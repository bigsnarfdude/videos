Better. Yeah, so yeah, thanks very much for the invitation. I've been coming here for about five years now, and it's just become very quickly one of my favorite places in the world. So it's really nice to be back. And I hope we can continue having conferences here for a long time. Yeah, so the title is slightly condensed both to fit it on the board and because I made a conscious decision. And because I made a conscious decision to expunge the word cluster from the title, but I mean, there will be some clusters in the talk, but I want to focus on some other aspects of the story. So I'm going to start by introducing the setting, and hopefully after that, there'll be time to do something else. Let's see. So, I'm going to discuss positroids and positroid varieties, but I'm going to do it in a slightly unusual way. So, I've been calling this. So, I've been calling this the Chanaksha King P remix version. So, this is this first part, at least, is joint work with Ilka Chanaka and Alsta King. And yeah, I mean, maybe not use space on the board. So, this is a whole theory in combinatorial geometry that's originally due to Posnikov, to O. Posnikov's spire, Knutson-Laumann spire, dot, dot, dot. But I'm going to present it. But I'm going to present it. I mean, this project was about reinterpreting that theory in terms of representation theory. And so today, just to kind of cut corners, I'm going to introduce it in representation theoretic language. But I want to stress that behind some of the definitions I'll give are actually theorems that say these representation theoretic things are equivalent to the geometry. And that's both to kind of give credit to my co-authors and also because it was like 20% of my whole life doing this. So there's actually content here. Here. So the input to the story is going to be a consistent dimer quiver Q in the disk. So here's one I prepared earlier. So, I'm just taking a quiver, I'm embedding it into the disk, so it becomes effectively the one skeleton of a two-dimensional complex whose geometric realization is the disk, and that one skeleton is oriented, so it's a quiver. And there are various rules, so the boundaries, the faces then come naturally from, I'll talk about faces again a bit more in a minute, but the quiver naturally has faces coming from this embedding in the disk, and I'm requiring things like all of the boundaries of those faces are oriented cycles. And so I'm not going to give a full definition. And so, I'm not going to give a full definition. I'm just going to focus on the example. Probably I should get this out of the way now. So, this is going to be my running example for the talk. The full sub-quiver on the white verses in the interior of the quiver is an oriented free cycle, which is famously mutation equivalent to crowd participation. Good to A3. So, yeah, that will be the running example for the talk. Then I'll use it occasionally to kind of get away with not making some definitions completely formal. Some definitions are completely formal. Okay, but I'll expand more and I'll come back to the word consistent. So, some version of this appeared in Nakajima-san's talk at the Gong Show as well. I'll give a slightly weird definition of this later in the talk. But there's some condition which I'm not telling you yet. So, because this is drawn in the disk, as I just said, it naturally comes equipped with faces as well as vertices and arrows. Vertices and arrows, and so I'll call that set Q2. And part of my setup is that, well, excuse the colors. The faces are a disjoint union of anti-clockwise-oriented or positive faces and clockwise-oriented or negative faces. I've changed my notation from one thing to the other. So, this is indicated by the little dots in the middle of the faces in the picture. So, in traditionally from the physics literature, positively oriented faces are black, and I have the same issue as Makadima-san, so this is black, and the negatively oriented faces are colored white, and partly that's because there's a dual bipartite graph under here, and so those are the traditional colours for the two sets of vertices in a bipartite graph. So it's a vertices in a bipartite graph. Okay. There's this consistency condition which I'm not explaining, but will explain later in some way. So let me introduce a straight away an algebra. So the algebra associated to this picture called the Dime algebra. It will be called A. It's a function of Q. It will be called a function of q and um what I will say is that I take the path algebra of q and I factor out by some relations, which I will just write a formula and then explain it. Not make the notation too. Yeah, let me not write the step. Yeah, let me not write the step. So I'll explain what this relation is. Just Michael is here, so strictly speaking, I should take the complete path algebra and then take the closure of this ideal of relations. And you either know why or you don't, but I should do that. And this relation, let me just draw it graphically. So if I pick an arrow A in my quiver, which I've deliberately drawn in white, so it's not going to be one of the ones that forms the boundary of the disk, it's going to be one of the ones inside. The disk. It's going to be one of the ones inside. Then it's contained in two faces, one of which is oriented positively and the other of which is oriented negatively. And so if I call the two paths completing A to these faces, PA black and PA white, the relation, the defining relation is that those two paths should be equal in the algebra. Yeah, so for people who like quovers with potential, this is an example of a frozen Jacobian algebra. There's a potential I can write down that gives me these relations, so I won't write it down. That is an important fact for some of the talk, but this is, I mean, the fact that it has a presentation in that form is important, but I can also just define it directly. Okay. So now what I'm going to do is that each vertex will That each vertex in my quiver, I can choose a path T sub V from V to V, which just goes round the boundary of a face. And it then turns out, well, yeah, I'm going to add up all of I'm going to add up all of these things. I'm going to call it T that in the algebra A, this element I get by just choosing a cycle boundary a face at each vertex and adding more up, or even not adding more up each term individually, is independent of the choice that I made because of these relations. So you can think about why that's true if you want. So, you can think about why that's true if you want. And so, with this choice, I give A the structure of a Z algebra for Z, the power series ring, in this one variable, T power series, because it's complete. And when I have such a Z algebra, let's say lambda, I mean, it's going to happen for several different algebras, so let me just use lambda for a moment. A is the example we have in mind at the beginning. It makes sense to think about the category of colon-Cauli Lambda modules which are finitely generated. Finitely generated Lambda modules such that when I restrict the module to just be over Z, I get something which is Cohen-Macaulay for the now commutative ring Z, as Hannah Harrison explained. And now this is a regular ring. So as he also explained, in fact, in this case, it's just projective modules over Z, and Z is even a principal ideal domain. So this small p proj is just free and finitely generated. Is just free and finitely generated modules over z. So when I think of lambda or a with its z module structure, this is the kind of natural module category to look at. Drawing the box here. So one of the things that turns out to be true is that if I choose any vertex of my quiver and Cohen-Macaulay A module, then the rank of let me write MV, I mean I view M as a representation of the quiver, so the vector spaces at the vertices, which I'll call Mv, are equipped with Z module structures, and so the rank of one of those over Z turns out to be independent. Of V, so I'll just call it the rank of M but some invariant, some number attached to a co-Macaulay A model. And so the first proposition, yeah, I mean, you could Yeah, I mean, you could probably read this as a definition, but I'm stating it this way. So, consistency, which I didn't explain, implies that for every vertex of my quiver, the projective A module there, so I like left modules, so that's A V firstly, it's in, it is Cohen-Macaulay, right? So, one thing happening here. So, one thing that's happening here is telling you A is a Colin-McCaulie module over itself, which is a nice situation that we all like. And what's more, the rank of this module is one. So, yeah, at least in the context of our paper, if you decide to go look at it, consistency is a combinatorial condition, which I haven't explained, and it implies this. And conveniently, It turns out, due to a paper by Bergren and Serjenko, which is yet to appear, but they showed it to me, the converse implication is actually true as well. So you can take this as a definition of consistency for the topic. So, algebraically, this consistency condition is some kind. Some kind of good algebraic behavior. But the thing I'm not explaining is that there are purely combinatorial ways to check it on the picture. So it's not kind of, you can't necessarily see by looking, but you can do some combinatorial check, which is relatively benign to check that you have this. Okay. So now a key definition is that I think it actually, yeah. I think it actually is the center, but since we never need to know that, we didn't prove it. But we didn't run cheap, the other part, right? I mean, I guess if it's true, it's true because of this. So yeah, no, probably that is, yeah, okay. Probably that more or less is a proof that the center couldn't be any larger because otherwise this would fail. Yeah. Yeah, it's an order of logic thing. I mean, yeah, very early in the story, we need to identify Z, identify Early in the story, we need to identify z, identify that it is central. But no, I guess once you get here, you can prove that it is, in fact, the center, but it doesn't actually matter much in the end. Is A so-called the title order? I think it's an order, and I would have to remind myself of the definition to know whether it's titled. Polynomial power C is a linear one variable, and I Z entry is just a And the IJ entry is just IDR over. So when I sensor with the fraction field, yeah, yeah, it's the tile order. Ah, yeah, good. Okay, the sensor is there. Not important facts, but it is a fact. Okay. So I'm going to say a subset of the arrows of Q1, a subset of the arrows of Q, i.e., a subset of Q1, is a perfect matching if If its intersection with, let me write it in some sort of order. If I intersect it with the boundary of any face, I get one element. So let me draw an example yellow. Yellow. Let me not compute it in real time. So I'm just going to hope this is visible. Is that okay? Yeah. So I'm just going to squiggle some arrows. So I make a choice of arrows in my quiver. Some of them might be on the boundary. And my picture is very slightly deformed from the notes to the forward. Looks right. Looks right. So, if I didn't make any mistakes, now every face should contain exactly one arrow with a purple squiggle on it. So, that's a perfect matching. And now, given such a thing, I can define a module depending on mu, it will be a cone we call the a module. It'll be a cone we'll call the A module by the following quiver representation style rule, which is that at each vertex v I just have a copy of Z, so it will be rank one by construction. And on an arrow, it will be the multiplication map by T. Be the multiplication map by t if a is in my matching, and it will be one if a is not in the matching. And so, one consequence of this is that the path of bounding any face acts as multiplication by t, so that's consistent with the z model structure equal on a. Yeah. So we call this a perfect matching module. Perfect matching module. Sometimes it helps to think of it as a kind of generalization of a matrix factorization, where instead of just having a two-cycle, but you have various longer cycles, but I mean, it's not a very complicated factorization of T in any case. And so now, another fact, this is sort of how we start. Well, the way I'm presenting it here, I'm combinatorializing the representation theory. And combinatorializing the representation theory of A in historical terms, we're representation theorizing the combinatorics of Q, which is that, in fact, if I pick any Cohn-Macaulay A module of rank one, then it is isomorphic to a perfect matching module for some And let me even say, yeah, because it's true. For some unique, the grammar of the sentence might be a bit confused now, but it's longer than just version being irrelevant. I probably shouldn't have said it. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. We can talk. It's an amusing future direction, but for us, we're only going to take matrix factorization. Direction, but for us, we're only going to take matrix factorizations of T, and there just aren't very many of them anyway, so it's not structurally relevant now. But between isomorphism classes and perfect matchings, yes. Yeah. I'm going to not overdo this, but I have some short definitions. So let me take E to be the sum of the vertex item points at the boundary vertices, the blue vertices in the picture. And B, so the second algebra that's going to play a role will be the corner algebra or eigenpotent truncation or for us, boundary algebra. So that's the second algebra that's going to be relevant to us. I don't know a quiver with relations presentation for it. Although again, I think Vergren might know one that will appear eventually. But so I'm going to define it in this way. It's a sub-algebra of the quiver of the algebra A I have defined very explicitly. Okay. Could I squeeze it under there? Yeah, let's do that. Okay, so I need one more algebra. Let me come back to this board of pre-prepared examples that's going to be based on this other quiver here. So for a choice of number between k and K and n. So, well, let's say this way. So, I choose two numbers, k and n, they satisfy this inequality. I'll write pi n very briefly for the path algebra of qn. This picture is of q7, so qn is an n cycle of two cycles. Cycles, just making this loop longer. And I mod out by the relation xy minus yx, and I complete and I close. So I'm imposing that this is, well, people know this. So it's the pre-projective algebra of the n cyclic graph, right? And then, so far, k has not played any role. C, which I will carry forward a bit more, is which is a very good thing. is which depends on k and n is pi n modulo one additional relation which is yk minus x to the n minus k right so now depending on k I'm saying that if I take k anti-clockwise steps in this in this in this quiver I'll end up at the same place as if I take n minus k clockwise steps and I want those two paths to be And I want those two paths to be equal. So I impose one extra relation, which now depends on k. Why? Well Here's a theorem, and this is by Jensen, King, and Su 2016, which is well the sort of very condensed way of saying something nice. So, C is in the category of comical immortals over C. C is free in. Commercali modes over C. C is free and finitely generated as a Z algebra, and what's the Z algebra structure? It's taking T to correspond to multiplication by X Y to any one of these two cycles, which equals YX, of course. Yeah, okay, let me present this. Let me interrupt the theory. Okay, let me present this. Let me interrupt the theorem to bring you a definition. Um, so uh for every i in well me, yeah. If I choose a subset of the numbers one up to n, and I choose it so that its cardinality is k, and I'll write the set of subsets just by the binomial coefficient which counts them. Them. It's a very mild instance of categorification. I'm treating a number as a set with cardinality. So for any such choice, there is a module MI in CMC and it's defined by very similar rules to the one we saw before. It's that at every vertex, I just put Z. So again, it will by construction have rank one. And for the arrows, And for the arrows, xi to get your signs right now, xi will act as multiplication by t when i is in my chosen big i and one otherwise. Let me just write in shorthand, so I'll point at the picture again in a second. So yi Is that sort of clear enough? So, with y is one when x is t and vice versa. So, it's maybe I should squeeze it in. Okay, so xi and yi, I've numbered here in the example, I've numbered the two cycles, and so I'm just passing the numbers of the two cycles to the x's and y's, right? So, what I'm going to say is that if in my chosen subset i, if it contains one, I, if it contains one, then this x will act as t and this y will act as one. If it doesn't contain two, then y will act here will act as t and x will act as one. So again, every two cycle is t, but which factorization of it it is depends on this set i. Okay, so it's a very similar definition. Um, let me now resume the theorem, um, uh, which is, yeah, so the second piece of content is that. The second piece of content is that if, again, just completely analogous to what we've already seen, that the rank one modules in CMC are exactly the MIs and there are n choose K different ones. Okay. Good, right. Yeah. Let me start bringing these things together now a bit more. So now an ultimate. So, now an observation, it really is just an observation, so I mean, not really credit to anyone, is that there is a canonical map from I, i.e. the pre-projective algebra, of, let me drop the n, but obviously write length, of course, to b um Okay, so this is almost visible, I hope, in the picture that I've drawn. Is that I just map the vertices of Qn onto the blue vertices of A. So I'm writing a map, I'm explaining a map from pi to A, but it will just very transparently have image in B. So I map these vertices onto these blue vertices in the way suggested by the picture, and I map an arrow to an arrow when I can, and if I can't, I have to map it to the rest. To the rest of the place. So that was very vague, but I think if you think about it, you'll be able to reconstruct the map. So let me not dwell on it too much. And so then the proposition is that we can make this a bit better. So given my input data of this queue from which I constructed everything, there's a unique A between 1 and N. Hey between one and n. Maybe I confused the issue slightly by changing the order. So n is somehow fixed to be the number of boundary vertices or the number of boundary arrows. There's somehow implicit in what I said to fit. Whereas k is a bit more mysterious, and this is where k appears from the algebra. So there's a unique k such that this map actually factors over Jensen King Su's algebra, CKN. So, the k is somehow an invariant of q, which is a little bit harder to see. Duality of z plus work out the multiplication. Yeah. Yeah, obviously, this connects otherwise. Otherwise, um, there's no statement. I won't write it on the board, but just in case I accidentally say it, so we'll sometimes say that the type of really any of the objects I introduced is Kn, if I need to be specific about what these numbers are. And so, moreover, I get an induced restriction map from Cohen-Macaulay B modules to Cohen-Macaulay C modules. Cohen-Macaulay C modules, which I wrote too high up. And the statement is that this is a fully faithful function. So it's not fully faithful on all the modules, but it's fully faithful on the co-majorities. All right. So CKN and B are not necessarily isomorphic. Correct. And even under consistency condition. Correct. So the isomorphic cases, thank you. This is a very good question. Cases, thank you. This is a very good question. So, I'm gonna have to make a slight detour for experts. Um, so, um, as I'm about to get to, um, this technology all comes from describing positroid varieties and cluster structures on positroid varieties. One very special case of a positroid variety is the big cell in the K-n-Grasmannian. If that's what I'm describing, then this map is isomorphism. But in general, I might be taking a much, much smaller positroid cell in the K-n-Grassmannian. Cell in the KN versus Manian, and then this is not my size. Yes, from what I'm about to say, yes. Yeah. Zigzag paths. You have to do it. Basically, if you do the combinatorics that tell you the combinatorial version of consistency will give you a permutation of one up to n. And if the permutation is add k, then it's an isomorphism. And if it's some other permutation, it's not. Yeah, thank you. This is a very important point, but yeah, come transparent now. So now I'll make a definition, which is in some sense the answer to a question. One more question. Yep. So this is a free phase of the tree. Yes. So the map is a sufficient phase or even typically. No. Hilariously. The map is injective. So it's it's a it's So, it's an epimorphism in the category of Z algebras. So, it becomes an isomorphism when you tensor with the fraction field. So, it's a kind of reasonable order thing. But, yeah. The quotient is finite dimensional, and so that's why this happens. Yeah, yeah. I should sit down. I mean, you need to take over. What was I saying? Yeah. So, a reasonable question I can now ask is. Now ask is what are the elements of n choose k? What are the k subsets of one up to n such that the rank one module mi, which lives here, is actually in CMB, which I'm just going to abuse notation and denote the fully faithful functor by nothing. So I'm just going to treat this as a subcategory, right? So I can just ask which one of the rank one modules from here are in the image of this map. Of this map, and I'm going to just shorthand that, right? Okay, and so far, I'm not. Well, I'm not going to answer the question unless you already know what a positroid is. I'm going to make it a definition. So, I'm just going to take the set of those things, and for the talk, this is the definition of a connected positroid. And I say this was defined completely differently by Poznikov, and there's a theorem behind this which says that. And there's a theorem behind this which says that the two definitions are the same, right? Good. It's not. So positroid is a kind of matroid, and connected means not the direct sum of two smaller matroids. I'll come back to this later. Good. Right, so now there's a geometric interlude. So I've already mentioned this in answering some questions, but let's spell it out now. So what this whole story is about, at least for the combinatorialists. At least for the combinatorialists, is the Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces of c to the n. There's a projective variety that parameterizes those subspaces, solution to a modular problem. It's called Flush Manian. It's a projective variety. If anyone in bath is watching online, Bath is watching online. I've chosen a basis of the ambient vector space because I have to because I have to write down coordinates on the graph manufacturer. That's why it's even an ordered basis. So if the number of Zoom participants just dropped by about three, that's because people from bath were here and have quit in frustration. Anyway. Choosing bases. So now the coordinate ring of this thing. And again, I'm just going to brush a bunch of geometry under the carpet. You shouldn't really do that. I'm going to write the coordinate ring on the affine code. I'm going to write the coordinate ring on the affine cone. So, this is the ring in which the projective coordinates are actual functions, but yeah, basically, all hats of the talk should be ignored by people who don't already know what they're for. So, what this has, this is really classical, this goes back to Flucker in the late 19th century, I think, even, is that this ring is generated by Flucker coordinates, which I'm going to denote by delta. And the only thing you really need to know. By delta, and the only thing you really need to know about them is that they're indexed by k-element subsets of one up to n. So the combinatorics I had is appearing, they satisfy relations. The relations are called the booker relations. You don't need to know anything about those. This is a booker coordinate. Perhaps for the cluster people, so some would certainly know this already. Some of the booker coordinate relations look like cluster exchange relations, but others don't. But others don't. Okay. So now, I probably meant to fix this. So this pi is unrelated to the previous pi, but it was pre-projective and now it's positroid. So the positroid variety associated to my positroid p is the set of points in the Grassmannian such that the ith clucker coordinate of v is zero. V is zero whenever the indexing set I is not in my positroid. So I just restrict to the sub-variety on which the floor coordinates labeled by the elements of the positroid are reasonable functions and all of the others are just zero. Right, so this is what I mean. I sort of go back to Yama's question. So now I can say another thing. So this map is an isomorphism if and only if P is all of n 2's k. And typically, it's not good. Good. Um right yes, I guess I have to say this now. Right. Okay. Yep. Nope. Nope. Wait for it. Yep. Not yet. This is the closed positive variety. I didn't write it. I should write it. So closed positive variety. It's not a cluster variety. Back to the algebra for a moment and do a little aside. So, again, if I pick it, if I pick a vertex in Q0, then what I can do is I can take the projective module for A at that vertex. I already told you that was rank one. If I restrict it to the boundary, still rank one. And if I, well, let me call this T V. TV plus. So the projective module for A is rank one. If I restrict it to a B module, it's rank one. If I restrict it now to C, which I have no notation for, it's still rank one. So the JKS theorem says it's isomorphic to Mi. And let me tell you the particular I is I V plus. And the other thing I can do Just maybe slightly weirder looking is this, and that will give me MIV minus. And here, check its duality over Z. So what do I do here? So here I started from the projective A module at vertex V. Here I'm starting from the injective Cohen-Macaulay module at vertex V. So you have to be a little bit careful here. But you have to be a little bit careful here. It's only injective in CMA, it's not an injective A module. But I don't care about any other A modules, so that's the natural injective generator, right? So by just taking projectives or injectives, the two sort of most canonical modules attached to a vertex, I can produce two k-element subsets of one up to n, representation theoretically. I don't think it makes sense to say that. Okay. I'm sorry for the lack of examples. I can show people examples later, but I think the time to value ratio is not so good. Okay. Okay, so now I can kind of answer Lara's question. So let me write f with a plus or minus to be the set of i v's with the matching plus or minus, but not for all v in the quiver, just for the boundary vertices of the quiver. And pi p with a little circle is then the points in the closed positive variety pi p such that the floca coordinates of v indexed by elements of f do not vanish. Do not vanish. Sorry, in not zero, in so for some slightly weird piece of magic, I haven't written a plus minus outside here because you can make either choice and you get the same sub-variety, which is kind of weird fact, but it's true. Okay. Right. So far, I haven't, well, except in answering people's questions, I think I haven't mentioned clusters of. Answering people's questions. I think I haven't mentioned clusters at all. I'm really happy, but now I have to. So let me take the A of Q to be. I have to do this because it's just the context of the problem, really. So the Cosda algebra associated to Q it should have invertible frozen variables. So I'm treating Q as an ice quiver. So, I'm treating Q as an ice quiver where the blue verses on the boundary are frozen. So, if you don't know this construction, then I'm just going to kind of quite quickly state kind of the problem. Yeah, so that's that's the cost algebra I want to consider. Aq is a sub-algebra of the Laurent polynomial ring in variables indexed by the vertices of quiver. However, it's defined. However, it's defined. And the theorem, the surprisingly recent theorem, really, still not published. 19 plus accepted. Is that there are two isomorphisms which are, I'll call eta plus minus, and they go from And they go from this cluster algebra to the ring of homogeneous coordinates on the open pository phrase. And what's the sign doing? So I hope it's not too low to read at the back. Yeah, okay. Right above. So what the sign is doing is that I take one of my shadows. One of my initial variables xv, and I send it to the pluger coordinate labeled by iv, the label I got out of the representation theory, with the matching sign. These are two different maps, two different isomorphisms. So the upshot for the cluster theory, which is what these people are working in, is that this ring actually has two cluster algebra structures on it. They're abstractly isomorphic, but at least a priori, different sets. But at least a priori, different sets of functions in here can be tossed to variables under this map. And generically, that's in fact exactly what happens. The only exception is, again, this very uniform case where this map was nice multiple. Okay, so unless it's the big cell, these are genuinely two different cluster algebra structures with two different sets of cluster variables. Okay. Okay. Now the conjecture is by Mueller and Squire seventeen, I think is that the These two cluster structures, so while they're different, they have a very close relationship. They quasi-coincide. And why not make this don't want this to be too unsatisfying? The definition is a little bit technical, so let me just give a part of it. So So, what it says is that for every cluster variable x, there exists another cluster variable x prime and p, the Laurent monomial in frozen variables. such that eta eta plus of x so this is a cost of variable on the coordinate green for one cost of structure is equal to eta minus of x prime cost of variable from the other structure but multiplied by eta minus of this law and polynomial in phrases okay there's more to the definition than this i mean there are various slightly technical combinatorial rules about how the p's should interact Rules about how the P's should interact. This is supposed to be a bijection between, well, I've set it up so they're cost of variables of AQ, so it's supposed to be a permutation of the mutable cost of variables and things like this. But let me just, this is part of it. So it's a combinatorial problem. I mean, despite phrasing it in cluster language, as you can actually see from the board, so the conjecture predates the existence of the cluster structure. So it's possible to kind of say what phenomena you're expecting without the cluster structure. And the cluster structure is just a way of getting at the And the cost of structure is just a way of getting at the information we want. Okay. And the theorem is that the conjecture is true. That's unsurprisingly. Let me say one thing. I want to say a little bit about the proof because it's the most homological part. So let me just say out loud, there's a little bit of small print, which is that the Is that in this representation theoretic translation? I've only described connected positroids because they're the ones which are being categorified. The conjecture applies to all positroids, including the disconnected ones. And in fact, the theorem also applies to all positroids, including the disconnected ones. But so there's an inductive argument on the geometry side, which reduces the problem to the connected case so that we can apply the categorification. And I'm just going to focus on that part. Yep? At the moment, we don't have a good categorification in the disconnected case. Moment, we don't have a good categorification in the disconnected case. That would be really nice to know. Yeah, but we don't know it. A categorification that has all the properties we would want is not a Higgs category, so it's a little bit exotic. I mean, the Higgs category will work, but it doesn't, it will categorify the cost for algebra, but it doesn't have all the properties that we need to make the proof work, actually. Oh, I erased it. It won't embed into the JKS category, for example. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Let me try and use five minutes to just tell you the strategy. And well, I did warn you that the setup would take basically the whole talk. Every time I think, can I cut even more and talk about the proof? But I think if you really want the details of the proof, you'll have to come and talk to me. But let me just tell you the ingredients. So the strategy. So the strategy, very roughly, is to use categorification. So yeah. Because of, so I was making a little bit of a fuss about dimensions in Hannah Hawaiusan's talk, and this is kind of why. Because of some compatibility between homological and Compatibility between homological and geometric dimensions, or some incompatibility. CMB is not itself a Fourier category in general. Basically, because this is two Gorenstein in the non-commutative sense, but the ground field has cruel dimension one. But it has various Frobenius subcategories, and I'm going to choose two of them. And they're both very natural. So one is the category of objects which have no positive extensions. Objects which have no positive extensions on B. So this is a Frobenius subcategory in which the projective objects from here become injective. And I can do the dual thing where I look at an injective cogenerator of CMB, which is B check. This was duality over Z, and I forced that to be projective. So these are two different subcategories. So these are two different subject trees. And now, yep. So the kind of input is that by combining some results of mine and results from the joint work, these are stably 2CY Robenius exact categories. Unfortunately, I just erased this definition. If I take, I can write it down again though. T plus yeah, this this B module module is in here T minus, which is the dual thing is in here these are cluster filting. So these are and because of the way in which these objects were obtained somehow from the projective and injective A modules, their endomorphism algebras will have that quiver. So we're in a kind of good, if you're familiar with cluster category. kind of good if you're familiar with cluster categorification we're in a setup where we can do that um yeah let me skip just very slightly ahead going about like two minutes just to try and indicate the group yeah um yeah so Yeah, so yeah, let me not indicate now. I can explain later if people want. There is a sense in which g proj is naturally a categorification of the eta plus cluster structure, and g-inj is naturally a categorification of the eta minus cluster structure. That's, I think, not clear from what I presented, but except in the notation, but I can explain more later if you want. And so, how do we get from these categories? And so, how do we get from these categories to a proof of the theorem? I mean, all the work that's gone in so far is about translating the combinatorics into representation theory. And now you want to apply representation theoretic tools. And when you want a representation theoretic tool, you call Bernard Keller and you say, have you got any new representation theoretic tools I can use? And usually the answer is yes. So there's a theorem by Fraser and Keller. And we not state the theorem in abstract, but just apply it to this situation. So, to prove the conjecture, what do we need? And what I'll probably leave implicit for time is that, of course, the proof strategy is to check all of the stuff I'm about to write down exists and satisfies the conditions. So, what do you have to do? You have to find a functor between the derived categories of these two categorifications. Whose names are too long, really. Functor doesn't actually have to be an equivalence, although in this situation it will be. And it has to satisfy a small list of things. Two of them are diagrams. So if I draw this functor vertically. To vertically, I reverse the direction. Good. Firstly, I can project down to the stable categories, which we saw earlier in the week. And I want there to be an induced functor here, which we'll call it phi underline. So this is effectively just saying it takes perfect complexes to perfect complexes. Well, it is just saying that it should also lift to the homotopy categories on the additive closures of the cluster tilting objects. Yeah, okay, I'm conscious of time. Yeah, okay, I'm conscious of time. So, this diagram is the kind of functorial one that has to commute. For two, let me just say it's compatible with cluster characters. So, I didn't explain what the cluster character was either, then it's probably okay. This is the point that is going to let you deduce cluster theoretic consequences from the representation theory. Point three is that the stable functor here should be an equivalence. Should be an equivalence. And part four is that if I apply that equivalence to T minus, I get a cluster tilting object which is mutation equivalent to T plus. And so to prove the theorem, we do all of this. Phi turns out to be the canonical identification of both of these things with the derived category of B. Derived category of B. And maybe we write one final thing, which is that a surprisingly key point ends up being the fact that the cluster tilting object T plus is actually isomorphic to the second syzygy of T minus in the singularity category. And I think it was not clear, but this is actually an ingredient in proving about three quarters of the statements of the theorem. Okay, sorry about the time, I will stop there. I need to change the microphone, yeah. Okay, so is there any question? Yes, so this is maybe more related to the first part of your talk. But have you looked at the work by Romp on tile orders? Because he talks a bit about the long ago, I think, the irreducible, irreducible representations of a tile orders and. Representations of a tile orders, and that would be maybe corresponds to the one in rank one, which you look at. And then there's a lot of nice properties of it, forms a lattice and has a lot of nice properties that he shows. And yeah, I mean, irreducible ones form a lattice. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I didn't look at it from this angle, but I think we do know that the rank ones are the irreducible ones. Yeah. So any general theory would. Yeah. So it's like a what called it? Discrete lattice. It has some auto equivalence and. Equivalence and with three FS representation finite, and maybe there's some interesting information you can get from that. Okay, thanks. I didn't know about this. Can you remind me? So, this band drive category, this is a relative cluster category, right? Is that right? Or and yes, and and this corner. Yes, and this gornstein injectives is a Hicks category. The other, so I'm trying to understand what kind of category is Kb of at T, yeah. So it well, okay. So in the yeah, so in the connected case, um, this is, yeah, these are both the relative loft category. I think in Eden Wu's convention, probably this is the Higgs category, but he could have chosen the convention that made it that one. So they're both kind of, they're actually equivalent as exact categories, but that's not the relevant fact. As exact categories, but that's not the relevant fact. This is kind of comes from Palou's work. So, these are, in fact, both the perfect derived categories of A. So this part of the square actually is where you get the most technical part of the definition of quasi-cluster morphism from. So it's the slightly wacky, not quite graded compatibility between all the different Lawrence polynomials. So that's the most subtle part, actually. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. But this is somehow the growth. Okay, thank you. But this is somehow the growth in the groups, these are where G vectors live. So that's the role there. Sorry, can I just realize I forgot to say something that's very important, which is there's an independent proof of part of these results subsequently by Castles, Lei, Sherman, Bennett, and Wang using methods from symphactic geometry. And I didn't want to forget to mention their work. Can I just ask number four when T is takes something mutation equivalent to T, it's not going on the nose to T plus in your thing? The nose to t plus in your in your thing, is it or and just this fact here that it's it's apply a maximal green sequence twice, yeah. That's that's where so this is where you get this from the existence of the green sequence is by Ford and Say Janko, but that's yeah. That's why the fact that the two exact categories are equivalent by a via functor, which actually sends t minus on the nose, but that doesn't help you. It's really this relationship that's the key one. More questions? In general, there is a equivalence between Gore Einstein projective and the Gorenstein injective given by Nakayama functor. And the UFI or UFI bar coincide with it? No. No? No. So I think that's the one that I think will produce the equivalence of exact categories, which relates. Of exact categories, which relates T plus and T minus directly. I think that also follows from your work with Martin Calc and Michael and Dong Yang. No, in fact, what this is, sorry, I hate doing this because it's like, I don't want to write more of it. Let me just so the inclusion functor here, let me not write mod, but I shouldn't write. But I shouldn't write, but the functor induced by the inclusion of exact categories turns out to be a derived equivalence and the same for inch. So that's what we're using. So that they're both, and somehow amusingly, this is also that. So it's really, it's somehow, yeah, it's just coming from the inclusions of all of these things into C and B. That's where the equivalence comes from. Yeah. But how Nakaima functa and the phi bar are different? Bar are different. Ah, maybe I'm maybe they're not if they're different. I think they should only be different by shift. And maybe I forgot a shift in the definition of the Nakiyama, so they're actually the same. But I mean, there's I think the two things we have in mind, or I have in mind, are related by shift. And I'm maybe I'm not sure which one is the Nakiama. Thank you. I have another question. So, you start with a perfect. Start with a perfect matching to get to boundary algebra B, yes, yes, and then my question is: sorry, the boundary algebra doesn't depend on the choice of perfect matching. Oh, okay. Oh, really? It's just the idempotent truncation of A. The perfect matchings enclose models, but the algebra doesn't depend on this choice. So, B is uniquely determined by choice of n and of k. No, it's it's you need the way I set it up, you need q and Need Q and what you actually need in the end is the Grassmann permutation or any of the equivalent. So Q is more or less starting from a dimer model. So my question is, is it possible? Yes, how many B did you? There's the same number as the number of positoids, which is quite a lot. I'm not quite familiar with the positoroid. Let's say it's one per. Let's say it's one per mutation per geop like geometric exchange mutation class of dime equivalence. So they are parameterized by a certain family of permutations. By elements in symmetry. That's right, by the Grassmann permutations. It is okay. Grassmann permutation. So it is elements belonging to certain interval with respect to recoder or yeah, it's um yeah it's phrasing in terms of juggling patterns. It's like a periodic permutation of Z where Permutation of Z where all elements go forwards and the average jump of an element is k or something like that. So, for example, that average jump has to be an integer, so that rules out some permutations. So, is there any question from Zoom audience? If not, let's thank the speaker again.
