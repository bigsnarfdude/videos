So next we'll have Evan speak on a project that we're actually working on together, which is kind of exciting. So Evan, take it away. Thank you. So for those who don't know me, my name is Evan Mitchell. I'm a postdoc at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Campaign, funded. Campaign, funded postdoc. So I know everybody's sick of the doom and gloom of COVID, so I want to start by apologizing because I'm going to not only take you back in time a bit to the doom and gloom of COVID. In time, a bit to the doom and gloom of COVID. But I'm going to talk about how doomy and how gloomy it could have been. But I've tried to end with some positive notes, so I think happy thoughts. We'll get through it. So I want to start by just throwing up some numbers for you. So these come from Public Health Agency of Canada and from Canadian Institute for Health Information. To date, at least last I checked, there were approximately 4.8 million confirmed. Approximately 4.8 million confirmed COVID-19 cases across Canada. There have been almost 55,000 deaths, and there have been almost 190,000 people hospitalized, but almost 40,000 of those in intensive care. Those are big numbers. They're kind of scary numbers. Thankfully, they've been lessened by the introduction of vaccines in early 2021. And the question that we were really interested in, And the question that we were really interested in looking at was how much, how much of an effect do those vaccines have? It wouldn't really surprise you if I got up here and just said that without vaccines, things would look really bad. What we're interested in is how bad. Really quantifying that question and attaching a number to that and really being able to say this is how things might have looked if we didn't have these vaccines in some way. So that's really the question that we're interested in with this work. I will just preface it and say that everything I'm going to show Preface it and say that everything I'm going to show you is sort of a project that's still a work in progress, it's not a completed project. So bear that in mind as we go through. So to answer this question or start to answer it, what we've done is we fit a compartmental model, which I'm going to talk through in a second, and we fit that to data on daily infection reports and we fit it to data on hospital occupancy, both acute care and intensive care. And I will just say as a plug for tomorrow, And I will just say as a plug for tomorrow that all of the modeling and fitting of models and simulation and all of that was done with all of the tools in the MacPan R package that you're going to be learning about a lot tomorrow. So if that sounds interesting to you, that's coming up. So I don't know about you, but personally, I like to have as few equations in my talks as possible, ideally none. So I'm going to talk you through the basic idea of what our model looks like without Idea of what our model looks like without giving you any equations. So I'm just going to talk you through the different compartments that we're tracking in this model and sort of how people are flowing between these compartments to give you a sense of what it looks like. So we start with sort of a commonplace to start. A susceptible compartment. These are people that have not been infected by the disease yet, could become infected by the disease at some point in the future. When those people become infected, we model them going to this, what we call an exposed compartment, which is people who have been infected by the disease. Which is people have been infected by the disease, but they're not yet able to pass that infection along to somebody else yet. Now, from that exposed compartment, when that infection develops, we're going to assume that it can develop in one of two ways. The first way is as what we call an asymptomatic infection, which is kind of this mild infection where you don't have any symptoms or anything like that. And because it's kind of a milder infection, we're going to just model people as moving from having that infection to becoming recovered at some point in the future. The other side of that. The other side of that is you can move on to having a pre-symptomatic infection, which can then develop either into a mild infection, and again, mild infections we're going to assume eventually recover, or that can develop into a more severe infection. Now, if you get a severe infection, there's a couple of different places you can go. The first place is you end up going into hospital. This is acute care hospital, so we're thinking short-term stays. And again, if we're modeling you going into And again, if we're modeling you going into short-term stay in the hospital, eventually we're going to assume that you recover. The other option, if you have a severe infection, is you could just die from the infection. And the final option is you can go into the intensive care unit if it's a really bad infection. And once you're in the ICU, you can go one of two places in this model. Either things can get better for you and you can go into sort of short-term hospitalization and eventually recovering it out, or things can get worse and you can die from the disease. Can get worse and you can die from the disease of the intensive carrier. So, this is kind of the schematic of what we're thinking about modeling in our compartmental model here. And I will say that we've got sort of layers of this kind of a picture going on for different vaccination statuses as well. So we've kind of got a different layer of this depending on what your vaccination status is, whether you've got no vaccine, whether you've got one dose, two doses, things like that. So that's kind of the overall schematic of what this model looks like. Schematic of what this model looks like. For the modelers in the room, you can probably infer from that what the equations should look like, and for the non-modelers, you probably don't care what the equations look like. So we'll leave it at that. What we're going to do with this, to try to get a handle on how things might have looked if we didn't have vaccines, is we're going to model a few alternate scenarios with this. After we fit this model to a set of data, we've got Model to a set of data, and we've gotten a good fit to it. We're going to look at a few alternate scenarios of what things could have happened. The first is that we just don't have vaccines, right? We never had them introduced in early 2021. The other scenario that we're going to look at is that we did get vaccines, but the rollout was delayed. And we've put in a delay. We just chose a delay of 60 days, about two months. There's nothing really special about that 60 days. It's just, there's some delay in when these vaccines came out. There's some delay in when these vaccines came out. And the third alternate scenario that we're interested in looking at is that vaccines came out as they did at the same time as they did, but when they came out, they were less effective than what they actually were. So these are three different scenarios that we're interested in looking at to really get a handle on how much vaccines helped us, what the impact was of vaccines, and really starting to quantify that and attach numbers to that. And then to get a sense as well of how A sense as well of how well we'd be able to control things in each of these alternate scenarios because things would look really bad and we'd want to try to control them in some way. We're going to imagine a few alternate scenarios for each of these scenarios. And the first is that we're going to introduce a hypothetical lockdown that manages to achieve a transmission reduction of about 10%. Or we can have one that achieves a transmission reduction of 30%, or we can have one that achieves a transmission reduction. Or we can have one that achieves a transmission reduction of 60%. So just trying to get at how likely is it or how well would we have been able to control things in each of these different scenarios. So that's kind of the experimental conditions we're looking at here. And I'm going to kind of walk you through some of the results that we've seen in each of these scenarios. So before I do that, though, I want to just mention this one other paper because we're not the first to try. Mention this in my other paper because we're not the first to try to look at this. I want to mention this because I'm sure many of you are familiar with the authors of this paper. Some of you watching at home might be the authors of this paper. So this is a study that came out last year. And it was looking at a similar type of question. They were using what's called an agent-based modeling approach. And they were trying to make predictions about how things might have looked if we didn't have vaccines or any other public health measures and things like that. Measures and things like that. So, I just want to point that out that that exists, and that we're not trying to claim that our work sort of replaces this work in any way. Really, we're just trying to add some different perspectives to the conversation on this impact of vaccines. I think there's sort of two key things that we're trying to add to this conversation. The first is that we're sort of providing predictions from a compartmental model instead of an agent-based model, which a compartmental model is something that we can more easily calibrate and fit to multiple different data sources, which is something. To multiple different data sources, which is something we're interested in doing in this case. And the other thing that we're trying to add to this conversation is that we want to give a more sort of fine-grained picture of how things might have looked over the entire country. So this first paper was looking at Canada as a whole. And what we're trying to do is look at, again, across Canada, but break it down province to province to really get this sort of more fine-grained picture of how things would have looked across the country if we didn't have vaccines. didn't have vaccines. So, we, the results I'm going to show you today just have to do in Ontario because that's sort of the results that are the furthest along. But we've also got results in the works for these other provinces with apologies to Amy and anybody else from Atlantic Canada or the Northern Territories. We're not trying to snub you. These are just the data, the provinces that we have data on. So that's kind of what made it into the study. Okay. So I want to walk through some of the To walk through some of the results, some of the numbers that are coming out of it. So, I want to, there are a few things to pick apart in this figure. The first thing are these gray dots in the background here. These are the actual observed data that we saw. So, what I'm plotting here are just daily infection reports. And we're looking at the calendar year of 2021 because vaccines were introduced, at least in Ontario, in early 2021. And by the end of 2021, was when Omicron came out, and infection report data got pretty unreliable. Infection report data got pretty unreliable, so we stopped trying to fit to it. We're just sort of focused on this one year where vaccines were initially introduced. Those gray dots are the actual observed data. That black curve that's running through those gray dots, that's our model prediction after fitting it to these data. So we haven't, nothing has been changed, no experimental scenarios in place in that black curve. That's just sort of our baseline fit to this. That's just sort of our baseline fit to this data. And then these three colored curves that we've got here: this orangey-goldy one on the top here is if we've got no vaccines at all. So we go back and we say, what if we just never had vaccines come into play and use our model to predict what things might have looked like. That's that top curve there. The blue curve is the scenario where we're modeling vaccines have been delayed by 60 days, and the green curve is where we're. And the green curve is where we're modeling the scenario that vaccines were less effective when they first came out. So, right off the bat, we can already see, I mean, we can see that things are worse, but again, that's not really surprising. But we can compare sort of these peaks here towards the end and just see really attaching some numbers here to how bad things would have been. This is on a log scale, so these differences are actually bigger than they look. In the sort of observed case, we had maybe around 1,000. Maybe around a thousand daily infections at that peak towards the end, right? And in this very worst case, we're getting no vaccines, we're up to predicting a peak of a hundred thousand a day infections. Very, very big difference in just attaching actual numbers to that difference instead of just sort of making vague statements about it would have been worse. Trying to tell us how much worse it would have been. So, what we're going to do then. So, what we're going to do then, that's one picture that we've got, but then what we want to do is we want to say, okay, well, if we were in any of these three hypothetical scenarios where things look bad, we'd obviously want to try to control that, right? Or public health officials would want to try to control that. So we want to look at each of these three colored curves, and we want to say, okay, well, let's say we put in a hypothetical lockdown to try to control things in this scenario. How good of a job could we do in that case? How good of a job could we do in that case? Could we actually control things? And if so, how sort of strong would that lockdown have had to have been to be able to bring things under control? So we'll start with that curve where we had no vaccines. So that's the dark gold here, is the same dark gold curve from the last slide. The lighter colors are these different hypothetical scenarios here. So we're going to imagine placing a lockdown, a hypothetical lockdown there, which is roughly where... Which is roughly where our predicted infections hit this peak that we had back here, which is where we actually put in a lockdown. And we're going to look at three possible scenarios for what can happen from that lockdown. If we can achieve a 10% reduction, a 30% reduction, or a 60% reduction in transmission. And what we're seeing here in the case with no vaccines is that even if we get a 60% reduction in transmission, it's still not really enough to turn things around in this space. Things still look really bad. In this space, things still look really bad towards the end. And I will just say for reference: this lockdown that we had back here got us about a 33% reduction in transmission. So the 60% is really just in this figure, even if we had an unreasonable level of transmission reduction, it still wouldn't be enough. Ontario. Everything from this is Ontario. Okay. And we can do the same with the other We can do the same with the other scenarios we had. So, this is a scenario where vaccines were delayed coming out by 60 days. Similar kind of story: 10%, 30% reduction doesn't really help us too much. We'd need a really large reduction in transmission to kind of see any sort of turnover here from that large takeoff. And again, 60% transmission reduction is something that effectively isn't attainable. So, it's just in there to say we need an unreasonable level of transmission reduction to. Reasonable level of transmission reduction to turn this around. Third case is a little bit better. This is where vaccines were just less effective. And in this case, even a small, easily achievable transmission reduction of 10%, which is this curve here, is enough to sort of bring things away from this peak and start things declining based on these predictions. So it's story's a little bit better in this case where we just have less effective vaccine. Just have less effective vaccine. But in the case where we had no vaccines or delayed vaccines, things weren't looking very good. And it wasn't looking like we could get that under control in any sort of reasonable way. And just because in the title, I promised you results about hospitals and deaths as well. What I've presented here is percentage increases in the peak hospital occupancy and the peak daily deaths. And the peak daily deaths in Ontario based on these predictions in these three scenarios. And you can see that things in the no vaccine case are very, very bad. We're looking at things on the order of a 10,000% increase in all of these different numbers. Things get a little bit better, go down by about an order of magnitude as we sort of go into a delayed vaccine case, and down even more as we get into a less effective vaccine phase. Just to kind of drive home how things. Just to kind of drive home how things would have looked, not just with infection reports, which were all the slides I was just showing you, but also with hospitalizations, also with daily deaths, and attaching some numbers to how those really would have changed if we didn't have these vaccines. Or not even didn't have them, just didn't have them as soon as we did, right? Okay, so to kind of wrap this all up and bring it home with some takeaways, I promised you some slightly uplifting takeaways. Slightly uplifting takeaways. There's two key things I think that are important to take away from this. The first is the numbers themselves. That was really one of the main goals of this. Again, like I said at the start, it's not really surprising to say things look bad without vaccines. What we are interested in is how bad and attaching numbers to that and really quantifying that. So, that's one of the major takeaways: the numbers that are attached to these. The ones I've shown you, the ones that I haven't had time to show you, all of those sort of numbers, that's a big takeaway. Sort of numbered, that's a big takeaway. The other thing, this is more of a qualitative takeaway, but and I kind of made reference to this in the last few figures, but things would have been a lot harder, if not impossible, to control if we didn't have vaccines or if those vaccines were delayed even two months. Compared to that case where we had vaccines at the same time, but they were just less effective. Kind of suggesting that it's important to just get a vaccine out as early as possible and start getting some level of coverage in the population. Some level of coverage in the population, even if it's not as effective as you could otherwise make it, just getting something out and getting some level of protection going is important. So those are the kind of two key takeaways I think you should walk out with. And I'll also just say again, we are in the process of expanding these to look at all these other provinces as well. So it's not just going to be Ontario at the very end. Try to get a picture of how things look across different provinces throughout the country. Different provinces throughout the country. And I'll just finish by saying this isn't my work alone. I'm just the lucky one who gets to stand up here and tell you about it. Funding was graciously provided by Canbaught and NCERT for this work. I've had a great team of collaborators, all of whom are in this room right now, that have helped with various points in this project. And also a big thank you to Mike Lee for coming. For compiling all of the data that we used to calibrate in this study. Thank you.
