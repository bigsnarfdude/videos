Thank you for inviting me. And damn, it's hard to give a talk after Max. Guess I have to, I don't know, do something. I feel like I'm boring. I need to learn from him. Okay, and now. That's the useful. So Brouwer groups are module of curves via homological invariance. So, what I'm gonna say here is actually the result of a work that The result of a work that, I mean, in a sense, is still in progress. Started, I would say, around 2019 and it spawned several different papers. So I thought that might be a good idea to give a sort of overview of this results, which somehow fit together. And everything I'm going to say, it's To say it's joint work with, but this is something that I always do, and I guess I have to if you ever if you ever get to work with me, this is what you get. So throwing so this is. So this is Roberto Pirizi. Okay, so this is a workshop on Brower groups, which I guess the following question should be: I should not need to motivate the following question, which is given X Even X theme or stack, what is the Brouwer group of X? So the thing is, something that I've learned over the years is that if you give me a variety as the ancient people used to. Ancient people used to know them, which is by equations, most likely I am not able to compute any of their invariants. On the other hand, it's quite funny that one of the somehow more modern algebraic varieties from a certain point of view, like moduli schemes or moduli stack of curves, actually we can compute their invariance. Their invariance. And somehow the reason is that we can produce stuff on moduli stacks thanks to the functorial point of view. That's basically the principle. So, in fact, over the years, maybe let me say something that so MG is the modular stack of Of smooth curves of genus G, which I always consider over a field. And over the years, people investigated quite successfully some invariance of NG. Let me give you an example, which somehow are several results due to well, I should say, Mumford, I should say. I should say Parr and Arbarel and Cornalba. I should say also RC and Vistoli. And actually other people, I'm not mentioning, well, Martin Olson and Fulton, but also they worked on the problem of computing. On the problem of computing the Picard group of a module of curves as it I'm thinking now over a field. So, and for instance, they proved several things. The Picard group of the moduli of elliptic curves, I mean, in a sense, is a single group of order 12. The Picard group of M2 is Z mod 10, if I remember correctly. And the Picard group of Mg is equal to Z for G greater or equal than 3. Of course, I should say here that I'm only giving you a few examples. Giving you a few examples. People investigated MGN, and as I said, this is over a field. But for instance, Martin Olton, William Fulton investigated the Picard group of M11 over more general-based schemes. But this is just to somehow tell you that people have been interested in this. And somehow, why can we obtain these results? Well, because we can produce line bundles on this moduli stacks, right? Thanks to their. Stacks thanks to their property. In fact, if you have on these stacks, you have a universal curve, and for instance, one thing you can do is to take the push forward of the relatively dualized sheaf and take the determinant of this. This produces a line bond, which is not an easy thing to do in general. And in fact, basically what these theorems are saying is that this is the only one in a certain sense. In a certain sense. Like, not the only one, literally, but everything is a power of this. So, and I'm mentioning here CMB study because more generally, they also investigated the Picard group of moduli of hyper elliptic curves, of which this is a specific, is a particular case. So, So, this brings us quite naturally to the following question. Yes? If you want, there is, I mean, one way to think of this is like if you take the discriminant of our elliptic curve, you can, so this is on, of course, if you take smooth ones, this is non-zero, and you can. This is non-zero, and you can see that as a section of the 12th power of the Odeline power. This one, a similar thing can work, but you have to use another interpretation of this as a basically, well, ramified cover of Q21 ramified over six points, and you can cook up a discriminant. And you can cook up a discriminant out of that too, more or less. And here there is no cook. Okay, so this brings us to the following question. What about the Blauer group? This is what I want to talk about. So perhaps So, perhaps let me give you the results or better. What was known without, so as I'm gonna, as the title says, I'm gonna talk about this particular technique for computing Brauer groups. So, before that, let me tell you what was known before this technique, or better, before without using this particular technique. So, there are several. So, there are several results. Let me mention a few. I will follow the same structure. So, the Brouwer group of M11, well, this is, so let me say perhaps that this is, I should say this. Here we are taking the characteristic of the base field to be different from 2.3. And this is different from two, and this should hold in every correctory. So for the Bromber group of M11, there are several results. I will perhaps write it in this way. This is when the characteristic of the base field is zero. So you see that there are the elements coming from the base, and then there are these elements that come from some comology group, but they are not very. From some comology group, but they are not very mysterious because what is the point? The point is that you have a line bundle of 12 torsion here. You have a cup product. So you can cook up a cyclic algebra by taking the product of an element here with an element pulled back from the homology of the base field. So you can produce this cyclic algebra. So, in a sense, this is a result. This is a result. So maybe I should say something here. This is a result. There's a very nice result by Anthug and Meyer, where again, they actually studied the Brouwer group of M11 over different bases. They did it basically over an algebraically closed field of characteristic naught 2 over Q. So these are somehow. And yeah, you can. And yeah, you get this result. They also studied over Z, where we invert two, and also over a general base where the Brouwer group is trivial. So you see that, for instance, when you work over algebraic closed field, at least of characteristic zero, you get from this that the Brouwer group is trivial. And let me also mention, so somehow I will say until admire, although more general. Although more general than this, in a sense. And let me also mention another funny thing, which is that for when the characteristic of k is 2, and either k is finite or algebraically. Algebraically closed, then there is an interesting result. Okay, I will write it somehow in the so let's let's say just for simplicity that k is algebraically closed. Then in this case, there is a Z2 factor, which exists even on algebraically closed fields, and this is due to Sheen. And this is new to Sheen. So are you saying that it equals E2 or just that that's some summary? Okay, then we follow this list, and then we see that there is That there is so the next natural question is: what is the Brouwer group of M2? And we are quite surprised to find out that this was not studied. What about the Brouwer group of M3? Same. We couldn't find actually an answer to this like before. Like before. And then it was proved by Roberto. Let's say, let's work here over C that the Barber group of Mg for G greater or equal than 4 is trivial. This is due to Pringueli and Pirigi. So, you see that the situation is basically quite mysterious here, known at least over C, and here known when we work in characteristic zero or for fields of characteristic two, which are algebraically closed. So, what did we do? So, together with Roberto, we proved the following. So, and this is somehow between, I don't know, let's say 19. I don't know, let's say 1924. So, first, I will not go in chronological order, but chronological order, but I will go with them. So, first, we computed the Brouwer group of M11 over any field. And the answer is the following This is in characteristic not two and for character. And for characteristic two, we have let me do it. Let me check. I'm not 100% sure. Give me a second. It's funny because you basically work for doing this computation and then you forget what the results are. Yeah, and tell me that. So, J well, before that, let me also tell you what these cases are. So, this first case is cases are. So this first case is when we have x squared plus x plus 1 is irreducible. And this case here is when x squared plus x plus 1 is not 0. The characteristic is q in both cases. So So, I will not tell you what J is. No, I mean, we can talk about it, but it's basically a certain subgroup of a certain fiber product of some K-theory group and motivic homology, like the H mod when the difference is one between the anyhow. What do you mean by big? What do you mean by big? If you're a giant... Honestly, I don't know. Perhaps it actually can be deduced. Yeah, exactly. But we can talk about that later. And right. So you see in particular you recovered the Shin's result there. You recover the Shin's result there. Then the Brauber group of M2, and this is, let's say, over a field of characteristic zero, it's the following. So as usual, there are the pieces coming from the bar group of K. There is our piece that comes from the homology of the Comology of the base field, as usual, because we can use it to produce cyclic algebras thanks to the Lyme bundle of 10 torsion. And this guy here, which lives also on algebraic closed field. Who is this guy? This I will tell, actually, who is the generator here. And I mean, And I mean, and then we get also a result for fields of characteristic p, but the problem is that we compute everything but the p torsion part of the baby. Yes. So I'm looking at the first one, and my inner child wants to take the Library spectral sequence for the map from M11 to the J line. And so the key is computing R1, pylo, or star of GM somehow. So this is what, I think this is what Shin did. I think this is what Shin did. So, this is not how you're getting. This is not what. Can you identify in your, like, is your weird J, like, is there something happening with the cohomology of the. Yes, it's quite explicit. Like, but the point is that what you get is, so maybe this is spoiler, but what you get is that you have an explicit description of this as a quotient stack, even over fields of characteristic two. This is like in the appendix of Silverman. And then you can write the symbol for. Symbol for the generator here, which comes from the fact that special fact over fields of characteristic two, if you get rid of the curve of J invariant zero, this is a Z2 gerb. So you produce an invariant, an element coming from this Z2 gerb. And then there is a magic happening, which is that if you take, I mean, then you see classes in here, basically in the In here, basically, in the US CATO description of the motivic homology. So, you can take the symbol given by this element coming from Z2, which a priori does not extend, and the J invariant. So the logarithmic form would be alpha dj over j. Miracle happened. This is actually that. All right, and then there is the Brouwer group of M3, which turns out to be again, this is over theta. Be again, this is over say fields of characteristic zero, which also has e2 factor, and this is related to the, I mean, in a sense, you can prove the existence of this using the 27 lines of the tube. Okay. Of course, I'm not going to give details of all these constructions. I'm happy to talk about it. About it, I will just give some pieces here and there, but it's just somehow to tease you in a sense. So, this brings us to the following question. When did I start? Okay. So, how to do this? And this is where comology. And this is where chromological invariance comes in. So Max said that at the core of math, there are examples. So let's follow this path. And instead of giving you directly a definition of a comological invariant, I can give you an example of a cohomological. invariant, then give you an example of a homological invariant. Even if you don't know what the homological, perhaps you do, but so say that you have, for instance, E, a Netal algebra over a field K. Okay? So when you have a Netal algebra, So, when you have an etal algebra, what can you do? Well, you can produce a quadratic form out of it, right? There is a quadratic form. This basically comes from taking two elements and sending to the phrase of the matrix given by the multiplication by x and y. And y. Now you might want to diagonalize this form. So you get some elements. I don't know, let's call it A1 AN. Where do these elements live? Where they are in F star, sorry, well, k star. This is a non-degenerate paradigm. So, what can you do? Okay, these are not really well defined, but better. Still, not really well defined. We can do the following: we can take symmetric polynomials. In this guise. So these are symmetric elementary symmetric polynomial of the grid. But wait, symmetric polynomials, where? What algebra? Well, let's. Well, let's do it in, I don't know, homology, for instance. Like Galois homology of this field with coefficients in, well, let's say Z2. We can do this, right? Because if we take this to be equal to one, this is exactly this element. So this, so if you So, if you, this is actually a Steele-Whitney class. Well, not originally, but taking care of it from the original definition by a symmetric symmetric function, symmetric polynomial. So, this is a Stiefel-Whitney class, and it's actually an invariant of the et al. algebra. And this lives in, so maybe here I can put D, and here I can. D, and here I can put D. So, you've never seen this before. Let me present you with a cohomological invariant. You give me an object, I give you a cohomological class. Not only that, I give a comological class in a functorial way. Right? So, perhaps now I can give you a definition with respect to, I mean, if you want. With respect to, I mean, if you want, with respect to field extensions. Yes, so okay, I guess. Perhaps I should stress here that here I'm working on fields of characteristic not this one. Oh, wait. Okay, so the following definition makes sense, which is, I mean, I'm not, yes, originally due to SER. Originally, due to SER, which is that now you can, in general, a comological invariant alpha of an algebraic group G, let's stick now with these coefficients for the moment, is a functor. Is a functor from the field extensions over some base field to, I guess, we can think of this as graded algebra, which takes a g-torsor. We have a g-torser over. So, sorry, what am I writing there? I want to take Q torsource, I guess. And to this, And to this, you associate some homology classes. Okay. Over over K over is it functorial network. I'm taking the classifying stack. Natural transformation, yeah. It's a natural transformation from this, the functor that is associated to every field, the Galois homology. Galois homology. Exactly. Do we all agree on this? Yes, I think. There's one more condition. We need to say that the trivial concept is normalized, yeah. Okay. All good. This is the actual definition. And now just substitute this with an algebraic step. This is with an algebraic stack. So now I want to say for of an algebraic stack is a natural transformation between these two functions. This definition is not correct or better. It's badly behaved. Or better, it's badly behaved because you have to impose some continuity condition. And now, so the continuity condition is for every DVR with residue field, let's say with residue field. Field of k and also want to say this is k0, this is little k and f and quotient field big k I want, I write and then explain. For every object, CR over M. So let's just parse this. I want this, this is JR is the map that goes from the cohomology of the residue field to the cohomology of the quotient field using the first the isomorphism with the H1 of first the isomorphism with the h1 of the h of spec r and then restriction and i want that if i start with an object that lives over the dvr if i compute the cohomological invariance on the closed point and i look at the cohomological invariant and i use jr to see this as an element in the cohomology of the quotient field i want this to be the same as the value of the homological invariance for the restriction of the object over the quotient field so in a sense it's a continuity condition A continuity condition. Now, so this is now due to this was this definition was given by Piris in his thesis. What yeah, So the point is, which is why it's interesting to us, and the point is that, well, let me do the following remarks. The first is that for if x That for if x, if m is a scheme, then the homological invariance of m basically captures the is like the non-ramified commodity. I mean, I'm skipping the coefficients here, but two, this has the following, let's sorry. Following, let's say, sorry, it's a smooth scheme. Now, actually, you can use this together with the fact that this invariants form a sheaf for the smoothness-Navich topology. And actually, it's actually the shiftification, I mean, the global section of the smoothness-Navich shifification of the talcomology to prove that if M is a portion stack. Is a portion stack, then the invariance of M, I mean, this is in a, for a general cycle module, ROST, but perhaps I should, let's just keep this for the moment like this. This is the same as the G equivariant zero char group with the coefficients of X. Of effects which would be variants. Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right. So this is a generalized conclusion. And three, again, here I'm taking the n to be the characteristic of the base field, not divide n and these things are actually not easy to compute, but they are basically the thing that. The thing that allowed us to do the computation no most of the time, no, because this is the zero child group with the gequivariant zero child group with coefficients or Ross Char group. Yes, exactly. Exactly. And finally, And finally, the n torsion of the Brouwer, the homological Brouwer group of M is computed by this. It's okay, if I put two here, I should just put mu n. Well, not use this notation. Okay, so, and moreover, this is equal to the n torsion in the Brauer group of n for m the smooth potion stack with, let's say, Let's say smooth the Lean Manford portion stack with quasi-projective modular space. Sorry? This one. So this is the homological bra group. There is a data bra. Yes. Okay, good. So the point is that somehow the what is the why is this point of view useful? Well, it's useful because on one hand it gives you a way to produce, I mean it gives you some Way to produce, I mean, it gives you some opological invariants are, at least to me, like easier to produce, to guess, in a sense. And the Rust theory can be used to show that the chromological invariants that you have guessed are actually all of them. Because, in fact, what we do with Roberto in these cases is compute the whole homological invariance. And the degree two part. And the degree 2 par gives the Brouwer group. In fact, if you want, homological invariance can also be used to say something about the torsion of the Picard group. That's another application we had. Okay, so now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Yes, absolutely. So this is a, now M actually is always a smooth. I mean, for some of these claims, we don't need all of these, but it will always be this. Thank you. Yeah, because you see, I mean, you need basically the point here is that if, okay, maybe I should not. We can talk about later. So, what about this? About this, so this is some other third part, which is application. Perhaps now I should tell you who these generators of this browser group are. So I'm finishing at 35, right? Okay. So for instance, for M2. So, what I explained here is the theory, as again, let me stress this: when the characteristic of the base field does not divide n. Which means, in particular, you cannot use it to compute this over any field a priori. I mean, but together with Robert, I mean, the Totaro developed a theory of homological invariance with coefficients basically in multiple. Invariants with coefficients basically in motivic homology, which works also for p-torsion characteristic p for classifying stacks, or if you want for algebraic groups. And together with Roberto, we also expanded this theory to include algebraic stacks, and this was the tool for this. The theory here gets way more, computations get more complicated. So, M2. So, M2. Let me. So, we see that the interesting part is this. Who is this guy? So, you start with a genus two curve, which are notoriously hyperelliptic. This means that there is a There is what is sometimes called a wire stress device. This is the I never remember if it's the branching logs or the ramification logs. What is the one on top and what is the one below? I know it's a hard question. No one knows, right? I guess I want to see. Knows, right? I guess I want to say that the branch logus is the one above and the ramification is the one below, just to say something. So this means that this is the branching logus, rubs. And in particular, W is the spectrum of E, where E is an etal K algebra. A algebra of degree six. And now, what do you do with etal algebras? Well, we do what we have done before. We can compute alpha 2 of E, which is going to be better. Say alpha 2 of E is the second. Syvil-Whitney class of E, which is the one that we defined before when we were giving an example of a comological environment. And this is the generator, or better, this coupled with, well, depending on which cycle module you're taking the. Cycle module, you're taking the coefficient because, in general, you can compute the invariant in cycle modules, but we're only interested in this. This is the generator of the Z2 factor in the Brouwer group of M2. And that's it. In fact, you can compute the Brouwer group in general for much. You can compute the Brouwer group in general for modular hyper elliptic curves, and the results depend on the parity of g. Why? Because if g is odd, you have one more class, which is the Severi-Brouwer scheme obtained by taking the family of hyper elliptic curves and modding out by the involution. For G even, this is a projective bundle. For G odd, this is a very Brouwer variety, which is not, I mean, it's not a projectivization of a vector buck. I mean, it's not a projectivization of a practical and so this gives you one class more. And another interesting phenomenon is that, for instance, if you take compactifications, there are certain compactifications of modular papyriptic curves that preserve the invariants, namely admissible covers. There are other compactifications, like the De Lim-Manford one, which kills the invariant. For one, which kills the invariants. Basically, because, in a sense, admissible covers are, I mean, preserve the arithmetic of the biostructure device. So, M3. Where does the generator of the Z2 part come? Well, one thing you can do Is to take this guy, where this is the moduli of odd spin curves of genus 3. If you don't know what odd spin curve is, you can also consider the restriction of this guy over this. Over the complement of the hyperlink curves. And this is the Mau, if you want, the H0, P2, O4, minus something, module GL3, aka genus 3 curves, non-hyperliptic genus 3 curves are basically quartic curves, smooth quartics, of course, modular reaction of this group. And notoriously, every Notoriously, every smooth quartic has 28 B tangents. These 28 B tangents are exactly the fiber over this map. But more generally, you can extend this also over here. So this is a map. It's 28 to 1. Now you start seeing almost the 27. Right, so this means That you have this map. So, again, these are, if you want, over fields, these are eta algebras of degree 28. So, you can say, hey, let's do the same thing that we did before. Let's just take the Stiepel-Whitney classes. Right? Because now, if we have a curve over fields, we can take the fiber of this map. This is an etal algebra of degree 28. Let's take alpha 2. Good idea. Good idea, but is this non-zero? Here, GL3. This is a 28 degree 28 algebra. You take the second stieple-Widney class. So, this means that in particular, you can take the pullback of alpha 2, the second silver. Alpha 2, the second Sylvia-Whitney class. And the question is: is this not zero? How can you produce an example? In fact, it's enough, of course, to produce one single example where this class is not zero. How do you do that? Well, one thing you can consider the following: let's say let X be a smooth cubic surface over some field F. Now Now you take a point that doesn't line on any line. And you take the blow-up of X at this point, and now this has a natural map. 2p2 was ramification logus. Perhaps I should say, yeah, the ramification logus, this is coherent with what we said before, is a smooth quartic. Right? This natural map is just, I mean, if you want, if you consider x the smooth cubic surface, you can project on p2 by this point. This, of course, will only be a rational map, then you blow up and you actually have. Now, this is the funny thing. There is a correspondence between the 28 lines on the blow-up The blow-up of this cubic surface and the 28 B tangents of ramification logics, which is a quark equipment. Again, in the case of the current, Again, and this, as I said, this corresponds exactly to the fiber of this map, if you want to, the odd theta characteristics. So now this means that the etal algebras that we would like to consider if you want, we have We have let's say that we take an F point. So, this et algebra here is equal to a certain etal algebra A prime times. times f and this is because these are the this is the algebra of the line of the 27 lines if you want is the ring of functions of the final scheme of lines of the cubic surface plus this uh russian like this f here which just comes from the exceptional divide what does it mean it means now that if we pick in a wise way In a wise way, the points. If we pick a field that is, I don't know, like for instance, we can take f to be this field. And let's say that we have an extension, which is this. Which is this. So, what is the idea? The idea is that if you pick wisely, okay, maybe let me also say this: that the cubic surface, this cubic surface appearing here, maybe remark X can be obtained as the blow-up of P2 at S, where S is a scheme, closed subscheme of length. Lucid sub-scheme of length six. Let's say that if you pass to algebraic closer, these are six points. So this means that if we pick wisely six points here, which of course should be Galois conjugate, and we blow up them, so we get actually a scheme that if you take module the Galois action produces a surface here of which Here, of which we can actually compute the algebra of lines. So, in particular, so for instance, you can do the following. You can take Q1 and Q1 prime to be, so let's say that the Galois group, or better, let's say that gamma is the Galois group. Is the Galois group of K over F. So you can pick two points which are exchanged. So this is, let's say that this is generated by sigma and tau by sigma, or better, exchanged by tau and fixed by sigma. These are, oh, I should say, fixed by Should say fixed by sigma and exchanged by tau. This is the same, but as which tau and sigma. And then these are fixed by sigma tau. So this basically what I'm saying is that if you want, there are points of P2. P2 over these fields that leave on one on k square root of a, one on the other extension obtained by taking the square root of b, another on the extension obtained by taking the square roots of a b. Then you have a very nice picture and I blow up this point. So this is if you want. Yes, if you want. And this is where actually some colors would be useful, but there are colors? Perhaps I should just so you can concretely compute what the 27 lines. Concretely compute what the 27 lines are. And they basically come, let's say, of three or better four typologies. There are the conics that pass through five of these six points. Then there are the lines through. Through two conjugated points. And then there are also the lines through non-conjugated points. And finally, there are the exceptional devices. And the point is that for every of these lines, you can concretely compute the field of definition. Well, that's because, for instance, let me maybe just make an example with the conic. If you want, we can do the computation. And if you want, we can do the computation together later. But let me just give you an example, for instance, with the conic called green on green. That's wise. And of course, this is fixed by the element of the Galois group that fix the point left out. The point left out. So, you can actually say what the field of definition is. Similarly, if you take, I don't know, for instance. If you take, I don't know, for instance, if you take the exceptional, which I guess was this one, the exceptional divisor as a field is defined, means defined leaves over the field of definition has the same field of definition as. As the point you're blowing up, and so on. Like, for instance, if you have a line through conjugated points, then you can tell what the field definition is. I mean, it's very concrete. So, you do all the computation. So, this means that you can actually, the upshot can describe. Can describe concretely the etal algebra E prime as a certain product of different etal algebras of the form A square root of better F this should be F square root of a F f square root of a, f square root of b, f square root of a b and f itself. So you can write concretely. It's very explicit. You just do the counting. And then, but now this means that you are computing the alpha two of an etal algebra that you split via this. And this is also a computation that is quite easy to do. Like you can concretely The alpha 2 of this. So, and when you do these computations, in the end, you get something, which if I remember correctly, is like this is probably the last thing I'll probably the last thing I would say concerning the stoke. So you get that the alpha 2 of this E prime in the end, it's going to be something like something like this. And you can prove that this class is actually non-zero by just computing the if you want, you compute the ramification. If you want, you compute the ramification along a equals 0 and b equals 0. And so, in the end, so this means now, as you know by again, abstractly computation using the Ross child groups, that there must be a Z2 factor, you have found it. It's exactly this. So, this is the, if you want, alpha 2 of S3 minus 1 over M3 minus 1 is the generator. Is the generator of the Z tube factor and the Brouwer group of M3. And I think I will stop you. Thank you. Any questions? Do you know anything about other homological invariants of their degrees? Like, for example, are they generated just by the by these people in the classrooms that go fields? So what we know is the following. What we know is the following. Now, if we work over an algebraically closed field, we are able to prove to compute the invariance in an abstract way, which is a sort of unsatisfying. In a sense that we know that there is basically, so there is a, well, there is the ones coming from the base, then there is the Brouwer group, if you want, about degree two, and then if I remember correctly, should be two of degree three and one of degree two. Two of degree three and one of degree four. Which part of it? The whole invariant, the invariance of M3. Yeah, sorry, you're asking about M3 or in general? So M3 is the most mysterious from this point of view because two of degree three and one of degree four. The way this is obtained, by the way, I should also say that we uploaded the paper some months ago and there was a mistake where we claimed that the environment A mistake where we claimed that the invariants were only up to degree two, but actually, there is a mistake, so we found out that there are more because so, okay. So, there are two of degree three, one of degree four, and this is interesting because we don't know what they are. I mean, a priority can be Stiefel-Whitney classes, but I was just the I think the homological invariance of these mod two for E6 for the finite group of. Might be. I mean, thank you for this. It might be very helpful. The way this is done is... Okay. The reason, I mean, the way we do this is actually by looking at a stratification of the moduli space because if you take, as I was saying, Because you take, if you take, as I was saying, when you compactify through the Limanfrastek, you get something that is trivial. So you plug this into a long-exit sequence for Ross Child groups. And this gives you a way to compute, at least abstractly, because you start looking at deeper and deeper strata of the moduli of curves, because you know that somehow they should come from this deeper strata in the sense that they should be the ones that ramify in a certain way on this deeper strata. And if you go in this way, you realize that, for instance, when you look Realize that, for instance, when you look at curves with three nodes, there are two irreducible components: the curves that are irreducible and the ones that it's a line plus a curve. And these are somehow the two degree three invariants come from these two different components here. Yeah, this is, but good news for Hg for hyper-elliptic curves, then we proved that basically. Prove that basically they are all Stefel-Whitney classes. So we actually compute them over, I mean, not even, not with the algebraic closed field hypothesis. But for the four. Oh, you said the four isn't so the degree four? No, no, I mean, they are not clear in the sense that we prove that they are there, we don't have an interpretation for them. But the problem is that somehow, how do you know that there is one element, for instance, in degree? instance in degree okay let's say m3 minus h3 right how do you know that there's an element here in degree one it's basically the the fact that the picard is nine torsion well it's basically because you can produce an element in the ross chow group of the divisor of singular curves and you can prove that this is sent to zero by the push forward and so the long acted sequence tells you that there should be something of course it's a it's a way to prove that you can use to prove that for instance if you have an internet Can use to prove that, for instance, if you have an interpretation, like if you have guessed some homological invariants, you have found them all. You can actually use the proof that those are the invariants. What they actually are, though, it's more mysterious. They might come again from, I don't know, maybe from what you were saying, or from the, again, spin curves. But the spin curves business, you can use it actually also to produce invariants of higher degree, non-trivial invariance of higher degree, in fact on Mg in general. And perhaps, this is just a conjecture. Perhaps, this is just a conjecture, what is happening might be that you go higher with the genus and every time the invariance gets shifted by one, which is why you have something in genus three. Then in genus four, maybe they start from degree, this would be degree three. I don't know. These are just yes. Sorry, for what classes? These are actually hydrogen algebra for this. I mean it depends a little bit. If you mean like the algebra, you can write it explicitly. Like if you want, it's the algebra coming from the ramification of the curve. Of the Weistrass divisor of the curve. Like if you want, you have a universal curve. you want you have a universal curve which has a universal viestrass divisor so this gives you um okay no this is not completely true you have to know how to associate an algebra sorry an Azumaya algebra to an et al algebra the I mean to interpret the alpha 2 as a but this this I think I mean I don't know from the top of my head but I think this is but if you want an interpretation in terms of like severi Brower varieties Like Severi-Brauber varieties? This is a question that I asked myself, but I honestly don't know the answer. Like, for instance, there should be a non-trivial Severi-Brauer variety on a P1 bundle over MP. What is this P1 bundle? I don't know. Yeah, so that's it for today. See you guys come on off this night.
