Today I talk on with Kano-san our recent work about two deformed super cohort. And that is joint work with Kando-san, Harada-san, and Shirai-san. And that is the introduction. The introduction. In the Virasola article, it's very important in string theory. And also, if we compactify some space, then super n equal to 1 or n equal to 2 or more super common algebra is also important. And on the other hand, there is M theory side or K theory case in the M C mean weak. There is some circle. If we say largest R, then Q over, Q equal exponential R case. And so there is some another parameter Q appears. And the deformation, Q deformation of Virusol algebra also important. And but uh that is that is QRSO algorithm found almost to twenty or thirty years ago. But uh up to now there is no super generalization for this Q Virus algebra. But that recently we found the n equal to two case, so we report this case n equal to two supercomputer. So that to construct this super n equal to two This super n equal to QD Horn Virasarajara. The key point is number four using this free, not the Virasoro, but using customary algebra, UQSL2 hat. And using this free boson realization and slightly modified this realization, we get that n equal to two. That n equal to Q deformed super algebra. So today I talk on first Virasal algebra and second n equal to super algebra and three Q Virasura algebra. And next we say the reboson realization of UQ cats male algebra and modified and defined Q subonizer. And the second And the second about condo-san said that ha why this modification is good or not. That is relation with Y algebra. So, kind of sound talk on how to find this our result. So, but one, two, three, four, this is a very old story. Old story, 20 or 30 years old. So I'm very sorry. Created that. First, the Virasoro case. That is a very known fact. The Virasoro algebra is generated by generator Ln. I wrote Ln. N is integer and some relation. That is famous Virasolo Coval relation. Regression, area is center, center C is center, and this bracket, this is convolutation relation, and delta is also chronic data. And to make super virusol, generating function is not not this mode, but generating function is very useful. So if we define by this LN mode. By this Ln mode, times parameter Z and N minus 2, and defined this changing function LZ, then that this 1.1 direction is equivalent to 1.3. That is computation of this generating function, Z and this delta is marriage predictive delta function, delta x equals sum over every integers. over every integer xn and this round is the difference by different change in w this round and round the third and seed center and this is differential over this w so anyway this mode relation is equivalent to this generated relation and today i use the Today I use this free boson guard addition and using free boson guard addition we defined the Q deformed n equal to gene test. So free boson algebra is important so I introduce boson algebra but it's that is generated by a n and q n is integer and the derivation is usually boson. And am is normal. A n and am is n times chronic advertise and and uh I don't know you don't need the origin and q q is the zero mode. And there is it is famous fake influx prefix generation by bosons. I mean this generator be a sort generator is beaten by this boson. But w I don't But w I don't write in expected. Today I don't use this form. So anyway, there exists 3D free writer issue. So this is first part. We are solo. The next is to that is super generalization n equal to super. That is that is That is defined, general, generated by J and G and L. J is U1 current, G is super current, G R plus minus. L N is V plus or is N is integers, but R is two case integer case or half integer case. There is some. Case either there is some RAM sector or rubo self, there is two sectors, but are Z or Pandova 2 plus Z. And with derivation, there is many, many derivation, but the important derivation is this one. The supercurrent is anch commutation. This brace is anch commutation in nature, AB plus BA. G plus and G plus is H commut, and G plus, this relationship is important. G plus and G minus H commutation relation produce B razor and U1 current. Then there is another relation, but another is almost trivial one. Important is this relation. By the supercurrent, The super current, Vilasura and U1 current is generated. And same as Vilasura, we need the generative function and free field visualization. Generative function is the same as before. L and  ‚Åá  and J is defined. Then this commutation direction for mode is same as equivalent to the genetic direction for genetic function. function. G is common unsquared and g plus and g minus produce u1 current and virusroc. And then also there is free filation. But in this case, virassurgue is one kind of boson. In this case we need three kinds of bosons. A i and qi. I is one, two, three. n is integer. And the relation is different. I and j is if i equal j is equal I for J is equal than J user commutation. I and J is different than they independent. So mutually independent, three kinds of bosons we need. And I don't write any expedition construction, but there is also free filialization. Maybe I write some some relation later, but Some relation later, but anyway, there is three fitted relations. This is the second part. And T yes, I will show you later, but that is important. Second third thousand this hue deformation of Velasola. Of Virasoro. This is the generated I wrote now, not well, but T. And there is two parameters, Q and three parameters, Q and T and P. Two is independent. Q is deformation parameters. T corresponds to the center. This beta corresponds to the center. Now T is just. One to center. Now, p is just a q over t anyway, three parameters, but two is independent. And the relation is like this. Important point is this is not Lie algebra. Right-hand side is not linear, but bilinear. So this is not Lie algebra. But then this is well-defined algebra. And if it's artifact and f is some number defined if l is number of defined by this and this is relation with our mode and we can also write this relation by genetic function genetic function is defined by this and that this 3.1 relation is equivalent to 3.4 vision f times F times T and T Z and T W minus T w times T times F equals something. Delta is delta function. And also, z equals free-free the i dash by boson. But I don't write any expressed form. So that is third part. That next slide. I want to define this Q the home and the super algebra. But the point is using affine algebra, UQSL2. The fourth part is here. So you QS. Uqs32 hat is generated by I wrote Xn plus X plus minus and phi plus minus X plus is creation operator X minus is an iteration operator phi is current and relation is there are many iterations but the important relations is express and express creation and iteration Creation and creation predata reproduce have produced oh sorry this is disappear two over n minus current part that is a main important there is another many derivation but I omit and uh if we write this delay write this relation by generating function x plus minus z phi plus minus z then this relation is written by like this combination relation of x plus and x minus is something like this delta is the function function phi is uh generating function for zero and also ex express express is not volume. Express is not commute in in in the n equal to case. And that this is very similar to n equal to n equal to two case. This is this is not commutation, this anti-commutation relation, but uh looks very similar. This z plus and g minus corresponding. And g minus correspond to is x plus and x minus. But that n equal to case g g is g plus and g plus is anti-commute, but in that case, it's not commute, but this kind of and the next is important. I want to use this free realization. This free free realization for UQ generators, and I want to modify this one. Then I said I can get a super n equal to super Q D on eraser. So this is the known fact this UQSL two hat is written by Boson. There are many realizations, but realization but for example Atoshi Matzo San or Shirai-san make this impositionization but today I we use Matzo sand version Matzo sand version is very suitable for our purpose so Matzo sand version sh make a boson realization by some paraphylominic Parapherominic deli addition. This is Matzo Sant de Radition. E realize this UQSO2 generators by three kinds of bosons. That is similar to any code 2 super pilot case. This is also written by three kinds of bosons. Same as before. I is 1, 2, 3, and 2. Before, I is one, two, three, and I and J is different, then they are independent. And the real relationship is like this: X plus minus is important. And X plus minus is divided two terms, X plus minus plus part and minus part. There is two terms. And I note this plus and minus is epsilon, epsilon is plus minus. And we also need normal ordering. We also need normal ordering. That is, that means positive model goes to the right. For example, A5 and A minus 5 dot dot dot is nothing but A5, it should be right part. Positive mode should be right. That is the definition of this normal modeling. And uh also this is uh Q integer defined usually. defined usually. Using this Matsozan lighter boson realization for this UQ SU2 hat. It looks complicated, but uh not so complicated. That is that that is exp that plus or minus but and Minus part and they are structured like this: exponential boson, exponential boson, and this is zero mode. This boson is first kind of boson, A1. Second, third line is A2, second kind of boson. And fourth line is third kind of third boson. There are three kind of boson. One, Kind of boson, one and two and three, and everything is exponential boson type, and that is summation is n not equal to zero, n over z minus n, and boson, and square root of something. This is q integers. And i this exponential part contain positive mode and negative mode, so I need normal ordering. Normal ordering. Positive mode should be right, and negative mode should be left. And zero mode. And the second part is also similar, just different is minus sign. This minus. First line and second line is very almost similar, but sign changing. The third line is. The sideline is that is this is only positive mode n goes to run positive. So if you are if sure is a positive plus then this is only positive mode and if sure it's minus then this is only minus mode so fourth line is also so so third and fourth line is only positive or only negative first and second is both First and second is both positive and the second negative one. And this is clear, but if we this is QE deformed case, but to get Q equals one result, we just Q equals one case, this Q integer goes to usual integers and this N, N we. This n is cancelled. So k over 2 is go out to this summation. So n is canceled. So k over 2 is also before this summation and k over 2 before the summation and 2 over k is also also summation. So this is k over 2 and this is 2 over k. So this part is if we multiply. is if we multiply then they should cancel anyway this later part is important information this is k over 2 k over 2 minus k over 2 2 over k and 2 over k plus 2 that is a boson realization for u q es and uh we know uh this is u a fine case but uh You a fine case, but uh there is question about uh uh boson generalization for uh n equal to two, q equal to one and n equal to q two boson realization. That is just that q goes to very similar if we take a q goes to one limit. Q equals to one limit, then the boson realization for n equals two is very similar to this one. And we know that is that result. So we see that q equal one, n equal to realization, and seeing this, and that the difference is almost this part. This two should be. Should be changed to k plus 2. I mean, I know that both on the different realization for q equal to 1 and n equal to 2. That is different this part. So, changing this part, then maybe we guess we may get both on the right hand side for n equal to 2 and q not equal. equal to 2 and q not equal 1 and the result is the story is very simple we can find n equal to 2 q sub algebra very similar to previous right that we should define g G that is plus part and negative part. And the plus or minus is defined like this. The difference is omit this part and two should be modified K plus two. Two should be modified to K plus two. Two should be modified to K plus two. And some other very small changes. These should be shifted by. Be shifted by k to the two over k was such only that this is the previous one. This this two and this two is changed with k plus two and some other small modification. This two k plus two k plus two and you throughout this part and add this part. Add this part. Then, this is modification which we did. Then, actually, this generators, this G plus generator generator, nice algebra. They justify G plus and G pluses and commute. And commutation relations G plus and G minus is produced some other generators. And I defined it K or T and then this T satisfied these kinds of relations. I mean, this K and T is G is written by boson, so this K and T is also written by boson. So we can calculate the region. Then T and T The equation then T and T commutation of T and T is like this. That is produced. This is not linear, but we have K minus K plus and another W. W is written by K and T and G. Well, this is very complicated, but anyway, we can define. We can define that as well. So the point of my talk is only this part. Just modify the 33 derivation for UQSL2 cat money algebra, very small modification, then we get that complicated but uh nice algebra. So this is generative function. So Genetic function. So for the mode expansion, it's like this. If we if we define mode from this generating function, then we get a definition for written by mode. Jn plus minus gr plus minus t n plus they satisfy this kind of. There are many, many. Well there are many many relations but anyway we can get uh new algebra that is n equal to 2 and q the form of pirazzo algebra. So my talk is stop here but I changed to candle sound. Uh notation should uh it's very changed. Sorry, sorry. Sorry for candle sound. Sorry, sorry for Kano-san. I changed it into a notation. I use three kinds of boson, but Kano-san used many kinds of bosons, but finally, he wrote that alpha tilde and alpha bar and beta. Three kinds of boson is different. And also this is proportional. And generator is also, I don't cheer that canoes don't don't like. Connozzan don't don't write to that. But anyway, so so I stop here.
