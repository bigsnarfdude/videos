I should remind you what the definition is. So, all surfaces are going to be closed here, closed and oriented for simplicity. Okay, and usually also hyperbolic and not a torus or something. So, the curve complex of S is a simplicial complex, or you can just think the one skeleton. So, the vertices are going to be isotopic classes of simple closed curves. Simple close curves of essential simple close curves. And then you put an edge between two of them if they can be realized disjointly. If A intersect B is empty after isotop and I'm sure you've seen And I'm sure you've seen talks about the curve complex before, but it is a locally infinite graph. And its main geometric feature is that it is hyperbolic. That's the theorem of Mazer and Minsky. That it is C of S is hyperbolic and it has infinite diameter. Okay, and it's hard to stay. Okay, and it's hard to study the mapping class group without looking at this complex. And so, for a long time, I thought this was like the unit of the theory, an atom. You cannot really break it apart. This is what you have, and you will study it. And then in 2016, at the MSRI program in geometric group theory, Ursula Hammenstadt gave a talk where she proposed a way. She proposed a way of what we call disintegrating the curve complex. Okay, so she, so let me state this theorem. So this was announced by Hamistad in 2016. And by the way, this week is her birthday conference. And so if you will, if you want, this is my tribute to. Okay, so there is a tower. I should really draw the tower vertically, but you know, usually there's no place on the board to do that. Maybe I could do it over here, but anyway, I'll draw it horizontally. So C, I guess I'll drop S from notation. So this is some Cn, and then you go down Cn minus one, dot, dot, dot, all the way to C zero, okay, of. Of hyperbolic complexes or graphs, they're all equivariant with respect to the mapping class group. So the mapping class group is acting on the curve complex, but it's also acting on all of these. And the extra feature here is that, so all. The extra feature here is that, so all maps, all maps from C, say K plus one to C K are Lipschitz. And then the main feature here is that this last one here, C0, is quasi-isymmetric to a tree. It's a quasi-tree. Okay, so the additional features are that C0 is a quasi-tree. Quasitary and then the coarse fibers. Maybe I won't define that at the moment. We'll see at the end if there's any time for this. But you can kind of imagine what coarse fibers are. Coarse fibers of CK plus one to CK are quasitors. Okay, so that's the theorem. So somehow the C can be. So, somehow the C can be disintegrated into quasitories, if you will. Yes. Yes. Okay, so she didn't indicate what the proof was supposed to be, and there haven't been any papers, but this served as an inspiration for Ken Brumberg and Alex. And Bromberg and Alex Rasmussen and me to start looking at this. So, this is our joint with mapping class group. Yes, so these are all mapping class group invariant. Is that the question? No, how is how is it related to well the the all these complexes are uh acted on by the mapping class group okay but they're they're sort of getting simpler and simpler until they get down to the quasi-3. So it's some somehow they're all built, they're not really built. Somehow they're all built, they're not really bundles, but maybe that's one approximating word that you can think of. That the curve complex is built by iterating this quasi to quasi-tree bundle construction. And it's all electrivariant. And directions are still nice when you go down or yeah, they're as nice as for the curve complex. They'll be they're what? I'm not sure if you thought about this, but probably. Thought about this, but probably are they cylindrical? They must be. Uh, I haven't thought about it. Yeah, I would bet they are, but we haven't thought about it. Yeah, they're certainly everything is as nice as for the curve complex. Yeah, that's sort of the philosophy here. Okay, so um okay, so we're gonna have to do that. Okay, so this is still sort of in progress, but we claim with maybe lowercase t as a theorem that we can prove this. Okay, so let me start by giving Ursula's definition, which is fairly simple. Okay, it turns out that that's not the best working definition, so I'll give you a more complicated definition after that. Okay, so okay, so the definition is. So, the definition is, you know, sort of depends on the index. And let's start with Hamisha definition. So, C0. So, if I take two simple closed curves and make them in minimal position in the surface, then generically, what you think about is that the complementary components are going to be, you'll see a million quadrilaterals, and then you're going to see a few hexagons. And the number of hexagons depends on the order characteristic of the. Depends on the old characteristic of the surface. Okay, that's that's somehow generically what you expect to see. If you see anything else, then you put an edge between the two curves. Okay, so C0, so the vertex set is the same as the vertex set of C. In other words, they're isotopic classes of essential simple closed curves. simple closed curves but we put more edges than we do in the curve in the curve graph that is we we join a and b by an edge if um if the surface minus a union b is consists or contains contains at least one at least one you know greater than or equal to eight gone of course all of them are all of them Of course, all of them are even-sided, right? Because they're two curves, and when you go around, you'll be alternating between the two curves and b. And so, if you see, if they're all quadrilaterals or hexagons, then you don't put an edge between them. Otherwise, you do. Okay? So, this is C0. C1, and then I'll let you figure out the rest of the definitions. So, here you Definitions. So, here you so, in other words, if you see one eight gun, then you know you put you put an edge there for the next one. You're required to see at least two eight gons or more complicated regions or at least one tangon. Okay, so at least one greater than or equal to ten gon or or if you have genus, of course, if there's genus, if it's not just a disk, then you also put an edge there. That's more complicated than any polygon. Polygon, or at least two eightons. Okay, so you can see how this continues, right? Yes. Yeah, so if the complement is more complicated, if it's not even a disk, then then you put an edge there. So certainly if there are these joint curves will be always connected to an edge. So it's like if you have the product, you can say continuum weights. If you have topology that's like infinite weight, you're always putting infinite weight. What do you mean? I don't know, so you always put an edge in there's topology in the company, yes, always, yeah. Yeah, so this there are more edges than in C, right? So you can see that there is a map from C to C zero, which is just identity on the vertices. And you know, just here you're adding more edges. Okay. Now, Okay, so that's the statement of the theorem. Now, it turns out that this is not a good way to think about these complexes. It's kind of hard to work with curves and complements. So we have another definition that uses train tracks. So I'm going to give you a crash course on train tracks. No, C0 has more. No, uh, C0 has more edges. You're as you go down the tower, you're adding more and more edges, right? Yeah, like if all the complementary regions are disks, and you know, no matter what they are, you know, eight guns, ten guns, you would not connect them in C. But here you sometimes do, depending on what these regions are. Well, they're identity on the vertices, and then and then they're just extra edges. So, quasi-friendly is a little confusing. So, positive fibers is a little confusing. Yeah, I know. So, that's that just requires coarse fibers. Coarse fibers requires a definition, but you can kind of imagine what it is, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, n is, I don't know. Certainly, let's say it's something like, to be safe, 6g minus 6 is probably a little bit less. Okay. Okay, so train tracks. Okay, so a train track is really a graph that's embedded in a surface. A graph embedded in an S, and it's locally modeled. So it's going to be a trivalent graph. So, it's going to be a trivalent graph, and it's locally modeled on. So, it's sort of a smooth graph, it has a smooth structure. So, these vertices that are valence three, they have, there's a well-defined tangent space. And two of these directions are going to be, they're going to form angle zero at the vertex. And so there's a notion of a smooth path. So, a path, a smooth path can run through like this or like this. run through like this or like this but it's not it it's doesn't like it doesn't it's not allowed to do to make the circle okay so um and then there's an additional condition that no complementary regions complementary regions are smooth disks so here we're not allowing punctures but uh also puncture disks wouldn't be allowed okay uh and uh Okay, and monogons. Okay, so this kind of thing is not allowed, where there's no topology in here. And then there's also bygons. Those are kind of negotiable. They're frowned upon, but sometimes they have to be allowed. Bygones are okay. Yes, they're okay. Okay, so this is sometimes not allowed. So an example of this is, let's say a Taurus. Example of this is, you know, so let's say a torus. So the torus I'm going to draw is a square, the usual way. And then I'll take this graph. Okay, like this. There's a train track. Okay, so here the complementary region is a bygone. And there is nothing really you can do about this. If you're in some kind of a hyperbolic surface, you could try collapsing the bygone. And that usually works. But here it doesn't. But here it doesn't. Taurus is weird anyway. Okay, so then there's a notion of a carried curve. So a curve alpha is carried. So the name, the usual name for a train track is tau. It's carried by tau if it is homotopic. To a smooth curve and tau. So, a curve of a simple closed curve, of course, is embedded in the surface, but when I stick it into the train track, it doesn't have to be embedded anymore. For example, well, this horizontal curve is certainly a carrot. It's in fact even embedded in the train track. There's also a curve that goes. A curve that goes that takes this vertical branch and comes back, and then maybe, um, well, and then it closes up. So, this would be a one-one curve, slope-one curve. But you can also think about more complicated curves. You could go around here a million times and then do this. So, this would be some other slope, maybe one over a million or something. Okay. Now, any curve that Any curve that is carried and homotoped into tau like this determines weights on the edges. The edges are called branches. So a smooth curve tau determines weights. This is simply the number of times the curb crosses a particular branch. And so then there's an obvious rule. And so then there's an obvious rule that if you have this situation here and you count how many times your curve crosses here and how many times crosses here how many times crosses here, well then x must be equal to y plus z. Okay, so these are called the switch equations. Is every curve carried by some track, right? Every curve is carried by some track. For example, by the stupid track, that's the curve itself. Yes. But there are lots of curves not carried by a particular track. Like, for example, here, if you have a negative slope, that wouldn't be carried by the track. Okay. What else? Oh, so then you can also look for real solutions or non-positive, non-negative solutions of the switch equations. Okay, so the set of uh the set of um real or non non-positive non-positive real solutions non-negative there are too many uh negatives here real solutions the set of non-negative real solutions uh uh to the switch equations Which equations forms a polyhedral cone. So for example, here, I can try to solve. So let's say I put a weight A here, which is the same as over here, and I put weight B here, which is the same as this. And then let's see, no, that's not what I want. Let's see. No, that's not what I wanted. No, no, I guess I wanted A over here in the middle, so that I have A plus B here and A plus B here. Okay? So A and B can be any non-negative numbers. And then that's going to determine a solution to the switch equations. And so here the cone is, so you can think of it as a quadrant, right? That's the solution. So maybe we'll call it P of tau. P of tau. It doesn't matter in which direction. Nothing is just count how many times. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, this track here is orientable. So any curve will always go through any branch in the same direction. But there are non-orientable tracks. So P of tau. Now, a point in here can be interpreted as a measured geodesic lamination. I don't really want to go more into that, but P of sigma is really a subset. It's a subset of this space of measured laminations, at least when the surface is hyperbolic. If it's a torus, then I guess you have to say foliations instead. Yeah, in the torus, you get the well-defined slope. Taurus, you get the well-defined slope and you get the transverse measure. And so, this object here is, you know, whatever it is, it is homeomorphic to R6G minus 6, when G is at least 2. And so you have this polyhedral cone that has a well-defined dimension, like in this case, 2. And then you also have this object that has a well-defined dimension. And in the case of a torus, that dimension should be 2, not. Should be two, not zero. And so what we define is the index. Index of the strain track is going to be the difference between, so it's the co-dimension of P of tau inside ML. So this is the dimension of ML minus the dimension of P of tau. So for example, this one here is index zero because the Because the set of laminations carried has codimension zero. Okay, so this is kind of a maximal track. You cannot make it larger by adding branches. Okay. All right, any questions at this point? How exactly do we get polyhedron? The polyhedron is the set of solutions to the switch. The set of solutions to the switch equations. So you look at all possible assignments of non-negative numbers to these branches that satisfy the switch equations. Okay, so that's a. So here, well, here I sort of, you know, you could call it C, and then the equation is C equals A plus B. I just use a sort of a shorthand and instead of C, I put A plus B there. So A and B can be any non-negative real numbers. And then this gives you a solution. Okay, so it's a quadrant. Okay, so it's a quadrant in this case. These have cover the measured laminations, uh, yes, they do. Every measured elimination is carried by some trainer. Okay, um, so okay, so our definition now of C sub k. So, what we want to do is we want to put an edge between two We want to put an edge between two curves if they're carried by a train track whose index is greater than k. Okay, so we sort of electrify the set of curves carried by a fixed train track. So CK is equal to C with the set of curves carried by By a train track of index greater than k, by any train track, by any train track of index greater than k electrified. Electrified meaning that you look at that set of curves carried by a fixed range circuit index greater than k, and you put an edge between any two of them. So now the distance is one for any two of them. Okay? And so again, it's clear that you get a tower like on that first board. As you decrease K, you're electrifying more and more terror interacts. So there are more and more edges. Okay. Now these spaces are not exactly the same as Ursula spaces, but they're quasi-symmetric. Okay, so that's what we show. Okay, so that's what we show. They're after quasi-simulatory the same. But these are somehow easier to work with, even though they're harder to define. Okay, now there are a few more things I want to tell you about free intex. Okay, yeah, so what's the relationship between train tracks and the curve complex or curve graph? So, somehow, one point is that every train track coarsely defines a point in the curve complex. So, up to some sort of bounded ambiguity, you can pinpoint the location of the train track in the curve complex, curve graph. And this is done through vertex cycles. Okay, so well, there are different definitions of vertex cycles. What we care about is that they're all bounded distance from each other. They're all bounded distance from each other in the curve graph. So, one thing you can, one definition is you just pick some curve that crosses every branch at most twice. So, this always exists because you start following, you know, you just start constructing some smooth path until it closes up. And that's going to be a curve you want. Okay, so vertex cycle. Early cycles. So these are curves carried by how and crossing every branch at most place. And so the fact is that any two such are bounded distance apart in the curve graph. In C, and therefore, also in all these others, CKs. Okay, that's one thing. Another thing you have to know is splitting. So, this is a process or Process or an operation on train track. So if I have a local picture like this, okay, so this is called a large branch. This one here is called a large branch. But also, there are small branches like this. And that's a small branch. And then there's also one in between. One side is large, one side is small. But the splitting operation. But this splitting operation concerns large branches. And what you do is you construct a new train track that outside of this looks exactly the same as the other one. But over here, you sort of split them apart and then you put a diagonal branch, either this way or the other way. It's sort of your choice, which way you want to do it. So here you're going to be carrying fewer curves. Any curve carried by one of these will also be carried here. But there will be. Carried here, but there will be curves over here that maybe you know they maybe go like this, they go this way, and then they take this turn, and so they'll be carried here, but not here. So, somehow what happens with this polyhedral picture is that it gets cut into two pieces. So, this, if you look at the P of one and P of the other, it'll be some, there's going to be some kind of a cut through here that, and then one half of it is going to be. One half of it is going to be P of tau one and the other half P of tau two. Okay. And the main theorem about this was proved by Will Mazraminski and then independently Hamishtad. So the thing to look at here is the splitting sequences. So I start with a train track and I start splitting it. At every point you split any way you like, and that's a splitting sequence. Like, and that's a splitting sequence. So the theorem So let so I guess this is the notation for you know you the map really goes from the split track to the original track like this. There's kind of a folding map that's you know, there's an obvious map that. There's an obvious map that does this. Okay, so let this be a splitting sequence. Then the set or the sequence, say alpha zero, alpha one, alpha two, of vertex size. Of vertex cycles of the tau i forms a reparametrized quasi-geodesic. So that's somehow in C. That's somehow the way we understand the geometry of the curve graph. There's an alternative approach using these bicorn paths and such, but the These bicorn paths and such, but this is the analog in the world of train tracks. So you somehow have a, you know, here's your C, and every one of these train tracks has a well-defined location in the curve graph. And as you split, you're really describing some kind of a quasi-geodesic. It doesn't have to be, you could be pausing. You could be splitting in a subsurface or something. And so you're not really moving anywhere in the curved graph. But then you could continue and move some more. And move some more. Okay, so that's somehow the picture here. This is tau zero, tau one, tau two. Okay. All right. And maybe the last fact for now is that, and this is really an exercise that any, so if alpha is. So if alpha is a curve carried by tau, then tau can be split, not just once, but several times. Several times. So that at the end, alpha is embedded in In the split track. For example, in this Taurus picture, if I do this a million times horizontally and then once vertically, I'd have to split a million times. Here is a large branch. This plus this. That's a large branch. You start splitting here, you'll do it a million times, and then your curve will be embedded. Okay. Um Okay, so this is the the end of the crash course I'd like to I'd like to prove before we are done with the hour that this last one, C0, is a quasi-tree. And that should be somehow more or less a complete proof modula, some of these facts. But before that, maybe I'll also mention that there are actually a couple of papers about C0, at least. One is by Hammenstadt, and then the other by Mar. Mar Maasai and Feimer. And so, what they show, I mean, they really talk only about C0, but exactly the same argument works for all of them. So, they show that CK is hyperbolic. And they describe the boundary, the grammar boundary of each of them. Well, really, for a Well, really for k equals zero, but they could have done all of them. Yes. We have these two definitions. Is it clear how they are related? So they're quasi-asymmetric to each other, but that's not clear. It's not obvious. It's a theorem. It's a theorem. But here's the main point. Why is this true? The main point, and this is really, this goes back to the work of Kazarafi and Irakapovich. Which one comes first? So the map, so the map from say C to C K. Say C to C K has the property that if the distance in C K between two curves A and D is one, then the image the image of a geodesic see A and B may can be far apart in C, but they're connected. Part in C, and but they're connected by this extra electrifying edge in CK. And so you can take in C, you can take a geodesic joining them. And then you can look at what happens in CK. Well, of course, A and B themselves go to points of distance one. But where does the geodesic go? Well, it goes to something bounded, is the point. The image of a geodesic AB in CK is K is uniformly bounded. Okay, so this is related to the property that people call alignment preserving. And in fact, it's equivalent to it. If I take a geodesic in C and I look at its image, it'll be a quasi-geodesic, an unre-parameterized quasi-geodesic. That's sort of on the surface of it, it's stronger than what I stated here, but in fact, it's equivalent. Okay, so let me give you a proof of this. Okay, this is kind of the key point. And this then implies by the work of Kapovich and Rafi, you basically check the guessing geodesics lemma. You look at the paths that are images of geodesics in C. And with this extra property here, the guessing geodesics lemma tells you that the space CK is hyperbolic. And then there's also the work of Daudle and Taylor. And Taylor, that in that situation of alignment-preserving maps, describes the boundaries. So that's the way to think about this theorem here. Okay, so let me give you this proof, proof of this fact. Okay, so the picture we want to draw is in C. Is in C. Okay, so proof of key fact. Is that what I called it? Okay, so here's C. And then I have these two curves, A and B that might be far apart. And then I also have tau. Tau carries A and B, right? We're assuming that tau has index K, index less than, index greater than K, and it carries, carries A and B. Let's throw some. Here is n b that's our assumption, okay? So, tau is somewhere, let's say here in the curved graph, and then I can also form a splitting sequence from tau to a. A is carried by tau, so by the exercise, there is a splitting sequence that I can perform on tau to get to a track where A is embedded. And in particular, this A is going to be a vertex cycle of that. And so that means that the picture is something like this. The picture is something like this. You know, my splitting process is going to give you something like a geodesic, it'll be a quasi-geodesic, it goes from tau to a, yeah, and I can do the same with b okay, like this. And then I also have this geodesic from A to B. Okay, well, these two are quasi-geodes, and then the geodesic from A to B, of course, is a geodesic. And so this triangle is thin. The thin triangle, because C is hyperbolic. It's a thin triangle. But this, you know, going from tau to A, we're splitting this track of index greater than K. So all the curves carried by tau are joined by an edge in CK. So in CK, this is small. So this whole geodesic, quasi-geodesic goes to bounded diameter set, diameter one or something in CK. So this is rounded. So, this is grounded in CK by definition. All these things, all these vertex cycles along the way, they're all carried by tau, and tau is index greater than k, so it all gets electrified. And likewise, this one, okay? But each of these points on this geodesic is within a bounded distance of one of these. And so its image is also bounded because this map is Lipschitz, right? The map from C to C. From C to CK is Lipschitz. So if I'm bounded distance away from some set that goes to a bounded set, then I'm a bounded set. Yeah? Is that okay? Yeah. All right. So they're all hyperbolic and we sort of understand what the boundary is. If you know what the boundary of C is, then you can guess what the boundary of CK is going to be. But maybe in the interest of time, let me not go into that. Time, let me not go into that. Um, okay, so uh, I'd like to prove that the uh that C0 is a quasi-definitely Okay, so theorem, I can see zero second. And this should give you a flavor for how most of these arguments go, but there are many complications for the general case. Okay, so here we need a couple of facts. One is so we need, okay, so one, this is the Manning's. So, this is the Manning's bottleneck criterion. This is how we can tell that the space is a quasi tree. Okay, so let's say x is a graph with the usual metric where every edge has length one. And I'd like to know that x is a quasi. So, suppose delta is some number. Multi-assembled number given. And for every two vertices, say xy in x naught, so these are vertices, there is a path, a particular path p of x, y with the property that such that for any other path from x to y, so that for any other path. Take Q from X to Y. This path P is contained in the delta neighborhood of Q. So in the tree, you would take, I don't know, there is A, there is B, X and Y. You would take just the geodesic from X to Y. And then any path from X. Any path from x to y inside the tree will have to cover that geodesic. So delta is zero here. And if this is a quasi-tree, then you have to, so you just think of a quasi-tree as being some kind of a thickening of a tree or something. So then you still have to, there's no way to avoid passing close to a point on this geodesic. You know, there's some delta so that you can't miss the delta ball. Okay, that's a. That's one thing. Okay. The other one is something that goes back to the work of Mazer and Minsky. It's called the nesting lemma. It's about train tracks. Oops. Oh, well, it's gone now. Okay. Okay. So the Mazeminsky testing one. And I'm going to only state a special case because we're really concerned with C0. And in C0, we are electrifying all train tracks that are not maximal, right? The maximal train track is one with the maximal dimension of P of tau. And that you should be thinking of that as all complementary regions are. Of that, is all complementary regions are triangles. If you have like a quadrilateral, then you could add another branch, and that would increase that will increase the dimension of p of tau. Okay, so if tau is if tau is a maximal train track and the curve A is fully carried, fully carried means that it crosses every branch. Crosses every branch. Okay, then, and if B intersect A is empty, so B is the show in A, well, that's going to imply that B is carried. In other words, if you imagine the sequence in C, so I'm just doing one step at a time. You have a curve, and then I go to the joint curve, another joint curve, and so on. To the joint curve, another joint curve, and so on. And in the beginning, the you know, the curve is carried. Well, maybe at the end, it's not carried. Well, the last time it's carried, you know, you have a last curve that's carried that says that it's not fully carried. There's going to be some branch that doesn't cross. Before you can step off of the train track, so to speak, you first have to step off some branch. Okay, that's the nesting lemma. That's the nesting lemma. You might ask why it's called the nesting lemma. There's what's nesting here, but that's for another day. Okay. All right, so now we're ready for the proof. Proof of the theorem, of this theorem. I don't know, is that theorem two? There was no theorem one. Proof of theorem two. Okay, so I have to check that a C0 is a quality. I have to check that the C0 is a quasi, so I'm going to use the bottleneck criterion. So you give me two vertices, so let's say A and B C 0 0 be two vertices. I won't tell you what delta is until the end. Something is going to tell you for you about it. Okay, so I need to construct a path between them. Okay, now there is a fact that I also didn't mention. Fact that I also didn't mention, but any two curves are carried by some maximal track. Any two curves in the surface. So there is a maximal track. That's also not very hard to prove. A track. Oh, that carries both A and B. You can actually construct a train track carrying both A and B by taking the union of A and B and any. By taking the union of A and B, and any time you see an intersection between A and B, you smooth it out in a particular way. You decide which one comes first. So let's say here is A, here is B. And then you decide that A should be turning right and B should be turning left. So you just make a little surgery here, like this. And that's going to give you a train track that carries both A and B. Maximal with respect to that property. Well, this one might not be maximal. So, this is sort of the you see the relationship between Ursula's definition and our definition, because if there's an eight-gon in the complement of A and B, then that's going to say that in the complement of the taintrex, you see a foregone, foregone. Because half of the terms are going to be smooth, so it's going to be foregone. So, it's not going to be maximal in that case, but you can add some branches. But you can add some branches and make it maximum. Okay, so that's the starting point. And so I want to again draw a picture in C. Okay, the pictures in C, but there's also sort of a parallel picture in C0 that you can map this to C zero. But for the moment, let's say it's in C. So I have A and B here, and I have tau that carries both. And I have tau that carries both. And now I don't want to just nilly-willy take some kind of a splitting sequence from tau to a. I want to be somewhat efficient. I want to start splitting tau as long as I can and still carry both a and b. Okay, so sometimes you can split and still carry both and b and then you know, so this is tau prime. So this is the, so split tau as long as you can. And still carry and b. So say the split tau to tau prime. Okay, so here's my tau prime. And now from tau prime, there's nothing better I can do. I'm just going to take my splitting sequences to A and then to B. I can't be efficient anymore. Okay, so you see a path now between A and B, right? There is a path. There is a path that passes through tau prime. So there's a sequence of vertex cycles here and a sequence of vertex cycles here. So this is my preferred path. So define P of AB to be the path the path obtained by concatenating. Splitting sequences from L prime to A and to B. Okay? So I have this path and I have this path. So my preferred path goes through tau prime, meaning a vertex cycle of tau prime. Okay. And I can project that to see to see. That to CK. So that also gives me a path in CK. Now I have to show that if I take any other path from A to B, then this path will have to come close to every single point on this path. Okay, so let Q be a path in C0 from A to B. Okay, now it's a path in C0. Okay, now it's a path in C0, so that means it's not really a path in C. You know, in C, I could be making big jumps, but that's no big deal because of that little property that we just proved that you can interpolate. You can interpolate a geodesic between two points in Q, in this path Q that are far apart in C. And that's not going to change my image path very much, right? It'll just add something bounded. So I can assume I can. No, I can. So, after interpolating relating geodesics, we may assume Q is a path in C, not just C0. So, consecutive curves are actually disjoint. Okay. Okay, so now let's prove that this path Q has to come close to every single vertex. Well, tau prime is a little bit weird, but tau prime, of course, is distance one from some other vertex. And I'm just going to show that every other vertex has to be close to some point on Q. So take some, let's say, take this one here. So this is some train track tau A that's on the way between tau prime and A. I'm splitting tau prime towards A. Tau prime towards A, and tau A somewhere along the way. I have to show that my path Q comes close to tau A. Okay, so let tau A, tau A not equal to tau prime be on, well, tau, tau prime A. On this path that they have, this is, well, I don't mean geodesic here, but you know, whatever the sub path. Here, but you know, whatever the subpath of P of A B. Okay, tau A. Okay, so I'm looking at this path Q, and the very first curve in that path is A, and it's carried by tau A. First curve is carried. The last curve is B, and it's not carried because it's past tau prime. So I can't split and still carry both. So it must be that B is not carried here. Okay, so we have a path. Okay, so we have a path just like in the nesting lemma. We have a path towards the maximal train track. We have a path that starts out at a curve that's carried and ends at a curve that's not carried. So somewhere along the way, there has to be a curve that's not fully carried, that's carried out by a subtract. So there is some curve X in Q that is carried by. Carried by tau A, but not fully. So by the nesting lemma. This is the nesting lemma. Okay, but now we're done, right? Because this X is carried by a proper subtract of tau, which is not maximal, because it's a subtract of tau. And that subtract was electrified. So this X. So, this x is within distance one of a vertex cycle of that subject, which is, of course, also a vertex cycle of tau. So, x is within distance one in C zero of a vertex cycle of a subtract. Of a subtract. If I take a train track of index greater than zero, meaning not maximal, then all curves carried by that train track are electrified. So any two of them are going to be distance one. So this x is within distance one of a vertex cycle of that train track, which is some kind of a short curve. You know, it crosses every branch at most points. And that curve is also then a vertex cycle of Tau itself. vertex cycle of tau itself it's one of the one of those finitely many curves that we are counting as vertex cycles so we've shown that x is bounded distance from tau from tau a right tau a really uh represents the vertex cycle of tau a so we've shown that this x so i don't know anything about this path but uh well in fact in c who knows what's happening but uh we found this curve x that in c zero is close to tau a so this is you know close in tau a So this is you know, closed in Thai way. In in in C0, sorry. Yeah, does that make sense? So if you the nesting lemma says that if you have yeah, it's a and b. So I'm looking at this path q that starts at a and ends at b and then and then there are all kinds of other curves in between. Curves in between. Well, so I can apply the nesting lemma to any two consecutive curves in this. So maybe A is fully carried, maybe the next one is fully carried, and so on. Well, at some point, you have to get to a curve that's not fully carried. It's carried, but not fully carried. Because B is not carried at all. Before you get to the curve that's not carried at all, you first have to get to a curve that's carried but not fully. That's what the nesting lemma says. So if I look at the last curve carried, last curve. Carried, last curve carried, then that curve cannot be carried fully. Because if it is carried fully, the next one will be carried in well by the nesting one. Okay, so that's that's my x. Okay, this x is carried by a proper subtract, which is not maximal. And so it's close in C0, it's close to any other curve carried by that subtract, in particular, the vertex cycle. The vertex cycle. And so these in C0, these two curves, these two points are actually close. Okay? And so that's it. That's the proof. So delta here is something like, I don't know, two or three or something. Okay. Any other questions about the Any other questions about this is the main proof here, so you should yell at me if I didn't explain something well. Okay, so how do you get at the fibers? How do you see that? Well, there is a more complicated version of this. So you have to prove that. So there is a more general version of the nesting lemma that applies to train territories that are not maximal. And then the main thing is we actually have to. thing is we actually have to we have to have a criterion for um when a splitting sequence of tracks of index k makes progress in ck that's really what the nesting lemma is about that's why it's called nesting because you you know it makes progress if there's somehow nested that's sort of the main technical part of the paper that you know proving this criterion for when um when the splitting sequence makes progress in ck that depends on k so for example you can have pseudonasops So, for example, you can have pseudonosophs that, of course, all pseudonasops are loxodromic in C, but they might not be loxodromic in the C case. Like in C0, the ones that are loxodromic are the ones whose stable lamination has only triangles in the component. If you have something else, like a quadrilateral, that's going to be elliptic in C0. Maybe it's more useful to give a little bit of philosophy here instead of giving Instead of giving more about the proof. So for mapping class groups, there's another complex that people study, namely the arc complex. That's when surfaces punctures. And so let's say A. Maybe I don't have time to define, but I think people maybe seen the definition. So So, this philosophy of disintegration doesn't apply just to C. You can, you know, here we, you know, C was complicated and we wanted to disintegrate it into these quasi-trees. Well, you can also think about disintegrating the R complex. And in fact, this has already been done by Fujivara and Schleimer. So they show that you. So they show that you can do something like this. There's some kind of a tower of this sort, AN, and then this is really, it's quasi-asymmetric to C. And I want to say coarse fibers are going to be like curved complexes of subsurfaces. So, of course, everything is the same, everything is hyperbolic here, but coarse fibers. Here, of course, fibers are curved graphs of subsurfaces. So, one, you know, I sort of care about asymptotic dimension, and this makes it clear that asymptotic dimension of the arc complex is finite if you believe that asymptotic dimensions of curve complexes are finite. By, you know, there's some kind of a fact in asymptotic dimension theory that these kind of bundle maps, you know, if you have this, you know, so. If you have this suitable map, then the dimension of the source is bounded by the dimension of the target plus the dimension of the fibers. And likewise, the disintegrating curve graph also tells you that the curve graph is finite as an diagnostic. So the philosophy here is that you should be able to decompose in this way, in this tower fashion, any kind of naturally arising hyperbolic object that should be decomposable in this way. Should be decomposable in this way into simpler objects. Like here, here are the simpler objects are curved graphs. And then over here, they're quasitries. The same philosophy also works for outfn. There are more spaces there. There's a free splitting complex, and there's cyclic splitting complex, and then there's a free factor complex. And you could conjecture the same thing. Uh, conjecture the same thing, and in fact, over here, this this has been done. This is the well, it's not posted, but it's my work with Mark Fein where the coarse fibers are FZs of you know, some relative FZs. There are some versions of FZs, just like over here, they're curved graphs of subsurfaces. So, anyway, it's a good philosophy. All right, so I think I'll stop here a couple minutes away. Sorry. Really, a very nice question. But what can you do with these integrated? Well, I like it. So, I mean, one thing is it's immediate that these symplatic dimensions is not only finite, but you also get expensive. Mentioned is not only finite, but you also get explicit bounds that are probably best known anyway. But I just like the concept of, you know, the C is not an atom, right? It's going to be decomposed further. Everything is quasi-trees. That's the real philosophy. Would you expect that an argument like that is going to work for CK as well? Well, CK is not a quasitree. It's these fibers that are quasi trees. So the dimension, as in the dimension, goes up. So the dimension, asymptotic dimension goes up hopefully by one. We don't know how to prove that, but that's also, I guess, a conjecture that every time you increase k, the osmotic dimension goes up by one. It's a bundle with quasi-trees as fibers. So the dimension should go up by one. We don't know how to prove that. So it's like a well, less than or equal. Less than or equal is immediate. Less than or equal, less than or equal is immediate, but uh, that it's actually equal, that we don't know, yeah, yeah. So, do you expect it can be like the central radiance is the right to something simpler? Well, there's nothing simpler in quasity, right? That's that's somehow that's the real atom, that's the real atom. Yeah, of this weather for uh I I haven't thought about it, but yeah. I haven't thought about it, but yes, I'm sure I'd be shocked if it wasn't. Yeah, I mean, we use a lot of train track tools. So I'm not sure what, I mean, yeah, yeah, no, I don't know how to do it just with curves. All right, let's take a look at it. All right, so we're going to have to go to the
