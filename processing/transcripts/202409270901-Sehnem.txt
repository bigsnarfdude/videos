E is every non-zero idea on the crossfather intersects this star with A. And G has one zero interstitial A. Or equivalent every representation of the plasmoda which is phase one A is phase of the polygon space. And I'm also interested in primarily. And of course, if you want the system to be prime, we need to require something of all the actions. As much as we need to require minimality when you want the cospodorse to be simple. So we say that A is G prime. A is G prime if every Q non-zero design radius of A have non-zero intersection and I'll be also interested in the interaction. And I'll be also interesting pussy sequences that I will do later in my mention on Monday and how they relate to each other beyond these two properties. I think they are very useful tools on this idea of the problem of the cosmology. Let me give you some nice properties of the cultivary polynomial. Property is by the original definition of food and bag. By the original definition of Fusenberg, this is the universal G-boundary. Meaning that the action is the compact space, the action is strongly plausible and minimal in the degree solid space. And Caroline Kinnis proves that this can be identified as the initial jet in a lot of complex numbers. And for example, this has And for example, it has mass properties, which is genius. Gene active means it can enact objects in the category of operating system interaction and unicam of the deposit maps. And also, this enjoys a G energy. GDT, which is every equivalent UCPI because this hour must be completely isolated. And I'm pretty sure that's called. I'm pretty sure that's called rigidity, which is a very nice property, is a very refined music map, which is the self map is the identity map. And this was part of the identification of this with the ch injected envelope numbers. First, introducing in a series of work by Hamilton. Uh G is C type sq, meaning that the reducing group is not simple. The action when we push the back boundary is topological three. And third, because colour, like this action piece. And this gave a very nice A very nice characterization, dynamical characterization of case class simplicity. And it was not known for some time whether this was equivalent to the unique physical. And Bulan, Carlencan, Kennedy, and Osawa, they do that they gave a characterization of unique trace properties and proved in particular that sister simple would have unique trace properties. But the cover is not too in general. The first examples were In general, the first examples were by Levu. The following, simple. And normally everybody uses the map is economical, meaning that the conditional is economic. The conditional expectation of the phase of conditional expectation. And so we cannot characterize simplicity with the traces, but if you enlarge the polynomial and if you allow the range to be in the gene-checked envelope, we have a characterization of the integration of and these are pursued expectations in this case. Let me go back to no complex setting. We have action C alpha A and I G of A is the G inject envelope Okay, I of A this is a bit of inject angle up or the G inject angle upwards the actual position. And existence can make important tokens improved by these have enjoyed similar properties as Mr. Bagbar with respect to complex numbers. So we change essentiality, but with A instead of complex numbers, they are compatible. And absolute expectations. So an equivalent use equivalent. He is absolute expectation if his idea is already and there is always a canonical opposite expectation which is Positive expectation, which is again the phase four point expectation point A. And here it is half-housard, it proves that the action has the ideal intercession property if only if everybody pursued the expectations face. And they also gave some conditions that are sufficient sometimes that people get into discussion. Whenever you have a non-hanonic colour, Expectation. And we always have an enemy implementing the action. A also mission. And because these algebras have all the decomposition, we can always have a Python result. And more recently, Jeffen and Usu they gave a characterization of simplicity for minimal actions of C hypersynthogroup. And along the way, they gave a characterization of formality for minimal actions. So that G V. GB minimum the following and equivalent a cross product is not running and I will say closing the contributor center then third And third, there exists some element. In the FC center of the group, many have finite finite quadrant classes, which is not the identity, and a non-zero center projection in A and a unitary coin. Such that this unity type implements the action of the corner and sticks or element which is a decentralized object. And they also, in the separate case, they could reduce with these two conditions of A. And in the case the group is FC hypocenter, is a result by Esther Hoff that for a minimal action, primarily is equivalent to the idea to simplicity, which is the same as the ideal decision. Combining the schemes of unconcerned choice. They also prove different methods. Different metrics. Along the way, they also prove that the action here has a unique sort of expectation that it has great use. And So we get a characterization of primality final arbitrary actions. So suppose Hi in the following equivalent cross product is not fine. And now we need the exact angle of the cross product. So this is not a factor. This has a figure center. And now transition is there is this particle which is. Which is P, G, B, G, and H, where P is again a non-zero second projection. So I understand in terms of A, and you can understand how what this means in terms of terms of G of A of A and all the three strengths of A. But here it is about the center projection, which is A. And G is an objective element and UG is a unit idea in the corner and H is a supigroup of G, not necessarily normal, such that We have the following properties. First, this element implements the action on the coordinate, alpha G. Okay, and second, G has finally finite conjugate classes with H. H h. And we have alpha H U G is equal to U G whenever H then I write is using H and also the symbolize of G and third we have when you apply that to When you apply the actual different classes, they are designed. So we always have alpha t P is a characteristic function of A B. So alpha P E G. This means in particular that this corner is invited on the H and every different class has been moving around, in particular the element G has to be. But if the element G has to be H. So let me tell you how this means. So here, this is equivalent to have a regular ideal in A V, which means that right here. And here they paper the other kind of the life information action. For example, in the case of a commutative system algebraic, this is called his function of radio or s. And on this ideal H, the actions are. And here, all this means is that the ideal J is H minus and we have a distance. Which do not depend on any representative, they are mutually worked over now in the unit. Which if I we are assuming that on a G prime, then it has to be essential. If you apply this in the commutative setting, this is really a sister analog proposal. Really assisted, I'm another proposal from Stefan Weiss on for nine algebra, which I'll see if we can restate. Suppose you have a more simple action on a standard chromatic state, then the following are equivalent what One, the closed product is a factor. And second, whenever if H is a summary group of G, and we have an inherent model set such that This form additional partition and we need also elabority. Then the following holds partition up to start of measure zero. The following holes. Uh whenever an element acts cheaply, then it must have infinite H, conjugacy classes under H. And if you're applying here for a commit that you sent you might be guide a. For commuter hemocentrism, we get R, and here there is a set property in this couple. And we also prove for FSC hypocentric group that ideal concession property is equivalent to uniqueness of pseudo-expectation. And in the case, we have, and it's also characterized ideal decision property. That case, the disruption is not hold. And in the issue-minded case, it's equivalent to MIT not to be cross-factor. That's all. Thank you. Crystal. That's all. Thank you. Any questions for Kotlin? So the condition 3 is very concrete, and so that's a neat characterization. But then the weight is on how to know that this G prime, because that refers to the Samana injected boundary, if I if I remember correctly. No, right now G prime is. No, no, no, the G prime of the G prime of A, what then I misunderstood? So G primes of A means that A cannot have two nuclear tobacco invariant ideas, which means that A cannot have an invariant idea which is big like there is no reference anymore to that to that. Yeah, yeah, we just uh we have just for the pursuit expectation. Just for the pursuit expectation, but you're right. There is no here we can refer just to F A, and if you can use results of Russo and Giffen, then you can also have this function in terms of A in the case A and for the pursuit expectation, then because of C high percentage, then you do have this, you do need Hamanabound. And equivalent pursuit expectations equivalent to the constraint. Then there the Hamana value shows up. But there is a statement that doesn't refer at all to buy me. It doesn't prefer at all from IAS really in terms of great technique for for going from IA is A, for that top of the right board. That was pioneered by Gaffer Manders in that big now. It just becomes a little more tech purpose. And related to the thing that I posted on Net Overflow, I would like to advertise with uh Ulan and a few students here uh both of us wrote in that. And both of us wrote in the because, of course, this is an example of a groupoid for Nehemian algebra, and they introduced a very actual notion of what a groupoid, what is an ICC groupoid. And then it becomes very neat when we are cross-product is a factor, even on mute, this group is ICC. Yeah, and I know, of course, yeah. Can I ask just to sort of put it into context, so the other result of Geffen and Bernso, there's definitely some overlap in the characterizations. So when, so obviously when you have a minimal action, then this is reduced to, this reduced to their result? Yes, yes. You can the element here, you can take a unitarian here. Here, you can show that the because the action is minimal, this you force the element to be F C because when you come here, if the specter is compact and you come with the support of the trajectory and fixed orbits, because the action is minimal, you have finitely many orbits covering all this space. And this will force the energy to be up to C. And can I ask just And can I ask, just because I'm not used to working with G prime this, can you give me an example of a C star algebra that's not prime but is G prime with respect to an action? When you have the action with minimal, for example. Okay, and not minimal too. Let me see. I guess, yeah, in terms of dynamics, right? You just take some creative space. Clearly, that's very important. Very far from file. As long as G moves the points around about, you're not going to have trivial intersection open subsets of G action. Invariant of the G-action means. So just like topologically transitivity? For example. No, you can have something for dense environmental geometry. Probably if you want like a more concrete example, take K of H plus K of H and then unitize the whole thing and have an action that swaps those two K of H's around. Inches around. Yeah, there's only like three ideas in the whole thing. Much easier to check for sure.
