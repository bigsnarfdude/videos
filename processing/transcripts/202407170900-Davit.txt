All right. So first I'd like to thank the organizers for this wonderful workshop and apologize I wasn't able to make it in person at the last minute. I hear Banff is beautiful this time of year. I can see a few trees through the windows. I guess that will have to do. So today what I'm going to talk about is Talk about is the role of localized stress structures in viscoelastic flows through porous media. That's work that was done by my PhD student, Omar Mokhtari, in collaboration with Jean-Claude Lacher and Michel Cantar. So I think it's the first time I feel that I attend a conference and all the concepts that I need and the example of That I need and the example of applications have already been repeated time and presented previously. So I'm going to focus on the scientific questions that we are interested in. One of the small miracles that happen when you put polymers in an otherwise Newtonian fluid and you flow that through a porous medium is that you observe an increase in resolution. An increase in resistance to flow. And there are many experiments showing that. One of the latest ones is this experiment by the group of SUJID Data looking at a flow in a polyacrylamide solution flow in a beat packing at basically, let's say, zero Reynolds number to simplify the situation. And looking at the evolution of the pressure drop and reconstructing in this way, In this way, the apparent viscosity as a function of, let's say, the flow rate, and observing this increase in the apparent viscosity, this increase in resistance to flow. And that's the first question I would like to address today. It's like, what are the mechanisms that drive this increase in resistance? This increase in resistance to flow. The second question that I'd like to look at is instabilities in this type of system. And that's the second small miracle that happens is that when you put polymers and flow that through a porous medium, you observe very complicated spatial temporal dynamics and that going all the way towards elastic turbulence. Elastic turbulence. And I just want to show you some of the recent microfluidic experiments that were done on that topic. So the one on the left, I'm going to start with this one. Both look at flow in these arrays of cylindrical pillars that are in black on the one on the left and in white on the one, the video on the right. And on the video on the left, you're going to see the evolution of the magnitude of the velocity. Of the magnitude of the velocity field and the time fluctuations, and you see this beautiful preferential flow path that form that change direction. You see these kind of coherent structures of flow path forming that like these beautiful dynamics. Similar situation, different solution on the right, but similar configuration, looking this time at the birefringence. At the birefringence of the polymer solution and seeing this kind of flapping movement in the wake of each synanda. And of course, there are many different regimes when you get at these flows. And so one of the second question that I'd like to talk about is trying to understand what controls these complicated dynamics. Complicated dynamics. So, the way we approached this problem was using high-performance computing simulations of the flow to look at these two questions. And before we jump in, the porous media configuration, I would like to first tell you a little bit about how we do the simulations, the type of equations that we solve, and just give you a few. And just give you a few preliminary comments and simple results that will help us understand what's going on in Porse Media. So you've also seen these equations many times. So what we solve are all droid and Finny type models. So you have the first equation, which is the momentum transport equation, which is basically a simple. Equation, which is basically similar to Navier-Stokes equation, but with an additional component to the stress, that's the stop E. You have mass conservation, which is here written in the form of divergence of u r equals zero. And then you have a transport equation for something that's called the conformation tensor. You have a transport part on the left-hand side of the equal sign, which is the hyperbolic transport part. You have the first. About. You have the first term on the right-hand side, which is the coupling with the flow, which is inducing the stretching and change in orientation of the polymers. And the last term is the relaxation towards equilibrium. And depending on the relationship that you use between topi between the stress and the conformation tensor, you have these range of different models, including the Ol-Rogby model, for instance, the Phine P, the Phineas. For instance, the FiniP, the Finicia. Mostly, what I'll show today are all rod B simulations and Finicia simulation, and that's just because at steady states, you then have a shear viscosity that's constant, and that kind of removes one of the problems, which is a very interesting one. But this is not what I want to look at today. Something else that I'll use through this presentation is. This presentation is the stretching field for the polymers, and the metric for that is the trace of the conformation tensor. So keep that in mind. So we developed our own code to solve this problem. There are different reasons. One of them is that we wanted to develop our own numerical scheme. So I won't get in the details of exactly what we did. Details of exactly what we did. You have the reference paper that's indicated, but I will give you the ideas. And the ideas are a staggered projection scheme, which has several important properties. The first one is that it maintains the conformation tensor symmetric and positive definites. It satisfies also a discrete equivalent of a free energy estimate. It has good. Estimates, it has good accuracies through something that looks like a log confirmation approach, but that's not used in the standard way. It can easily be adapted to a range of different constitutive models for viscoelastic flows, and it's well suited to high-performance computing, and in particular because it's implemented in a C. In a CFD code that's developed at the Institute of Nuclear Safety in France, and that's perfectly built for HPC. So what's going on? So our working hypothesis, and I think you've heard about this several times already since the beginning of the workshop. Already, since the beginning of the workshop, you'll probably hear about this again. But our working hypothesis is that one of the important factors controlling these flows is stress localization. And let me give you an example of what this can look like. You have on the top images of experiments of viscoelastic flow on a simple cylinder, and you see that in And you see that in the wake of this cylinder, particularly at the high Weisenberg number, in the high Weisenberg number case, you form these very, very long structures that are often called birefringent strands and where the polymers are really, really stretched and the stress, also the polymeric stress is very high. And this form at the At two points on the two stagnation points on the cylinder, and basically to simplify things, and are transported then in the wake of cylinders. And then at the bottom, just to show you an example of one of our simulations in 2D of this type of structures. So you recognize these trends, but they are a lot more complicated. But they are a lot more complicated in this case. And so, one of the first things we did is actually look at a very, very simple case, kind of come back to one cylinder, two cylinders, etc. Look at the literature to try to better understand the link in particular between these trends and the velocity field, the impact of these trends on the velocity field. And I'm going to try to very roughly To very roughly summarize some of the results in the literature and some of our simulations to try to give you an intuitive sense of how they behave in the flow and how they modify the velocity field. So the first point, if you look at flow on a simple cylinder, so you have the strain that forms in the wake, as I showed before. And if you look at the velocity field, you have If you look at the velocity field, you have this asymmetry that forms where in the wake of the cylinder, you slow down the flow a lot. And actually, you can show that on most of the strand length, it's not true close to the cylinder, but it's true on most of the strand. The strand acts as a line distribution of force that opposes the flow. Second point: if you have several cylinders that are aligned with the flow, That are aligned with the flow, as in point two. You'll see that this new type of structures that form is not a single strand. It looks like the strands, you have two strands and now wrapping around the obstacles. And that actually acts as a barrier to the flow. If you look at the velocity field between these cylinders, you have very small flow. You can have vortices, for instance, but very small velocity. Very, very at very small velocities. And so, there's this idea that somehow they act as a barrier to the flow. Third point: if you put cylinders side by side and this periodic boundary condition, so initially you have a preferential flow path that's going above and below the two cylinders that you see. And you tend to amplify that as you increase the Vice. That as you increase the Weissenberg number. So basically, if you add flow going above the cylinders, you form these trends that they get close to each other and they tend to block the flow between the two cylinders. Okay, so that's the third idea, which they tend to amplify existing preferential flow path. And the fourth point is we've noticed that. We've noticed that they also tend to be sticky. So, for instance, if you have a strand stuck to another obstacle and you change the flow angle, it's very hard to unstick it from the other cylinder. And you can create hysteresis for, for instance, like this by varying the angle of the flow. So, there is this very wrong, it's probably very wrong, but let me tell you anyway. Wrong, but let me tell you anyway. So, an idea that you can, a way that you can think about it, is think about it as almost an elastic strand that's sticky, and that will help you understand what I say in the remainder of this presentation. All right, now that we've got all the techniques and some of the important results on simple configurations, let's Let's look at what happens in Porsche Media and with the first question that I told you about, which is what generates the increase in resistance to flow. And so let's go back to this type of simulation in 2D Porks media. So you have the colon on the left, which is the trace of the conformation tensor, and the column on the right, that's the normalized velocity. The right that's the normalized velocity field for two different Weissenberg number. And can you see my mouse? Yes. So if you look at the velocity field, you have very interesting things happening that I think you can interpret in terms of the simple configuration that I just showed you. So let me start with this big channel that you have here in the low-base undercase. And if you look at what's happening in And if you look at what's happening in the higher bicep case, you see that you kind of split this channel in two where you have this massive strand that has formed. If you look, for instance, here, you had a flow path, right? That was not the main flow path. You have a higher velocity here or here, for instance, but you had a flow path here, and it's completely. Path here, and it's completely disappeared in this case because of the strand, a small strand that's blocking the path. So, this is where you tend to amplify existing flow paths. And if you look at the two velocity fields here, you can see that very well, where you can see that you tend to form smaller flow channels with a higher velocity in this case. Something else that you see. Something else that you see is that if you have clusters of cylinders, like here, for instance, this tend to be wrapped by strands. And if you remember that it acts as a barrier to the flow, then you see that here you also don't have any flow inside the clusters where you had a little flow initially. And so, one of the things that becomes fairly obvious, especially if you look at the distribution. Especially if you look at the distribution of the velocity in this case in the longitudinal direction, but you can do it on the magnitude of the velocity too. Is that you modify, as you increase the Weisenberg number, you modify this distribution. And in particular, you tend to generate higher maximum velocities. So you see that as you increase the Weissenberg number, you go from the blue curve to the black curve. And if you look at what's going on at very low velocity, What's going on at very low velocity, close to zero? This is this zoom here. You also tend to amplify stagnation, so zones that are close to velocity, um, that's zero. And that's that goes back to the effects that I was showing you, which is amplifying the preferential flow path and at the same time creating more stagnation zones, in particular, while you have these trends wrapping around multiple obstacles. And one of the questions we were interested in is: well, so we see that the existence of the strands, these localized stress structures tend to modify the flow. They tend to reorganize the flow, redistribute the flow. And so we were wondering what was the effect on the flow resistance. One way to look at this, which is something you've already seen. Already seen in other talks done a bit differently, but that's the same idea, is to look at this from an energetic point of view. And so if you manipulate your L Roy B equations, zero Reynolds number, you can end up with an energetic balance that looks like this. On the left-hand side, you have the integral of the time derivative of the Um, time derivative of the Helmholtz free energy. It's kind of it has a let's say a potential energy components, which is the trace of C minus identity. And then you have this log of C, which is the entropy. And then on the right-hand side, you have dissipation, which is this term. And you have a source that comes from just the way we impose the flow, which is by having imposing a macro. Having imposing a macroscopic pressure gradients in the momentum transport equation. And what's interesting is that if you look at the terms that you have in this dissipation term, you have this component here. That's the normal viscous dissipation, the solvent viscous dissipation. And then you have a second component, which is this expression right here that comes from Expression right here that comes from what's happening inside, mostly inside the strands, right? Because this is going to get really big when the trace of C is actually very large. Okay, so you have these two components and you can link that if you assume that you have a you can describe flow by a macroscopic equation that's some form of Darcy's law, which is which is written right here. We'll see a Here we'll see a hydraulic resistance. Then you can write this hydraulic resistance in terms of the ratio between dissipation and some kind of macroscopic kinetic energy. And you can decompose that into two components. One that's the viscous dissipation, and the other one that's what's happening in the strains. And in the simulation, you can look at exactly how that behaves. So you have Behaves. So you have the normalized version of the hydraulic resistance, which is this curve right here. You see that it increases dramatically when you start reaching a Weisen number of the order of one. But more importantly, what you see is that you can decompose that into the two components that I was telling you about: the viscous dissipation and the effect of the strands. In most of our simulations, these are similar. Of our simulation, these are similar order of magnitude. And so, what that tells us is that the increase in resistance to flow comes from two effects. One is you have the strands reorganize the flow through the structure, and in doing so, they create preferential flow path where the normal viscous dissipation, the solvent viscous dissipation increases a lot. And the second part is that you. Part is that you have an increase in the rate of entropy production inside the strands themselves due to the presence of the polymers. And these two components are important in understanding the increase in resistance to flow. This is at steady state, and that's interesting because there is recent work which is. Recent work, which is the work that I was showing you in the introduction. And there are some people in the conference working on that. So looking at the impact of temporal fluctuations. And when you have another aspect that needs to be taken into account is, of course, that when you have a temporal fluctuation, if you do a decomposition that's similar to a Reynolds decomposition, then you have an additional component to the macros. additional component to the macroscopic stress that comes from this fluctuation and it plays a role in in the in in the in the pressure drop but what's interesting is that our work show our work shows that you don't need that to have an increase in resistance to flow you have an increase in resistance to flow even a steady state before any type of um elastic turbulence happens and um so i think it's an interesting question to know like the the relative effect of uh The relative effect of the relative contribution of these two effects, and like when you transition from one being dominating to the other, etc. So, I think that's an interesting perspective. Another thing is that you've probably noticed that you've mostly seen 2D simulations on viscoelastic flows, and the very good reason for that is that it's very, very difficult to do 3D computations. It's really, really computing. Is really, really computationally expensive. So, we've done some simulation at steady states in different types of bitpackings. Very recent results, so I'm going to go really fast. But what's intriguing is that you see this, the patterns of trace of C here, of what I call stress localization, is very different. And so, it raises, I think, interesting questions as to the role of these patterns. As to the role of these patterns in controlling dissipation and also stability. And that brings me to the second part of this talk. And I'm going to go really fast through it because it's getting late. We want to have five minutes questions. You have two minutes for the second part if you want to have questions. So the starting point. So the starting points are these experiments by in the group of Jeffrey Guasto and Simon Howard and Amy Chen. And the first set of the first paper that came out is this one, basically showing that if you disorder this hexagonal pattern of cylinders, you tend, which is what you see in this line, you tend to reduce the temporal fluctuation and delay the transition. And delay the transition to chaos. Okay. And then there's this second paper that came out about one year later looking at a slightly different pattern, looking at what I call the staggered case and the aligned case, which is just a rotation by pi over 6, and showing that the situation is completely different in this case. And that if you look at the aligned case, first you delay the transition compared to the target case. Compared to the stargate case, you need much higher Weiss and Mary number to transition to have important temporal fluctuations. And also that you have the opposite effect where if you introduce disorder in the pattern, you transition faster. And so that was, we found that intriguing because it's very similar patterns and we were wondering what's going on. And let me show you very rapidly some of the simulation we did. So in the staggered case, for instance, the first For instance, the first instability that we found, you're going to see it on these images here, you find you have these trends, and you see this like kind of what I describe as flapping behavior. And that's really the first sensibility that we saw. And this is very sensitive to the symmetry of this. So if you disorder the position of the cylinder in this case, you tend to remove this instability and you actually tend to And you actually tend to stabilize the flow. You have a range of different regimes that I'm not describing, but I'll describe in the paper if you're interested. If you look at the aligned case, you have a pattern of stress localization that's completely different. You form these type of envelopes, and these are very, very stable. Okay. And actually, what happens, we found if you introduce disorder, is that you Disorder is that you reduce the number of envelopes and you tend to destabilize. And we think that this explains the difference that you see in the experiment. So I'm out of time already. So let me just rapidly wrap up. So I talked about in the steady state situation, increase of resistance to flow, showing that you have two components that contribute to this increase. One is the solvent. Is the solvent viscous dissipation due to the reorganization of the flow? And the second one is what's happened in the strands and the stretching of the polymers in the strands. And in the second part of the talk, what I introduce is this idea that what controls this spatial temporal dynamics could be the stability of these patterns of localized stress. And let me leave you with the experiments. The experiments on the left for the velocity field, some of our simulation on the right-hand side. And hoping you also see some similarities in this behavior. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks very much for the talk. It's very interesting. One question actually about about your
