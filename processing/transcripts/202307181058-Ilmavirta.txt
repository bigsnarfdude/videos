which is unfortunate for here, but I'm also going to speak for all of us. So I'll start with a quick overview of what the big picture of the thing is that I want to achieve here. So previously in New York Problems, non-linearity helps and non-locality helps. We've seen examples of these in the past. So these have been issues, but now they have become something useful. And now in this episode, an isophyte helps. So just want to add something to the list and then just make this point and how this helps. But make this point and how this helps and how things actually fail if you are too symmetric. Okay, so more specifically the topic is: I want to do anisotropy in seismology and how alterpa geometry makes it useful. So if you just use differential geometry, then there are things you won't be able to see. But if you use ultra-plag tools, then there's a surprising new set of observations. And the big theorem that I want to give to you is this. So, not always. This. So, not all the things I defined yet, but never mind. I just want to give you a quick impression first. So, I should mention that this paper is now on archive since last Monday, so it's actually there. So, generically, so for a dense and open set of stiffness tensors, so a stiffness tensor is uniquely determined by any of the following pieces of information. So, if you know the slowness polynomial, whatever that is, or you know the whole slowness surface, whatever that is, again, or Surface, whatever that is, again, or you know any small part of this flowing surface for a single polarization, and that's kind of the thing that is most physically interesting. Okay, so I'm saying here that it holds genetically, but that it's a whole class of congregate samples. So, for example, if you happen to be ostrombic, which is a special symmetric type, then we know it not to be unique ever. Okay, so we know that it's only genetic, so it cannot hold uh in all possible cases, but it will hold uh most of the time. But it will hold most of the time. Okay, so to start with just going through what the universe problem actually is and what the PDEs are and so forth. And then I'll go and study the geometry of the solar surface and go get a functional geometry there. And then finally, if I can have the time, I'll go through an example of a two-layer model of the Earth. Okay, so we'll start with the elastic wave equation. So, first, Questions. So, first, the players on the scene. So, there is the displacement vector field. So, it is indeed a vector value. And so, if you are at a point x in your domain and at time t, then this displacement just tells you how far you are from equilibrium at a point. And then there is a density, which is supposed to be a real-valued thing. And then there is something called the stiffness tensor, which is a RAM4 tensor, which somehow describes the springiness of the material, so it describes the size of the restoring force, if you want. The size of the restoring force issue was distorting a KL from its equilibrium position. Okay, and these quantities have some properties. So the density should be positive. The stiffness tensor should have some symmetric properties. The exact nature of those is irrelevant, but there are some symmetry, but it's not fully symmetric. And then also the stiffness tensor should be positive in some sense. And well, maybe I should explain this. Maybe I should explain this. So it's analog for the answer, so you can see it as a quadratic form on the space of symmetric matrices. Okay, so these are the symmetries that kind of make that a sensible concept, and then I want that quadratic form to be a positive definite one. So that's kind of what this means. And physically, what this means is that material is mechanically stable, so there is no direction in which you can distort it so that it blows up spontaneously, which is something that physical materials can. Physical materials to have. Okay, and the equation of motion is the elastic wave equation, and it looks like this. So it's essentially a wave equation, as the name says. So there is the second time derivative here, and then there is something that looks like a vector laplacian of some kind, even by that stiffness tensor. Okay, and where this comes from is simply Newton's second law. So you see here mass times acceleration of a particle, and then here is more or less the restoring force, which is. Is more or less true and false, which is given by the stiffness sensor. And the derivatives are there because it's only about relative displacement and not absolute displacement that matters here. Okay, so I'll be interested in that equation. And this elastic wave equation is hyperbolic, so we can have propagating similarities, and then I would like to study how those things propagate. And well, suppose for a while that this rho and C are constants, so that I can do things more explicitly. So that I can do things more explicitly. And then, if I plug in an answer like this, so u is supposed to be a vector-valued thing, so that amplitude A should be a vector, and then I'm putting in some kind of a frequency omega, and then a vector p there. So, well, that amplitude A is the direction of oscillation. And that P vector there is more or less the direction of propagation, and those can point in different directions. So, if they point in the same direction, then you move like this, and if they point in opposite directions, And if they point in opposite directions, then you move like this. Okay, so that's the meaning of those vectors, at least roughly. So if you just plug in that to the constant coefficient elastic wave equation, then you end up with this equation. And well, rho and omega being non-zero, you just get this thing, the identity matrix, and this gamma matrix together annihilate my vector A. And here this gamma thing is what is This gamma thing is what is called the Christoffel matrix. And now I should underline the fact that it is the Christoffel matrix and not the Christoffel symbol. So the same symbol and it has kind of a... So alto Christophel symbols will have some meaning to this story, but unfortunately the two concepts are completely isolated. So this is just something not to be confused about. Okay, so this polarization vector A is an eigenvector of the Christopher matrix. So that is Of the Christoph matrix. So that is an eigenvalue iteration, more or less. So this A here is called polarization, and it is indeed an eigenvector for the last wave equation to be true. Okay, so if we choose not to keep track of the polarization, which we will like to do, so we'll be forgetful of that, and just track the particle as a kind of a point particle without any additional data, then the condition is that the determinant of this. Then the condition is that the determinant of this should be zero. So I don't know what this essentially is, that this is the principal symbol of the spatial pattern, that is the principal symbol of the fine part of the hard quality operator. Okay, and it's matrix value because we have a system. Okay, so in general, so even if these things are not constant, the similarities of the elastic wave equation mostly will satisfy this equation that the determinant is zero, and I will be ignoring the word mostly here, not just three to three. Here, and I just treat of these as the tools. Okay, so that's where the similarities can be. And then the second question is: how do the similarities then move? And they move according to some kind of a geodesic flow here. And I'll just speak about the fastest similarities. So there are different polarizations, so they go at different speeds. And I'm looking at the fastest one, which, if you were to have the usual kind of isotropic, the most familiar textbook example, it's called the pressure wave or P wave. But now that we don't quite have But now that we don't quite have all that symmetry, then it's not called a pressure wave, but a quasi-pressure wave, because it's kind of the close the same to it, but not quite the same. And therefore, I'm calling it a quasi-p. So the fastest similarities that follows the generic flow of the Finnish metric FQP, which is given by the Lechankara transform square root of the leading algebra of the Christopher matrix. So where this formula comes about exactly is not exactly important, I suppose, but I just want to give that explicit. I suppose, but I just want to give that explicitly so that there is a connection that you can play with. Okay. Are you talking about the characteristics of the equations there? Yeah, but that's why the similarities travel. Yeah. Yeah, indeed. And the fact that I'm looking at the fastest similarities means that I'm looking at the top eigenvalues of the number one stands for that. Um, let's see. So, um, then, so the thing that really appears everywhere is the reduced stiffness tensor. So, this A, which is just the original one divided by density, so that kind of normalization is sensible. So, it defines a Christoffel matrix, and then it also defines a slowness polynomial. So, we're just giving the name names to the things that I had on the previous slides. So, the slowness polynomial, by depending on A applied to P. By depending on A applied to P, is just this determinant here. And as I say, here it is a polynomial, and we should check that it actually is a polynomial. So, first of all, this matrix here, well, the identity matrix is constant in the vector P, and then the entries of the Christoffel matrix were, sorry, if I show the equation here, the entries of the Christoffler matrix are all quite a polynomials in the In the components of P, so therefore it is kind of a polynomial, so matrix-value polynomial. So therefore, this whole thing is a matrix-valued polynomial of P, and then the determinant is a degree n polynomial for the entries, so all in all we end up with a degree 2n polynomial. Okay, and the fact that it is polynomial will be quite important. Okay, and so the set where similarities are possible is what we call the slowness circuits or rather. We call the slowness surface, or rather, what people in physics call the slowness surface. So, this is just a set of points, so you can think of this as kind of a subset of the code diagnosis space at a point of your domain where this slowness polynomial vanishes. Okay, so this is just a vanishing set of this slowness polynomial. And giving these names now helps do some of the geometrical stuff. And I should mention now here that knowing the slowness polynomial is more or less the same thing as. Polynomial is more or less the same thing as knowing the slowness surface. Because you know some normalization things. So if you know the polynomial, then you know where it vanishes and vice versa. The only thing is that if you have been to be fully isotopic, then maybe you have to know the display surface not as a set but as a scheme, but never mind. Something very crucial. Okay, so here's a concrete example in two dimensions. So a very specific stiffness tensor with explicit numbers, which I forget, but anyhow. So on the left we have a slowdown surface. So on the left we have a slowness surface. And okay, so in 2D the at least of the matrix is a 2x2 matrix. And it's a positive affinity symmetric matrix because of the operation of the stiffness tensor. And therefore it has two eigenvalues. And the two eigenvalues now correspond to these two branches. So the blue branch here corresponds to the bigger eigenvalue and the red one to the smaller one. Okay, and so now this is somehow in the cotangent space of Is somehow in the cotangent space on top of some point on your domain, and then if you take the duality in the kind of physical way, then you end up on the tension space and you get something that is supposed to be the unit sphere of some kind of the null. Okay, and if you look at this blue thing on the right hand, that certainly is the unit sphere of some kind of a complex thing, so that is the corresponds to a things we know. But if you look at this red thing, then it's utterly miserable. So it's not a sphere in so many ways. So, it's not a sphere in so many ways. I mean, the norm seems to have three values in some directions and it feels to be convex and all that kind of thing. So, that is not the kind of geometry that I enjoy doing. You know, some may say that I enjoy doing exotic geometry, but that's not quite reasonable enough for me either. Okay, but this quasi-pressure polarization, this blue thing, is the fastest wave that behaves well. And we actually have proof that it is always convex, so it will always produce some. Convex, so it will always produce something reasonable. And what anisotropy then means is that the speed of sound depends on direction, which means in this picture that I don't have circles, but something else. Okay, and these are certainly not circles, so this would be an isotopic example. Okay, so let's then look into the inverse problems. So I'm not looking at any specific inverse problems here, but just a general form of them would be something like that. General form of them would be something like this. So, given information of the solutions to the elastic wave equation on the boundary, so maybe you have interior sources, maybe you can set up your sources in the boundary or whatever, then the task would be to find the parameter C and a row everywhere within your domain. So it's a classical linguist problem, but pretty hard if you have the B and Alzheimer's. Okay, and then the geometrized version of that would be that given the travel types of similarities, that is the geodesic distances in that. That is the geodesic distances in that geometry that I gave you between boundary points, then find whatever kind of geometric data depending on your setup. Then the task would be to find the quasi-Pinslamanifold, so one of the domain omega, and you want to find that insulin metric F. Okay, so a couple of remarks are in order. So first of all, I'm reducing a problem to another problem, and it's not clear that we win anything. So we might just be going from bad to worse. Just be going from bad to worse. But the thing is that for problems of the second type, we can actually prove stuff in the fully unf setting. So there are at least some things we can do. So it is not utterly insane. And the second point is that Riemannian geometry is not enough. So of course Riemannian is kind of more anisotropic than Euclidean, but still it can only handle a tiny subclass of the physical value and interesting stiffness tensors. But not only is it enough But not only is it not enough for physics, but it's also not enough for mathematics in a way that I'll show in a moment. And also, so here I'm speaking about getting the Finsler manifold, but of course knowing the solontophili manifold and knowing the Fiemannian or the Finsler metric is the same thing as knowing the sphere bundle or the cosphere bundle of those metrics. So that's just the same thing. So instead of the metric, maybe we should be talking about the cosphere bundle because that is somehow The cause here bundle because that is somehow what couples best to the outspike prescription. So, the connection between that physical model and when this geometrical picture is indeed here, which is granted three derived from before, so that the co-spheres of this thin slot geometry, so the fibers of this right here, they are the quasi-P branches of the solar surface. So, that is the connection that kind of defines this whole geometry. Okay, so. Um okay, so just to kind of uh give a short uh big picture overview. So this phase that goes through the planet, they follow geodesics of this one-tipped geometry, and they tell something about the interior structure of the planet, and that interior structure of the material parambias is encoded as a geometry. So the task would be to find that geometry, and maybe later to convert that into physical information. Okay, so then let's move on to the So then let's move on to the geometry of these loneliness surfaces and what they look like. So I'll have to start with what an algebraic priority is to me. So well maybe I should be calling this an algebraic set, but nonetheless this is good enough terminology for us today. So I'll say that a set V in the Euclidean space is an algebraic variety if it is the vanishing set of a collection of polynomials, just an. Of polynomials, just any polynomial functions from Rn to R. Okay, so that's my definition. And then the observation is that this Lawness surface is the vanishing slip of this Lawness polynomial. And therefore it is an algebraic variety, and therefore we can apply the tools of whatever can be said about the varieties. And the study of the geometry of varieties is a part of algebraic geometry. So not all of it, but exactly is classically a very important part of that field. That field. Okay, and then I'll move towards the first theorem. But before I can do that, I'll have to give you another definition. So say that a variety B is irreducible. It can be written as the union of two varieties in a non-trivial way. So I'll give you a reducible variety. So in the plane, the union of the two coordinate axes. So both of those two lines are varieties, and the union is also a variety. But now it can be. But now that it can be written in a non-trivial way as a union, so therefore it is reducible. But also, if you think of this as the managing set of a polynomial, then this is just x times y equals 0, which of course you can then just say that x has to be 0 or y has to be 0. So reducibility for the variety and the reducibility for the corresponding polynomials is kind of more or less the same thing. So that the vanishing set of single polynomial is reducible. Polynomial is reducible if the polynomial can be written as the product of two polynomials in a notable way, which here is easy. x times y is x times y. So I can factor it. Okay, so here's the first key theorem. So we're working in dimensions 2 and 3 only. And this says that there is an open and dense subset of the stiffness tensors A so that the slowness polynomial is in a reachable. Okay, so this says that typically if you take any random stiffness tensor A, then the slowness polynomial will be irreducible. So it cannot be written somehow as the union of two things. And a couple of remarks. So again, this is not true for all A. So this fails in a couple of interesting cases. So for example, if you happen to be fully isotopic, then this is certainly not true because the This is certainly not true because the slogan surface is the union of concentric spheres, and then all the spheres upright is in themselves, so it just can be written as a union of them. And also, if any one of the geometries for any of the colorizations happens to be Riemannian. So, if this thing slide geometry that I have happens to be Riemannian, which is a valid subclass, then my artifact geometry fails entirely. So, if you have an view within Riemannian geometry, then it will fail. Then we fail. So, this is something where anatomy truly makes a difference. Okay, and I'm not going to prove this, but I will give the basic idea of this. So, typically, for a family of polynomials, so as we have, so the family of slowness polynomials is sometimes indexed by these different sensors. So, typically, for a family of polynomials, the set of irreducible ones among them is Zariski open, that is, open in the Zariski topology. That is open in the Zaristic topology. And in Zaristic topology, open sets kind of, well, they come in two kinds. Well, you can be empty, which is always a valid open secondary topology. But if it happens to be non-empty, then from the point of view of the usual ingredient topology, it is automatically open and dense. So the Zariski open sets are huge. So if you want to prove that something is genetic, then we actually have to prove that it's non-empty. So if you have openness, which comes from So if you have openness, which comes from all kinds of things that cross-endic it, so it's kind of heavy machinery, but then that might not do anything because you might be empty. But to show that you are not empty, you just need to come up with a single concrete example and do that by hand, and then you automatically get genetic in ready to delete. So that's kind of a fun thing that you can't do with analytic tools. Okay, and then what follows from here is that we And then what follows from here is that, well, when the solar surface is irreducible, then any tiny little open set in the Euclidean topology, where you can have tiny little open sets unlike in Zariski topology, then that will determine the whole slowness surface. And indeed, in dimensions 2 and 3, this is generically true. So for most slowness surfaces, you will be able to do this. So it is enough to do all of your measurements for a well-behaved plus IP branch. So I said that the geometry for the other waves instead of For the other waves is kind of measurable, but you are free to ignore that. Do all of your geometry for the well-behaved part, and then out of that, you can automatically read of what happens with the real-behave read. Okay, so in a picture, so we've seen pictures before, but what happens typically in geometric inverse problems is that so if you do your usual tools, then maybe you'll be able to see some little bit of this thing. Little bit of this thing on the tangent space. So you see maybe a little open subset of the unit vectors that we have there. That is typically kind of accessible. And then if you do that, see that little arc there, and then you kind of take the duality, and then that is maybe converted to that little arc there. Okay, but then what I said in the theorem is that this little arc here will determine the whole thing. Not only the blue thing, but also the red thing. So the red thing somehow seems to be big. Somehow seems to be kind of decoupled, but there is an object-like connection, and also, if you were to somehow complexify this variety, then these two things could actually be connected, some would be complex well. Okay, and the way to go from a little bit to the whole thing is simple, you just take the closure into the Zariski topology, but what Ethereum gives you is kind of a reassurance that the Zariski closure will actually give you the whole thing, because it's not automatically. Because it's not automatic that it will actually do that, so we just have to prove that it does. Okay, so it's kind of methodically easy given any specific one, but what we really needed to prove is that generically this thing actually works out. Okay, but then going further, so again in dimensions 2 and 3, there is again an alternate dense subset W here of stiffness tensors A so that the map that came Of A, so that the map that takes these difference tensor into the corresponding polynomial that that map is injected. And that again is not quite trivial. And indeed, it is not always true. So we know that there are materials that have this post-rhombic symmetry, which is very specific for physical symmetry, but those materials always come in quadruple plates that have the same slowness levels. So they come in sets of four stiffness tensors, some of which may fail the physical positivity condition, but Fail the physical positivity condition, but oftentimes they will all be nice. And they always have exactly the same slowness. So this just says that again it does not hold for all fields, but it does hold at least for some of them. Okay, so then what follows is, again, in relation to B, that generically any small subset of the slowdown surface actually determines the stiffness tensor. And the stiffness tensor is the physical parameter that we care about. So if you do your Care about. So if you do your geometric measurements, you get a little bit of the slowness of this, and then that is actually enough, assuming that you are not in any of the symmetric cases where the symmetry messes up your geometry. Okay, so I'll give you a sketchy proof of this theorem. So the space of stiffness tensor, so it's kind of some Euclidean space of some dimension. And there will be a positivity condition, but that doesn't really matter all that much. Really matter all that much. And then there is the space of degree 2 and even polynomials on this Euclidean space. And again, just there are finitely many coefficients, so I can just think of it as a Euclidean space. Okay, so I can define this map F that goes from A to C. So given a stiffness tensor, it gives me the corresponding polynomial. So this is actually a polynomial map because the coefficients of the slowness polynomial are actually polynomials in the stiffness tensors for polarizing. Okay, so then, well, this is kind of a map between these Euclidean spaces or affine spaces, and what you need to do is to projectivize this map. Because it's kind of unfortunate that the Euclidean spaces are not compact. So what you can do is you can kind of add a point at infinity, and then that kind of compactifies things. But then there might be some odd things where you might end up having maybe zero slowness polynomial or something unfortunate, and then you might have to blow some things up. And then you might have to blow some things up. But anyway, there is a way to kind of turn all of these things into compact things. So this is kind of a canonical tool in unstoppable geometry to do that. And once you have done that, then you can start studying the mapping properties of this F much better. So if you take any C in that target space, so any polynomial of the correct degree, it might not be actually realizable. Realizable in the image, so it might not be in the image, but we can always look at the pre-image and we can ask what the dimension of the pre-image is in the space A. And what a heavy theorem tells us is that a fiber dimension thing is approximately continuous in the stadistic topology. Okay, but stadistic topology is again great because approximate continuity gives us quite a bit. So in clean nature video, all you get, you clean topology, you only get. Get complete and unfortunately only get some small open sets. But now we find an explicit example where the fiber dimension is zero, and therefore it follows that it is generically zero, because these open sets are just so bloody huge. Okay, well that means that generically this pre-image only contains finitely many points, which is what it means to be zero-dimensional. Well, and again, this number of these points is then upper semicontinuous. And actually, for different reasons than here, but apparently, this upper semicontinuity. Apparently, these opposite continuity is a thing in algebraic geometry. But so, doing this other kind of black magic here, and you can repeat the same argument: if you find an at least one which has exactly one pre-image, then it is genetically, then the genetic size of the pre-image is one, which means that indeed the genetic pre-image is a singleton and therefore the map is genetically injected. So, this is kind of more or less the flavor of what these proofs look like in. Flavor of what these proofs look like in this kind of a setup. Okay, so then if I have a few minutes, I'll go through an example which is kind of in some ways silly and simple, but I just want to give an explicit example of how this thing can be used to do something more global. So what this algebraic tool really does is kind of post-processing of your geometric problems. So you end up with some kind of metric information, you reconstruct your things to make. Information, you reconstruct your finstel manifold or whatever, and then what this tool does is to promote that information to something about the stiffness tensor or something like that. So, but to see the post-processing in action, we need to have a more complete version of the problem. So, I have a simple model for a planet. So, there are two layers, that is a mantle and a core. And then the interface and the outer surface are both strictly convex. So, for example, a constant fixed PS, so these. So, for example, the constant is VS, so this would be kind of a reasonable toy model for VS. What is not reasonable is that the material around us are constant in each layer, but just to make life easier, we'll do that. And we assume that there is no total reflection of these pressure waves that traps them to the core, and which that is kind of a very condition in the setup. Okay, so that would be uh what the model looks like, and then the measurements would be like this. And then the measurements would be like this. So you measure travel times and direction of waves between all surface points and for all polarizations. Or maybe you only use the fast polarizations either way. Okay, and so if you use these kinds of measurements, the conclusion is that these measurements genetically determine the whole model. So even if you only measure pressure waves, you get the whole stiffness tensor with bulk qualization information included automatically. Automatically. Okay, I'll just give the proof in a picture. So, what you first start with is these short blue lines here. If you know that the material is constant, you know that the geodesics in this geometry are straight lines. You just don't quite know what the speed of those lines is. Okay, but if you measure the distances here for short nearby points, then you can just tell what the speed is in that direction. Okay, and then you wobble that direction slightly, and then you get an open subset of Then you get an open subset of speeds, so an open subset of the unit sphere, then you can run these arguments and then you get the whole stiffness in that region. Fine? Okay? But now you know what these species are supposed to be here, and then you can start deforming, and at some point, things will not come through the way you expected, because you will have hit this in an on-prem area. Okay, so these dashed blue lines are something that doesn't actually happen, and so you can. Doesn't actually happen, and so you can detect the lack of expected behavior, and therefore you can tell where you have hit the boundary. And now you know that this coordinate boundary is convex, and you can approach it from different directions, and therefore you get the whole thing. And then you pick two of your favorite points on the coordinate boundary, which are pretty close. But then you know the geometry here, so you know how to aim at those points from the boundary, and you know the total travel time, so then you can figure out the travel time between those two points. Got the travel time between those two points just within the core, and run the same argument again, and that will give you the stiffness tensor in the core. Okay, so these are the theorems. So the first theorem is exactly the same thing that I had on the first slide, one of the first slides, and then this is kind of a write-up of the thing that I just had on the previous slide. So indeed, we can show that genetically analyzed perfect stiffness densor is uniquely determined by any small Determined by any small part of the flown surface. So, any small set of erections with a single polarization will be enough generically, but not always. And that's all I want to tell you today. Thank you. Yeah, thanks very much for John's question. So, what about maximum? Are there any advantages to anisotropy? Are there any advantages to anisotropy there? We are looking into it. So I don't know yet. So the question is: you have to kind of the analogy of this loan surface there. The question is, so are there any examples where this loan surface is not reducible? And we expect that as there is a rule of thumb, if there is a single example, then it will be generic. So if you can play around and find a single concrete example, then we expect that we can prove within a year. We can prove within a year, instead of giving the 5B this thing, that it is genetically true. That's in process. Okay. So, question one is do you state the theorems and two and three dimensions? That's for physical reasons, or is it mathematically relevant? And the second one is this irreducibility condition. I mean, can one view it as some kind of View it as some kind of algebraic implicit function kind of statement on the non-degeneracy condition? And maybe it's completely stupid, but so. Yeah, so I think the irreducibility thing is so I don't know if there's kind of any reasonable way to see it somehow geometrically, at least not as far as I know, so let me just try and Know, so let me just try and give that. Okay, so here, for example, these two surfaces are still perfectly smooth and nice, so they seem to be somehow kind of analytically disjoint, but this is irrevocable as a surface. So then I'm not sure what to make of that. Somehow, well, you can complexify it, and then you see it's connected, but that's not something we treated at all. But coming to the question of dimension, then we know that the set of good ones is. Set of good ones is open in Zariski topology in any dimension. So that proof is kind of just heavy machinery and very other things. But then to show that it is then open and dense, actually, you need to produce the example. And the example will be produced by hand. And so we just don't know how to produce kind of explicit examples. So if you can kind of cook up a seven-dimensional example of an irreducible solace polynomial, then we know that it's generically irreducible in dimension seven. Generate possible information server. So, I mean, you could repeat the exercise for any number of dimensions, but with other physicists might stop saying interesting and on that slide, can you say a little more about what it's like to take the Zero Scroll here? Yes. Question that I didn't anticipate. So if you have any set of functions, So, if you have any set of functions f on the Euclidean space, then you can define the closure with respect to that familial functions. So, the closure of a set A is a set of all those points X for which it happens that if f vanishes on A, then automatically f has to also vanish at this point X. Okay, so you can think of the closure as the maximal extension of the conclusion of vanishing. So, if you know that something vanishes on the set A, then the closure. That something vanishes on the set A, then the closure is the set where you can also say that things have to vanish. Okay, so and this actually is a topology if it's unitarian. But the thing is that if you choose continuous functions, then you get the standard topology. And if you choose smooth functions, you get the same thing again. But now if you choose polynomials here, then you get the zadistic closure. So you can think of the Zadistic closure as the maximal extension of the conclusion that something vanishes, assuming that the thing that vanishes is at the moment. That the thing that manages these sets or normal would be this. Okay, and then from this point of view, a variety is exactly the same thing as a post-so I can see that you're looking at sort of general stiffness tensors, but how does this relate to the Lagrangian theorem? So I mean is that is the set of stiffness tensors somehow restricted in a full way? somehow restricted in a for a reasonable equation of state, in a grounded framework, or do they really all come up? I mean? Yeah, so well first of all we did impose the symmetry condition. So there are different kinds of symmetry assumptions that you could physically make, but for most materials this would be reasonable. So can you ask if I only make those assumptions on symmetry and nothing more, then are all of those realizable? Because if of course it might be that Because of course, it might be that the thing is genetically true, but all of the physical examples are in the complement. That might well happen. But these kind of fully anisotropic things, so the things that have the worst kind of symmetry, they do exist physically and they actually pretty common in the mantle. There's one more question. Yes, I guess this is related to Zurski Klosher's question, but is there some way to quantify some kind of stability estimate for stability estimate for saying like uh you know for the surface closure like if the you know two qp solid surfaces are sufficiently close then the stiffness tensor starts issues um yeah that's a good question and that's something we are now uh kind of thinking of but it's not not trivial so first of all if you make a small tiny little measurement error in your slowness at this and then you take the sariski closure you get the whole Euclidean space so the Zariski closure is very very unstable but there are some Unstable, but there are some things that maybe you can kind of do with it. So we expect there to be some kind of conditional stability low coming of some kind, but don't ask me for details yet. Okay, so I guess uh next we'll have lunch. The talks will continue at two and thirty. Please thank Johannes and all the other speakers for
