So, today I'll talk about some new work that I did with my PhD advisor, Silas Alban. So, this is span-wise variations in membrane father dynamics. So, for those who don't know, a membrane is basically a thin extensible sheet that resists deformations due to stretching. So, maybe you are familiar more with flapping flags. There, you have infinite stretching rigidity. These membranes can also extend. Extend. So we'll consider the pure membrane problem. So in this case, we have zero bending rigidity, but of course, it can be included in the model. So what you're seeing here is a finite span membrane. This edge is the leading edge, then you have the trailing edge and two side edges. And we are imposing some background flow, which is shown by the arrows here, with some constant speed U. And want to see what the dynamics give us when we change certain parameters. Okay, so membranes appear in biological flows. For example, we can have membranes in the wings of flying animals, such as the one shown here. These are squirrels, these are bats. So their wings are made of these membrane structures. But we also have engineering applications. So you might be interested in when a membrane loses stability in order to construct efficient sails, parachutes, or drones that resemble the flight of bats. And on the right corner over here, I'm showing. And on the right corner over here, I'm showing a micro-air vehicle constructed by NASA, where the wing is a membrane wing. And the advantage of having this as opposed to a rigid wing is that it can adapt to the unsteady airflow conditions faster and therefore it can increase its maneuverability. All right, so since we have a finite span, we can control also the boundary conditions at the leading, trailing edge, and also the two side edges. And the two boundary conditions that I will consider are. Boundary conditions that I will consider are either fixed or free. So, by a fixed edge, I mean that we have a zero deflection there. So, this is this boundary condition over here. And then when I say free, I don't mean a completely free edge, otherwise we get compression and the problem is easily posed, but rather I have a partially free edge where the membrane is allowed to deflect freely in the vertical direction and it's constrained by these vertical poles and is attached to these muscles rings that can move up and down. Attached to these muscles rings that can move up and down. So in this case, the free edge is basically this derivative. So I consider just the side edges being free in this problem. But you can, of course, do a fixed or a free edge for any of the four edges. And the x and the y coordinates are also dependent on this material coordinates alpha 1 and alpha 2 and on time. But at the edges, I have that x and y is always fixed, and it's only the interior. Always fixed, and it's only the interior where they change. So, the main question that we want to answer in this work is that when you have now a 2D surface for the membrane and a 3D flow, when are these membrane flutter motions truly 3D? And when are they 2D? And so you can use a 2D flow with a 1D curve. So on the left, maybe you cannot see it very clearly, but you have a single hum shape, which is growing in amplitude. Growing in amplitude, and on the right-hand side, you have another membrane with different parameters where you have a lot of variation in the spanwise direction. So, even though the fluid is coming in this direction, you get a lot of variation in the spanwise direction. And we want to also see what are the trends when you change things like the membrane mass, so how light or heavy this body is, when you change this tension, the Poisson ratio, or the aspect ratio. So, I should mention here what the Poisson ratio is. If you're unfamiliar, it's a material. Ratio is, if you're unfamiliar, it's a material property. And if it's positive, it means that you have basically the ratio between the transverse contraction and the longitudinal extension. So if it's a positive Poisson ratio, it's a volume preserving property, but if it's zero, you get something like this. I changed my slide, but somehow you cannot see it on the screen. It's lagging. Maybe if we zoom somehow, you can see that I'm not sure. Let me try to reshare my screen. I guess it's the same problem as the ah finally, okay. So here we have the model that we have been using with Scilas. So we have an extensible membrane equation. It looks complete, but I would want you through it. It looks complicated, but I will walk you through it. So, we have the mass, it's this dimensionless quantity R1. So, it's a ratio between the density of the membrane to the density of the fluid times the thickness ratio. And this second derivative with respect to time of position is, of course, acceleration. So, if we have mass times acceleration, we think of Newton's second law of motion, we have then the forces. So, this huge term over here is the tension force, which can be derived using a variational formulation of the stretching energy. Formulation of the stretching energy. And on the right of the equality symbol, we have the pressure jump force. So, for this one, is basically the force that will couple the membrane dynamics to the fluid flow and vice versa. It's a fluid structure interaction problem. The N is the normal on the membrane, and then this thing under the square root is basically the stretching factor. So it tells us how much the membrane has stretched. These epsilon terms are the strain tensors. Are the strain tensors and they are functions that depend on this pre-strain, which is a parameter that we can prescribe. And we will control the pre-tension. So pre-tension is this Ks, which is a ratio between the stretching rigidity. So R3 is the stretching rigidity. Nu is the Poisson ratio. E is the Young's modulus. So you can control the stretching rigidity and then multiply by the pre-strain to get the pre-tension. Physically, you can think of the pre-tension as the amount by Pre-tension as the amount by which I extend the membrane before I fix its ends. Okay, so I said that you have this pressure jump force, so it's the difference between the pressure below and above the membrane. So we need to solve for this. It's an unknown. So you use this pressure jump equation. So it's a derivative with respect to alpha one, which is the material coordinate. And it's a function that depends on the position of the membrane, the vortex sheet strength. So this is the vortex sheet strength in V alpha 1. Vortex is strength in the alpha one and alpha two direction. Nu1 and mu2 tells you the average tangential flow velocity. Tau1 and tau2, as you can see here, is the dot product of the tangential velocity with the membrane, sorry, of the tangential vector with the membrane velocity. And then is the normal component of the membrane velocity. Okay, so actually it's like this, but I didn't want to. It's a very, very large equation. So I don't know. You can derive this using Euler momentum equation. So we have this in our work. If you are interested, I can also tell you more about it later. Sorry about the extreme lag. Okay. Then we have to close the system of equations. So in order to do that, we use the kinematic condition. So probably a lot of you are already familiar with the Biosabar law. So this is basically telling you that the normal component of the membrane velocity. Normal component of the membrane velocity, which is the thing on the left of the equality sign, is equal to the normal component of the flow velocity. So, what you are seeing that Ex is the flow velocity, the background flow velocity, which is only in the x direction. And then the double integral, which is the principal value integral, is telling you the velocity induced on the membrane from the bound vortex sheet and the free wake. Okay, so there is a bound vortex sheet. Okay, so there is a bound vortex sheet on the membrane, and then there is a free wake that emanates only from the trailing edge of this membrane. So it's a vortex sheet method. Okay, so to do this numerically, since it's a non-linear system of equations that are all coupled, and it's a 3D flow, we use the vortex-lattice method in combination with Broyden's method. So, vortex-lattice method, you discrete is basically. A vortex lattice method, you discretize basically the membrane into a bunch of panels and then you place on them a vortex ring. So, on each panel, there is a vortex ring consisting of four vortex filaments, and then there is a free wake. So, you need to compute the velocities induced from all those vortex filaments on each of the collocation points. And then we use Bruyden's method, which is a Newton-type method, to solve for this non-linear system of equations. Okay, so the title of this work was Spanwise Variation. Title of this work was one-wise variations. So, I have to tell you what we tried for initial perturbations now. So, this is a passive problem. So, you do some initial perturbation on the membrane and you want to see how the dynamics will evolve. So, we tried two different initial conditions. We started with an asymmetric one along the span and then asymmetric one. So, the asymmetric one is of this form. So, you can see in the surface plots that I have, if you have that all the That I have, if you have that all the edges are fixed, you just do a skewed perturbation on the edges, okay? And you also ramp up the background flow. So for example, if I plug mt is equal to zero here, you get that the flow velocity is zero. As time grows, then you get that this goes to zero. So you get u, which is the background velocity. And then we also do the symmetric case. So the symmetric initial perturbation is of the following form. The following form. So you just give a perturbation initially at time zero, and it's a non-zero slope. So you can see it here. It's only in the interior of the membrane, and the edges are prescribed. Okay, so now we are seeing how this perturbation has been evolving time for a particular example. So this R1, remember, is the mass, T0 is the pretension, nu equals to zero means that the positive ratio is zero. zero means that the password ratio is zero. So on the left, we see the asymmetric initial condition. So you get a lot of asymmetry, there are many troughs and peaks, but then these go away and you get a three extremum shape and then it just converges to this single hump shape. Instead, if we start with the symmetric initial condition on the right-hand side, you see that you immediately go into the shape that we observed at time 25 before, and then you still 5 before, and then you still converge to the same type of dynamics. So, I think this is very interesting. You start with a very different initial condition, it goes through different regimes, but you end up with the same shape. And the same is true when you have three side edges. Okay, so here you are seeing the animation that we have. So, we did the asymmetric initial perturbation, and this is a top view. On the upper corner, there you have the Z-center, so just Corner, there you have the z-center. So just imagine if I place my mouse over here, you're just following this point in time. So you can see it grows and then it oscillates a bit in time. So then it gives you different dynamics where you have traveling waves in the spanwise direction. All right, whereas if I start with the symmetric initial condition, you see that it's symmetric in the spanwise direction. Symmetric in the spanwise direction initially. It grows into this single HAMP shape. It still oscillates and eventually it can still give you dynamics that have some variation in the spanwise direction. Okay, so in this slide, what we do instead is showing, sorry, showing what happens in the large amplitude region. Amplitude regime. So here the two initial conditions, which are the top and the bottom curves, they go through different transitions but eventually converge to the same thing again. So here this example is with three sided edges. Okay, so we also need some measure of asymmetry, which is given by the following formula. So you take the Z, which is the deformation in the Z direction, minus Z, which is Z reflection, which is defined as Z. Which is defined as this. So you can think of this as Z for the membrane shape, but reflected in the alpha 2 is equal to zero plane. And then these curves. So remember, the horizontal axis is the dimensionless membrane mass, and the y-axis is the pre-tension. So we can see, for example, that over here, when the membrane is very light, then you have that the ZA symmetry, which is this curve, is decaying away. So it means you start with something. Away. So it means you start with something asymmetric, but it will converge to something symmetric. If you have a moderate value of mass, then you have some cases give you something that is asymmetric in the long term and something that is symmetric, as you can see, for example, over here. So if I focus in this particular example, this black rectangle, we see that if we take snapshots of the membrane at different times, we get At different times, we get something that is bandwise symmetric, like in this. This is a front view, it's just imagine I am holding the membrane facing you and you're looking at it from the front. Then the green one is showing that you have side-to-side oscillations, so there is a lot of asymmetry, and then the asymmetry starts decaying. And if I start with the other initial condition, you can go through the same states. All right, so in this slide, I'm sorry about the resolution. This slide, I'm sorry about the resolution. You can basically see what happens when you have light membranes, heavy membranes, small or large pretension, and the dynamics are very rich. So let me explain what you're seeing in each case. At the very top row of each of these, you have the mid-span profile. So basically, if you look at the surface over here, it's like taking a cross-section along the mid-span. Whereas the blue one, the one directly below, is showing you the mid-cord. So it's taking a slice in the other. Cord. So it's taking a slice in the other direction. So for large pretension, for the largest value shown over there, we have that the membrane can perform these up-down oscillations, but it's usually span-wise symmetric as we can see from the mid-cord snapshot. Then if we decrease the pretension a bit, we get a steady shape. So even though it looks like I'm just plotting a red and a blue curve there, they're actually all the snapshots. They're actually all the snapshots in time, but since it's a steady shape, they are overlapping. And you can also get, if when you decrease the pretension, a lot of span-wise variation. So this is an example. So here you're seeing a membrane with all its edges fixed. And at the bottom, I want to... So, for example, if you want to put this on a paper, you cannot show the video. So, we want some way of showing that you get spanwire. Way of showing that you get spanwise waves. So we have this chordwise average of z over time. So if we integrate away the alpha one, you can think of this quantity as a projection of the z of the membrane at 2nd space. So how can we understand these bottom curves? So you have different time intervals. And then on the very left, since the yellow is not changing much, the yellow is this quantity that I am talking about, it means I am talking about it means that the shape is almost uniform, right? So it's a steady shape, single hand shape. Whereas on the right-hand side, you have this zigzag pattern, which means that you have asymmetric side-to-side oscillations, and they are periodic. So you can change the pre-tension and the mass and see that for some of these cases, you get a single ham shape, which is more like in these cases over here, or you can have. Over here, or you can have the zigzag pattern, which denotes that you have waves that travel along the span. But I want to also mention that in the lower part where you have these traveling waves, the blue, for example, is showing that the deflection there is zero, whereas the yellow is showing that the deflection is large. So basically, it's not that the traveling waves are getting reflected off from a wall. They are basically going up to a distance and then returning back. To a distance and then returning back, and you saw that in the videos. You can also change the Poisson ratio, as we said. So, here, what happens when you increase the Poisson ratio? So, previously, I had zero, now I'm using 0.5. You can see that these up-down oscillations that we saw before are occurring at a different value of the pretension. So, previously, that happened, I will just remind you, it was at 10 to the 0.5, whereas now this is occurring at a much lower value, which is 10 to the minus 0.5. Much lower value, which is 10 to the minus 0.25. And not only that, so if I focus on this region over here, now you get these multiple peaks in the mid-chord, which is indicating that you have standing wave motions. So let's see how that looks like. So now I'm focusing on one of these standing wave motions. So initially, it's just a single ham shape, but eventually it gives you something like this. Something like this. So I think it's very interesting that just by playing with the quantities like mass, pretension, all these, you can get such rich dynamics. And not only that, within each of these examples, the dynamics change a lot. All right, so I was mostly talking about membranes with all edges fixed. So now I'm doing the same parameter space study, but for three side edges. Or three side edges. And here, as someone might expect, if you put the restriction of having fixed edges at the sides, then you might expect more symmetry, right? It's more restricted. And this is exactly what happens. So if I look on the left at the mid-court profiles, then you have much more variation. And it's because you have now this freedom, right, at the side edges. And you can also see it from this measure of asymmetry that I defined before, these are the log plots of. Before, these are the log plots of that asymmetry in the same parameter space. You see that these log plots are all growing, which means that the span wise asymmetry is growing for all cases here. Okay, so this projection that I told you to look at before is basically showing that the wave speeds, so if you look at these slopes of these lines, then you see that the oscillation frequencies decrease with increasing mass. So as I go down, the mass is increased. So, as I go down, the mass is increasing, and the wave speed, therefore, of these traveling waves is decreasing with increasing mass. Okay, so this is another example of this up-down oscillation for free-side edges, where you get a lot of symmetry in the spanwise direction. And I mentioned before that it doesn't get reflected all the way up to the free edge. So it goes up to here and then it returns back, and you can see that from the video as well. Of the video as well. Okay, so now what this slide is showing is what happens in the case of having a larger aspect ratio. So, aspect ratio is the ratio between the width of the membrane and the chord length. So, previously it was a square membrane. The aspect ratio was one. Now we are increasing the aspect ratio to four, which means that the span is four times as large as the cord. And then here, what you're seeing in each panel is 11 smacks. 11 snapshots in time of the aspect ratio 1 membranes, the mid-span and the mid-cord profile. And then below it is the aspect ratio 4.1. So you can see here that from the mid-span profile, the maximum deflection point was closer to the trailing edge. Whereas now, when I increase the aspect ratio to 4, the maximum deflection is occurring at the middle. And in general, And in general, the membranes are more steady. So you can see here, for example, an example. So this is the Z-center. You can see it's almost steady. It looks like the movie is not playing, but it does. And then you get this oscillation back and forth of the membrane. And then if we wait a bit longer, it also has this dimball in the middle. All right, so I will skip this. All right, so I will skip this. It's basically something similar for the free side edges. I want to also say that we tried to change the pretension in the two directions separately. So previously the T0, which is the pretension, was the same in both directions. So it was the isotropic case. But in nature, for example, bats have anisotropic pretensions. So we wanted to control the pretensions separately in the cordwise and in the spanwise direction. So you can do that by changing the So, you can do that by changing the strain formula basically. Instead of having E bar, which is the pre-strain, you have E-bar C and E-bar S. And on the left here, I'm showing the isotropic case, but on the right-hand side, you have the ionisotropic case. So you can see that the pretension in the spine-wise direction is smaller here, and it's the one that drives basically the dynamics. Whereas in the other case, in the lower panel, we have that the chordwise pretension is smaller. We have that the cordwise pretension is smaller, and again, is the one that controls. So, the smaller pretension is basically the one that controls the dynamics. All right, so thanks for your attention for this particular project. I want to talk about something else for the next five minutes. Maybe it's of interest to some of you. So, now I'm a postdoc at NYU and I work with Professor Jun Zhang. And this is collaboration also with another postdoc of his here at NYU Shanghai, which is close by, I guess. Close by, I guess. So, I wanted to talk about this. So, this is, you're seeing some videos of some of the experimental work that they have done. I'm working with Zhuang on the model and the simulations as well. So, let me go back and explain what you're seeing. So, here, maybe I'll pause. The white line is a water-air interface. So, below the line, you have water and above air. And at the bottom over here, what you're seeing is a vortex. You're seeing is a vortex ring gun. So it's a generator of vortex rings, okay? And you're seeing the vortex cores of the vortex ring over here. If I play the video, basically you can get different behaviors based on the angle of incidence of this vortex generator. Okay, so here we have called this the dissipated motion, the reflected, the broken drop. They reflected the broad energy across. So, dissipated means that when you have a specific angle or fruit number for these vortex rings, they just get dissipated. The most interesting one, I think, is the reflection. So you should have a specific angle and it has a specific strength. And then the vortex ring gets reflected. And actually, it gets reflected with the same angle. So it's like in optics. I think it's very interesting. The broken one, The broken one, I will slide through it. So basically, what you're seeing is that only the upper core is interacting with the interface and then it gets broken into a wave, whereas the across both of the vortex cores cross the boundary and then it breaks. So on the right-hand side here, we have this phase diagram. The vertical axis is the angle of incidence and the horizontal axis is the fruit number. So if you're not familiar with it, I defined it here. Familiar with it, I defined it here. It's a ratio between the circulation of the vortex ring, and G is the gravitational constant, and D is the separation between the vortex cores. So a very low fruit number is basically very weak. So we were lucky because this interaction between vortex rings and free surfaces has been studied a lot. But in all of the previous work, the ranges of fruit numbers. The ranges of fruit number and angle of incidences that they did was missing this reflection part. So most of them were either dissipated or broken. But you can see here, if you have a large enough angle of incidence and a strong enough vortex ring, you can get this reflection. So here I'm showing you instead what happens when you shoot a vortex ring at a fixed wall on the left. The fruit number there is 2.5. The fruit number there is 2.5. The angle of incidence of this. So I should have said the angle of incidence is the angle between the vertical and the vortex generator. And then if you have a very weak one, very so on the right hand side, you have a free surface, but a very weak vortex ring, then the behavior is very similar. All right, in this slide, I'm focusing on a particular point on that phase diagram where we get the reflection. Where we get the reflection. You can see it here. It deforms the interface, and the interface makes it reflect. And on the right-hand side, we have different initial angles of incidence. And then you see that as it propagates, then it returns back with an angle that is almost equal to the angle of incidence. Having reached an angle of 90. So the angle of 90 is just the point at which it goes parallel to the At which it goes parallel to the interface. And then here is for a fixed fruit number of 2.5 for different angles. So you can see, for example, if I have something which is a larger angle, it doesn't deform the surface so much. But if I shoot the vortex ring at a much steeper angle, it eventually evolves into something that reflects but almost breaks into a wave. All right. Right.
