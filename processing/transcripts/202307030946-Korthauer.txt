Okay, so just to start off, just to give you a really broad kind of big picture overview of my research area and then we'll dive into the more specifics. So in general, my group is really interested in dissecting epigenomic variability and in a large part we focus on DNA methylation. And this variability, as we know, can come from many different sources. So this could be variability at the organismal level, variability at the tissue level, variability at the cell type. At the tissue level, variability at the cell type level, and these factors of variation could be deriving from intrinsic sources such as the microenvironment or molecular processes, but they could also be factors that are extrinsic to the organism or cell. So these could be things like the external environment. And ultimately, the interest is, once we find these sources of variation, to then associate them with things like phenotypes or molecular properties. Phenotypes or molecular processes like gene regulation. So, as I said, I'm interested in this at the organismal level, the tissue level, and the cell level. So, a lot of our work is not necessarily single-cell level, but the project I'm going to talk to you about today is at the single cell level. So, just as a motivating example, so this example is going to kind of be used throughout the talk. So this is data from a paper from 2017. Data from a paper from 2017 in Science from Lua La et al. And this is showing a TC of single-cell whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from around 3,000 mouse neurons. And to create this tease me, the features that were input are average DNA level over these big bins, 100 kilobase bins, that are non-overlapping. So those are the features. So, those are the features, and the clusters here are annotated with the clusters, and the colors and the labels are used by using known sort of cell-type markers and looking at whether those methylation of the gene bodies of those marker genes were depleted. And so, when we look at something like this and other kind of similar papers in the literature, we wonder: you know, can we do better by Can we do better by summarizing the information not over these large bins and not relying on an alternative on sort of predefined regions like gene bodies and instead use the information that we have, which is the genome scale, and take advantage of the fact that we have site-level resolution in this sequencing data. So we don't want to collapse in these regions. And we are hypothesizing that by doing Hypothesizing that by doing this, we're going to get a more accurate clustering compared to previous approaches for analyzing the single-cell DNA methylation sequencing. And also that the features that we pull out would be more informative for associating with things like phenotypes and biological processes such as gene recognition. So, just to get a better kind of mental picture of this data and the key data science challenges. And the key data science challenges involved. So, this is kind of a picture that zooms out from the chromosome level to broad regions to then really zooming in on the bottom. So, this is adapted from a 2022 bioarchive preference from Premer et al. And so, if we imagine that these boxes here are leads, we can see that for each single cell in the rows, we just get a kind of random Get kind of random, to first approximation, random snapshots of information. So for any given CPG, we don't observe whether that CPG is methylated or not in every single cell. We just observe it in a small fraction of cells in our experiment. So some of the key challenges here is that we have high dimensionality. So even if we're just going to focus on CPGBs, so cytosine is followed by guanines, which are arguably the most relevant. Which are arguably the most relevant site in mammalian cells, with the exception of neurons, which have some appreciable non-CPG methylation. We still have roughly 30 million of them in the human genome. So we have high dimensionality. We also have the lack of independence of nearby CPGs. So you can kind of see that in this cartoon, where you have this structure of methylated and unrethylated CPGs. And then a well-known challenge in the single A well-known challenge in the single cells. We also have really high sparsity. So, depending on the exact protocol, the exact assay used to derive this data, it's going to have most of the sites are missing. We don't observe them. Again, you just observe this small fraction. Another key takeaway is that to a first approximation, this information that we get is binary. So, typically, we only observe one or a small handful of reads at each site. And although the And although there are cases where there's a little variation, we typically don't have the coverage to be able to call that sort of level of variability in the single cell data that's available. So to a first approximation, it's binary, but we only observe this random snapshot of sites in each cell. So one approach that has been used, and that's different from the motivating example, where we just summarize over these. Where we just summarize over these large bins, and we, in that case, would lose that site-level resolution. So, a different approach is to focus on regions that are called variably methylated regions, or VMRs for short. And so, this is an example of kind of what a variably methylated region looks like on the left, and a region that's not variably methylated amongst itself on the right. So, here the color. The color indicates a broad class of subtype. So, not one subtype of cells, but it's divided into three kind of broad cell types. So, you can see that here this green subtype has lower methylation than the other two cell types. But it's important to note that these VMRs here, and in general, we don't want to need to rely on the cell type information. So, we don't know that in going into. Know that in going into it, we're going to be able to detect regions that show this variability, and then again, we add in the information about cell type if we have that from an independent modality or some other prior biological information we can mark for genes. So, again, the ideas that we're going to detect these regions, they're going to be informative of things like cell type or other gene regulatory processes, for example. For example. So, kind of getting back to this idea of these detecting very remotely regions that are associated with sort of subpopulations of cell types or cell states, the key idea here is we want to leverage the structure of the data in the face of this sparsity and high dimensionality that to a first approximation the data is binary. So, if we start on the right-hand side, what we have, what we observe. Side, what we have, what we observe is when we zoom in to a particular region close enough, we can observe sort of the average methylation level across all the cells that we have covered in that region. So in this example, cartoon, I've got a region where 70% of the cells that I'm observing in that region are methylated and surrounded by some flanking regions that are not methylated. So we could imagine that this data arose. That this data arose from an underlying collection of three different subpopulations, where 30% are a subpopulation that's not methylated in that given region. And then we have two other subpopulations that are both methylated in that region. And one of them is 50%, and the other is 20% of the cells. So these two are two different sub-populations, but we're more. Two are two different subpopulations, but when we're zooming into a given region, remember it's either methylated or not methylated. So we don't really care essentially how many different subpopulations are here. Just that we can group them, however many arbitrary number of cell types there are, we can group them into two groupings. So we have the number of cell populations that are methylated in that particular region, and then the ones that are unmethylated. So that's kind of the key thing that we're going to leverage. A thing that we're going to leverage going forward. And in the framework that we have developed, so the framework is called VMR-Seq, emphasizing that it's detecting VMRs from sequencing data. So it's a computational method and software. So it's a two-step procedure. The first step is to scan the genome for candidate regions. So here's where we're not wanting to rely on binning into an arbitrary size of bins, and we have to choose the size of bins. And we have to choose the size of bins, and we don't want to rely on just predefined regions of interest. We actually want to use the entire genome scale data. So to do that, we look for regions that have higher variance than the rest of the genome. And to do that, there's kind of two smaller detail pieces of information that help us. So one is using relative methylation levels, and that's used to adjust for biases and uneven coverage. Biases and uneven coverage across the different cells, and another is using smoothing to sort of smooth out some of the noisiness that we see in the data since we have low coverage. And then once we have that sort of measure of variability on the y-axis there, then we find sort of candidate regions that are regions that could contain these VMRs. And those are the ones that have variability above a certain threshold. So the threshold, the So, the threshold, the red line there, we determine from using independent training data, so independent single-cell bisulfite sequencing data that has been sub-sampled to contain a more homogenous set of cells, and then look at the variability in that homogenous set of cells as training data to determine what is kind of our null threshold. Again, here we don't care about statistical significance. We're getting a set of candidate regions that we're A set of candidate regions that we're then going to look for enrichment of variable methylated regions. So in the next step, this is where we want to employ a probabilistic model to actually infer does the data support that there is an existence of a BMR, an existence of multiple subpopulations or not. So this is in contrast to previous approaches that may just take a May just take a percentage of the top 5% variable height methylate attributes, for example, is a common thing for previous approaches. So the second step is really looking at the likelihood of whether this data is arising from a data generating process that supports the existence of two groupings versus one grouping. So on the left here, this is the two grouping models. We cover this with a hidden Markov model where the underlying Hidden Markov model, where the underlying states here, the hidden states, are there are two states, and there's a methylated state and the unmethylated state. So this is referring to that grouping where we're saying however many subpopulations there are, there's the methylated, there's two of them, one of them is the methylated one in that particular region, the other is the unmethylated. And then we have our observed data, which we assume comes from that hidden state, so that's our methylated and our unmethylated counts. Methylated and our unmethylated counts. And then we have our overall kind of grouping proportions, the proportion of cells in each of those two groups of subtypes. And then we can, by solving this hidden Markov model, we can get the probability that the data arises from this process, but then we can also compare with the alternative model, which is the null setting, which is that there's just one grouping. The data does not support the existent. Support the existence of a methylated and non-methylated grouping. There's just kind of one grouping of cells. So, by comparing the likelihood under each of these settings, then we make a call, is there a VMR in this candidate region or not? And that's where we're actually doing the probabilistic model. So, what does the output look like? So, this is the same two regions I've shown before. So, the one on the left, this is the case, the two-grouping model is more. This is the case, the two-grouping model is more likely than the one-grouping model. And if you look at the hidden states here, this is the region where there's a methylated grouping and an unmethylated grouping. And then in this case, actually both, outside of the actual BMR, within the candidate region, we have both of the groupings are unmethylated and vice versa. Whereas the most likely situation for the non-BMR is they're all in the methylated state. The methylated state. So we can look at simulated data. I'm going to go through this fast because it's not as convincing because, of course, if we simulate, it's not going to be as realistic. But if we use simulated data, we show that the clustering accuracy in terms of F1 and APC is more accurate than existing approaches. And then getting back to our motivating data example of clustering mouse neurons, so we can use the ORI-sync approach and then competing. Competing previously existing approaches on the bottom row here. And if we look at metrics such as nearest neighbor score of how similar the cells in each cluster are, we see that the VMRC approach is showing higher or increased cluster separation compared to previous approaches. And then, just to end, sort of an interesting finding that we're following up on now is that. On now is that if we use multimodal data, so data where for each single cell, both single-cell methylation and single-cell RNA sequencing is measured in the same cell, and we try to leverage information that we're learning from the expression to see if we see any corresponding variation in the methylation. So, here is showing if we try to infer cell cycle in this mouse gastrulation data set from this 2019 nature paper. Nature paper. We can kind of cluster each of the cells into the G1S or G2M phase using just the expression. And then we want to look, is there any corresponding variation in the methylation corresponding to the cell cycle? So naively going into this, we wouldn't necessarily expect that methylation is changing throughout the cell cycle. It's actually kind of competing results in the literature of whether that does or does not happen. Does or does not happen. So we weren't sure what we would find, but we were seeing some interesting enrichment for cell cyclophanes and some previous enrichment for BMR output. So what we're seeing kind of as in our first look is that there does appear to be some variation with cell cycle. So within the cells at stage embryonic phase 6.5, we can see there's more of the S-phase cells down here, and there's a little bit more of enrichment of G2 pyl cells. Little bit more of enrichment of G2 pilot cells up here, and then same for here as well on stage 7.5. So that's something kind of interesting, it's just that there's some interesting associations that we can find with these features. So I'll end there and happy to take any questions here or on the floor. Don't turn the When you're looking for the BMR, we also need to filter them based on how whether it is more likely to have two status of mathematicians. I can imagine you have so like 30, like three meaning sites, I'd say, you can select. But if the two subpopulations you're looking for, the mathematician status or the mathematician difference is quite small, like the number of patients are quite small, then you're looking at a bunch of A bunch of sites that are not really different between this does not really have some population, how would that affect the results? So if I understand your question correctly, I think that gets to the sensitivity to the size of the subpopulation that's showing? I think it's probably the sensitivity to the difference, it's the number of regions that would represent the difference between the two. The number of regions. Okay, okay. Of regions. Okay, okay. So, one pretty important thing here is that the method itself does not try to infer the total number of cell populations present. So, it's trying to get these features, these VMRs, that you can then use as input to clustering algorithms, and then those could maybe leverage that information to make a call on the most likely number of subpopulations. But when we're zooming in and doing these hidden markup models within the regions, all it's trying to do is make a call. All it's trying to do is make a call probabilistically. Is there evidence that there are two different groupings? That there is one of the subpopulations that exists has an unmethylated state and the other has a methylated state? Versus, do they both, are they both methylated or both unmethylated? Or by both, I mean all of the subpopulations present. So it's agnostic to the number of subpopulations present. Interest of the time, we move the rest of the questions to Slack. Our next speaker is Jana Durant from Clinton University and he's going to talk about modeling gene regulation via a joint analysis of multimodal single cell data. So nothing more single cell data.
