Student, I wish we had a society like this, but I'm glad that we are at least trying to create it now. Okay, so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about my lab, one project in my lab. And what we do or what I'm interested in is thinking about or developing methods to investigate genetic variation to say something about human origins. And one thing that I'm really interested in. And one thing that I'm really interested in is the role of admixture. So whether that's been important or not. And when I say that, I am thinking about admixture from archaic Cubans, like Neanderthals, but also we are interested in admixture from more recent admixture events like what happened in the Americas with European colonization and the slave trade. Um and so we've known about Neanderthals for a long long long time but in 2010 we had the first draft of the month of the Neanderthal genome and so that really enabled comparisons between the Neanderthal genome and our genomes and people were able to identify that modern humans have traces of Neanderthal ancestry. But Neanderthals are not the only archaic human population. There's another group called the Nisavans. And the Nisavans, we know about the Nisavans from the Nisiva Cave, which lots of archaic remains have been excavated at this cave. These are samples of fossils. And what's fascinating about, or one of the findings here, is that from that little tiny fingerbone. From that little tiny finger bone, a whole genome was sequenced. It was not an neandersyl genome, it was not a monocumid genome, so they called it the Denisovans. So, what's fascinating about Denisovans is that we don't know anything about them really, and that's most of their fossil record. But we integrate with Denisovans, and when you think about who has the most invisibility intergression, it's not populations from Siberia where the Siberia, where that's where the bone came from, but it's populations from Oceania, like places like Australia or Papua New Guinea. And Europeans don't have Venice introgression, or very little. And so, in the last five years, there's been a handful of papers that have suggested that there's been more than one introgression. More than one introgression event from Benise events. And so there's some of the papers, and so they started with, oh, there's two introgression events, then three, and now there's up to four Denisovan introgression events, but not from the same Denisovan source, but from distinct Denisovan populations. And so the way this sort of This sort of inference was made is by thinking about the relationship of intraverse segments in humans and the sequence genome, the mesoven genome that we have. And so for instance, here we have three grey lines, so you can think of them as being human genomes. As being human genomes. Then you have these little triangles, yellow triangles. You can think of them as being segments of archaic ancestry. And so once you identify those, you can ask, well, what's the genetic similarity of these segments to the Denisovan genome or to the Neanderthal genome? And we know they're not going to be identical, right? There's going to be some distance. And so people do this. And let's say we take all the distance. This and let's say we take all the distances to the Nisibin genome. Then, people, what they do is they build a distribution like this. So, this is the match to the Nisibin, for instance, and this could be a match of one, something like a perfect match, or no, or no match. And so, you can see here there's two peaks, and the way this is interpreted as is there's two. Is there's two, there's a set of segments that are more similar to the sequence in Lisa, and there's a set of segments that are more distant to the lison. What that means is probably that there's one population. The population that actually intergressed with us is one of them is more closely related to the Nise events, the sequence in ease events, and another one is more distant. And that makes sense because. And that makes sense because the lineage that actually intrabres into humans, the number of differences is going to depend on the coalescence time of the sequence in these lineage and the intrarescent lineage. And so that's fine, but I think we need to think about how we classified the new cement segments. Segments. And so a lot of those papers, not all of them, but a lot of them classify segments as being Denise event by first identifying them as being archaic, and then they have a bunch of arbitrary steps to classify them as being from Denise events. So there's not like a statistical principle way of doing it. And the other thing is that a lot of the methods. The other thing is that a lot of the methods that have been, so this is not all of the methods, but a lot of the methods that have been identified or developed to detect archaic introgression typically do it in slightly different ways. So some of them actually use an archaic genome. Let's say they do an HMM, they use the archaic genome and they have some feature about the data that counts the archaic animals in like little windows or something like that. Like a little windows or something like that. Some of them don't use an archaic human sequence, none of the sequence archaic human genomes, but they'll use African populations as a population that does not have the Nisivan or Neanderthal intergression since this happened when humans expanded out of Africa. And so, what we wanted to do. And so, what we wanted to do is to make this inference jointly. We want to be able to jointly identify the NIS events and the undertill segments in the genomes. And so, this is a work that Deo postdoc is doing. Okay. And so, what we are doing is we're extending one of the methods called HMEndix, which does not use an RKQ. Which does not use an archaic human reference. And the idea is that you have two hidden states. So one of them is archaic and one of them is human in his paper. And so the features of the data that he's using, so he partitions the window into small windows. And the observations or the features of the data that he uses, Norritz, who 12, 8. Lorett's who 12H and Z, is to look at the number of variants that are private to the population that you want to identify introgression in. And so the idea is that when humans left Africa, that's only a subset of the genetic diversity that's in Africa. And so the only way to generate new genetic diversity is through new mutations, like DNA replication errors, or Errors or intergression with meander tools and the misimets. And so the idea is that if you have Windows where you have a lot of these private variants, then that effectively means you have high orientation rate or you have introgression, because that's another way to get variations. So what we are doing is we are just adding another state to have Leander's whole beyond the news event with the normal. And so, here, what we are doing is we are going to use the berries that are absent in Africa and present in Eurasia to sort of distinguish this introgression event from the underfolds, and then the ones that are just private to your target population to distinguish the ones that come from the nascent. And so, instead of collecting one observation per window. Collecting one observation per window, we're going to collect two. So, the number of variants that are private to Africa and the ones that are private to Africa and Europe, for instance. And so we can do this. And there's like a standard machinery for how to get the probability of being in a specific state. And so, with that, we can identify. And so with that, we can identify the segments. And so here, what I'm showing you is we apply this in Papua genomes. And so here on the x-axis, we have Neanderthal and the misimin. And so what we did is for each segment that we identified as Neanderthal, we asked, is it closer to the Neanderthal? If we identified If we identify it as a Neanderthal. And the same for insect. And at least for the ones that we identify as Neanderthal, they are indeed closer to the Neanderthal. And the ones that we identified as the Misovan are indeed closer to the Denisovan. And so one thing that we are working on now is try to. We are working on now is trying to think of: okay, so we did do some comparisons with the previous method, and we do a better job at classifying segments between the indices or Neanderthal. But there's still some that are there's still some confusion, but so we're working on coming up with a better way to classify this, maybe a post-process. Classify this, maybe a post-processing step, so that we can so that we can infer the split times of the different anisopen lineages and the population that the sequence inisibin belongs to. So, some of these have been inferred by some older folks, but some of these are still unknown. Okay. Um, so want to thank my lap? Want to thank my la and I want to plug my podcast that I do with my colleague Lurie Rolfs. So thank you. Go back to the previous line. Go back to the Pennsylvania. I'm trying to get my head wrapped around focusing on private alleles and how that will be affected by your sample size and the actual frequency of, say, denisopin alleles in a particular population. And, you know, so if you sample too much, you'll actually expect the denisopins to be at not a single copy, but at more than one copy. But it seems like your HMNIX algorithm could be expanded to not focus on. When you say sample size, you mean the When you say sample size, you mean in the humans, right? So we do it per individual. So you're looking at the private variance within a single individual. Relative, but it's private relative to that population, right? Yeah, so it's right, you're right. So it's relative to a whole sample. And that's a sample sign as I'm saying if it's too large, then nothing's private. You would be surprised. No, no, you're right. Yeah, I wish I guess for the I guess for the sample sizes that we have here, I think we have like 200 Africans and four Eurasians. So it's at least 1500 individuals, but there's still enough. Right, and if let's say denisovin allele frequencies are at 2%, then you know, then if that's the number that matters relative. But I don't think that you I think you could do double tens or something, not just single tens or Or something, not just singletons, or anyway, that's just a question about. Yeah, that's a good idea to think about. Yeah. So, in the HMM next file, do you take a fixed window size or the window size depends on the number of variants? It's fixed. So, you don't scale, so it doesn't affect the inference. Like, if you have windows with many variants, you are less likely to, or more likely to see that they're all private, or less likely to see them all. That they're all private, or less likely to see that they're all private, compared to a situation where you can only wander. So you're talking, sorry, I don't understand. So if you're less likely to see if what, if the window your confidence in the inference is going to depend on the number of variants that you happen to be in the window. Yes. So would it be better to So would it be better to change the window size based on the number of windows? Oh yeah. Um I mean the windows are so small that you don't expect that many, but you do ex I guess you I guess you kind of patch you get some probability for each window and then that's how you can then decide maybe that goes back to the question of the frequency. Of the frequency, right? So, frequencies are going to affect how many parents you're going to get in that particular. Yeah, so I think for the Windows sizes that we have right now, they're not that many, right? Because they're so small. Also, you don't want to have too many states because then what you're counting is have zero variants, one variant, two variants, or too many variants. Yeah. With Sally's question, I mean, maybe one reason. I mean, maybe one reason to only use the variance that should be absent in the is that even if the variance is only at 2% frequency in that sample, if it's absent in the Denisem, then that shouldn't be used as a signal of Denise and ancestry perhaps. Right? The only way you can be, but that kind of made me wonder, given that you have Given that you have arcade genomes, is there a reason to not use them in the step of identifying? I think, well, yeah, so one thing that we're thinking is actually use them as an outgroup population because you get information from not the lack of private variation between the archaic human and your target sample as well. So that's one way that you could. So that's one way that you can include it here. So you get information from private relative to, say, populations that don't have the NIST event ancestry, but also more similar to the sequence in NIST event than any other answer. So that's one thing we could do in this context.
