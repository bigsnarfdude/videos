Thank you very much for the invitation to speak and for this very nice workshop. There is a slight change of theme from what we have been hearing in the past two days. So I'm going to talk about quantum graphs. And towards the very end of the talk, I'll try to make a connection to quantum Markov semi-groups, which is like the main interest of this workshop. Okay, so here is a broad outline of my talk. Most of my talk is devoted to just introducing or giving an overview of quantum graph, because that's maybe relatively new to some of the people in this audience. And then there are different perspectives to quantum graphs. So you might have seen a definition of quantum graph, maybe in a different context. So I'll try to summarize the different perspectives that you have to quantum graphs in the literature. Perspectives that you have to quantum graphs in the literature. And then I'll talk about quantum graph homomorphisms, which is the closest thing that I could find to the theme of this workshop, because quantum graph homomorphisms are essentially quantum channels. So that is something that many of you might relate to. And then lastly, I'll try to make some connections to quantum market semiconductors. Okay, so let's begin with understanding or motivating the idea of a quantum graph from a class. Idea of a quantum graph from a classical graph. So, a classical graph typically has a vertex set, which is some points, and then there is an edge set, which are lines connected between these points. So, here is an example of a very simple classical graph. So, this has three vertices, and there are edges represented by these lines. And often, you can represent the structure of a classical graph by a matrix called its adjacency matrix. So, this matrix. So this matrix typically has zeros and ones as its entries. Okay, so it has zeros and ones as its entries. And the positions of the ones represent an edge on the graph. So for example, there is an edge between 1 and 2 here. And so the first row, second column has an entry 1. And 2 and 3 don't have an edge. So the second row, third column has an entry 0 in this matrix. So, what we typically do with adjacency matrices is that the entries are zeros and ones. But one way to generalize this structure is to allow the ones to be replaced by other values. So instead of just looking at a matrix with ones, you can allow the ones to be possibly replaced by other complex valued entries. And instead of looking at just a single matrix, you can instead look at a collection of matrices that have this skeleton structure as this adjacent. This skeleton structure as this adjacency matrix, but now the ones are allowed to be replaced by other values, including zeros. So, now what happens is that a single matrix in this collection is no longer sufficient to give you all the information about the graph. But the collection as a whole gives you the same information as the adjacency matrix. Because if there is a zero in any position, or if there is a non-zero entry in any position of a matrix in this collection, then you Of a matrix in this collection, then you know that there is an edge between those corresponding vertices in the graph. Yeah, so I'm going to assume that my graph is reflexive and undirected, and so therefore the adjacency matrix is reflexive and undirected, but these matrices need not be symmetric. So, you can, so all the stars can be different values, so that's why I've used different colors, so it's not necessarily a symmetric matrix. The graph? No. So actually, at this point, I'll also assume that the graph is connected. Yeah, that's right. So reflexive means there are loops on each of the vertices, and so that means there are ones on the diagonal of the adjacency matrix. That's right. Okay, so from a classical graph, you can construct a collection of matrices, but this is not just any. Matrices, but this is not just any set, it's actually more than just a set, as we will see. But an alternate way of writing this same set is as span of matrix units, Eij, where the ij indices come from the vertices of the graph. So these are just matrix units that are given by the edges in the graph. And so what are the properties of this collection? So first of all, it's a linear subspace by definition, because I've allowed the stars to take Because I've allowed the stars to take all possible complex valued numbers, it's going to be a subspace. And since I assume that the graph is undirected, therefore this set is closed under adjoint. So that goes back to your previous question. The matrices are not symmetric, but the set is closed under adjoint. So if you have a set in this collection, then its adjoint will also belong there. And then, since I assume that the graph is reflexive, the identity matrix is also going to belong to this collection. And so if this And so, if this property looks familiar to you, it's actually an operator system. So, one way of defining an operator system is that it's a linear subspace in a matrix algebra that contains the identity and is closed under adjoint. So, what we see is that starting from a classical graph, you can arrive at an operator system. So, as I said, this is one way of defining this operator system. It's the span of the matrix units where the The matrix units, where the indices of the matrix units arise from loops or edges in the graph. But more than just an operator system, there is a key property. It's a bimodal property. So what I mean by that is this operator system, S sub G, is a bimodule over the diagonal matrices. So this means that if you take a diagonal matrix on the left and on the right, and multiply it with an element of this operator system, then it will be absorbed into the operator system. Then it will be absorbed into the operator system. So, this collection Sg is an operator system and it is also a bimodule over this diagonal subalgebra. And it's precisely this bimodule property that allows it to capture the relation between the vertices of the graph. And so, if there is something that you take away from this talk, then this is the key idea that a quantum graph is an operator system with a bimodal property. And now, this algebra. Property. And now, this algebra is going to change, and that is how you get interesting structures. But this is the most underlying idea: that it is basically an operator system in some B of H, bounded operators on a Hilbert space, satisfying some bimodal property. Okay, so here is the more abstract definition, as you might probably see. So, this is like the most general definition, and its special cases arise in various contexts. So, in order to define a quantum So in order to define a quantum graph, the first thing you need is an analog of the vertex set. And in the non-commutative setting or in the quantum setting, this quantum set is given by a C star algebra. So a finite dimensional one-numan algebra for this talk. And there is an operator system which satisfies a certain bimodal property. So this operator system is closed under the weak star topology, and it is a bimodule over the commutant of M. bimodule over the commutant of M. So M is represented in B of H and the set of all elements that commute with M is called the commutant of M. And so this operator system has this bimodal property with respect to that commutant. So maybe some examples will help to digest this definition. So how do you view a classical graph as a quantum graph? So if you have a classical graph, let's say with a vertex set V and an edge set E on n vertices. E on n vertices, then you can identify the vertices with diagonal matrix units. So you can view this. This is what you always do, even like classical probability to quantum probability. So you identify these vertices with these diagonal matrix units. And so this algebra of vertices now is the diagonal algebra. And the commutant is going to be the diagonal algebra itself. And the graph operator system that I showed in the very Showed in the very first slide is going to be an operator system satisfying this definition as a law. So, in this way, you can view a classical graph as a quantum graph. The more useful one that you often encounter in quantum information theory is matrix quantum graph. So, here our vertex set is the full matrix algebra. And so, if you think of Mn with the standard representation, the commutant is just the scalar multiples of the identity. The identity. And then any operator system will therefore trivially be a bimodule over this commutant. And so any operator system over Mn is now going to be a quantum graph in this sense. And this is also known as matrix quantum graph or non-commutative graph, as you might have seen in some papers. And as I pointed out earlier, not every operator system is going to trace back to a classical graph. So if you want an operator system to necessarily come from a classical graph, system to necessarily come from a classical graph, then it must be a bimodule over this diagonal algebra dn. Okay, so why is it called quantum? So there must be some connection to quantum information theory. So basically quantum graphs generalize what is known as confusibility graphs of classical channels. So here is a very vague way to define a confusibility graph, but think of a communication But think of a communication channel. So let's say you're sending some alphabets X1, X2, XM through a noisy communication channel. And so what happens is that maybe two alphabets, let's say B and D, might be confused as the same output by the receiver due to noise in the channel. So this is a noisy communication channel where two inputs might be delivered as the same output at the receiver's end. So this confusion in the communication channel can be depicted. Communication channel can be depicted by a classical graph, and this is called the confusibility graph of this channel. So, basically, the input messages that you're transmitting through the channel are the vertices of this graph. And whenever two messages may be confused, so let's say x1 and x2 can be confused, so then they are connected by an edge on this graph. And if you look at this, x1 and x5 never lead to the same output in this particular example. So, x1 and x5 are not confusible. X1 and X5 are not confusible upon transmission, and so therefore they are not directly connected by an edge. So, in this way, you can model the confusion arising in a noisy communication channel through a classical graph called the confusibility graph. And basically, what quantum graphs do is precisely they play the analogous of this in quantum communication. So, if instead of a classical channel, you were using a quantum channel, then the confusibility graph that you get. The confusibility graph that you get in that corresponding picture will happen to be a quantum graph. And so that's how, or maybe that is one of the reasons why it's called a quantum graph. So to see the more precise definition in this context, let me recall that by a quantum channel, I mean a linear map that is completely positive and trace-preserving. And so we know that completely positive maps have a Krauss representation. And so if you begin with a class And so if you begin with a classical, sorry, with a quantum channel, let's say between two matrix algebras with a certain Krauss representation, then you can associate an operator system to it, which basically plays the role of the confusibility graph. And this operator system is given by this span of the product of these Krauss operators. So maybe one way to see this is if you embedded a classical channel as a quantum channel. As a quantum channel, and then you drew its confusibility graph, and then wrote the graph operator system, then you would precisely arrive at this definition that you see here. So, this is a generalization of the idea of confusibility graph, but in the quantum setting. Oh, it's linear span, that's a good question. Right. And in this paper, this was given by Duwan Seven. Paper, this was given by Duwan, Severini, and Winter. They also show that, in fact, every quantum graph, a matrix quantum graph, basically arises as the confusibility graph of some quantum channel. So if you begin with an operator system in a matrix algebra, then you can find a quantum channel on the appropriate size such that this operator system will correspond to the confusibility graph of that channel. And one thing that I must say is that although this definition uses That although this definition uses the Krauss representation, they also show that it is independent of the Krauss representation. So, even if you have a different Krauss representation, I think you get a bijection or an isomorphism, so you get the same operator system. Okay, so with that little motivation, maybe I'll complete the motivation with some more significance. So, this is the same noisy communication channel that I showed earlier. And so, if you think about it, And so if you think about it, let's say you want to know the channel capacity. So what is the maximum number of messages that you can transmit through this channel without any confusion? Then if you look at this graph, it's basically the independence number of this graph. So it's the largest subset that is mutually non-adjacent. So if you want to study what they call the one-shot zero error capacity of the channel, it's the same as finding the independence number of the confusibility graph. Number of the confusibility graph. So, similarly, in the quantum case, if you want to know what is the capacity of the quantum channel, then you can study some of the parameters of the associated quantum graph to compute its capacity. And in particular, a very simple characterization for two messages to not be confusable is if they satisfy this orthogonality relation with respect to this operator system. And so, therefore, quantum graphs often arise in zero. Therefore, quantum graphs often arise in zero-error quantum communication. Okay, but there is also just genuine mathematical interest in quantum graphs. So in fact, quantum graphs have appeared in different disguises in various branches of mathematics, including C-star algebra, non-commutative topology, category theory, and quantum symmetries. And so, if you have seen quantum graphs before, then I would like to say that there are two main definitions. To say that there are two main definitions. So, one is this operator system model that I introduced earlier. So, this builds on the idea that you are trying to quantize the edges of the graph. So, the edges of the graph are basically modeled, or basically the edges model relation between some vertices. And what you do in the quantum case is Nick, Weaver, and Cooperberg introduced something known as quantum relations. And you can view a quantum graph. You can view a quantum graph as a quantum relation on a quantum vertex set, and you're looking at a reflexive and maybe symmetric quantum relation, which precisely turns out to be an operator system. So this operator system model is built on the idea of the edge set. But there is also a different model that independently arose in category theory and non-commutative topology. And that uses the idea of the adjacency matrix. So as you know, that a graph can be expressed using vertices and edges or Using vertices and edges or using an adjacency matrix. So there are two ways to talk about a graph. And so similarly for a quantum graph, to define a quantum graph, once you fix the quantum vertex set, it is sufficient to define an operator that mimics this role of the adjacency matrix. And that's called a quantum adjacency matrix. And this was introduced by First in Musto, Reuter, and Verdon in this very categorical paper involving tensor calculus, where they study quantum sets and quantum. Where they study quantum sets and quantum functions. And even though these notions appeared in very different contexts at different times, it can be shown that they are equivalent notions. So maybe I'll briefly define what is the quantum adjacency operator model, because I thought it was related to one of the talks that we heard yesterday. Okay, so for the quantum adjacency model of a quantum graph, there are two things that you need to define a quantum graph in this setting. So first of Quantum graph in this setting. So, first of all, you need a set that plays the role of the vertex set, and they call this a quantum set. So, it's basically a finite-dimensional C-star algebra, but you also want it to have a Hilbert space structure. And so you do this by fixing a faithful tracial state. So, once you fix a state, then you have this associated G and S Hilbert space, and you can view this set or this C star algebra M as both a Hilbert space and a C star algebra. The quantum set is basically of C. Set is basically of C star algebra along with a fixed trace. And then there is an operator on this set, which plays the role of an adjacency matrix. So in the classical case, if you think of the adjacency matrix, it has some very natural properties. So for example, it has entries zeros and ones. So what it means is that if you have the matrix and if you multiply it with itself pointwise, the sure multiplication, then you get. twice, the sure multiplication, then you get back the same matrix. So that's what it means to have zeros and ones as its entries. So in the quantum setting, you can recast that sure idempotent property through this condition. Then if the graph is reflexive, you have ones along the diagonals of the adjacency matrix. So that is given by this condition here. And lastly, if the graph is undirected, then this quantum or this adjacency matrix normally is symmetric. And so the symmetry in this setting is. And so the symmetry in this setting is given by this picture. Yeah, correct. I should have put that first. So M is this multiplication map. So M is a C star algebra. So it's this usual multiplication map. And eta is this co-unit map. So the unit map in the C star algebra structure. And this M star and ETA star are their duals with respect to this GNS Hilbert space structure. with but space structure m tensor m yeah so um like this definition of half star algebra has this multiplication map it's that one yeah yeah so in the c star algebra there is this multiplication operation yeah it's just that Right. Yeah, so if that's right. So if this if this was all replaced by the classical setting, then the sure idempotency condition would exactly correspond to A, sure multiplied with A. Yeah. Okay, so this was not very relevant, but I just wanted to give an overview. But I just wanted to give an overview of quantum graphs in case there is some interest eventually. So, there are actually multiple definitions as you might see in the literature. And so, this was just like a small summary of the different definitions you might encounter. And the very first one, matrix quantum graph, is the one that you typically see in the context of quantum information theory. So, where this operator system corresponds to the confusibility graph of some quantum channel. And, of course, you can cast. Course, you can cast the properties of the graph in different ways. So, if the graph has to be reflexive or undirected, then you can impose certain conditions that will. So, these are all equivalent. It can be shown that there is a correspondence between them. I must warn that there is not a one-to-one correspondence. So, several quantum adjacency matrices might give rise to the same operator system. So, this is not a one-on-one correspondence. But, yeah, so the last two rows have a bi-jerk. But yeah, so the last two rows have a bijective correspondence, but the others don't. Yeah, right. Yeah, so that's why there is a state on psi. Yeah, so the G N is Hilbert space L to M psi. So M is an algebra, but you can also view it as a Hilbert space. You can also view it as a Hilbert space using the state psi. And then, with respect to that Hilbert space structure and M as a map on this Hilbert spaces, you can talk about a dual. Yeah, so that's why they call it a set. It has both an algebra structure as well as a Hilbert space structure, and you interplay with both the structures depending on the need. Okay, I'm happy to maybe talk about it more after the talk to clarify. All right, so going to homomorphisms. So we know what a graph homomorphism is. So basically, it is a mapping from one graph to the other, which preserves the adjacency structure. So you map the vertices such that two adjacent vertices in the first graph map to adjacent vertices in the second graph. So a natural question to ask. So, a natural question to ask is: What can you say about homomorphisms between quantum graphs? And apparently, since quantum graphs have appeared in various contexts, a lot of people have asked this question. And so, this is an incomplete list of people who have studied homomorphisms of quantum graphs. And maybe I can very quickly say some things about some of these studies. So, the first one here is the very purely operator. The very purely operator system version of defining a homomorphism. So, you know, quantum graphs can be viewed as operator systems, and a natural way to define a homomorphism is in this category of operator systems. So, it's basically just a unital complete order isomorphism between the operator systems. That is one way you can define a homomorphism between quantum graphs. There is this other study by Stalker, which is maybe more popular in the quantum information community. Information community. So they use some Krauss operators which embed one operator system into the other. And then there is this more categorical approach that uses the idea of quantum functions. Then there is this idea of quantum relations, and you can talk about push forward and pull back of these mappings. And there is also a notion using this quantum adjacency matrix. So you look at certain intertwining operators that take one adjacent matrix. Operators that take one adjacency matrix to the other. And then the last three are from a very different perspective, what is known as non-local games. So if you've heard of quantum games, it's a very growing topic. So these are games played between two players where they cannot communicate directly, but they have access to quantum entanglement to make some decisions. And so these last three papers use this idea of quantum non-local gateway. Of quantum non-local games to define homomorphisms between quantum graphs. So the first one talks about homomorphisms from classical graphs to quantum graphs. The other paper talks about quantum graphs to classical graphs. And the third one is a homomorphism between quantum graph to classical graph, quantum to quantum, combining the first two. Okay, so I thought I should talk about at least one of them in more detail. So my guess was that. So, my guess was that probably Stahlke's version is the most familiar here, or might be of most interest because of the quantum connections. And so, I'll talk about this entanglement-assisted homomorphisms between quantum graphs. So, basically, the way it is defined is that there are two matrix quantum graphs. So, you can just think of S as an operator system in some matrix algebra, and T as another operator system in some matrix algebra. Oh, it is traceable. Algebra. Oh, it is trace-free, so it's not an operator system. So I'm looking at an irreflexive case. So there are no loops on the vertices of the graph. So you're basically looking at a trace-free version of an operator space. Okay. And so the way you can define a homomorphism between two graphs in this context is we say that there is a classical homomorphism between the quantum graph S to T. If there is S to T if there is a quantum channel with a certain Krauss representation that satisfies this property. So basically, the linear span of conjugations by these Krauss operators take one operator system to the other. So basically, you can think of it as a quantum operation that takes one graph to the other. And so this is. And so, this is called classical homomorphism because there is no use of entanglement here. So, there is also a quantum version of the homomorphism. So, basically, what it says is that there is a quantum homomorphism from S to T if you have an ancilla. So, it's a finite dimensional von Norman algebra, and there is some operator in this space, and then there is a quantum channel, which basically takes. Which basically takes now, so you have elements from the first graph as well as like an operator from this answer. And the combined system is taken from one unit to the other. So here there is an entanglement involved. So that is depicted by this vonomen algebra n. And so therefore, this is a quantum homomorphism. So this is the way. So, this is the way that Stalke introduced quantum graph homomorphism. Maybe another way that I was telling about, which is also very interesting to people in non-local games and maybe more quantum information, interactive proverb systems, is these last three papers that use the idea of a non-local game. So, what is a non-local game? So, basically, a non-local game involves two players and a referee. Involves two players and a referee. So the players are generally called Alice and Bob. And there is a fixed set of questions and a fixed set of answers. And there are multiple rounds in the game. And the way each round of the game is played is that the referee randomly samples two questions from this fixed question set. And they send one question to Alice and the other question to Bob. And then the players, Alice and Bob, must individually respond with an answer. Respond with an answer and send it back to the referee. And the players are not allowed to communicate with one another during this process, although they may communicate before the game begins. And it's called a non-local game because you can think of this as two people living in two separated spaces. So there is a non-locality involved. They're in like two separate labs without direct communication. And basically, once the referee has access to all the questions and answers. Has access to all the questions and answers. He has a decision function, lambda. He plugs all that values into the decision function. And if it gives you a zero, then they lose. And if it gives a one, then they win the round. So a very well-studied game is the graph homomorphism game. So here you have two fixed classical graphs, so G1 and G2, and the inputs for the game are basically vertices from one of the graph, and the outputs for the game are vertices from the other graph. From the other graph. So, what happens in the game is that the referee randomly picks two vertices from the first graph and sends one to Alice and one to Bob. And they are expected to respond with the homomorphic images of these vertices from the other graph. So they respond with two vertices from the other graph, and then the referee checks whether it's a valid homomorphism. So basically, if the graphs, if the vertices that were sent as inputs were adjacent, then their responses should also be adjacent in the second graph. In the second graph. And if they had received the same vertices as their inputs, then they must agree on their outputs as the same vertex. So basically, the referee checks whether their answers are giving you valid homomorphisms to the graph. And what's really interesting here is that there are multiple rounds, and the referee doesn't have memory of one round over the other. So even if there is not a genuine homomorphism between two graphs, but at any point of time, the referee is only checking locally at two given vertices and not like for the whole graph. Two given vertices and not like for the whole graph. So he checked for two points, but then when the next round begins, he already forgot those two points and he's checking at another point. So often the players can fool the referee into believing that there is a valid homomorphism between the graphs, even though there is not. And the players can use different strategies to decide on their responses. So the game is challenging because there is no direct communication, but it's also interesting exactly due to that fact. So the players can use entanglement. So, the players can use entanglement, like they can make some measurements on their individual labs, but it's an entangled system. So, the outcome of their measurement magically has an effect on the outputs of the other person. And so, they can use entanglement to correspond to their responses. And so, there are many games where the players can win a game with certainty using some quantum resource. Certainty using some quantum resources, but not with classical resources. Okay, so there is like a whole vast theory of non-local games, which could be an entire conference in itself. But I'll just say that in my paper with Mike Brannon and Sam Harris, we generalized this quantum graph homomorphism game from quantum graphs to classical graphs. So this game that I was defining here was between one classical graph to another graph. Here was between one classical graph to other classical graph. But you can also talk about a homomorphism game, which generalizes this idea, but it's from a quantum graph to a classical graph. And so using the winning strategies of such a non-local game, we came up with a different definition of a quantum graph homomorphism. So here we have two graphs. We are looking at a homomorphism from a quantum graph G. So it's an operator system S living in some matrix algebra. Matrix algebra, and there is a classical graph with a vertex set V and edge set E. And so we say that there is a classical homomorphism from this quantum graph to classical graph. If there is a projection-valued measure, so what I mean by that is that these are some projections, so self-adjoint idempotent elements that add up to the identity operator. So that's what I mean by a projection-valued measure. Let's satisfy this annihilation. Satisfy this anhylation or this compression condition. So basically, this definition is motivated by the winning strategies of this non-local game that I was trying to introduce earlier. So these PAs or projections basically come from the strategies of the players. And since this is a synchronous game, there is only one family of projections. And this condition basically just means that the adjacency condition is preserved during the game. Condition is preserved during the game. So, this is a way to define homomorphism between graphs using the idea of non-local games. And you can also generalize this to the quantum setting, meaning the use of entanglement. So, here basically, you define a homomorphism from G to G if there is an ancillary, so it's a finite-dimensional one-numbered algebra, and there is a unit vector which gives rise to a faithful normal trace. To a faithful normal trace. And then there is a projection-valued measure which now lives on this bigger space m tensor n, which satisfies the same condition as above, but now you have amplified it to a bigger space with the answer. Okay, so these are two very different ways of looking at homomorphisms. One in the Stalkin notion, which uses these Krauss operators to embed one operator system into the other. And this is a more non-looking. And this is a more non-local game way of approaching quantum graph homomorphisms. And basically, we show that these two are equivalent definitions. So in this theorem, not getting into the details, we basically show that the homomorphisms defined by Stalke are the same as the homomorphisms that we define using the non-local game approach. Okay, so this was. So this was all about quantum graphs, but now I want to say something that might be of use to people here. So how does this relate to QMS? And before I say this, I have a quick story to share. So there was a student who, maybe a small student, who knew an essay of a cow. So he knew how to write an essay on a cow. A cow has like four legs, one tail, and all that. And then he goes to the exam. And then he goes to the exam. And then on the exam, they ask him essay on a tree. And then he doesn't know how to write an essay on a tree. So he writes this entire essay on the cow. And on the last line, he writes that the cow was tied to the tree. So that's exactly what my last slide is all about. I said everything I knew about quantum graphs, and now I'm going to probably say something about QMS, which is also not useful. But so if you have a quantum Markov semi-group, If you have a quantum Markov semi-group, you can look at the pre-dual, and so that is going to give you a semi-group of quantum channels. And so, with each quantum channel, you can associate a quantum graph. So, the confusibility graph of that quantum channel. So, in this way, from a quantum Markov semi-group, you can get a family of quantum graphs. And so, a very natural question to ask is, can you praise the properties of this QMS in terms of parameter? In terms of parameters of this quantum graph family. So, for example, we know a lot about some parameters of quantum graphs like independence number, chromatic number, and so on. So, can you phrase questions like existence of an invariant state for this QMS in terms of some parameter for this quantum graph family, or irreducibility in terms of maybe, let's say, connectivity or connected components of the quantum graph? So, these are some conditions that I'm, these are some questions that I'm really interested. Some questions that I'm really interested in thinking about, and I know very little about QMS, and I hope to gain from the expertise in this audience. All right, so with that, I would like to thank you. Are there any questions? Like when when you have more fizzma, you you want like some properties to be preserved. Like some properties to be preserved. So I didn't get exactly what kind of properties of your graph are preserved by various, well, you can pick maybe the quantum, the most general definition of morphism, or like equivalently, if you have like two graphs which are isomorphic, what can you say? What features are preserved? Right. So when you talk about homomorphism. So, when you talk about homomorphism, the only thing that you're preserving is the adjacency structure. So, for example, for a classical graph, all you're looking at is the graph adjacency structure is preserved. And similarly, for quantum graphs, they're only looking at this operator system which models this adjacency, or the adjacency operator is being preserved or transformed in like a very unitary way, let's say. But if you talk about isomorphism between quantum graphs, which has also been studied, you can show that some parameters are preserved, like the chromatic. Some parameters are preserved, like the chromatic number of this quantum graph would be the same as the chromatic number of the other quantum graph. And maybe independence number is also preserved. So some graph parameters are preserved while others are not. That is my PhD thesis. Yeah, I can talk to you a lot about it. There's one notion of a quantum graph homomorphism that involves quantum channels, right? So if the quantum graphs themselves are such quantum computability graphs coming from quantum channels, can one make explicit what that means for the involved channels? Yeah, I did think about it. And one way of maybe interpreting it is like there is one, okay, maybe for Is one, okay, maybe for isomorphism. So, there is one quantum communication channel, and you are transforming it into another channel such that the noise is preserved. We are not increasing the noise in this new channel. So, that is what it would mean for a quantum graph isomorphism in that case. So, it's just a transformation of the original quantum channel into a new channel with noise preserved. Excuse me, can I make some small comments? Yes, please. There was a paper by Silvert Yashin which discusses the semigroups on quantum graphs. So there is possible another connection between this story. So there are people, for example, Sierra Tyashon, who analyzed the exactly semi-groups and trying to obtain some. Semi-groups and trying to obtain something like GKSL, like Forbes on not on C star on quantum graphs and how to delete it to the from a quantum graph to the to the to the algebra. So we just know dynamics on quantum graph and trying to delay it to the algebra. So there are this kind of questions. So possibly you can be. So, possibly, you can be maybe you're interested in such things. Yeah, thank you very much for that comment. That's really useful. And I must add that there is this other notion of quantum graphs, which appears in differential equations. So, it's an operator, and it's totally different from anything that I said. So, there is a clash of terminology, but I hope that the one that you're mentioning is still this, but I'm really curious to look at it. Actually, it's exactly Parato. It's exactly operator systems. I just said it. It's exactly about operator systems. It possibly even knows the words of the quantum graph or not. It's exactly about operator systems. Great. Thank you. Thank you so much. When you defined this quantum graphs, I thought all the Vonavan algebras are finite dimensional. But most of this quantum mass of simple things we are giving is infinite dimensions. Do you have any corresponding version of your quantum graphs with infinite dimensional operator system? Right. So like as I was writing this up, I realized that most people would want an infinite dimensional version. But right now, the quantum graph literature is like really young and there hasn't been any study on the infinite dimensional version. But this general definition here that was given by Nick Weaver is applicable to infinite dimensions. To infinite dimensions. So, in principle, you can talk about quantum graphs where this space is infinite-dimensional, but nothing has been done ahead of time. I would like to write, take a simple channel, something like a deep speaker channel, and then write down the corresponding channel. Right, yeah. Yeah, that's yeah, that's a good point that I haven't looked at it, but thank you. To that, I haven't looked at it, but thank you. Yeah. Do you know that the X is from a most cases? Oh, okay. Right. So, well, I can answer for the non-local game scenario. So, for some games, we know that there exists a perfect strategy, and so we know there exists a home of. Strategy, and so we know there exists a homomorphism. So, in those cases, you can actually explicitly construct the homomorphism because you're guaranteed of its existence. But, for example, the style case version, you do not know. Okay, that's thanks.
