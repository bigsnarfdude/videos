I have a very good remembering of my stay four years ago, I think, when you organized this kind of scientific exchange. Unfortunately, the situation is not the same. Okay, so I'm going to present some recent results which are being obtained by Batiste Hardy, a PhD student at the Université Catholique de Louvain. Louvain and we have a collaboration together on this subject. Okay, so in fact, I'm going to. This is the outline of my presentation and I make a short presentation, introduction, which is very general and probably you have done all the same. And after I will focus to remember what is done in general to account for freed force in CFDDM or to field model approaches. DDM or two field model approaches. And then how we could try to use microstructures to account for the effect. No, I mean orientation tensor. So we have tried to define some tensor properties to characterize the effect of microstructure. And we have measured this effect in a specific array of random fixed array of particles to try to see. Of particle to try to see if we can obtain some interesting insight by using this approach. Okay, so just to say that there are many applications which are concerned by this kind of problem, but we all know that. And there are still many open questions. So this is why this kind of meeting are always very fascinating, because there are many physical mechanisms or modeling challenges which remain open. Which remain open. And hopefully, the development of the numerical simulation approaches gives us a lot of insight, which can help us to improve the modeling in a frame of a multi-scale approach. I think it's very interesting too. In fact, my talk is on this range: how we can use particle result simulation in order to give some information to the mesoscopic scale, discrete particle simulation, or maybe. Discrete particle simulation, or maybe either to the macroscopic scale, which are using a error approach. Okay, so what is done in general when you want to model the force on single particle, the situation is quite simple if you are considered a very dilute situation at a low particle Reynolds number. According to Maxé-Rele on the Getty. According to Max Evile and Gatiniol in 1983, you can more or less write the force applied on the particle by the fluid, Fp in terms of Archimedes forces, which represent the, in fact, it's representing the undisturbed field force on the field element coinciding with the solid particle and an additional charge, which is due to the fluid flow perturbation by the particle present. Perturbation by the particle presents, and normally you have the drag force, the added mass, the history force, and so on. This force is written in terms of the relative velocity of the particle with respect to this undisturbed field velocity at the particle center. And if I assume, and I will not discuss that, the dominant force in my case is a drag force, then I can write this force just under this very classical. Under this very classical form, by introducing this drag coefficient, which is given in terms of a Reynolds number, based on this relative velocity, and here you have the definition of the relative velocity between the particle velocity and the undisturbed field velocity at the particle position. For larger Reynolds number on dilute flows, in general, we assume that we can use the same type. Use the same type of approach, but we have to change the drag coefficient in order to account for the dependence on the Reynolds number, and you can use the Schiller-Norman correlation. Now, if you want to apply this modeling to CFD-DM, it's very simple. You just assume that this is fine and you can use it. You are normally simulating the feed flow on a mesh, which is. flow on a mesh which is large with respect to the particle size. In fact, this field flow is perturbated, this resolved field flow is perturbated by the particle. But in general, you assume that you can interpolate this field velocity at the particle position, but it is not always the case. I know some people here, Olivier de Jardin and others, have tried to make a better word in order to A better world in order to estimate this contribution, the undisturbed contribution. In the frame of the TFM approach, when I mean TFM, I mean the fluid phase average and kinetic theory for the particles, so it's more hybrid approach. In fact, we use the same type of assumption, and what we need is to close the moments, the fourth moment, which appear in the Which appear in the mean velocity equation and in the kinetic stress of the particle or in the fluid correlation. And so, in fact, you just apply the same, you assume the same assumption, and after you have some additional assumption in order to close these terms. But it is not the purpose of my talk. Then, what happens if I am interested in If, if I am interested in dance situation. And in fact, before to go to dance particulate flow, I start from a very classical case which is used extensively to estimate this force applied on a particle. And this is a fixed uniform random array. And when you have a fixed uniform random array, you can compute the average force applied on a particle. Applied on a particle. And this average force is connected to the total pressure gradient across the array, but can also written by analogy with the Kregius expression as two contributions. A first contribution, which is equivalent to the Achimedes forces, so it's just a pressure gradient by the volume of the particle, plus an additional contribution which represents the residual contribution. Represent the residual contribution or which is equivalent to the drag force in the dilute case. And this residual field force is assumed to be aligned with the mean field velocity, which is logical if it's a random array, a uniform random array, just by symmetry. And this force is given in the literature by correlation, which are extracted from experiments or by the array of the corrections From experiments or by particle result simulation, for example, the one I have quoted just before. And so you can find in the literature some various correlation for this force I will not discuss, which are all in terms of the volume fraction on the Reynolds number of the particle. And then, for example, you can compare this correlation with respect to the solid volume fraction. To the solid volume fraction, and at a Reynolds number of 15 facts, the variance correlations are not so bad, and you have a very strong increase of this mean force with the volume fraction. And this is crucial if you want to predict fluidize bed, because this non-linearity of the drag is very important to capture the cluster formation on the cluster. Formation on the cluster-induced turbulence, for example. The problem is how we can use this information in CFD-DM. In general, in fact, we use directly this coefficient in the simulation of the force acting on a particle. So, in fact, when you are a particle in a given cell of your simulation, you compute the The force acting on the field force acting on the particle in terms of the pressure gradient of your simulation, and an additional drag, which is a function of these dimensionless forces I gave you before, which is a function of the local volume fraction on the particle Reynolds number and the relative velocity of the particle with respect to the fluid velocity at the position of the particle. Velocity at the position of the particle, and you can see that the force is aligned with the mean flow in the cell. Okay, and this is a very questionable assumption, and we will see that later on, because due to the local arrangement of the particle, you may have a very different instantaneous force, even if the mean value is correctly given by the previous correlation. Correlation. In fact, for the two-free model approach, it's exactly the same. We use the same assumption. And finally, we assume that these moments are given in terms of this mean drag coefficient in the fixed array or slightly modified eventually. Okay, so this introduction was just to remind. I agree. Just to remember, I agree also that some people have tried to improve that, but this is really at the beginning. In practice, most of the closure models used in practical code are based on this assumption. The problem is typically connected to the picture I show you here. You can see that you have a very non-uniform distribution of the fluid flow, and so the force, and this is an instantaneous picture of a simulation. picture of a simulation across a random array, a three-dimensional random array of particles. And I show you an instantaneous, in fact, fixed plane of the axial velocity component, just to show you the heterogeneity of the fluid flow. And due to the distribution of the relative distribution of the particle, it is clear that the force, instantaneous force applied on the particle, even at a very small scale, is very Even at a very small scale, it is very, very different according to the local arrangement or to the microstructure of the flow. Typically, you are you this is a result which has been obtained by us, that was already presented by Anthony Vax, for example, in some of this paper, which shows the distribution of the force normalized by the mean streamwise force. On the left, you have the distribution. left you have the the distribution of the streamwise force you can see that the the the square root is very important with respect to the mean force and on the right you have the same thing for the transverse force and you can see that the transverse force fluctuation which is normalized by the streamwise force which is the only mean force which remains you can see that the transverse force is That the transverse force is also very large and implies that you have probably some translation, transverse motion of the particle which is induced by this force. So in fact, the CFDDM and TFM approach are usually neglecting this effect. And I believe that this force may play an important role in the production of friction particle velocity and in the mean transverse dispersion of the particle. Dispersion of the particle. There are some very interesting first propositions which are found in the literature. I think that Balashandar shows something at the late conference about this work, how we try to account for the force variation within arrays of only the sparse spherical particle. There is also some work on VAX on colleagues and a stochastic Lagrangian model proposed in the paper of Mirian. Paper of Miria and Cubramoni. In the paper I want to present you, we propose to develop a specific approach which is based on a tensor, a local tensor that we have introduced in order to account for the local distribution of the particle. In fact, in the flow that we consider, we can say that if we are looking to a given particle in the array, everything is given. Everything is given in terms of the particle Reynolds number, the solid volume fraction, the mean solid volume fraction, the vector which is aligned with the field velocity, and the position of all the particles. And if all these variables are fixed, then are given, then the force on the particle P is known. Okay, I assume that it is a small Reynolds number and I have no unsteadiness or turbulent behavior. Behavior. Okay. So the question is that maybe I could do that by using some artificial intelligence method in order to account for all the distribution of the particle. But in order to try to simplify the analysis, I want to introduce some tensor which can characterize the local distribution of the particle and maybe will be. Will be sufficient to model the force which is applied on the particle. Okay, so especially when I am doing DMCFD, I know the relative distribution of the particle with respect to one another. And so I should be able to compute the tensors that I will introduce later. So if I have a model which can give me the force in terms of this variable, I can use directly in a CFTDM simulation. In a CFTDM simulation. So, the first answer we have introduced is really developed by analogy with contact theory in granular medium. It is not strictly the same because it's a local transfer. It is not just the particle which are in contact. It's a neighboring particle which are in this transl definition. And why? It's because the weight, you know, if you are in. You know, if you are interested by contact, you only count the particles which are in contact. In fact, in our case, we have a weighted function which is a Gaussian, which can and we can change the widths of the Gaussian, and then we can account for particles which are not directly in contact with the particle, but maybe at a given distance, not too far. And the distance of integration is given by sigma zero. And we can choose sigma zero, and for the moment. Sigma zero, and for the moment we have a first proposition, but this can be changed. And from this tensor, we can define two other transfers which are more relevant. One which is a spherical tensor, which is in fact based on the trace of the tensor, and the other which is a trustless tensor. And this trustless tensor is interesting because it will give you a measure of the anisotropy of the local microstructure. So if you have more particles in front, If you have more particles in front than behind, for example. The problem is that this is not sufficient because this tensor is symmetric and you cannot make the difference between a particle which is in front or a particle which is behind. And in contrast with contact granular theory, we need to have this orientation and then we have introduced a normalized vector which gives in fact some kind of mean. Some kind of mean direction of overconcentration of power. And so we believe that we have to use these two tensors in order to characterize the microstructure. What we hope is that this is enough. So this is really optimistic, we can say. Maybe we should have much more variable. Maybe we should increase the order. Should increase the order of tensor in order to better characterize the microstructure, but probably it's more a question of the extension of the far particle, the particle which are at a far distance, than to the order of the tensor, because we didn't improve the analysis if we try to account for a third-order tensor, for example, based on the same variable. Okay, so the what. Okay, so what we would like to do is to finally model this force on a given particle in terms of this model force, which now does not depend on all the distribution of the particle, but on the value of this tensor, which is characteristic of the neighboring of the particle T. Okay, so okay, in fact, we can introduce, but this is not. We can introduce, but this is not very crucial for the discussion. Now, in fact, no, I mean, what is important is that we, in order to characterize the effect on the fluid force, we will use some scalar or vector which are based on the contraction of the previous tensor with the fluid flow orientation vector. Okay, and in fact, this will give us, in fact, if the microstructure. The microstructure is aligned or orthogonal with the flow. Okay, so this is what is interesting to model the effect of the force. So this is why we build this first we decompose the vector capy in the direction collinear, in the streamwise direction, collinear to the flow on the transverse component. And we define a vector which is a product of Product of the microstructure tensor and the direction of the flow. So now how can we get information about this modeling approach? In fact, we have used a simulation result, particle result simulation in a fixed periodic array of particles for various solid volume fractions on when. Various solid volume fractions on Reynolds number. And then, first, we have tried to capture some correlation between the microstructure characteristic quantities and the feed flow component in order to try to see what are the good parameters that we should use to characterize this microstructure effect. So, okay, so no, I will give you no information about the simulation condition. I just say. About the simulation condition, I just say that this is a direct forcing emotional boundary method developed by Batiste RD Bayton, the same method and Brugen. As I told you, it's a periodic array of particles with four special regions. The size of the bot is roughly with eight diameter of particle, eight particle, not giamer, eight particles in the long in external direct and twelve particle in the longitudinal direction. Direction and the ratio between the size of the particle and the mesh size is 24, 32, 48, depending on the Reynolds number in order to improve to get the good accuracy. And the simulation were made for various volume fraction from 10 to 40 percent. If you are interested, you may have additional information in the paper which were just published in the Journal of Multi-Facework. So, this is a typical. Multi-phase look. So, this is a typical instantaneous structure that you obtain in the simulation. And, okay, so and this is not really crucial, but this is the value we have measured in terms of force and variance of the forces according to the longitudinal of the transverse component. And these values are very comparable to the one which are obtained. Comparable to the one which are obtained by previous authors, like Antony, again, which has presented some data on this kind of simulation. More original is the analysis of the tensor. So we have analyzed the statistics of the trace of HP and we have also analyzed the statistic of the component of the The component of the bit per car and all the bit per beta. In fact, in this configuration, they are all roughly Gaussian. What is more interesting is to check that all these variables are independent, which means that we can use separately for the modeling approach. In contrast, we have found that the trace of the microstructure tensor is not a very interesting parameter because it is very strongly correlated. It is very strongly correlated with the local solid volume fraction. And this solid volume fraction was based, was constrained by Voranoid approaches. And this is logical. In fact, the trace in some way is just a representation of this solid volume fraction. And as this solid volume fraction is already known, this is why the trace is not a relevant parameter to give additional information. Additional information. Okay, so more interesting is to look at the correlation between the instantaneous force along Z, for example, and the component of the vector K I have given before. As you can see, the correlation is not very strong between Z and this component along Z. Component along Z. Sorry. And it is worse if you look to the correlation between the force along the direction of the fluid. It's a stream-wise force component, and the vector k in the transverse direction. But this is, in fact, this is logical because the vector k tell you if the over concentration, if you want, or the additional particle is on the right or left. The additional particle is on the right or on the left of the streamwise flow. So, in fact, for the streamwise force, you have no change. In contrast, you have a much strong correlation if you are looking to the transverse force, because naturally the sign of the transverse force will change with respect to the sign of this vector. Okay, so this is really one of the interest, and this is how we work. You see, we are looking what is the good parameter. What are the good parameters, and we can compute and measure also the correlation between the force and this component. The most strength in the correlation is the correlation between the force in a given direction and the component of the beta, which you remember this is the product of the tensor, microstructure tensor, and the streamwise direction. Direction, and you can see that you have a very strong correlation between both and the correlation with this transverse component beta. And also, you have a good correlation for the transverse force and this transverse component. In fact, there is no cross correlation if you look at this longitudinal force and the transverse component. Okay, so finally, we obtained that. We obtained that this correlation looks relevant. You have typically the final Pearson correlation coefficient we obtain for the various Reynolds number and condition. If we add the two contribution, one induced by the correlation with vector Kp and one with the vector beta p. And so we say this is a good model. We can try to develop a model like that. And this is how we can do. And this is how we can do that in a practical way. In fact, this is very simple. We just have to say: okay, the force on the given particle P is given by the streamwise mean force, the usual one. So given by the correlation, if you want the ergonom or PennyU or better, the Trinitietal correlation, multiply by first naturally the streamwise vector direction and two contributions. Two contributions which represents a matrix by the vector Kp and another matrix by the vector beta P, which can be measured because these two vectors, which are depending on the local microstructure, can be measured in your CFDDM simulation. And if you assume that this model is correct, then you can compute the correlation between the force and the vector, and it should obey. And the vector, and it should obey this expression. So, as we have measured this F print, this correlation and the variance, the covariance of the vector key, by inversion we can extract these two matrix. And we have proposed some modeling of these two metrics. Finally, we can come back to test really the predictivity of this model and This model, and we have made the according to a given arrangement of the particle. We can predict exactly what force is given by the model for each particle, and we can draw the correlation, all the points which show you the model force in terms of the exact measured force in the simulation. Okay, so this is for two values. Okay, so this is for two value. Perfect, but it is very, I think it's very encouraging and it captures a great part of the physics. Okay, so sorry. Yes, the problem is, in fact, that by doing that, we miss a part of the variance of the force. We can eventually have a random contribution, but this random contribution. Contribution, but this random contribution induced a decorrelation with the result. So it is not clear what should be the better solution. So, in conclusion, in perspective, what we have to do naturally if we want to apply to fluidized bed is to apply the same methodology in fluidized bed particle result simulation and to try to see if this matrix we obtain are quite general for a given Reynolds. For a given Reynolds number and a given mean volume fraction, then we can test the effect in a three-direct-based CFD GM simulation. So, and to see how the particle fluctuating motion and mixing can be influenced by these additional forces. And as I said before, you have an additional transversal contribution which will arise. And the fact that, for example, And that's for example, for the moment, it is not completely clear for me, but I would like to develop a stochastic model in the frame of the PDF approach based on this methodology. But it means that I need to have a statistic for this microstructure. So it's not completely obvious to do that. And finally, there is also the question to extend to other problems. For example, if you have heat transfer, you have also very big. You have also a very big effect on just a picture. This is a simulation across a random array of particle with hot particle. And again, the heat transfer is very depending on the position of the particle. And you have a huge distribution with respect to the mean value. So, again, this is something which should have probability to account for. Thank you very much. Account for thank you very much. Let's thank our speaker. Well, we may have time for a few quick questions and then we'll move to our last speaker for this session. Quick questions from here? Hey, Charles? Yeah, real interesting, this definition of this tensor that depends on the position of the particles. I was wondering, I assume all your applications are. I assume all your applications are for a single size. All the particles have the same size. And I was wondering if, in fact, there would be a possibility of refining the definition of that tensor by changing the weights in front of the distances to take into account the size of the different particles. There might be a possibility of defining that tensor, taking into account the different size of particles. Yeah, maybe. But I agree with you first. It is for the moment. You first, it is for the moment for a monodisperse distribution of particles. But I agree, this maybe we could extend in some way, maybe your proposition should be evaluated. But honestly, for the moment, we didn't try to do that. One more from Ray. Very interesting work. I just wonder. Work, I just wonder for the multi-linear model part section of your talk, you had you showed this force as a function of force, basically after the linear regression. And it looks very nice, but in addition to the linear trend, you also have some kind of scatter around that line. Yeah, scattering is very important because the scattering is the quality of the model, right? Right. I mean, in addition to the. Right. I mean, in addition, it's not perfect. The model is not perfect. It's an error. The scattering shows you the error of the deterministic prediction. So the question is, that error part should be quantified as a stochastic model? Or what's an alternative way to reduce that kind of or quantify that error, I guess? In fact, this is a very good question. In fact, if Uh, in fact, if you are in a random array, in fact, the question is: what do you want to know? You know, if you are in a two-field model approach, in fact, you want to have an average effect. Okay, so it is not so crucial, I believe, but this is to have exactly the true value for a given particle, what you see, you should have some statistical representation of what is arriving. Is arriving okay, but uh, I agree with you that this is naturally it is not perfect, but it's a deterministic prediction. So, I compare exactly the value predicted by the model with the value measured in the simulation. And in fact, the dispersion is because the model is not perfect. And as I tell you, one of the consequences is that I underestimate the The variance of the forces, for example. But the underestimation is just by 20%. So it is, if I compare with no variance at all or no transverse force at all, at least I have 80% probably of what is happening. So I don't claim that this is the final solution. I just claim that I would like to explore. I would like to explore the effect in CFDBM, maybe to see if it's interesting to go further to capture. I completely understand the deterministic model won't be able to capture everything, but what I'm really getting into is this variance. What does that depend on? Like, if you increase the solid concentration, will you make the variance a little bit larger? You know, how in fact, you need to know. But you need to know, it is true that we have measured a variance for a given solid volume fraction on Reynolds number, okay, in the simulation. And from that, we have obtained some correlation. So, in fact, the input of the model, you know, because you need input, the input of the model are the variance of the forces. Of the forces in terms of the solid volume fraction and of the Reynolds number, but this is classical. In addition, we need to have the covariance between the force and the tensor properties that I have shown in the picture. So, I presume that this is good and I can use after in a real simulation. Okay, thank you so much. Well, thank you, Oliver. Pretty nice thoughts. So, just to keep track on
