  And Changed.  Okay. Welcome everybody to the afternoon session for us, evening session for you. Today we are going to have three talks. And I'm very pleased to know the first talk by Toshi Gotter. He will speak about effects of radio abnormal, especially the dimension of rotations from health. Dimension of rotations from Gelfrid State to Turbo State. Thank you. Okay, thank you. And hello, everyone. So I'm Toshi Goto, and thank you, organizers, for inviting me to this workshop. It is my great pleasure. And this is joint work with my former PhD student, Dr. Yan, who is now serving in China. Let me begin with my motivation. Begin with my motivation. So, almost five years ago, Vikta Yakot and Diego Dontis studied some change of the fluctuation statistics of a velocity field, which is excited by Gaussian rundown field. So, it is easily imagined that when the Leynes number is quite low, so the out. Low, so the output would be Gaussian. Indeed, they compute this normalized velocity gradient moment. And if the velocity field obeys Gaussian, then this moment would be given by this value, which is Gaussian value. And if the Leynus number is increased gradually, then the then this moment would increase and larger than the Gaussian values. So there may be some transition Reynolds number. So they computed this moment and studied these values for a Beras Reynolds number. So in fact, they observed that when the Reynolds number is quite low, these values Quite low. These values are almost Gaussian value. But at around the near 819, they tend to increase. And the way of increase is powerful. So you can see that these lines is almost on a straight line. And they computed this exponent. Exponent rho n. I'm sorry, this is very small later. The point that the way of this power exponent rho n is, they say, the related to the scaling exponent of velocity increment in the inertial range. So there is a one-to-one correspondence. So this work stimulated me very much. And then I And then I thought that can we the similar behavior for the moment of passive scalar? Or maybe the increase rate or power low for the passive scalar may be greater than that of the velocity. That was the starting point. So, and another motivation, and previously. And previously, there are many studies regarding whether which PDF, epochillon dissipation rate or anatrophy, which PDF decays faster for high amplitude. There are many experiments. So in this experiment by Chen, Suny and Nerkin, they observed that PDF terror of anaestrophy is much longer than that of Is much longer than that of the epsilon. These are normalized by their mean values. The similar experiments also found that the same behavior. So the PDF terror of omega is longer than that of epicilon. The R rambda is low to moderate in this experiment. And in the DNS, so the PKS group. So the PKS group found that the similar behavior, I mean that the normalized normalization by their mean. So PDF tel of anaestrophy is higher than that of epusilone. Okay, however, if this anstrophy and epousilone are normalized by their extrude. The extreme value that means the largest number of anstrophy. So, if this omega is normalized by the extreme value, all the PDFs of anstrophy for various Reynolds numbers are collapsed on a single line. The same is true for the eposilon. But still, we have the same result that the PDF of Enstrophy is larger than that of epsilon. So does this mean that intermittency or extreme values differ for the entropy or dissipation? So I was, I have been So I was I have been uh the bothering uh this uh the question so then the if we uh study the PDF omega and epsilon in a near redausion state we may have some chance or we may have some hint to uh to this difference in PDF terrors so therefore the our motivation is that uh we'd like to see change of the or We'd like to see a change of the overall statistics of fluctuations from Gaussian to turbulent states. So, in my talk, mostly we are concerned about the spectrum and the PDFs of dissipation anatrophy. And during this research, I also had the interest in the effects of spatial dimensions on these statistics. So, the hope is that we may. So, the hope is that we may have some hints by doing this research. And while we have studied the dissipation, so as you know that at high Reynolds number, on the average, the input rate at a large scale is equal to the mean cascade rate through the inertial range and also finally dissipated into the heat. Finally, it dissipates it into the heat with the same rate. So the dissipation is only one thread which connects large to small scales. And the dissipation and anstrophy are scalar. So rather than considering each component of velocity gradient, so the treat the uh these two scalar is easier than the than like uh than uh Like done studying the components. So, with this motivation, we studied the fluctuations of the Navier-Stokes field and the passive vector, which is incompressible and passive scalar. This passive vector obeys just very similar equation to the Navier Stokes, but there are some should expect pre-speak Should expect pressure. All three fields are excited by the Gaussian random white noise, which are applied at low wave number range alone. But in my talk, we are mostly concerned about velocity U and the passive scale. This is a DNS parameters. The point is that the length of Reynolds number covered in this parameter. The randomness number covered in this DNS are quite wide from very low value 0.13 to 110. So this is probably we expect that this set of the Reynolds number are enough to see the change of statistical behavior of the distribution anatrophy and passive scalar. Okay, this is a spectra normalized by Cormann variables, epsilon, nu, or chi, and so on. And these are curves for burst T, passive vector, and the passive scalar. So as you can see, that when the Reynolds number is quite low, then the normalized specter doesn't collapse at all. At all. But when the Reynolds number increases and it becomes larger than the two, so the spectral tend to begin to collapse on a single curve. So the same is true for other two spectrals. So this suggests that the Kolmos-like scaling works for Leynus number greater than two. So maybe the turbulence needs to Maybe the turbulence needs to be, if the flow field is considered to be turbulent, on the spectral sense, the R lambda must be greater than two. Now, we look at the moments. So, if the velocity field obeys the Gaussian, then normalized dispersion rate and the passive scalar dissipation rate obeys this formula. This formula. So, about this formula, I will talk about later. Anyhow, let's look at the moments. Okay, straight horizontal line shows the Gaussian values. So, this is the second, order, third, the fourth, and the fifth. So, as you can see that the moments stay almost Gaussian value, but begin to increase. But begin to increase at rambla at about five or six. And this is a curve for passive scalar. And this is a passive vector. And this is a Navier-Stokes velocity field. So as you can see, that when the order increases, then these various moments are larger. Larger and the rate of increase becomes larger with the increase of the order. And roughly speaking, they increase in power law with respect to the Reynolds number. These are numerical observations. But how do we compute these Gaussian moments? That is the starting point. Is a starting point. So you know that if the velocity field obey the Gaussian state, we have PDF for velocity. This is MED. How about the PDF for epsilon and omega? Maybe you already know, but I didn't know. Then I started to compute this PDF. So if the velocity field obeys the Marlt-Barret Gaussian random field, Gaussian landowner field. So is true for the late obstruction tensor Eij, which is symmetric. By this symmetry and incompressive condition, we have only five independent, statistically independent terms in this equation. Two diagonals, three of diagonals. The same is true, but in the d-dimensional space we have this formula. A formula. Okay, now we make a vector, these components in this way. Okay, so the total number of the vector component is given by this one in d-dimensional space. Then, if the velocity field obeys the value of the Gaussian Landam field, by definition, the G eta ER component. It's a component of the data seven tensor obeys this functional form. A in bus. The A is given by the covariance matrix between G I G J, which means that covariance matrix of E rate of strain tensor. So this quantity is easily computed in this way if the velocity energy spectrum is known. Energy spectrum is known. So we can easily compute this variance A in this way, very simple form. Therefore, the inbus A, A in bus is also easily computed in this way. Very simple structure. Therefore, the PDF of the rate of strain tensor is given by this one, and if we compute this exponent, we have this one. This exponent, we have this one. Interestingly, this guy is given by just the rate of strength or dissipation rate. And this metric has one algebraic pre-factor times the surface element of hypersurface sphere. Therefore, integrating over this hypersphere surface, we arrive at Arrived at this expression in the Gaussian field. So this means that the episode of P epsilon P D F is given by the gamma distribution function. So there is the one prefactor and the exponent. The point is that the uh this exponent or this exponential is a function of n epsilon, which is given by this one. Which is given by this one. Therefore, this PDF is determined by the number of independent terms contributing to the dissipation rate. This is a key. The same is true for the enstrophy. So this PDF is computed in the similar way. But as you know, they they are the The voltage vector is trace race. Therefore, we have this number. And the passive scalar dissipation rate, we have this number. So, unlike this N epsilon N omega, the NO theta is D, dingy D. This is a big difference. So, So we think of P omega and P epsilon in dimension 3. So in dimension D equals 3, N omega is 3, N epsilon equals 5, which means that if the velocity field obeys the Gaussian state, then P D F of omega is the tail of the P D F omega. Tailor of the PDF omega is larger than episcopal PDF. And we expect that the same is true for at least for Reynolds, low Reynolds number case. Okay, let's look at the DNS data. This is a result. This is a epsilon PDF. The range of Leynus number is 0.13 to Number is 0.13210. So, as you can see, that black line is the Gaussian PDF or the Gaussian field. So, as the Leyner's number increases, the curves go in this way and curves go this way. So, you can see that the left scale of the PDF nicely follows the straight line with the exponent or With the exponent or slope, three halves. And on the other hand, light step, as Leynz number increases, gradually expanding. Since this is an exponential decay, as we can see from here, so the decay rate would be slower than the this one, okay, exponential. So maybe I stretch the exponential. Isolated exponential. If we look at the encrophe PDF, we have similar behavior, but the left tail has a slope one Halt. Right to tail decays a little bit decays slower when compared to the velocity. Now scalar dissipation rate. The same behavior is observed. The left tail is a straight line with a slope one half. A slope half one half. The light tail is slightly decays slower than the entropy. Okay, so the general observation. This is the control plot of PDF for Vera's Reynolds number. So uppergram lines show that the comparison of the PDF of gradient. The PDF of gradient. So the Venezuelan number is below 4 or 5. The control lines are almost unchanged, parallel, meaning that almost Gaussian. But our level that becomes larger than 4 or 5, it begins to expand. So the expansion seems to occur. The expansion seems to occur at lower redness level for the passive scale. The same plots are done for formalism of dissipation rate, similar behavior observed in that the expansion of the PDF occurs, begins at R lambda 4 of 5. But the expansion point for the passive scalar a little bit earlier than the other two. Harrier than the other two. And the left contours of longerism of dissipation rates or scalar dissipation rates are almost parallel with equal distance. This is consistent with the power of behavior of left tail of PDF of dissipation rate. So the previous observation was for the low Leynus number. So we would like to see what happened in the high Leynus number. So in the DNS, so they say that the Pucilon PDF or omega PDF obeys this strategic exponential. The equivalent exponent, the beta epistron and beta omega is smaller than one. Is smaller than one. These are reports. And from the previous observation, we expect that the prefactor are unchanged, irrespective of Reynolds number, meaning that probably this pre-factor are universal. But instead of writing this exponent in this way, so we just simply write in this way: phi epsilon epsi omega. So the weak. So we consider the ratio between phi epsilon psi omega as an amplitude of the epsilon and omega. As we saw for the low Reynolds number case below 2, then this ratio, which is equal to beta epsilon and beta omega is 1. Therefore, this phi psi, this ratio is equal to the ratio. the this ratio is equal to the ratio between C omega and C plus you know meaning that five thirds indeed curves are almost very close to the value of five thirds for Reynolds number smaller than two what happens if the Reynolds number is much larger than one the observation show that beta P0 and beta omega are close to each other and both are small And both are smaller than one. So, these are results. The curves are once attained to 5,000 levels and tend to decrease and to close to the sum value. And the point is that the curves are almost constant for some values of omega amplitude. So, horizontal nature of these curves implying that this exponents These exponents are the same, suggesting that the intensity of singularity could be the same similar. But these barriers are higher than one, meaning that lambda is greater than one, suggesting that PDF terror of anstrophy is larger than PDF of zero. So let's look at what happened for Have problem for this function for high Reynolds number. The result is like this one. So around the 787, so the similar behavior is observed. Curves are almost flat, meaning that these exponents are the same for exponent means that this one and this one. But we do not know how large their values are. And this value is greater than one. Again, at this high Reynolds number, the same statement can be observed. Now we consider the effect of the dimension. If the velocity obeys the Gaussian, we have this form. Therefore, left tail obeys this power with slope. On the other hand, right tail. On the other hand, right stale decays in this way. Therefore, D is increased, then slope becomes steeper and the light still decays faster. Therefore, with increase of D, the Gaussian field, so the PDF of Psychology becomes narrower. Indeed, this gamma distribution function obeys this change for various. Change for various dimensions. Now, what happened for the tablent state? I expect that the pre-factor still prevails, but we do not know what happened for the disk exponent. But we conjecture that the probability would be something like this one. The similar functional form may be expected in this way. When Reynolds number is quite low, the c Reynolds number is quite low, the Cd is one, and the beta D is one. But when Reynolds number is quite high, this exponent will be smaller, becomes smaller than one. But the way of change of this exponent against the Reynolds number is quite slow. Therefore, this ND, which depends on the D square. Square. Therefore, this dominates the behavior of phi. Therefore, for tails, PDF of epusilon in dimension is smaller than that of 3D. The same is true for the omega. Indeed, in our previous uh DNS in the four-dimensional turbulence, we computed the uh accumulated to PDF for participation rate. T D F of dissipation rate. So this is a one-dimensional salogate, and this is the sum of the velocity gradient. We consider this part. In three dimensions, accumulated PDF of epusilon is higher than that of 4D. This is consistent with the previous conjecture. So my time is almost run out. So this is my conclusion. So transition to So transition from Gaussian to turbulent state occurs at around R lambda 208. And we consider the PDF dissipation dynasty. The point is that the number of the terms contributing epsilon and omega are key to think of consider the tails of PDFs. And the PDF tails, the F-2 tails are almost universal. Terror is almost universal and algebraic. And when dimension becomes larger than 3, so with increase of D, so PDF terror becomes narrower and narrower. Okay, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Yes, I see some questions.
