First vegetables for the invitation, which is antenido dear demidos, todos the fuera y que ma temun estrocorazón en Mexico. So it is meadisimo gustos tar here, and many a todos the participants and presentations because guste what presentation. What is going to present? Yo, this work for many years in Mathematics and Combinatory, but principally with problemas optimization of points. So I can say with this. I want to talk about graphics in the plan, all in the plan in this plan. Tengo mentor. Tengo interest in general of the completa and interest investigating how you can build. So these graphics that we have geometrical graphics that are the requirements that the aristocracy is directed, and also topological graphs that do not have a restriction about aristocracy, because But, for effects of the medicine, what needs to be, for example, many people with problems, when crucial in the graphic, in the case of geometric cases, need the points of general position because of other general details for myself and verticals, but not going to. Vertends standards, but we have the aristos, we are going to be able to see them. So, that is a typical proposal that we have to the sixteen graphics, and for others for the topological graphics, if you want to continue cruising, it doesn't have to be intersecting much and solitas, a solid aristocracy that intersects many veces, or a part of aristos that intersect between many. So, voyage or voyage that my simplicity is the only thing that wants to decir what aristos have a point that can be a cruise. And the aristocracy doesn't intersect simple y puedes more. I think. So, well, I think with the geometric concepts, if the first observations that in the lid all this determined by where the luggage vertices for the conjugate points. For the conjunto points, that are my vertices. So, that's one of the things that have the vertices have all the aristocrats, not necessarily. So, what I studied are with juntos, in which study with points. And a technical utilization for many years, and that is super valuable. It is something that we have circular in the same way. So, for us, we have the graphics per moment. The moment, and we work only with points. So, that I have with points, the view associated with permutations. That is not really described as a matrix, but in the utilization of the structure of matrix structure. So, here for example, what you say is if you have a conjugate tunt, the first one is librarian circle that. Dibujar un circulo que los contents all es cojerma tangente a es circulo porquera aque sea y dechoes tangente está digira, digamos que aurí está pointendo siriva. Luego, voy las projections in mispuntos es erecta y dependiendo de loben que los pointos, bueno las projections so erecta, voy numerar mispunto. So my recta orita pience en la que está orientada si arriba y entos es mispuntes apareces. And then apparently one here in a torden, this first, and the number one other info, and then mispuntos, and then if my points and the environment continue to read the circular. And then what you will do is that in some moment, or the projection of the quarter, the projection of the 50s. So what I'm going to do is the order of mispuntos. One is that the etiquette of mispuntos about the projection. So, the principle has the So, principle has numerous numbers, and there is 5 chambers of order in the projection. So, that's a voyage to have the permutation. And if you conform the tangent redo demicirculo, you have some other changes. Here, porcelain is the three cuando 32, a little puedo, and also. Poquitos pueds, and we have not a choice in the presence, you can have the three two cylinders four. So conform to my vector, voy obtaining new permutations in the moment in the moment to parallel or when my vector is pointing, the order of this mixture. So it is my last permutation when this rotation of the vertical part of her, the vertical point of vajo, vascular queen, my immune system is exactly the completely depunt points, and my points are in general. So it has a parent in the One of the parents, in the moment, changed. So, you have here one of my parents, in the result that in the case, what definitely is like circular, is a permutations with this, because if you do the rectangle, you have other permutations, which will be just. So, what I want to say is geometrical problems in this world of In this world of circular ahora, all with points and in their circular and because it doesn't need to be in position general, if you have linear points, and an instant can implement various points, not only to know, if my conjugate points are general, all these changes, these Change these are transpositions. So, how do you confront their circular sources? And the question is, if all their circular sessions correspond to a point, and well, no, no, that's here. Intelligent circular correspondence to what we What we are configurations generalized from points. What is when in my life I have my point, and all the aristocraces that are segments directly that the union sections. So, can also not how segments of vectors and how the objects pass for parents or the two points, you can think that my geometric graphics are. My theométric. So, a generalized configuration of points is that all has linear simple infinite enamos determiner that is one, and what is intersecting. Intersecting a design. So, if I have a puedo defining a graphic of this manera, and these are what I do a configuration generalized. But, if I create a circular source, or we have a permissible cuando, in nugar de mi conjunto depuntos, en nugarmesar de miki junta. Implemente pido que empear cona con mispuntos en orden y logo permito changeos aquí a más que cualquier para espode chamber los más una vez antes de llagar mi position completamente position reveal. This is a permissible session, and the permissible permissible is society to a configuration functionalist of points. Configuration can point in particular the configurations that have been included in the configuration of points and so can see the world of permissible more grand queer world of configurations of points, but very interesting because many problems correlate a para graphic or with points now in essential for configuration generalized and more. And the view of a local mass. So, my sex queen. Different types of families with points. We have like the trivial position when all is in a rectangle, collectively, we have general position that will utilize for the problems, position convex position that is also problemas, and also. Problems, and also this conjugate with central symmetry. What exists a centroid that is not necessarily part of the conjugate determiner that has their symmetrical above the direct with the center of the center. So, what have their symmetric points about this direct of the directory? That's symmetry. It is simply. Simplement in the rotational integrated. So, we have how circular para differentes with metrics in the circular sources. So, that is here first, trivial position, position collinear position. Tenggots mispuntos are three and how all is linear. So, this cuando. So, when my circle and project in some linear y segments change, and then a change that the top es position general and the dichotomy, but not more for a more here, is one of creating their circular sources. Create the succession circular, estament order the objects for supervision. So, here we are with the projection in the agenda, the direct as miditoe este project. So, this minimum number one, two, like the coordinates, one two three four, and what you can ordinate my directors and supervision. So, with numerous directions, For 2000, here in the language negative y logo esta, y logu el 3, y logu el 4, y logo el 5 parallels que lo puedo notar lo puedo notar aquí. Sounto rectas paralelas. Yes, when you have paralelas, like this dos, puedas voya ver aquí. Very much as. But many things that can notar here are in the case with my conjugate eventually in some projections will be in the project of my permutation. For example, here the project, when vertical projects, when one is the first one, and it is part of my case convex in this direction, there is a little bit of a sign. In this direction, there is the other. So, the unique 5 is part of my case convex. And with 2, you can see that my case convex aquí notes. Vadel one, 5, althos. And the convexor can be aquí. First, one. First one, especially my direct imaginary director who will also misjunt, especially in the cuatro, and if you have no here, so here is the cuatro, the 5, and here if my susception circular, like infinitely, it is 5 and the 2, and the regret. So, that is my case convex. Mikasco convex. Puedo identificar tan con esto observación puedo mi identifar convexos en misación circular bueno acatinggo, quejane pas poraca tengo en tos exposión convexa, pueden ver que todos mispuntos aquí tenguel uno two tres cincos cuatro two. Cuatro dos, aquí está uno 3 6 cuatro dos 1. So estos mos points in algumentos tan to extremo de mis permutations and also central symmetrical para centrally symmetrical queen load escalation point with their corresponding symmetrical center for here, the center in this. The center in this jempler no está en ni conjunto, but y estu viera estaría aquí en Medi, here estadarí el centro y entéada permutación siempre estaría y en Medi. And what is imagined that projectos so that you have one two three no, but here go one and And if the study is more studying because it symmetrical symbols, 52, that would be a variety. And in relation to one two, what do we have no medosa there? One of the three, or all over. And that's my first projection. In cunt, that is a change that. Chambian que se día esta recta de here, esta recta dequí que contiene alumal cells, esta este chambio y est directa que contiene a los varitas es este chambio here. Lo conforme sigo van sando, voya tene la recta uno uno bara que es la que estadi. La que está que pasa por el centro y despé pué empezara tener paralelas. La dos uno varita, y la dos varita uno vana se para leasas, y dotengo más paralelas, entoses van peara ver algo como de este in this example. But in general, for a configuration symmetric conflict, if you will have this linear, which is how in the centro, that is how the equivalent is. And what center will intersect a change that has the Roja and also for symmetrical central severe as symmetry with respect to this linear roja. So, because passing the squier passage of the direct only that is here. Solamente que si el doses here el barrita porcelos no varrites da delotrolado y vise verse. So puedo identifía muy facilmente symmetria central symmet in susessiones circular suspicion. Ok, that is how the introduction. Now we have a more circular source, but we will see what problems consider generally metrics. You can see with one very classical and fabulous entonces. The first problem is study lines connectors. Probably in especially about the torema silvestre, the problem is in this problem. So first, with points, not only connectors, if all the rejects that pass for points, that is. Almost two points, that is all my connectors. And you can classify tenement. So you have to aquifer, have three connectors. And I will change these specials that are pour two points. These lines pass all porous points. There are rectas, we see more rectas ordinaries. And I intersect for this. And I intersect many para este problem. Y logo also classify, so that pass for three, the pass for four, etc. So that is going to be secure, where contiences. So here have 5 lasers pas points, 5 connectors, and the verdeada is a quatro connector. So this has a more 4 connector.  That is a madma de silvestre. Fu problema expression of this queen. Ok. Theorem Silvestre is a problem very classic problem, and there are legions in the faculty of algae, that the push problema un studiant and the students in the past, perhaps for resolving. For resolving results that are superficial, if you want to know what it is, it is not trivial, but it is a problem very well, it has a very demonstraciones. There is some capital that different demonstrations of the terms. What is that point? So, existence. Political sense exists a ordinary passage for points and to a lot of them, have this demonstration of the Silvestre consecutions circular to the point. This is my circular size, but in claims, here have all my points, of one, have not allowed them to change all. And that's a misinformation. And a miracle production energy that entrepreneur and primer, the participant changed first. So, the trajectory of the trajectory, where change with one point in principle, and the point in one chambers with it, the enlightened force that I bano ace elizier. Here, in this circular session, and my figure in the first place that entrepreneurs and the first one that we have. And this is my chambio, y you go este chambio, because. And this is what I totally. The choice siempre siempre y el uno. Siempre semo ve en la misma direction. Wellen imaginar se cuzo es que locho seba moviento. esto y siggeno 2cho. So que pued pasar. Puestengo dos casos. That one of these chambios se a uno de esamente dos elements, a transposition, esos una rectordinaria ya. Erector linear and terminate. Or if there are some, so we are not, and the new especially changed as simple, that is a rectal linear. On these segments, they are changing more of two elements. So I will say, like what I want is to decide imagine that I obviously tantito, and then here in a video tantito, and then we start in. And so they wish in the others, the other six, the four, the three doses are here, to vertically 32. But that segment, all tienes more of two elements, but all the verdes to change, amarillas, especially in transitions, assurance that changed in between. For locual, one of which is a very important thing. Una es que el nou llaga sudestino bueno en el chamino cuando mébe 'no ve sebado movendo en algún momento teno que est chambios de unberde con una marillo, de una marillo, con una sul, etc. If you have more, but like all the same colours that change a child when you have a change of a colour, only include one of the color. And so that will be a transposition. That will be a change for. Soon about the other, which all the successions circular in the world of permissible or more grandeur that the principles. So this demonstration for the configuration. Configuraciones generalized points. If you have what points to society with a family of pseudoline, also pseudo-linear passed by two points, and what intersecting a vegetarian, so not all the points that there is a cedar linear, those as collinearities, siempre exist a cedar linear queas for the power. One situation that passed by sacramente. So that's one of the things that has demonstrations with me like the most problems that I guste investigar. Direciones, my interest know what the maximum number of directions that can be determined. Pueden determinadas por conjunto del points. That minimum number of directions. That say can be determined by my conjunto del points. Excellent because this is here. This poríque employ here el exago regular. Or regular, the exaggerated regular expression tienes a direction. All are parallel las, that in the same direction, this otridirection and queen. Well, this otra yacubritos. And then And then cada una des directions is a misuse circular. For example, the jojas uno trees two cylinders are estas here. They are stress on the journey. So the numero de renglones en misuse circular es el número de direcciónes. The directions. Well, result that in minus 17, that is points determined to the directions. So, when you are in position to have two directions, but here in this minimum So that is the number of directions, and what is that essential need to do the number of points in directions? And in the fifth, two queu effectively the configuration conference, and we utilize circulated by the generalized society of points. Now, the uterus of this problem is that a classification completes. Completa dexiste, a classification completa classification of configurations of points that are critical for this para este. Image las que tien digamos un y elimo número de directions. In par with directions. No existing classification complete. It knows that these conjuntos here. These conjuntos here, with the polygon regulatory, generate in parallel in directions. This is a double dog generating a number of directions. This is a cruise exponential, and here have a geometric susceptibility, these points determined fiomérica, and this. And this copyado in the cuadrantes know that that, but there are many other families, but there are conjurors, but not existing classification complete. So, very scientifically with a student, we are que esteem special, that the conjugate is central symmetrical and. And we are mandos already with parents. And the points are in position general non-central position, what is that the unique rectas that are more of two points are that central power? What rectangle passes for the center of points? So, we can classify completamente, not only the geometric geometry, and not also. Geometric geometry, but also what they are specifically totally the configurations generalized from points, and the configurations geometrical queue satisfactory. So, this is very good. If there is interest, well, passing my problem, because we will have no power to do it. What is here this way? What the number of cruces that can generate to a specific graphic, in particular, is very interesting in complex graphs. Cruces are. Cruces are your intersections of aristocrats. So, in contrar, the number of cruises terminated by the graphic completes of other vertices. Here have two things, this cruise, this division, and echo, this division is optimal. It is the minimum cruises. The derivative. Well, that is what 15 general. And interesting in a way of variants, and it is my favorite for us to interact, I think. For the geometric case, the problem is for decades, and if you do porcerto, but no via maciados advances that our para decides to decide more sobriety.  And three advances that are there that mejan trespuntos unlado, tre sectamente ah, perdondo estos and two aristas. Jan two points a lad. 2 points a lad and the master. If you encounter, they have two ladies and the more. And these are three distance and the three distance specialists because they are exactly the middle of caden. What is the maximum number of charistas? That can be delumbero de charistas dad with points. Dad with points in position general plan. That we can decide from the cumulative, the more charistas, decir how can the number of serorists, moreistas, like pueda costar the number of lineage media, which are the charistas, more than that. And much problems super famous and clásical y aviartos, all. So, regreto number. So, regarding the number of cruces, the tore and 24 queue is the difference, not only, but the torrent is the difference in the study of numerous cruces in the sociometric crisis. This number total number total of And this is here, this number of charistas. The number of characteristics multiplicated by this factor, all of them are calculus, but what is the relation of clues, like numerous characters and cotas for charistas to prove concotas for enumerable crucial. Concotas for the number of cruces, and that was a paso impersonant. Here have a vecosomos of charistas of the yentonces if the number of cruces. The unique thing that I have to do is the numero de cruces of that. Ocho encuatro, 3 in 4 es es el núm de parejas, es como el núr de parejas de segmentos, que veen el número del parejas de aristas disjuntas. Menos, la seguiente partes el numero de no cruces. So estos el numbero de parejas de aristas disjuntas que no se cruza. Y lo que es esto es cuando tengo una arista, una Tengo una arista, a sero arista, lo unico que tengo que hacer es bueno, najor se los pungozi, baser el número de sero aristas por el número de puntos que deja de cada lad. So baser el three que es numero de sero distas por una seroista en este caso dejacero puntos un lado yes de l'otro. A seroista dejacero ses y logo menos. And that is the number of una histas por uno por 5. Una unaristas de já un punto de un lado y 5 del otro. Me 2 por el número de puntos en un lado, el número de puntos en el otro. Las dosaristas de jan dos y cuatro y las tres aristas de jan tres y tres. Son 3 pointos unla other 3. They are three points on others points of the two points that are in the artist. So, if you enumerate crucial and what important of this is, if I can enumerate, podcast enumerate cruise, and it is superfunded. Let's see the advances of this problem. De este problema, mi el problema estabierto, para cuelcer número depuntos, major que treenta. Elvance vecido está here, como nueve pointos, está, pero nueve está die si 1. El banseo nirn. This resultados que están aquí, los verde sitos. Son resultados. They are resulted in this. These results, this inclusive, are resulted previously to this relation in the number of characters with the number of clues. All the more utilized techniques of the 30s. The 2019 existence code. Existence cottas, and a mountain of results in the ultimate and all these results have theorem that the cabinet of user. So, to connect with the topology, okay, don't pod much, but like connectamos or paragraphs, topological. So, this otro del mis. So, this otro fabric in topological geometric graphics a two arista is a connector or a arista that two points of other in graphics do not tablar dead others so decided to define this manera. If you have If you have the completion, and we have simplest, in these intersections, multiple aristocrats or intersections when these conditions, what you said, is that triangulating, that 3 vertices and aristocras, 3 aristocraces that connect a Forman envelidad una curba simple una curba serada simple verdad un triangle entonces puedo orientadlo ento por example here cerfjando en la rista se y quiero verce una two arista o que arista es mepofijarentos triangulos que continena se, CB, C migráfica completa y. Gráfica completa y puedos el quales positivos y quales are negativos. So when Indo in esentido puesta las mane del log, so positive, but when this describing or in the sense of marriages of the science, then that is negative. Y came by example to be. So, for example, parents are a relid es A, and this is entirely negative. So, that is how this is done, not the right, so that is the way. So, with the orientations of my triangulos, you can define character. Poor definite aristocracy. One two arista is a aristocracy that has two triangulos, and the most negative or two negatives and the more positive. And result that a ton of results are demonstrated for the sociometric, it's valid also in topological, and thanks to that here. That is a pudding part of this conjecture super famous of the people, but this result is conjectural, specific in the conjectura is for the number of cruces in a topological de la Gráfica confetta with constructions that have. Existen constructions that have this number of cruces, when we do not engage, and that is a design that's super, super famous, including all the time that we're going to be super difficult that this problem. Recuerde. Bienes de los escientas, digamos. This first resultados are like more direct, biennial first articles, like to buy two significatives in the problem all these years. And lego. Y Luego is the 26 separate cruise of the case. And then you have to be sabía después like the mill that comes from 20 years, 25, 25. And the work that we And we utilize computer. So I think in Austria, there is an implementamos implementing a parabolic program. A program like to verify all the cases that we have and our intuition and that can be queer program as a person in the military and a practice, especially terminals, 25, not a male. But that's good more like superior, but really the theory will know the number of cruces of catrece, but Más a que simos finally, puedemos turamos la conjetura para untond de classes. But more grand para la que vemos, esto bien desperondes. This bien des 23, tuimos presentados progressives que intuín certas classes of divujos, between monotonos, que decir que las aristas siempresemo event. Asiomos vende direcha, dijos cylindricals, that are me qualities of budgets that have vertices in the origins of the bases of a cylinder, and the aristocracy can intersect that circulos in 5 exist various families for families. But we all sell this condition in especial condition, and the especially more. It is the more great family for which the family included many other families for us that the conjecture. And a little like noticeables, my imagination is that in a family that does not enter in our description, we can see that if one. Demonstrate that if a bojo era optimo has been, but results in contradiction of folks that are what optimo conjecture of it, that are terrible because no entrepreneurs in our specifications for theorem, and not only in these queues, we have. If we have a confecturation, all of the aristocraces are crucial. It is contraintuitive, non-doespensing conjugate, but create the conjugate, but this type of mixture that create this cabinet. And we have a digital queen, the podcast of which has graces. My gracias por preguntar me, that. Por preguntarme eso este miren. Descascarable dejunero saraca. Descascarable significa essentiallyment que que podemos yitando vertices a verme first contestato segua questiona y después trad because to definitely discourage. Definitely discouraged. For your segunda question, if mirror describes that these divos here are divus optimos, because we are 20 los divos numerous acto de cruise for grafica complete. And what we are currently looking at can modify a little bit so that triangular symmetry, and that is cadenita that can be the multiple 3, but the optimum for 3 points is continuous in the optimum for 6, esteem selection, and And all symmetry triangular symmetry. So we para cada en, damos en multiple 3 existe un divo optimo que tiene symmetria triangular. So very sentiment, if we demonstrate in the case special quiver symmetry triangular symmetry, and not And no pudding, the triangular symmetry, as we're going to do, but we're going to symmetries. For example, it is the symmetry like studio. And result that we can contradict the number of active cruises for these families. So, we exactly The same number of clues is superfluous because no idea of formulas exactly forms for geometrical complete graphics. So, this is a very good parameter, and not only And not only that, these millions, a little pandemic, we separate a lot with Bernardo, Bernardo Abrego, and Imos studying the symmetries, and we have the numerous actors to pass. Those para symmetries for cuadrado que. Quadrado because it is part. Symmetry hexagonal, octagonal que sell, para toda selles. And if we don't para las simparies, we have cottas, but not for the impact. Pudimos mejor dos resultados general results in cottas for symmetry pentagonal symmetry in the lantern, but not for the triangular queer luminaries important. Important. So, that segment is to first pregunta describe, do you think one, like, capas de la sevoyas? So, that is like capas in my divo. Tieno definition technica, because they are the including here, but essentially can enumerate vertices. Enumerar tos vertices, the vertices of tográfica of one, of talmanera que siquitas el one, if a version recursive definition. If it is what initial segment and final segment to graphic, if you do it, it's a definition recursive. But if I combo your divesto en capas, the una named. But more tall, it's a definition more technical. And that is a work in, for example, given perbolic where the aristocracy are geodesic. Because we have the contrajemplos, in some way, or notifying the metric. The metric is explicit because these contradictions the series. If the verdict is not studied in other gemetricas in general, and in particular, no idea in a Canada of numerous cruces, no existing series, this voice are rarimos. No, we are not existing. But no entrepreneur in the family that we think optimas. But if they are very extraordinary, the poet is queas. What decides that? So, for example, here in my divo, it is like all. And in a conclusion, you have a queen two. Simply have the two siences in the riddle. And if it was one, you have to jar others extra in the riddle. And if you have a queer otro extra in the riddle, he will constantly go. That's crazy. That is like serados for the aristocracy. This is how it serves for the aristocracy. And if you have a little bit of porbolic, but not very good. And this is the last thing that we are. OK, that's already consted. Maybe this is a variant of the problem, it's like a little bit of a little bit of a little Meaning the cylindrical queue what is in the plan, but two circles of bases contain all the vertices and not intersecting the circulos. So these like 3 linguistic, enterides like the pantalones. Tengos 3 circulos, no, tengos 3 circulos que endo destanos misvertices and And the aristocrats don't intersect the circles. And here are not working with completes graphics, especially working with three partitas because they have three circles. And the pod extended because there are some circles. This is the optimo for the simple 50. Obviously, we are optimal, but that means we have a lot of questions. There are a lot of questions. We studied with two circles, with three circles, and not much more. We have technicals to study four more circles, but we don't have to say. It's a good idea of problema biennito este y las technicas están yácmo ahí para empesara estudia. Which of gracias? Natalia? Natalia? Okay, when this is one of the problems about the number of directions, and mentioned no classification. And we mentioned that there are classification completa, we can reference with classification. Yira, the term of honor, concentrate in conjunctors with numerous parts of vertices, because it is facilitated from one another, but if all the results are concentrating in numerous parameters, generally asymmetria, and if we agree to the central things. So we concentre. So if we spar demonstrate that, if they are in points, siempre in directions, in or more. So what are all conjugates from directions exactly? The term describe conditions needs to Necessarias so that in a circular discussion, so that has exactly directions. So studying not the results in the demonstration of one garage, we have information of the circular sources that can be transit to the geometric geometry. So in the circular source, what we want is a combination of problems, which are the susceptible. And it is, because the points are in general, so in circular sources are transpositions, change of two, so the unicación circular queue satisfaction has regular polymers. The polygon regulation. And that record in the geometry that the unico is resulted in Jameson that configuration of general position is the regular and all their transformations because the problem is characteristic vaccine transformations. So how circular? As their circular source, two copies of the circular language, the problem with this simplified problem in this world. And if there are a lot that you can do there, and to understand what we have, this point of general imposes there is a 100 confecturation, ten families that are not in general that satisfaction. That is passion to have directions. I think they are todas apart because they are all apart from create 500 points, and the families poradicas for 15 points. But that all are all toddled, but many examples of not much, but algunos that satisfaction. So classificaries.  In escape in directions, we sabe. There with, but not, and it seems like it can, and I could imagine, can put them in. Not only condition symmetrical condition, and we have a ton of results as partial results, like necessary conditions, not necessarily indistado. I don't necessarily mention a vistado, and if the symmetry, one position general was central, that would be a little more extension, because I'm permitted that lines that have more points, but that lines have to be a very simple thing. So, we have a classification complete, but. Listado completed. Present that all points contienes precentro, or my conjugate tiene rectas per centro, and cada una tiene la first tieni 3 points the second two, the tercera cuatro que sea, yo tigo when rectas for 1 center, so exist a unique circular and y exist for Exist to what parameters, but the unicas that are giometric, the solutions and families. Including the position general, and these other things are much more. Because we have all the problems that we have. Problems that are just, no, no, si, ah, que ha una sit. Vive, muchas girl, Silver, Venada. Silver, I'm a commentary, I'm not imagining other geometries. If you have geodesic seradas, I think theorem of Silvestre is false, and if no serrades, because I can imagine. I worked on crucies for a lot of time, but this como del 20 y aviritando much directions, and interest in this problem. The interesting problem. Ten students during the pandemic, and we have one list to do our projects. For example, the paraboloid elliptical ellipsoid. But for example, the paraboloid and perbolico, with machinery. And respect when it comes to the case of lineage. Yes, I think this is the question: this term of Tau Grin is impressionante, but also superposed. Superposada, super, superposed. The articulo is complicated. One more article, but complicated. Nosotros unpoquito antes que de que escaroso demonstración, demonstrado algunos casos particulars. Particular cases utilizando suces circular security. I have their projectos that dependes. I think I have the idea that the many more con the situation circularization is a lot more tranquil that usanos usan curbs elliptical curve their algebra in numerous demonstrations so that one demonstration basic are y grin but the other is that they para in sufficient Is that the people to sufficiently integrate? And it is very great. So, everything is for me very interesting because it can be more, or inclusive for specific families. That's a especially well, it's que decision because we can just try to trade so many regions. So, you have many regressions because all manner of choice can be with my technical. I want to recall a second of time, but we will not.
