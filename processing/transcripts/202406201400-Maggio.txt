Maggio about the epsilon form for single-scale fibrin integrals with Calabiao geometry. So hi everyone. I would like first to thank the organizer for inviting me here in Mexico. It has been very nice and to have the opportunity to present my work. So I will mostly talk about work in progress with my supervisor, Claudur, Christoph Niega, Rancho Dancedi and Fabian Wagner. And I will talk about epsilon form for single-scale Feynman integrals that have an underlying Calabiao geometry. So, let me give an outline. I will start with a motivation and then I will describe what are the methods already in the literature to talk about the epsilon, to find an epsilon form, and I will generalize one of them. Then, I will mention some new examples that we use to understand a bit better the properties of. Understand a bit better the properties of integrals with a Calabio geometry. And then I will draw the conclusion and give an outlook for future work. Okay, so let's start with the motivation. We now know that Peyman integrals have underlying geometry that are more complicated than the Riemann sphere. So we have, for example, elliptic curves, hyberelliptic curves, and Cabiao manifold. We already heard some of these topics in this workshop. Indeed, there's also In this workshop. Indeed, that's also why we are at the workshop. However, it's not that it's all new. There are already some ideas in the literature about how to epsilon factorize them. For example, we have, I will mostly focus on these two works. So we have the paper by Weinzel, Pogel, and Bank on epsilon form for any loop equal mass banana integral. And then the paper by Gerges, Negat, and Cruden Wagner on Wagner's on how to epsilon factorize integrals with an elliptic geometry. However, of course, there are open questions. So, for example, if we use these two methods on the same integral, are we getting the same epsilon form? Is there a sort of uniqueness? And can we say what is the structure that we expect from an integral that has a Calabiao geometry, at least part? At least the part of the Calabiao geometry in the differential equation. And what are the functions that we expect to be there in the Calabria geometry part? So of course to understand that we need examples to look at and study them. And indeed, that's also the goal of this talk. So discuss some cases and try to understand these questions. So then let's start with a review that's very light. Review that's a very lightning review of the method of the tomb people, and more details are in their paper. So, they start with a very detailed choice, so they talk about a method, so they also give some steps on how this method work, and they put a lot of effort also in the choice of initial basis. So, this will be the slide with most text, more text, and there will be less. And so, they give some prescription, and they start by saying that they avoid integrals with UV. Saying that they avoid integrals with UV or IR divergences and integrals that have non-trivial epsilon dependence in the denominator. Then they start looking at the various sector. So for sectors that have only one master integral, they choose candidates with unit leading singularities. And then for sectors that are more complicated, so with several master integral, first they choose integrals such that they make this minimally coupling manifest. So for example, if So, for example, if a system has four master integrals, they try to, but it's elliptic, they try to choose two of these master integrals such that you can decouple the elliptic curve. And then the first integral of the geometry would be as the first integral would be a set of delog forms up to the last integration, and they choose for the last integration the different. For the last integration, the different olomorphic differential of the first kind. And then the other integral of the same geometry will be given by a linear combination of the derivative of the first. So this is the prescription that they give for how to choose the initial basis. And I also will be happy to discuss more if you have some intuition why this is the case. So I have mine, but I would be happy to hear other ideas. Then once they had. Once they are the initial basis, then they rotate by the inverse of the semi-simple part of the period matrix. So the period matrix is W, and they split it into a semi-simple and unipotent part. And then they rotate the basis of the top sector by the inverse of the semi-simple. So they it's like throw away the unipotent part. And once they've done that, they make a shuffling of the master integral. Shuffling of the master integral, and they bring the maximum integrals, they still have some epsilon form below the diagonal, such that now all the non-epsilon, all the non-epsilon factorized terms are below, like in the lower triangular part. And then they start integrating out these epsilon terms. Mostly they do it by shifting with other mastery integrals and with terms that are already with functions that are already present. Present given by the single-simple part of the matrix. But when that's not enough, they have to introduce new functions to epsilon factorize the top sector. And then they do the same for the lower sectors. So of course, there are more details in the paper. This was just to give an overview. And new details will be in the coming one with me and Claude as well. So this was one of the two methods. So this was one of the two methods and now I want to talk about the other one. That's the one that I also will focus more in this talk. So the answer that bins all F for banana integrals. But I want to slightly generalize it for any single scale integral with Talabiao geometry. So what we do is that we consider integrals with a specific Bigger Fuchs structure and the Bigger Fuchs already Structure and the Bigger Fuchs already introduced by Roger is the differential operator that acting on the integral gives zero plus subtopology. And the Bigger Fuchs structure that we consider is this one. So in particular, we can see that we don't have epsilon at the denominator. And the highest derivative power is not multiplied by epsilon. So this is, we assume that our integral has this shape, as this bigger group separator, and we And we can split this into part to study it better. So we have the we can completely factor out the epsilon part, that is this one, and then the pure integer dimension part. And for that, we can also compute the homogeneous solution. And the homogeneous solution corresponds to the leading singularity. So it's the equation specified by the integral of the maximum cut in the equals T zero. So I'm saying that because now I So I'm saying that because now I want to go as also Andrei was yes for Calabiao yes at least this is what I understood yeah no okay indeed this is the single variable case but yeah Andrea But yeah, as Andrei was saying also, to understand a bit better, let's go to the tau space. So to the Calabian manifold space, we can define indeed tau as the ratio of the single logarithmic solution and the homomorphic solutions. So this would be the equivalent also for elliptic curve, when for the elliptic curve there are only two solutions. And we, moreover, we consider the Picker-Fuchs operator such that the epsilon through the zero part as this structure where part as this structure where these y are the y invariant of the Calabiao geometry considered and so if we assume that the Bigger Fuchs operator has this shape then we can show that this is a canonical basis this is the same basis as also Bainzer let al but so now we know that can be used in any Calabiao integral that satisfies integral that satisfies this hypothesis. And yeah, q the indeq is just the derivative in the tau. So would be going in the tau space. And these f functions are they depend on the epsilon part of the pickerfux operators. Okay, so this was just to say to explain the two methods and now let's go to the example. Let's go to the example. So, the first question that I asked at the beginning is the comparison. So, we actually looked with the two people at the LUP banana integrals, and they were computed in this paper, and they also computed with their method extended for Calabio cases. And we actually get the same epsilon form up to some rotations. And the same for IceCon, but this way, the other way around. So, they computed the ISCON, and so I used. And so I use this other method to epsilon factorize them. And again, we get the same epsilon form up to some rotations. So it seems that the ideas are almost the same. And now let's try to understand a bit more about the structure. So to understand a bit more about the structure, I will look at new examples. And in particular, I will talk about the deformed virgeometric function. They are deformed because I They are deformed because I have this epsilon here, and in a minute I will tell you why they are relevant. So, this is the kind of hypertrophic function we look at, where p is equal to q plus 1, so we have q plus 1 q, and then we have the usual rational part, but we also have a real part, and the real part is given by the epsilon. So, okay. Okay, by the deformation epsilon. I will not prove it now, but some of them, so not all of them, we need a combination of a certain type of the parameters, they have a Calabiao structure. And by Calabiao structure, I mean that the differential operator is actually of Calabiao type. That's why we are looking at them. And in particular, they have the advantage that it's like only looking at the top sector. So instead of being So instead of being an integral with subsectors, this function are only the top sector of that integral. So we can look at them to understand the Calabria geometry part. And so we can study them as if they were Feynman integrals, because indeed they are defined by a differential equation. And this differential equation is exactly the same type of differential equation that I was showing you before. So we can You before. So we can really look at them as if they were Feynman integrals. And so indeed, we can also epsilon factorize them. And starting by from a derivative basis, so the same way one would do for banana, then we find a canonical basis of this form. So exactly the same shape. Let's now look in an example. So for example, for the Calabiao tuple. So, for example, for the Calabiao two fold, we would have three integrals, and the integrals look like that. So, we have a first integral divided by the holomorphic solution, and then we have the first derivative, and for the last integral, we have the third derivative, and the three functions are here to be to epsilon factorized, what is not epsilon factorized yet. So, this function will appear in the transformation. So, appearing in the transformation. Transformation. So appearing in the transformation, they will be defined by a differential equation. And solving this differential equation will give us, we impose this differential equation to eliminate the non-epsilon factorized terms. Okay, let's then really look at an example. We first took this ego geometric function that is very symmetric, as you can see, instead it has one alpha, one alpha, one alpha, and one one. Alpha 1 alpha 1 alpha and 1 1. And if we do that, so if we actually solve the differential equation for the F, we find this epsilon form. And let me give some definitions. So lambda here is modulated lambda and psi 0. So the holomorphic period is given by lipid k of lambda squared. And this is actually a modular form of way 2. And this, as Rogers also was already saying, this tells us that the Already saying, this tells us that the differential operator is indeed a symmetric square, but this we were expecting because it's a differential operator for a Calabiao twofold. So that's always a symmetric square for a one-variable case. And then by I1F1, I mean the iterated integral, and where the function that is iterated is proportional to, say, zero cubed in this case, and then multiplied by a rational function of. By a rational function of lambda. The other two functions that appear are proportional to place zero squared and play zero cubed. So having said that, let's look a bit more in the structure. Yes. Yes, I put the 64 because in this way everything would be integer, but it's just a rescaling. You can do the So it's just a rescaling. You can do the same thing. So let's look now at the structure. What we saw is that every entry of this matrix, if we compute the Q expansion, is integer. So this is also connected to the fact that I choose a parameter, so 64 Z, but that's just rescaling. So it means that it's a property. It's a property of the function by itself. And if we now look at the, I trade the integral and we write in terms of the Z, so with the Jacobian, I mean, this is very unwavy, but if we now look at the power of psi, it's actually, let's say, proportional to psi zero. But indeed, if one computes the modular weight, one can see that this transform as a quasi-Eischelear function of modular weight two. And the psi zero. 2 and psi 0, as we saw before, also has modular weight 2. So psi 0 is a modular function. This is a quasi Eischelaire. But what I wanted to say is that this object also has a sort of weight 2 in terms of a modular object. And if we now look at the matrix, we can see the diagonal transform as an object with weight 2, the diagonal below as an object with weight 4, and the last bit as an object of weight 6. And this is actually a property that we And this is actually a property that we observed in any other example. And yeah, the last thing, another thing that we observed, if we now look at the function that is going to be integrated, and if we expand it in q, so we already said that it's integer, but moreover, it's not just integer, but it's given by, so each an is actually n squared b n, where b n is integer. Where Bn is the integer. So this is not just any modular forms, but these are the magnetic modular forms. So these forms were introduced by Lee and Neuter. And so in a separate paper, also with Killian, we studied these new modular forms. Because studying these integrals, we found new modular forms that were not already present in the literature. Magnetic, this is the definition of. Magnetic, this is the definition of magnetic modular form, so we're a n divided by n to the power of d as globally bounded denominator, so that means that is integer. And yeah, in this case, the depth would be two. So just by looking at this function, we already found some properties that we expect to be true for a Calabiao, for integer with a Calabiao geometry. So we did the same also for another example, a bit less symmetric. So now we have one for. So now we have 1, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4. And what we observed is that we get again the same structure. So this size 0, the 0 squared, then the 0 cube on the diagonal still stays there. And also the Q expansion is still integer. And for that, we also found other new magnetic modular forms. And these are just, I just wanted to show. So we have they are this time are for gamma 02 before they were for gamma 2. They were equal gamma 2. Yeah, this so these are just the object that we tried the magnetic modular form in terms of. And this is depth one and the other. Okay, so this is what we observed for Calabiau Tufold examples. And if we go beyond K3, we see again the same structure along the diagonal. So we still see this psi zero structure. And the integer, the entries that still integer q. Entries that still integer Q expansion. However, we cannot use modular forms anymore, but it's like instead of using magnetic modular forms, we can say that they have a sort of weight with respect to size zero, so with respect to the holomorphic form. So this is what we observed for this example. We have also other examples. So for example, the ice cone and in the block of the geometry. In the block of the geometry, also the iscone has this same characteristic, and the same characteristic or also in the Barana integral. So, this seems to be characteristic of the Calabiao integral. And just to conclude, now everything was for one variable. Behind that, there was written more. So, this has been very much work in progress, and we're working to generalize this to more scale. Generalize this to more scales. In particular, I'm doing this with Joan, Oliver PhD student. And for now, we get that it works. So our generalization works for any mass configuration of the sunrise. But we also have new examples. We indeed can epsilon factorize the three-loop banana integral with two equal masses. And this also Claude is doing with us. These are the two configurations. Thus, these are the two configurations that we are looking at because they are the only two. So, the pairwise masses and the three one. And not only could we epsilon factorize them, but yeah, of course, this is more complicated because now even though they are A3, this is not a symmetric square anymore because this is not a single variable object anymore. But however, we still managed to define the class of functions. And this we did a bit before with Claudia, in particular, the function that we found. Claude, in particular, the function that we found here are Hilbert modular forms, and here actually product of modular forms. So we managed to disentangle the two variables into two products. And to give an example, the holomorphic period can be written like that, where these are the olomorphic period of the equal mass sunrises. And T1 and T2 are the out module for gamma 06. And yes. So with that, I. Yes. So with that, I'll bring you to my conclusion. So, yeah, understanding the geometry apparently can help us find the epsilon form. And we now have a method to epsilon factorize in principle any Calabiao integral with a single scale. And apart from the example that I showed, there are also Calabiao threefold and Calabiao fourfold examples, and the Ice Pons example. And we're now working on generalizing it to multi-scale integrals. So, yeah, there are already results for the two equal masses, banana integral, but we are planning to do also the four unequal masses. And yeah, of course, we need to try it on more examples because the banana integral can be a very too easy example to try things with. And this is on our plan. So, with that, I thank you for your attention. So with that, I thank you for your attention. Thank you. Thank you for that talk. Questions? I have two questions. One was I think where you talked about Lorenzo's and those basis. So in the beginning you mentioned something about is there a unique basis for About is there a unique basis, right? Yes, um, so I was not one, there was another slide. Ah, no, okay, I got it. Yes, yeah, I put too many animations. This one, yes, yes. So here, um, the same absolute form you say you obtain from two different methods. From two different methods, yes, but you mean the basis you obtained, or you can actually have a canonical form and you can always transform it from one to another. What was the statement? Yeah, the second so that the differential equation that we get in the two ways, in the end, it's the same. We can transform it with some rotation to is it special to this or it's I think it's special to every canonical form, right? Or Canonical form, right? Or as far as I understood, no, so not necessarily. If you have two canonical forms, you can always translate it one to another. This is what I understood. And the second one was about space and the depths. Yes. So in the papers, you define also the depths, and then in the next slide, there was also depth. No, but that was the depth of a magnetic model form. Yeah, but is there a possibility? Yeah, but is there a possibility of like having the results such that when you integrate every tone has either the same depth. Yes. The depth is the same because these integrals to these different magnetic modular forms appear such that when you integrate on them, in the end, they have depth zero. So all the terms will have depth zero that corresponds to integer expansion. So since we observe all Expansion. So, since we observe always integer expansion, they have the same depth. Okay, more questions? First of all, thank you for the talk. I'm not sure how much it applies here, but in Lorenzo's approach, if you have to perform the subtractions of the subsectors, then you always get this G functions. Yes. Do you get like even more complicated? So, no, what I get is iterated integrals of modular forms in the case of K3. In case with higher geometry, I would get iterated integrals of holomorphic period. That's what I get. Thank you. Okay. Any others? No? Okay, well, that's thanks, Sarah, again then. And we'll continue.
