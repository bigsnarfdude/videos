And we'll talk about geometric analysis of SSL PEs with full technologies. The presentation is based on a recent reprint which titled Like That, it's from an archive. So, what we try to do is study a PD model of the planar fold. So, you see here we have the standard planar fold equation. So you see here we have the standard planar flow equations with diffusion added and our intention was to do a truly infinite dimensional DSPD analysis in the sense by identifying a critical manifold in the original PD phase space, show some persistence results maybe and then try to find an analog of the blow-up method and combine all the other. So put just the simplest case for boundary conditions. Which is the simplest case for boundary conditions, which is uh homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. And this is because uh that way, if you consider only constant space solutions in our domain, which is an interval, then the problem reduces to the ODE version. And this is what our attempt is: a reduction of the full PD to the ODE problem. So this So, this makes us, our phase space go for 2D to infinity dimensional. Since this problem is locally well posed in time on L2, cross-l2. And by considering only constant space solutions, we can identify credit manifold at 0, constants v equals u square squared, the only case that we view as a subset of L2 cross L2. Of L2 cross L2. And these are high-level terms. Similar to what we said for the OD, but not quite for technical reasons. So the main difficulty here is that in the slow component we have an unbounded operator. You can say much more about PDOD fast slow systems, where the slow component is finite dimensional. Component is finite-dimensional. And this is because if you consider the semi-flow detilde of the full system up here and you compare it to the semi-flow of the singular limit, epsilon goes to zero, these two semi-flows, the difference between those will be for the epsilon appropriate norm. And then we can use the results from Bayes Luzhenk, which seem to be the more general. They have a series of papers that prove persistence of Persistence of manifolds for semiflows under this assumption here. However, this assumption is no longer true if we consider a non-zero, non-linear non-zero differential grade here, the slow component, so that the slow variables evolve in infinite dimensional space. This has to do with differential operators as such as the Laplacian we considered earlier being a bounding, and then you multiply them by a small parameter epsilon, and it's great. Parameter epsilon, and this creates a two-limit problem. So, here is the problem we're studying again. As I said, this is the critical microphone we identified as a subset of the cross-L2. So, there's a problem here as well defining what non-hyperbolicity is. Because usually, the non-hyperbolicity of an environment manifold is defined in terms of contraction rates along different. Contraction rates along different directions. This cannot be done here if our solar is three-dimensional. However, it has recently shown here that under certain conditions one can locally construct slow manifolds around with an appropriate notion of non-hypervelocity, which has to do with balance on the semigroups generated by the Generated by the differential operators here. However, note that we have a new parameter zeta here. So these are not totally slow manifolds in the sense of fencing, but they share some similar properties. And this parameter is needed to separate the slow part into fast and slow parts. And what I mean by that is, we consider, let's say, the Laplacian boss. The Laplacian in both equations, and you expand with respect to not normal basis. You see here in the slow equations that no matter how small epsilon is, at some point the eigenvalues will become so large that the corresponding equations will no longer be slow. So we have to group them together with fast. And this is what this parameter zeta, the role this new parameter zeta plays. Place and in terms of cutting off the system here and including some variables with k greater than k0 with the fast and the rest considered truly slow, this relation holds between these two parameters. As you see when you saw previously, we would have two slow manifolds if we could take a fixed epsilon and take z that go to zero. But this intuition here says that. The intuition here says that this is not possible in general. Taking zeta zero will correspond to taking k0 goes to infinity, and this means that we have this conceptual problem with what directions are fast and slow. What we can do instead is truncate this system at K0 to obtain a pass-low ODE system this time. A high-dimensional one, but still an ODE system. And there are further system. And there are further results that say if we project our critical manifold from the PD level onto the subspace generated by the span of the first K0 eigenvalues of our autonomous system, then this projecting manifold K C0 K0 will be normally hyperbolic part. But we can mindful of this, truncate it, all the system now. All these systems now, and for some fixed epsilon, some sufficient large K0 can approximate the original true slow manifold we had in the PV level. Therefore, we choose some K0 such that these two manifolds are close, and then we blow up the truncated system, which is an Audi system, and track this object that approximates our original uh slow manifold at the P V level. So much of the TV level. And yeah, so we have to blow up the origin of the truncated system here. No, sorry. So hyperbolicity is lost. The result I mentioned previously on the slow manifolds on the PD level breaks down at the origin. This PD system because you take the first shared derivative. Derivative of the fast equation and value it at zero. It turns out this is where the first eigenvalue of the Law of Lacian crosses the origin. That's why we cannot apply the slow manifold result there. So if we take our system and project onto the first k0 eigenfunctions and actually go through the calculations we're playing this system which consists of 2k0 plus 1 2k0 plus 1 virtues plus 1 because we add an epsilon here. So here that if we take the subspaces uk equals 0, vk equals 0, where k ranges from 2 to k0, which is our truncation point, are invariant. And on this invariant subspace, we only are left with v1 equals minus v1 plus minus square root of 2. minus square root of 2 u1 square and it's minus square root of of 2 epsilon which is the planar fold so our objective here is to show that somehow we can control the high order modes using some estimates and then we use the behavior of the planar fold to complete our analysis of this system and yeah as you see this is fast flow system with you one bit fast Fast load system with u1 being the fast, so u1, uk being the fast variables, v1 vk are the slow. And so the origin from the Alisho PD problem, which is where normal hyperbolicity is lost, corresponds to the origin of this high-dimensional ODS system. And we are able to obtain the main result here. So the image here we see C0, which is the project. The image here we see C0, which is the projected critical manifold for the PDE, which is here in this parabola. The left part here, as usual, long with hydropolic attracting, the right part of the parabola is repelling. And we're able to show that if you define transition line between delta in and delta out, these two sections. So this is the projection of the E1, V1 variables, but all the other. Variables, but all the objects here live in a neighborhood. That means the higher orders are not zero but are small. So delta n here is an interval. But delta intersection is defined as full neighborhood, cut intervals in all directions. And this is analogous to what we expect for planar fold. So this is the system, the truncated system. the system the truncated system uh at k0 equals zero this is system here truncated at k0 equals zero so we're checking what happens in this case in order to build some intuition for this general case. So this is a 2x2 fast slow system. U1 u2 are fast, v1, v2 are slow. We can solve for the critical matter, we can write it as a graph over u1 u2 and here in the And here in this drawing, we can see the stability. So C0, which is the parabola from before, corresponds to the graph over Q1 for U1 negative. But you see here the critical magnet contains much more than C0 and has stability properties here. For example, there is a blue curve that separates the normally attracting from the Attracting from the subtle part of the critical manifold. So, in this region here, two negative eigenvalues on the right, we have one positive, one negative, and along this blue curve, which you can calculate explicitly, one of the eigenvalues, which is a sign. You can do the same for three modes in our tracation. Here we have this funnel-shaped region. So the red line denotes the part C0, which is the parabola. So here the critical manifold is a graph over U1, U2, U3. Inside this funnel, all three eigenvalues are negative. Then along the surface here we we lose one positive eigenvalue one negative eigenvalue. So one negative becomes positive changes sign and the relative remain uh remain negative. Adding my negative. So let's proceed with the blow-up now. So there are two options. We can either include the domain length as a variable in the blow-up transformation. But this way, it turns out to balance the powers, one needs to take minus two as a weight, which is not ideal. But it has been done in this work where the pitchfork bifurcation with the slowly varying bifurcation parameters. With a slowly variant bifurcation parameter is studied using the same method. So, this approach is followed. However, it's not the disadvantage of the negative power, and thus the resulting vector fields in the charts are not even defined at zero. So, we chose here to perform a space rescaling by introducing this new parameter, capital A, which is a constant that's dependent on lowercase a, which is the Lowercase A, which is the length of our domain, times epsilon some power. And then for the other variables, we have the standard 1 to 3 ratio. This has the added advantage that makes the origin fully degenerate. I change it to fast law structure because you make epsilon appear in some places where it was originally not. However, for non-zero epsilon, the However, for non-zero epsilon, the previous system and their scale domain one are equivalent. Let's uh see some pictures about the dynamics in the three charts. So this picture should be familiar. We construct a transition map for the regional one, uh to sigma one out. Uh the analysis is based on an attracting central money for the MK0 one. Center manifold MK01 here. So you notice I made it thick, which is because if we look at the system at the R1 equals epsilon equals 0 subspace, let's say K0 equals 0, you will have a sp K0A point which you're attracting which which in the Which in the OD case is where the attractive part of the slope is currently a manifold black sea to the blown-up space. However, because here we have many more equations, you see that we do not have a single steady state, but the whole blue line here is the line of steady states. Actually connects this point to the point down here, which is where the unstable part of the critical manifold passing. And all these equilibria have different uh traction properties. So Abstraction properties, so we cannot follow a purely geometric approach. Instead, we have to consider some estimates for how they want in order to be able to control them. Look at short K2. This particular one, so again be familiar. We're able to reduce everything to a Lagrangian perturbation of the Riccati equation, that's planning the planar fold. So this is the everything Everything proceeds as usual here. And then in the third chart, you should again be familiar. The origin Q is a hyperbolic steady state, which is where the whole analysis is anchored around. We have some objects coming from the previous charts. The main difference here is that instead of FAR3, we also get the UK3, which are also unstable directions. And since our transition time, Directions. And since our transition time, as epsilon goes to zero, goes to infinity, we have to make sure that these additional stable directions are controlled. You don't cause any matter of blow-up before which are exit charge. And this again is done using some estimates on the higher modes. And let me finish by returning. And let me finish by reiterating some key points. So we have the existence of some manifolds around some normal hyperbolic points under a certain definition. Where we have the loss, on a markolicity, we discretize the PDE and we work with a discrete system, this blow up the discrete system. And the connection between these two approaches is that slow mind was approximately. We can approximate it by manifolds of the discrete eye system. And somehow you have to play with space domain in order to be able to obtain a successful blow-up. Finally, in the discretized system, we cannot hope to take case 0 goes to infinity and epsilon goes to infinity simultaneously. At the moment, at least. Double limitation I described earlier. I'll stop here. Thank you. So I'm trying to understand sort of what the result might help us to understand, say, relaxation oscillations, right? Which is one example where you have pointwise sort of say banana. Pointwise, sort of say, the Nandepal oscillator, and you have this slow passage through a point, through a fold in each point in space. I mean, these are sort of things, like if you do this now in a spatially extended system, you have like this, the relative phase of these oscillations as an additional degree of freedom, right? And I think my friend Paul has some results. I think he might mention some of this there in his talk. I'm trying to understand sort of what kind of solutions are going to. Understand what kind of solutions when I think of now relaxation oscillations where this jump now maybe changes in space, like this traveling wave, station periodic traveling waves are one example that people are interested in and how these relative jumps depend on space, how they travel. Can you track any of those and tell me something about the dynamics or maybe one day that you hope to what how does this relate to your results? So, the idea behind this work is to create a version of geometric signal perturbation theory that can be applied to PDs directly. So, this is just the first step. So, one day I hope it can be applied to answer questions like the ones you posed. But for now, the idea is to experiment with really simple problems and see what we can get away with. But we can get away with by working in infinite dimensional spaces. These solutions get very irregular, right? Very steep, as F soon goes to zero, so they see, I don't know how they can. In space, you mean? In space? Oh, yeah. But they know. I think they are very flat. It's not Neumann problems. I think they're almost constant. Yeah, we might as well do current. Yeah, right. And then I can get my travel. Yeah, so we start with straight-line solutions and then we add small regular. There are small regularities, and we show that as you pass through the fault, these do not blow up pretty much. This remain bound. That's it. What is the meaning of the word point here? Is it the point in function space or what is it? It's the only function space. Except L two, but L two is not a good space for P D's P. For P D is hidden. So points here refers to points on the critical manifold we identified. Where does it live? In our example, it lives on the subspace of constant solutions for convenience reasons. But in general, for example, if you switch to D-reclaimed boundary conditions, you will no longer have no longer be able to consider consonant specific. Constantly space functions anymore. So that's something for future research. So in general, point is refers to points that have a certain property, in the sense that if you linearize the PD there, the general PD there, the linear path satisfies some bounds on the semi-groups that generate. And you can also And you can also get and one of the additional properties is that you can obtain a good splitting as well here in order to construct some holes because of the issue described as if for fixed epsilon, if you add in values go to infinity, then some parts would be fast after all. So the fast loss operations are clear. In order to be able to construct solar models, you have to your linear operators have to satisfy some bounds at the given point, and also you have to have a good splitting. Short comment on so, how this normally hyperbolic theories is set up here. The approach was to set this up in quite a general semi-group setting, and then you do the selection. Group setting, and then you do this along Banner scale. So, in such an example, this would be an appropriate H2. I mean, the function of space setting I think is also better written up properly. But as Thomas said, what he meant with these points, I think, is just restricted. Neighborhood would be an HP. Just a quick question. I mean, it's really interesting that you're looking at the case where the slowly varying parameter, as it were, is not just varying in time, right? You just have the epsilon times of Laplacian in front, right? Could you just tell us a little bit more about the motivation for that particular XX? Is there a particular motivation for that one? Or are there other choices that one might consider? So the motivation was that if you don't have Was that if you don't have a differential operator here, there are already a lot of things known. So, this sort of is the first step to theory of fast LPDs, in a sense, of a full fast LPDs. So I'm not aware of any applications at the moment, but this is just say toy model explorer possible. Say toy model to explore the possibility to develop such a theory. One brief comment also to ask question concerning these applications, maybe to this more interesting reciprocation oscillation. I think as it's set up now, and as Timas pointed out, I think the problem and also a limit of this approach to a certain extent is of course that you and only And only approach this actual slow manifold idea, which is parametrized by this extra CETA or Dynamic-Lapino information by its phase zero for fixed epsilon. So you can't really say you you now fix a certain interval of the epsilon and now you let the K0 go to infinity. What you have to do is really to What you have to do is really to take the xylon with you to zero because it's always to make this fast-slow distinction really, really sensible here. You always need to take this mode parameter also to zero if you allow for more and more modes, because then you don't really get possible splitting anymore. So in that sense, the approach is really something where you say you are close with the Galerian approximation, right? And what you can construct is I kind of have some manifold parameters that rise in my phase zero or zeta, which is extract. Or zeta, this extra parameter. And then you have to be happy with fixing your k0 if you want to make some statements about a small amount of sign on around this. And then say, okay, maybe now we can that also approach some more interesting applications of the dynamics. But the full infinite dimensional problem is the ones. Is it fair to say, or is it reasonable to think of it in this way that your manifold might not be in some sense, you might not be able to do a lot of. You might not be able to do a contraction for a full term, but relaxation is sort of within this restriction that that would have to make larger or extensive. This could be a problem. It could be a problem, but it's interesting to really think about this. Yeah, no, I think probably you can cook around it, but I think the whole business, what is really important, that we can discuss later as well, is really this question of. Is really this question of thought to really make the fascination splitting even like really sensible mental setting, right? And then, if you're happy with that for this kind of fixed C ta parameterization, then you also need to work in a Galaxian case with fixed P0 and then you can just say, okay, it's in some instance. Then you can probably track things quite well. Yeah, full PDE answer probably is maybe that's a good conclusion for this. Conclusion for this session, and thanks a lot too much. Then we will reconvene. Okay, perfectly in time, and then we will reconvene another. I want to get it.
