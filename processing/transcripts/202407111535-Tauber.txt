Okay, so hello everybody, I'm Justin. I'm a postdoc in the soft mat lab of Professor Mahavan at Harvard University. And I'm very excited to be here. I've been working on an experimental sort of model system for French and Luki networks and I didn't know about this community at all. And then at APS, I met Sanyasov, and now I'm here. So. Now I'm here. So I hope I can give some different perspectives, adding to all the other different perspectives on branching. And my particular interest is the connection between branching dynamics and the overall branch shape that emerges in the end and how you can sort of control that. So today I will talk about an experimental model system. Experimental model system. And in particular, I will show you how you can have this nice branch structure here and then force it to become this very nice loopy network thing that you see on my slide. So I hope after this talk you understand a little bit better what's happening here. Before that, I want to give you some context for how I came to. For how I came to that pattern. So, this work is inspired by branched patterns in nature and particularly transport networks, so rivers, vascular lightning, we haven't really discussed yet, but there's all flow in these types of models. And at least for some part, self-organization plays a large role in how these networks come about, which means that there's some local process that guides how these practices. Local process that guides how these branches form, but that's not the only thing. They all grow in the context of their environment. So there can be at least some feedback. Lightning may be very clear. It will just strike at one point and then it will drastically reorganize. But yeah, you also see that the vascular fear in this foot that just follows the boundaries of the foot. Of the food. It doesn't grow randomly outwards. So it's clear that environment somehow plays an important role. And I want to think more about can we understand this coupling between local rules and these external constraints. And from that, I was looking in the literature and I found some literature by some people that are in this room. And there was this example from Mehmet of this, you cannot see it that well. These cannot see it that well, but this is neurons that are invading or inside the fin or the tail or whatever you should call it of the superficial. And there is this framework for the branching random walk that shows that at least locally there are some rules like tip branching, tip navigation and tip termination that were already discussed by Nausco. But then so there are some local rules. So, there are some local rules, but then there's also some other important thing that I think we already touched upon last time. There can also be some form of global guidance, which will add some global forcing to give directionality to a pattern. And that is exactly what Mannet worked on. So, to have this branching random walk and then have global guidance and local rules. I'm not talking about the branching random walk at all. I'm just interested. At all. I'm just interested in this general framework that you have a self-organizing system where you have some set of local rules, and then around it you have this idea of local guidance, and together it leads to branch morphology, and it also defines the branching morphogenesis. That's the idea. So, there's one thing that is very hard about this concept: where do these local rules come from? Is that where do these local rules come from? And where does the global guidance come from? And they must come from some physical interaction, but it's not so clear how. So, the question I'm asking is: how do these local rules and global guidance emerge from these physical interactions? And I'm not so interested in a particular model system, or at least I'm not working on a particular model system. We're more interested in general. How do you construct local rules from physical interactions? I think you already. Interactions. I think we already, so an example I can give is based on the jellyfish where we were discussing: is it guided by some stress field, is it guided by some pressure field? And I'm really interested in how does something, having these different types of fields, how does that affect the overall branch shape that you get at the end of the entire branching process of splitting, merging, all the fun things that happen. Um and ideology is is very And in this respect, because there are so many things going on, maybe it's very small scale. So I wanted to work with a model system that is maybe a little bit easier, which is fluid-driven branching, like viscous fingering or erosion or this hydraulic fracture pattern that you find here. So our idea is to take this concept of fluid-driven branching, but then apply this framework of global guidance and local. Of global guidance and local rules. So, I already told you that you cannot just set local rules, you need something else. So, in this case, the local guidance will come from the boundary conditions that you set. So, this is an analogy to this external constraint, this environmental constraint. And then the material properties, our hypothesis is that the material properties will lead to the local rules. So, what you put in your In your system, I forgot to tell you what fluid-driven branching is. So, fluid-driven branching is very simply that you have a defending face and you inject an invading phase in there. And then there is some instability that occurs at the interface, and that leads to this amazing branch pattern. So that's the thing. So the material properties of the defending phase and the invading phase together And the invading phase together, they control these local. That's our hypothesis. So, along those lines, I'm also setting up the experimental system. It's a Hiddy Shell cell type situation. So, I have two plates, and I put a spacer in between of 175 microns. It's a really small gap. And the spacer is sealing the edges completely. So, without me saying anything, no, this is just a completely Now, this is just a completely sealed cell, and then I can put a source. And if I want, I can also put the sink. So at the source, I can inject some fluid at some rate that I want. And then at the sink, the fluid can escape, if it's in. And this is roughly what the system looks like. It's about 20 centimeters big, so it very easily fits on your lab bench. And the whole process also is a nice time scale. Like lightning is a little bit too. Nice time scale. Like lightning is a little bit too fast. River formation is very cool, but quite slow. So if I wanted to change boundary conditions, but other people have figured this out for me already, how to do this. But I chose for this system. So here's one ingredient with the boundary conditions, and then we need the material properties. So we've chosen a miscible system of water that we're injecting in carbocal. And carbacle is a micro-gel solution of little spheres, and you can Spheres, and you can describe it, and it's a yield stress fluid. And a yield stress fluid means that if you apply only a little bit of stress, it behaves like an elastic solid, just assume it's linear and elastic, and then if you apply more stress beyond a certain yield stress, then it will start to flow and it will follow this Herschel-Goati model. But I think for everybody, it's easier if you just think of it as transparent mayonnaise. Because mayonnaise is also quite a good field-stress material. So, if you ever So, if you ever spooked mayonnaise out of your jar, you know that it sits in your spoon, and you can even stilt your spoon and it doesn't flow off immediately. But if you have it in the tube and you squeeze very hard, it will start to flow. Of course, it's food, so it's more complicated. And then we're injecting water, we just put a little bit of dye in there so that we can see what is happening. Okay, so we have the experimental system and boundary conditions. So, now I can start to show you the first result. To show you the first results. But the first thing I'm going to show you is to highlight a very important point for this system, and that is that the cells are compliant. That maybe doesn't make sense if you have seen the thick cells, it's like half an inch thick. But I'm going to show you that I can create patterns if there is no sink at all. So there is something here, but it's closed. So I'm just injecting fluid in a closed cell. And I'm injecting. And I'm injecting, so the total volume in the cell is 3.5 milliliters. I'm injecting 0.75 milliliters. And this will give a deflection of about 40 microns, which means per plate, because I have two plates, it's a deflection about 20 microns. So it's not a big deflection, but my gap is 175 microns, so the effect can be quite big. So this is what we get if we injected different flow rates. So at very low flow rates, we get this. So at very low flow rate, we get this, but we already have a look. And we get these very thick branches, and at very high flow rate, we get many branches. But this is very nice. You think of this as, oh, the flow rate actually sets the local rules. We can talk about later whether that makes sense. But it also aligns with some previous results from other people where they just took carbacol in a cell that is not sealed, and there you all. Is not sealed, and there you also find this general trend that if you increase the flux, that you get more branches. So, another cool thing you can do is you can just take the sink at the source and you can put it in a different place. And then you get a different type of pattern with very similar local structure. But the global structure is altered because you're in a different position with respect to the boundary. So I think. No, you don't have a sink open. In the two cases, you have a sink open. It's closed. It's closed, yeah. Yeah, it's still closed. The next slide. I've got to open it. Yeah, so just so this, I think, is already sort of a Greek form of global guidance. It's just set by the boundary conditions. So it's very hard to see. And I haven't measured it quantitatively, but I know. And I haven't measured it quantitatively, but I know for sure that it does bend out. So you can assume it's a clamp, a plate that is clamped at the edges, and it will have a zero deflection at the edge, and in the middle it will be able to expand. But what about the deflection? The carbon fool is incompressible. It's like the concentration is two grams per liter. So it's basically water. So now the question is: what happens if So now the question is: what happens if we add some more spectacular form of global guidance? And that is by adding a sink. So that is maybe a little bit similar to the lightning case or how rivers work. We have some sink, and that will put a lot of forcing where everything will flow. So that's what we're going to do here. So we have a source where we inject at a constant flow rate, like we did before. And then we have the sink, which just opened, there's a heater on the bottom. There's a heater on the bottom, so you can think of it as like a pressure-controlled outlet at atmospheric pressure or delta P. Zero. So first we see exactly the same thing we saw in a closed cell. But then once it gets close to the sink, we see that it collapses, which I think I was very nicely set up for with the previous presentation. It's a very more There might it's a very more complex system, so maybe there are some details, but I think in principle the system is the idea is similar, I guess. But I we can talk about that more. Yeah, I have a question. But the water is uh moves as a like a sheet flow, so all the kind of patterns that you observe are not like uh uh they doesn't have a shape. No, it doesn't have a shape. They don't have a shape. So the water doesn't erode the plate. No, it's completely filled. Okay. All those kind of veins, they don't have, let's say, a trendy shape. You mean like a river pattern? I don't know, in their own plate. So the way I'm seeing it, this is a little bit simple slide. All the patterns extend from the bottom plate to the top plate. From the bottom plate to the top plates. So there's no riverbed or something. So you start with the cell completely filled. So the entire cell is completely filled. I basically just take mayonnaise and syringe and I inject it. And then it's so that's that's important, yes. Thank you. The look, you stop the film, like all experiments have. Fail, like all the experiments have to come at some point. But your loop algorithm doesn't stay. I will show you at the end. Okay, Green. Yeah, so we have sort of three stages. How are we doing with time? I have another segment. Okay, I will speed up a little bit through some ports so that we get to the looking. So it's sort of in three stages. So first we have branching, then we achieve breakthrough. Achieve breakthrough and then we get a lot of loop. So I first will talk a little bit about the first part in terms of searching strategies and then I will say something about the looping. So we did something that you always do if you just vary the flow rate. We did it over three orders of magnitude. So we go from 30 microliters per minute to 30,000 microliters per minute. And then if we do the experiment, you see quite a drastic change in morphology of the pattern. Morphology of the pattern. So, at high flow rate, I've already shown you that case. But at low flow rate, we see this behavior where it sort of actually moves away from the sink and then it goes in stages and there's also some blow-up stage. And this is something you don't observe if you have open boundaries. So, this is only something you see if you have this very confined constraint for the outflow. So, this is nice. I wanted to have a little bit more of an understanding of how to quantify. Of understanding of how to quantify this. So, what I do is I first define a stable front speed because just imagine if there was no instability, it's very easy to predict when it will hit the sink. So, I can define the front stable front invasion speed that is just the flow rate divided by the area of this circle. You see it gets out of the boundary, so it's but it works, okay? But it works. And then we have the breakthrough speed, which is just the distance between the source and the sink divided by the breakthrough time. And if you plot them against each other, we get this change in slope if we look at the real data. So I did quite a lot of experiments. And you see first there's quite a high slope, and then at the power of well fit, it goes down. So I don't have time to discuss a lot why, but it indicates some change in. Some change in the local rules, if you want to say that. And what is interesting is that this change coincides with a change in the branching transition, and I can sort of quantify that by calculating the fractal dimension of the pattern. So I can binarize it, and then I see this dip. It's a very just like just do a blind power law fit. It's actually because of the change in the width that you get this tick. But at least it's indicative of a But at least it's indicative of a more flexible transition. Something very cool we can do is in the carcool you can easily embed little particles and they just stay there so you can use it to track the flow field. So if you do that at low rate and high rate, you see here that at low rate there flow, there's a lot of flow localized between the source and the sink. While at high flow rate there is barely any flow and it's all localized around the fraction. So we can also use PIV to quantify. Use PIV to quantify to get the velocities, and I express them here with respect to the stable front speed. And then you see here there's quite a high velocity between the source and the sink, and there's actually quite low. So the flow in this high flow rate case of the matrix is very remote. Okay, so then this is some indication there is some change in local rules in combination with the global constraints. I want to give a very quick To give a very quick different perspective on this problem, think of this as a first passage problem. So, you want to go from the source to the sink. This is something you find a lot also in animals that are searching for food or cybolds, maybe. So, in this case, it doesn't seem to know where the sink is. So, it's exploring the space, and then randomly it finds the sink. Well, in this case, it already knows where the food is, because that's where the flow is going. Although, for some reason, which Although, for some reason, which I think is a stress field, it doesn't go there. So, it's like an exploration, exploitation transition, and then you can talk about optimality. So, what is the best way to go from the source to the sink? So, we can define the speeds, which I already did, and the accuracy, which is the area of the shortest path divided by the total branch length. And I define the cost as the injected full human. And then we find that there's a minimum. That there's a minimum at intermediate flow speeds. And this coincides with the branching transition. So if you're balancing these two different modes, you get like optimal sort of behavior. So these are conclusions that I'm going to take, I think. But I want to say, I think we at least have some accessible experimental framework for studying the coupling between trenching dynamics and morphology. And you can put any fluid in here that you want. If you want. And I think it's based on a lot of work from other people, but I think the idea is interesting. So, then about the looping. So, I already showed you can create these loops if you have an open sink. So, now I'm going to show the perfusion by injecting another die. So, you see, it's entirely percolated. I must say I switch the flow rate two orders of my percentage down for the perfusion. So, if I perfuse at the same flow rate, the whole network goes away. But there is another. Goes away. But there's another way. I can inject from two sources without sinks. And then I have two branches that will collide. And then they, after some forcing, I would like some feedback on this because I don't know the best way to do this. I can also let them merge and then I also establish loops. And I have some preliminary data from a student where we looked at different flow rates, and it seems you can optimal. It seems you can optimal looping also at intermediate flow rate, but I'm not sure. And then to conclude, besides that, it's interesting fundamentally, we also have this idea to do something called self-organized manufacturing. So you want a certain pattern statistically, which has a certain function, maybe transporting something efficiently. And then you can use this idea of the global plan, which could be how you drive the systems. It is the difference between continuous. The systems, it is the difference between continuous flow and stop flow, where you put the sinks, where you put the sources. But you can also define the local plants, so different ways of putting materials in. So this is just Newtonian fluids. There's this very cool work that is still ongoing in our lab with interfacial dilation, the yield stress. And I recently found some more space-filling structures, which I think is just delamination. So I think a lot of people have already worked on this, but it would be cool to. It would be cool to also apply this and this concept. And then there's some modeling framework that we can wrap around this. So we have some existing work on erosion in space shield models. And I have a very cool model, this toy, which is based on dielectric breakdown on a grid. But there you can easily put sources and things everywhere, and you get nice, cool patterns at once. So that's it. For me, I should thank my collaborator, Johan Asanasjos. Was a student from Paris who helped me a lot to set this up. Madison Gates, and of course, Ma, and my fellow Schiphol from EMBO. Thank you. In the in the last slides that you shown with that kind of looping patterns, have you tried to study, for example, in the yield stress case For example, in the yield stress case, uh, oh, sorry, no, no, the other one was correct. Yes, yeah, okay, okay. Like in the yield stress or in the sync point sync case, have you tried to study the distribution of the channel length? Not yet, yeah, but not yet. I really want to do it. Right now, I have some rudimentary things, but I should talk to a lot of people here about the best way to define up my patterns into edges, because you can just simply do it at each branch point, but you can also do like. Point, but you can also do like ways basically. So I don't know what the best way to do to break it up because I do have a method to skeletonize and make a graph out of everything. So the framework is there, but I haven't done a good analysis yet. When you were showing ejecting ink from two inputs, right? Can you go to that slide? I didn't understand your protocol that you so. Problem that you so you're just injecting and they just happen to reconnect, although you think they avoid each other once the actual. So I know that if I go very fast, they avoid each other. I know mostly because this pattern is wider than if I only have one sink. But then it seems to be quite hard to find each other. But they do. To find each other, but they do, and I feel like in this low-flow vector issue, but I'm not 100% sure. This is quite preliminary. I saw that when you have a breakthrough, your fingers really widen a lot. So, I am wondering if this is due to the gill stress, or it also happens in your tonia, please? It also happens. Happens, so there's one paper where they do this, they don't talk about deflection, but it also happens in Newtonia. But you're talking about this widening? Yes, it's sometimes we wait. And in several pictures, you can see after percolation, you get the white fingers. Oh, yes, so I think that is also because of the deflection. Because if first the pressure, so I'm injecting at a constant flow rate, so the pressure varies. So if there's no break. So the pressure varies. So if there's no breakthrough, the pressure is really high. So the cell is deflected a lot. But when I get breakthrough, the pressure drops dramatically. You see that mostly because of these branches that are emptying out in the main button. But it also means that these channels that were quite high, they get squashed. And then everything gets, so the matrix got pushed apart. You can also see that in the PI, in the data where I put the particles in the matrix. You see there's a real. In the matrix. You see, there's a reorganization sort of like of the matrix. Also, the flow is constantly. The flow is constant. Quick question? Yeah. It seems to me that in the absence of this sink, you get something which is quite not reachable in standard, like some of the universities, for example. It's the fact that you have quite spaced. And I feel this video related. And I feel this really related to this high confinement in situation. Can you think about a natural system where you could have at the same time high confinement in one direction, but no, you know, you can preserve this even the height or the yeah could you think about this like download confinement both in one direction and just more in the other direction and also and also you don't have the natural single enterprises. I would have to think about it. Probably something is doable. This is the easiest thing you can make. Well, we can discuss more because I'm not 100% sure what you mean. Hey, let's then Justin again.
