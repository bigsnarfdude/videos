Well, thank you for the invitation. Well, I am going to talk about singularities in prime characteristics and some connection with characteristic zero. First, we want to introduce the law. To introduce the loss canonical threshold for it, one take an element in the polynomial ring over z with the condition that the polynomial f has singularity at zero. And we take this function. This function, this function is defined above the variety. With this function, we have an analytic form to define the loss canonical threshold. The loss canonical threshold is the sup of positive real numbers such that this integral exists. Then, the loss can Of a polynomial is an important invariant in birational geometry. This number measures the singularity near to zero. Well, and now we see an example of some spew threshold. Well, in this example, we have three different curves. three different curves and they lost canonical and sorry in the example we have three different curves and the loss canonical threshold now we note that these numbers are rational numbers and smaller the number that carries more fine near to zero is we can see this characterization of the This characterization of the lost canonical threshold. Well, this is analytic form to define the loss canonical threshold. But in other hand, we want to give a geometric definition of the lost canonical threshold. For it, we introduce the multiplier ideal. The multiplier ideal is defined use. Define use a loss resolution. And if we use if we use the multiplier idea, we can define the lost analytical threshold as the sup of the positive real number such that the multiplier idea is all the polynomial ring over complex number and. And the lowest canonical threshold in general is a rational number. Any question? No. Well, later, we are talking about an invariant analogous to the lost canonical threshold in brain characteristic. In brain characteristic called a spear threshold. One of our goals is to compute the pure threshold. Before obsessing this, we studied some tools. First, we We define the p expansion. Let p be an integer number. We take any real number. We can write alpha like the sum of like this like this sum. This sum in this zoom in this number this number this number number uh this number are called or are are called digit and all digits are between zero and p minus one in them this sum is called the p expansion of alpha note that the p expansion of alpha is different Expansion of alpha is different from periodic expansion, which is not defined for general real numbers. This is our first tool for this presentation. The representation of digit of alpha is obtained by using the greedy algorithm of ranging. We did not. We denote for this, we denote for this, sorry, we denote for this the zone from one to e of the digit over populous P. This, this zone, this zone is named the truncation of alpha. Well, oh, more notation for a vector alpha. For a vector alpha, for a vector alpha, we define this like this norm, like the sum of every entries of alpha. It's annotation. And when alpha is in this cube, this alpha is in this cube, biting up for this, the vector form for all the truncation of alpha. And now, And now, this is a very important definition. We say that alpha one to alpha m as we owe carrying module p if the sum of the digit, the sum of the digit is less than p minus one for every k bigger than. bigger than two bigger than one and and and know that if alpha one alpha to alpha n as we own carrying module p if and only if the p expansion the p expansion of this integral integral number as we also Number at we all carrying for all e bigger than one. And if p is a prime number, then we have the classical lemma Lucas Lemma, sorry. Lucas lemma. The local lemma say that if the entries of this vector, this vector, as we all This vector at we all carry modulate P if and only if this by nomin coefficient is different to zero module P. It's a classical Lucas length. Any question? No, okay. Well. No, okay. Well, carry on. Now, we introduce our main combinatorial tool that splitting polytope. But first, we see some notation before to define the splitting polytope. Speed important. Pronotation, given alpha and beta vector, we denote for this the component-wise inequality and for 1m, the vector 1111, 14. And let f a novel, non-constant polynomial in the ring R. R is the ring of the polynomial over k. K is a Over k. K is an arbitrary field. And we define the matrix epsilon, epsilon f, the matrix form which is column in form for all elements in the support of f. This matrix is named the exponent matrix of F. Of F. And with the Schwanning matrix, we can define the splitting polytope. The splitting polytope is this cell. It's the cell form for all vector gamma such that the matrix epsilon by gamma is less than the vector one. The splitting polytope was introduced first. Was introduced first by Mustata, Takagre, and Guatanabe, further developed by Hernandez. Moreover, we want to extend this definition to a list of polynomials. For it, we consider a finite list of polynomials F1, F2, F3. X t in the irrelevant ideal M of R. And we assume that F i has exactly ni monomial and we take L1 equals N1 and define Li with a property dive that first Li monomials is. L i monomials in fi do not appear in the leaf from f1 to f1 minus sorry from f1 to fi minus one and the polynomial f1 tilde is obtained by adding just the first l l i term of f i and F i and we denote the exponent matrix of f i tilde for epsilon tilde. Any question in this moment? No okay well and so we we give the we give the following definition following definition the explitting definition of the splitting polytope for a polynomial map giving a polynomial map f formed by the polynomial s1 s1 f2 until fc we know we denote n like the sum of l1 and like the zoom of L1 plus plus plus L t then the exponent matrix for the polynomial map is defined similarly to the expoing expanding matrix for a polynomial. The expanding matrix for a polynomial map is the matrix is a matrix epsilon f which its column is formed for the Each column is formed for the different element in the onion of the support of all polynomial f1 f2 fc tilde and with this we can define we can define the explitting polytope for a polynomial map, the splitting polytope. the splitting polytope for the polynomial map is the set form for all vector gamma such that the expanding matrix by gamma less than the vector one. Any question? No, okay. Now we can see an example before the example coming up about the splitting polytale. About the splitting polyton for a polynomial F and splitting polytale for I'm spitting polyto for a polynomial map are convex polytop. In fact, this polyto is inside this cube and this cube, respectively. Moreover, sine, the explitative polytope, is a compact set. This function, the norm function, has a has a maximum a maximum has a maximum let us say this maximum for for n and and the set formed by all vectors in the splitting polyton such that its norm equals the maximum the maximum of the function norm is defined defined the proper phase of the spree of Phase of the splitting polytope. This phase is named the maximal phase for the splitting polytope. This condition is very important for the next during this presentation. Now, well, any question? Okay, now I see an example of this. Example of the splitting polytope. Consider the polynomial map form for this curve and other this curve, and ambinomial and one monomial, with the condition that i is bigger than zero and b and c are bigger than one, then this is the this is the explicit. the this is the explicit the expanding matrix for the the mapping F in this in this matrix the column is formed by the union of the support of this polynomial and this polynomial then the splitting polytope in this example is given by the intersection of three of three planes of three planes, this one, this one, and this one. And we see below, this is the figure, the figure of the splitting polytope for this splitting, for this function map, for this function map. And this splitting polytope is given by the convex hole of the vector zero, v1, v2. V1, V2, V3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And the maximal value of this splitting, of this splitting polytope depends on the value of A and C as follow. If C is equal equals 1, equals one or if C is different to one and A is different to zero, the maximum phase is given by the vector V phi for this vector. But in otherwise, in otherwise, in otherwise, the maximum the maximal fape of this splitting polytop is given by the x join the vector the vector 2 and vector 5 is given by the segment is the splitting polytope we can see the maximal value of splitting polytope is can be formed by one point one point of for mark of for for more or for more for more point for more point in general in general okay uh does flitting polytope already mentioned resembles the more classical notation of the newton polyedron in fact our definition of this set was inspired by the newton polyedron by the Newton polyedron of a of a polynomial of a polynomial for the new sorry for the Newton polyedron of the polynomial map and so and so we can this definition of the Newton polyedro let f a polynomial in the in the maximal ideal m of maximal ideal M of R, R is the polynomial ring. The Newton poly of F is the convex hole of this F. This A form for the union of the support of F and if you consider now that. If you consider now the polynomial map formed by F1, F2, until Ft, the Newton polyedron MF for the polynomial map is the convex hull of this set. In this set, A, A, I, sorry. I sorry A sorry A is the onion of the support of all of all elements of the polynomial model. No, it's the onion of the support of F1, F2, F3, blah blah blah to FT. This is the difficulty. This is for remember the definition of the new top polyeth. So in this moment, So, in this moment, any question about the splitting polytop or Newton Polyero? No. Okay. Well, there are several usual connections between the explitting polytope and Newton polyedum. Albeit one, the Allowing one that formulates some algebra geometric condition of the hypersurface. This is explained in the following proposition. In the polynomial map, the maximal phase, the maximal phase, sorry, the maximal phase of the splitting of the splitting polytope of the splitting polytope. spitting polyto is equal the maximum the maximal positive real number such that this vector this vector is contained in the Newton polyeron for the polynomial map and and or the relation between these or these two two sets is if it's a new If the neutron polyedron of the polynomial map F is in diagonal position and we take eta, we take eta, the phase of the polynomial, of the Newton polyedron that is intersected by the vector one, then the maximal phase of the splitting polytope is given by DZ. It's given by DZ. He said all vectors such that the exponent negative for gamma equals the vector one and and the entry gamma j sorry the entry gamma gamma j equals zero if the respectively column in the exponent Every column in the exponent matrix doesn't belong, belong to the phase eta of the polynomial of the Newtop. Sorry, of the Newtop. This is a characterization of the maximal phase for the splitting polytope using the Newton polyeron. Any questions? Well, well sorry now we talk about the F pure threshold. This number, the F pure threshold, is an invariant analogous to the loss canonical threshold. To the loss canonical traction in frame characteristic. And its definition is okay. In this moment, we take our polynomial ring, but with the condition that K is a field with characteristic P. What? Definition. For a non-zero idea. For a non-zero idea A contained in M, we define the number that this number I do not remember the number sorry, I don't remember the this letter by this number this number B sorry B as the maximal non-negative integer non-negative integer such that this power this power AC is not contained is not contained in the forbidden power of n remember n is the irrelevant irrelevant irrelevant idea in the polynomial ring and it's for venues power and it's for venue And x for venus power is the ideal generated by the power of the x1, x2 to xm. So the splitting, sorry, the spiritual of A is the limit, is the limit with E goes to infinity of this. Of this number. This is the definition of the speeching polytop. Where information about the FFP threshold with the F pure threshold, we can detect the containment in the integral closure and tie closure of parameter ideals and the spirit threshold are related with the Are related with the A invariant and Benster Sato polynomials. Any question about the FFP threshold? No, okay. Well, and now, before to continue with the structure, we define the We define the term idea for a no-zero vector vector, sorry, for a no-zero idea A in M, the turn ideal of A denoted by a circle is the ideal generated by the monomial x A with the condition that the vector The vector A is contained in the Newton Polyero for the ideal A. Now, the next proposition gives us a relation between the pure traction of ideal A and its term ideal. For the same condition, A and ideal. condition a ideal in m and a oh sorry a zero the external ideal the term ideal of a we take uh f1 to f2 to f t the minimal generator for a then the following proposition holds one the spiritual of F pure direction of A is less than the F pure traction of X is extremely ideal. And the F-pure traction is less than the T. T is the minimal number of generator for A. And the last sentence, the last sentence, the last sentence allow us to compute the fur. compute the pure threshold of the tern ideal using the splitting polyton. In general, with this condition, you can compute the effectiveness of all the monomial ideas in general used with this property. Now, any question? Okay now that the task of computing the F-pure threshold is hard in general. However, a few examples of explicit calculations are known. Moreover, a serious difficulty that emerges when we want to compute explicit want to compute explicit examples of spur textual is that the x is that the existing methods are designed mostly for the case of principal ideas we attack this case of non of non-principal ideas using the explicit polytope and we and we give the next zero Theorem. With this theorem, it's possible to compute the splitting polytope in several cases for the no principle ideal. Then, the RM says, similarly, let a non-zero ideal contained in M and A and A An A circle external ideal and take f da f1 to f t of minimal generator of A. Oh, very important hypothesis. Very important. Suppose that the pure threshold has a unique maximal point row. This is an important hypothesis in this diagram. Diogram. The splitting polytope has a unique maximal point. With this unique maximal point, we take xi of this sum. We know this sum is the sum of the dg of the p expansion for rho. This number is s i. SI tell us that entitle flow at we of carrying motor pea or no? Now, if I denote the set or the index for which for which SI is finite, then we have the following sentence for the first. For the first case, if I equal the empty set, then that pure threshold is possible to compute using that splitting polygon, because that's a pure traction equals the pure threshold of external ideal. And for the previous proposition. For the previous proposition, for this proposition, for this proposition, we can use the exploiting polytope to compute the FFP direction for A. And otherwise, if I is different to empty set, we obtain this inequality for the pure tracheo. for the FA pure trechule using using the p expansion the p the p expansion of rho this theorem allows us to compute the pure structure for some for some cases in non-principle ideas any question Okay. Uh now now uh now uh return the loss candidate. Now we return the loss chemical threshold. We see an example to give us a relation between the pure threshold and the loss chemical threshold. In this example, In this example, we see that if p goes to infinity, the pure threshold approaches the lowest canonical threshold. Approaches the lowest canonical threshold. This is explained in the following theorem. This theorem, this theorem, sorry, this theorem, this theorem was shown. Was shown shown by Mustata Takage Takage. Sorry, this is a mistake. Sorry. Takage. Sorry. Mustato Takagi and Guatemala. If P is P is enough long, we have this inequality. There is a pure threshold. There is a pure threshold. Threshold, the fibrillator of A module P less than the loss canonical threshold by A. And the limit with P goes to infinity for the effect pure threshold of A, model P, equals the loss canonical threshold for of A. Of A. Well, this outer Mustata Takari and Guatanabe also have the following conjecture, which still represents an open problem. The conjecture say there are infinity any prime number P for which this equality For which this equality is true. It's a conjecture of Takage, mustato takage, and Guatanage. It's a conjecture. Any question? Okay. By using our characterization of the pure structure of A in terms of the splitting polytope of a list of Polytope of a list of the polynomial, we contribute some instance of the conjecture when i is a non-principle idea. This is all theorem about this conjecture. Assume the hypothesis of the previous theorem. Sorry, the hypothesis are this. Assume the same, the same this hypothesis. same this hypothesis assume that hypothesis the same hypothesis of the previous theorem with this hypothesis with these hypotheses we have first if the loss can the loss can be for the turn ideal of of a is bigger than the the t is the the The minimal number of generators for A, then the pure threshold of A module P equals the loss canonical threshold for of A. And this is equal T for all the prime numbers that verify this condition. The sum of the DG. of the digit of rho are bigger than t time p. Remember, this notation is the digit of rho in its p expansion. In other words, the loss conditions are of the term idea of idea of A is less than T then the pure threshold of A model P equals the lowest canonical threshold for all prime number P for which the entries of rho are we all carrying module P. Okay. Any question? Okay. Then we have a sketch of the proof for this theorem, for this theorem. For the first part, sorry, for the first part, for this, for the first part. For the first part, we have that the non-ofro, the normal drop equals the effect pure threshold of the turn ideal of A model P and this is equal to the loss canodical traction for the term ideal of A. Then for the prime P satisfying this property, This property that sum of the digit is bigger than Tp, we have that if a pure threshold is bigger than T and which force the equality. And using the well-known inequality for the loss canonical threshold, we have this relation and this relation aloft. Relation have obtained the equality desired. Any question? Okay. For the second part, for the second part, for the set of the prime numbers for which the entries of the rod as we are carrying module P. We are carrying module P, we get that F a pure threshold of A module P equals the F a pure threshold of external ideal module P. And with this equality, we obtain the claim now follow for this inequality, for this relation. For this inequality, for this relation. With this equality, we have the relations that equality follows. Any question okay well. Okay, now we talk about the other invariant in prime characteristic. This invariant is called the F volume. Well, for introduced the F volume. If definition, consider a collection of ideas. Of ideal I1 A2 AT and B ideal in R. Remember, R is the polynomial real ring over field in characteristic P. We assume this condition of contained a radical of B. Contain the radical of B. We define this set, the set B. The set B is all vector, all vector, such that this power, this product of power ideas is not contained in the Frobenius power of B. Remember, the Frobenius power of B is the ideal. Is the ideal generator for the power of all elements in V. Then the F volume is the limit, the limit with E goes to infinity of this number. In this case, this denotes the cardinality of the set. Of the set B. In general, the S volume extends the definition of the F pure structure. Now, explicit computation of this number is very, very hard. So, as an application of our study of splitting political, we provide So we provide geometric lower bounds for the F-volume of the collection of principal ideas in X theorem. We the same hypothesis for the two previous theorems, the same hypothesis for the two previous theorem, we obtain this geometry, the geometric lower boundary using the Using the exploiting polytope for the F volume. We can see for in this bone, in this lower bone, we use the digit of the pay expansion for the unit maximal point for the splitting polytope. Any question? Any question? Okay. Well, that concludes my presentation. Thank you for attending. Thank you very much. Is there any question for the speaker? Thank you, Bagniram, Javier. So in the case of a polynomial, it's a sum of monomials. Are there some monomials which are more significant and others ones which are irrelevant for this invariance you are mentioning? Well. Well that the important is the monomial case is because it's more simple to compute a pure structure. No, but no, no, not monomial. I mean, in a polynomial, it's a sum of monomials. So, for example, is one of the monomials more significant than the other in the sense that you can move the coefficient and nothing happens? Things I don't understand. We refer for the compute over monomials over ideas generated for monomials. Well, you have, I mean, in the case that you have one polynomial, say, the ideal principal ideal. Oh, okay. So, so, so, or, or, and, and also, if not, but let's say if you have a polynomial, then it's a sum of monomials. Then, you, the log canonical threshold to all the Threshold, do all the coefficients which are non-zero enter in defining the log canonical threshold, or is there one monomial or several monomials which are the significant ones and the other ones are irrelevant? Well, I don't understand you, but I think that if you take a If you take a monomial for compute the loss canonical traction of the sorry if you take the monomial for to compute the loss canonical threshold is easy easy for the definition for one monomer but if you take a polynomial it's more complicated and yes that compute the compute of the The compute of the pure structure for one monomial depends on the number of the ten of the polynomial. I don't know if you question or not. I mean, like, for example, if you take xy plus x to the cube, then is x to the cube the one significant or xy, I mean, you could. You could xy, or it doesn't matter what the coefficient of the x, y, it gives you the same but the polynomial. So, in a polynomial, are all the coefficients significant for the log canonical or there are some of them or some of the coefficients non-zero which are the significant to define the log canonical in the case of characteristic zero or in the case of characteristic p, are there some terms? Some terms of the polynomial which are the most significant, yes, for this for the original for the exponential matrix. Yes, the important is the exponent. The exponent, the exponent of the term different to zero. Yes. And so the other ones are not that significant. There are just some of the monomials which are significant for the thresholds. Yes, all monomials. Yes, all monuments. And the other ones, it doesn't matter what the coefficient is. Yes. And another question: in the complex case, you define the threshold by an integral, but then at some point, you mentioned that the polynomials were with rational coefficients. Is there some criterion using the real numbers, the integral over the, so can you put the definition of the local. Can you put the definition of the low canonical threshold? Sorry, sorry, again, please. The low canonical threshold, the definition with the integral. Yes, sorry, one moment. One moment, one moment. This definition. Yeah, yeah. So there you're integrating over a ball of radius epsilon around zero in Cn. But if your polynomial is real, polynomial is real and you find the log canonical threshold with an integral over the real numbers not over the complex numbers uh i don't know sorry i don't know okay thank you no sorry i don't know is there any question Hi. Hi, Wagner. Hi. Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So in the definition of term ideal, one moment, one moment. One moment for the book, the slide. Here. Okay, yes, in this definition, this term ideal doesn't necessarily correspond to an initial ideal with respect to some monomial order, right? With respect to monomial order, yes. It's not the same. This term ideal, or this is the question. This term ideal. Or, this is the question. This term ideal coincides with the initial ideal of A with respect to some or nominal order. No, no. Okay. No, no, can be can be differ. No. Okay, okay. So in general, are there relations between the low canonical threshold or the F pure threshold of an ideal with respect to some initial ideas? Are there, like, like in the proposition, you have Proposition: You have the first one, there is an inequality right for the term idea, yeah. But for in general, for some initial ideas with respect to some monomial order, are there relations? Yeah, yeah, yeah, there is an inequality. I do not remember one number. The inequality. Yeah, there is inequality for the ideal and the initial ideal for the for the sphere threshold. I see. I do not remember. I don't. Yeah, exactly. One moment. I do not remember. There is an equality problem. I don't remember. I think what is this? Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I did. One moment. I mean, the inequality is. I mean the inequality one moment. I think what it is, I think. I'm not sure, but there are inequality. I think it is. But the inequality can be different. Can be different. Can be different. Daniel, for I think in the I think in this moment that the relation between the with the relation with the pepure structure in ground deformation I think in this moment Luisa Pedro are worrying this in this topic in this moment I think I'm not sure I'm not sure okay but if interesting is is interesting a study a study ground deformation in characteristic premium in characteristic prime isn't it's a good topic i see thank you okay thank you uh is there any question another question no on online No, no, well, thank you very much, Wagner. We continue for your thought. Thank you. Thank you very much.
