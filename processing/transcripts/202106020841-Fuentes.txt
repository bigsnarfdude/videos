Is that working? Yeah, that looks good. It's not full screen yet, but now it is. I think that's good. Yeah. All right. So up next is Yvette, so please take it away. Sorry, I didn't hear that last. Oh, I said up next is Yvette, so please, please go ahead. Oh, okay. Yes. Thank you very much. Yes, thank you very much. And thanks, Flaminia, and all the organizers for this invitation. So I'm going to talk about some relatively recent work with Richard Howell, who's now in Hong Kong and superposition with Oxford. And it's about how can we sort of change the way that we use atoms to measure gravitational effects. And by doing that, we can have a very sensitive device to measure. Device to measure in very small scales. So, I want to start by thanking all the contributions of people in my past group, postdocs and PhD students. And as I said, in particular, this is a paper, these results I'm going to present today are a paper with Richard. And also, my collaborators in both theory and experiment that either we've published work that has led to this research or To this research, or we've discussed or applied for grants to take it to the experiment. So, when we think about measuring gravity using atoms, obviously what comes to our mind is the atom interferometer. So, I say here that it's a single particle detector in the sense that, well, we might throw, I don't know, 10 to the 8 atoms into the interferometer, but the atoms are independent of each other, there are no interactions. Of each other, there are no interactions, and each atom goes into a superposition of two different trajectories. These trajectories are different, so they pick up a phase that depends on the local gravitational field, for example, and that's how we meet, we have a gravimeter. So, I say here that it's local because when the two branches recombine, the interference pattern, the state, the system interferes with itself at one single point. Interferes with itself at one single point, and then we get the interference pattern and we measure. And this I now call spatial interferometry to distinguish with what I want to show you in a bit. And it's limited by the time of flight. So this is the precision and it depends on the number of measurements you make. This is the mode number and the time of flight squared. So it's a very simple. Squared. So it's a very simple equation. And as you can see, the most relevant thing is the size of the interferometer. So if you want to make it more precise, you have to make it bigger. I wrote here that it's compatible with Newtonian physics, because usually when we describe this interferometer, we use the Schrodinger equation and the inner products, which are Galilean invariant. And that's compatible with Newtonian physics. With Newtonian physics. But if you want to then use this sort of interferometry to measure things beyond Newtonian physics, well, then you run into the difficulties of putting quantum mechanics and general relativity together. And you know that that's full of inconsistencies. So doing that is very tricky and highly non-trivial. So we're proposing to measure gravitational effects using atoms, but in a very different way. So instead of Very different way. So instead of having atoms in free fly, you trap them in a box. So this is a box potential. This could work with a quadratic or other types of potential as well, but we use a box just because from the mathematical point of view, this is much easier. So, oops, I went ahead. So the atoms now, in the previous case, they don't interact. They're all independent. In this case, they collide, they interact, they get entangled. You can squeeze them. You can squeeze them, and basically, they give rise to collective excitations that we call phonons that are a relativistic quantum field. So, this scheme could be, I guess, implemented in other physical systems, like for example, in a superconducting circuit or something else where you have phonons in the quantum regime. But we are going to focus on the BC for now. And now, I call it interferometry. And now, I call it interferometry in the frequency domain because now the states that we're going to interfere are sharp in frequency and completely delocalized in this little volume. So, the states are in contact with each other at all times. So, in that sense, I say that the interferometry is non-local. It's not at a point, it's just occurring inside your box at all times. And as you have in spatial interferometry, it's limited by the size, by It's limited by the size, by the spatial dimension of the interferometer. This is interferometry and frequency basically on time. And what gives you the limiting factor is how long your states live. So the atoms collide, and these are non-linearities that give rise to parametric amplification. And the parametric amplification is something also that you can use in order to make things more sensitive. Now, the whole way we constructed this is underpinned not by Is underpinned not by Schrodinger's physics, not by non-relativistic quantum mechanics, but by quantum field theory and curved space-time. So, in this way, you can talk about quantum and relativistic effects in a compatible way. Of course, this is a semi-complete theory that only is valid at low energies, but this is the sort of energies that would be compatible with the experiments. So, in general terms, like I said, In general terms, like I said, you could have another system that has this characteristics: the phonos, but let's stick to the BC right now. You could take a collection in the general scheme of modes, of frequency modes, and then do something to them, entangle them, squeeze them, mix them, prepare your initial state. So, in quantum metrology, we look for optimal states. So, here's where you would do that. Then it comes the interaction with your system. It could be a gravitational wave, it could be the Could be a gravitational wave, it could be the local gravitational field, and then you do the inverse operation. So, you sort of close the loop, but now in the frequency domain, and then you measure the number of modes you want to measure. So, again, because you're not limited now by the size of the system, but by the time that they live, you can miniaturize detectors. So, this is, for example, this is from the experiment in Cambridge. This is a BC in a box. This measures. A BC in a box. This measures 50 micrometers. And well, there are some experiments now aiming at having bose angsten condensates in a chip. So of course, this is looking into the future. But the thing is, like, if you actually there is a lot of people working on making interferometers smaller, but when you make them smaller, you just lose the precision. So even if you can put an atom So, even if you can put an atom interferometer in a chip, it won't have the precision you would like it to have. So, I think that that is like a good paradigm change of how to measure that is to use these ideas. So, you still have a high sensitivity and some interesting aspects of high resonance to noise. And we've been working on this for many years. This maybe we didn't call it like that, but we've now sort of added some features in order to. Sort of added some features in order to realize that this is really interferometry in the frequency domain. So it's work of many years. And we first use these frequency modes to detect, to propose a detector for gravitational waves. So I'm going to tell you about that today and how this idea of closing now the loop in the frequency domain really brings the precisions much, much, much better. And we have some work on trapped also using. Also, using a trap VC instead of time of flight to constrain dark energy models. If I have time, I'll say something about that. We are patenting two ideas, one for a gravity, well, basically using this for a gravimeter and for a gradiometer. So it's very nice, the gradiometer, because you can measure the gradient of the gravitational field in this tiny volume, and that's very, very nice. And while we're Very nice. And well, we're working with curvature, space-time parameters, and dark matter, and other things. I'll tell you a little bit maybe about dark matter as well. Quantum field theory and curved spacetime has not been demonstrated in the experiment yet. It has in the flat case, but not in the curved case. So if we can show that changes in the space-time produces changes in the phonons, this would also be a demonstration of quantum field theory in curved space-time. So roughly how it works with the gravitational. So, roughly how it works with a gravitational wave, you pick two modes that would resonate with the gravitational wave and you prepare them in a two-mode squeeze state. This is the old scheme. I'll show you the new one in a moment. Then the gravitational wave changes slightly those states and you measure. So, this is work that we propose. This is an idea that we put forward in 2014. And well, then there were some people criticizing this, saying, no, it's not very feasible. This saying, no, it's not very feasible. And the key thing was that it required high squeezing. So, for example, that the number of squeezed phonons is of the order of the square root of the number of atoms in the condensate. And usually we would need something like 10 to the 8. And then also that when we went into the literature, there was nothing on how long phonos live. And it depends on the frequency and on the system. So based on System. So, based on some literature, we estimated 10 seconds, but that's where the criticism has come up and saying, no, these times are way too long. And now I'm going to show you how you can do something, well, relatively simple in order to get very high precisions with very short times and much lower requirements on squeezing. So, it turns out to be a three-mode application of the general scheme I showed you before. So, now we will take the ground state of the Take the ground state of the atoms in the VC, so I might call it pump or bulk. These are all the atoms in the ground state, and then because the atoms collide, phonon modes get excited, and we pick two phonon modes that are in resonance with the gravitational wave. So we first, two modes squeeze those modes. Then we do an operation that is called a tritter, which is a three-way mixing of the pump mode with the frequency modes. Then comes the graph. Frequency modes. Then comes the gravitational wave and then the inverse, and then we measure. So, to show you the difference with the previous scheme, this is what we did in 2014. We just had the two modes, the two-mode squeezing, the gravitational wave, and the measurement. And now what we added is the pump. And this pump has a lot of atoms in it. And then the two-mode squeezing, the tritter, and so on. And this improves sensitivities by several orders, many more orders of magnitude. I'll show you. I'll show you. And that allows you that squeezing can be much smaller as we assumed in this paper, and also that the system can have very short life phonon times, and it still works relatively well. So this is Bose-Seinstein condensate you described. I said a bit about that. I go quicker here with the ground state with a mean field function that obeys a Gross-Protevsky equation. But because the atoms collide, then you have to look at perturbations to the You have to look at perturbations to the mean field, which are the phonons, the relativistic quantum field. And, like I said, we look at quality uniform densities or uniform densities just to treat it easier mathematically. So, this is the covariant Lagrangian of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the space-time metric. These are the collisions of the atoms. These are some relativistic corrections to the potential term. And here, you have the kinetic energy that depends on the underlying space. That depends on the underlying space-time metric. So, when you consider the uniform density, the phonons, you plug your ANSAPs into the equations of motion and you get from there a Klein-Gordon equation in an effective metric for the phonos. And the effective metric looks like the density, the speed of sound. This is the real underlying space-time metric. And here you have the velocity flows in the BC. Velocity flows in the BC. So we call this the analog gravity metric to distinguish from the real underlying space-time metric. And in the field of analog gravity, what people do is that they play with the density or the speed of sound or the flows to make this side of the equation look like a known metric. It could be like a funky, I don't know, dark energy. We did some work on that, for example, a model. But what we are interested is What we are interested is in finding out if the real space-time metric can observe changes in the phonons of the system. So, and as I said, if that can be done in the laboratory, this would demonstrate at least a feature of quantum fields during curved spacetime that changes in the space-time produces changes in the fields. So, this is how the effective metric looks in flat space. Here we have a conformal factor, and you can see that it looks just like the flat metric. That it looks just like the flat metric, only that the speed of sound replaces the speed of light. And if you put the phonons in a box, you get a spectrum that depends on the speed of sound and the size of your box. So we find the solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation with these boundary conditions. If you now want to look at a gravitational wave, and as I said, you could look at other metrics as well, and that's what we've been doing in recent years. You have the In recent years, you have the flat metric and a perturbation, which is your quadrupolar perturbation to model your gravitational wave. And this is the effective metric that the phonons see that, again, it looks very much like the metric of a normal gravitational wave, only with this conformal factor and the speed of sound here replacing the speed of light. I'm going to talk about one dimensions today, but we've done this work also in three dimensions and in other geometries, not all of it. Other geometries. Not all of it is published yet, but some of it is. So, but in the simplest case, you have your perturbation, which we model by just a sine wave. This is the frequency of the gravitational wave and the amplitude. Now, these are not sources of gravitational waves like the ones that LIGO detects, which are the mergers, because those are monochromatic and very short-lived. And we need long-lived sources. So, we look at continuous sources, and there's a lot of work also. And there's a lot of work also in LIGO trying to detect these. They're very important in order to reconstruct the equation of state of neutron stars, for example, and so on. So this at the moment, what I'm going to show you is for continuous sources. So you prepare your initial state. Here, using the covariance matrix formalism, we show this is just the two-mode squeezing operator, and this is the tritter. This is the tritter, a bit more detail. And then we describe how the gravitational wave affects that initial state by looking at the Bugoliubov transformations produced by the gravitational wave. These first techniques we started developing with Jorma on how the motion of boundary conditions in flat space affect a field inside a box, but we have now developed this method much further. This method much further, and there is a very nice paper coming up with my students and Louis, my former postdoc, in which we have a new method for computing Bugol-Youth transformations in a unified way for many, many, it puts together many cases with the same method, which is very nice and allows you to solve problems that you could not solve before. So, that's like, hopefully, I'll be able to talk about that soon. So, we have now that you So, we have now that using quantum metrology, the error in estimating the amplitude of the gravitational wave is bounded by the number of measurements you can make and the quantum Fischer information, which basically compares the state after it interacted with the wave with another one infinitesimally close in the amplitude of the gravitational wave in this case. So, you put all this together, and well, you get an equation that is not the simple. That is not the simplest one. As you can see, it's quite involved. So, this is the error in estimating the characteristic amplitude of the wave. It depends on the atomic mass of the species you chose, on the angle of the tritter, so on your preparation of your initial state, of the number of atoms in the ground state, the number of phonons you were able to squeeze, on the lifetime of the phonons, and this is one of the most important things, on your internal. One of the most important things on your integration time. So, we need integration times of our order of three months or even like a year in order to get good precisions. That's why we at the moment need to just focus on continuous sources. But there's very interesting possibilities there. And I'll say a bit. How much I'm doing with time? You're doing all right. You have about seven minutes or so. Okay. So, yeah, this is the length. This is the scattering length. This is. Is the scattering length? This is the number, the phonon, the frequency number of your mode, and so on. So, as you can see, it's quite involved and it has a lot of constraints. I show you the constraints in a moment. But this is an optimization that Dan Goldwater, my previous postdoc, did, taking in account this equation with all the constraints I'm going to show you and optimizing, let's say, for sodium. And we find that the sensitivities look very promising. Look very promising. And this is taking into account already the coherence, losses. So these are the constraints. So these are two-body losses. So you can see constraints that look complicated. These are the constraints imposed by three-body recombination. So the biggest source of loss that we have in the system is three-body recombination. That's kind of the battery. And we also need that the initial thermal. We looked at the thermal noise, and these are. Looked at the thermal noise, and these are the constraints on thermal noise. This is to be in the phonon regime for the dispersion relation, weak interactions, cold regime. So as you can see, it's quite involved. And now we're doing numerical work to calculate the sensitivities in the optimal case. And there's a recent thesis that's on the archive by one of my students in Vienna that I really like because one of the main questions that work sort of hard to answer is. Work sort of hard to answer is how much squeezing can we produce in the lab for certain frequencies and so on. So he wrote his thesis on that. So you basically put in some of these initial parameters and his program allows you to compute how much squeezing can you get and how long the lifetimes of the phonons are. So we put that into our calculations. And these are the numbers that we get. I mean, these are just a sample of numbers. I mean, this is. Just a sample of numbers. I mean, this is for lithium, for rubidium. This is not optimized. The others are optimized. These are not. They're just like some numbers we wanted to show you. Here you can see this is the new scheme. So this is using the Tritter operation. And this is what we got in this similar case without the Tritter. So you can see that it gives you nine orders of magnitude. Or 10. It's very, very powerful. And the reason why is because. And the reason why is because I can show you very quickly because it's easy to understand. Before, here is the scaling. With the tritter, you get this number of atoms in the ground state squared, while before we only had the number of phonons times the number of atoms, and it was much, much smaller. So that's where that comes from. And so this is just showing you how the sensitivities really improve if we manage to get those phonons lifetimes longer. Phonons lifetimes longer. So, even if you assume here, I assume very short ones, I think. Where are these come from the computation that we did from the thesis? So, the phonon lifetimes here are this small, for example, no, 0.001 seconds, and you can still get some decent sensitivities. But if we get our technology to last longer, then it will work much better. This is just shows you some models for glitches of neutron stars that produce gravitational waves with lifetimes of like three months. And here you can see that the characteristic amplitudes are around 10 to the minus 22 and 10 to the minus 24. That would sort of fit in with our numbers. I also, you know, this comparing, our scheme works for higher frequencies. So it's not competing with LIGO, it's more like complementing the frequencies because The frequencies because we can go to higher frequencies. Now, there's not, they tell me there's not much interesting stuff in terms of gravitational waves, the standard ones, after 10 kilohertz. And after that, then you have like primordial black holes, you know, all the funky stuff. So maybe cosmic strigs. But in particular, I'm interested in dark matter. So I think that this scheme might be useful for persistent sources from neutron stars and things like that. From you know, neutron stars and things like that, but maybe even more for searches of dark matter. So, this comes from a slide by John March Russell from Oxford, who explained to us how CERN looked for single particle events of scattering of dark matter in these energy scales and didn't find anything. And going beyond that would be, well, building a bigger accelerometer, which would be crazy expensive. So, they're looking at proposals to search in this lower. To search in these lower energy areas in which you don't have single scattering events, but you have collective behavior, which is bosonic and it's also long-lived and it's monochromatic. So when I saw this talk, I said, okay, this looks like perfect for us. And this is the energy scales in which the detector I talked about would be more or less able to search. I mean, of course, a VC is very cheap in comparison to any of these other proposals. Other proposals, and you would also be able to have many in the planet and sort of you know use the information coming from all of them to get you know more information about your sources. So yeah, people usually ask me how can it work if it's so small? And this is the standard atom interferometer or light interferometer. And the precision depends on delta L over L. But here we're using quantum resonances. So we're using completely different idea. Using a completely different idea, and actually, it is close to the Weber bar. So, the Weber bar was also based on resonance. They were cooling them down to 4K and couldn't measure gravitational waves. And actually, now they can cool them down to milli K, I think. But still at those temperatures, they're not in the quantum regime. So, you have the vibrational modes, but they're in a thermal case. And if in our work you put a thermal state to start with, you get. A thermal state to start with, you get terrible sensitivity. So, you really do need to get into the quantum regime where you can use squeezing and parametric amplification. One of the basic things that we used for the case of gravitational waves is resonance between the gravitational wave and the modes. So, you're basically using a parametric amplification to measure the gravitational wave. And you can see here that obviously can be cooled down to half a nano Kelvin. So, this is many orders. Nano Kelvin. So, this is many orders of magnitude colder, and that's what's giving you the sensitivity. So, in a sense, what we have is a quantum version of a Weber bar. This also shows how, well, in part, the trick is that the speed of sound is so much smaller than the speed of light because the frequencies depend on the speed of sound divided by the length. And this allows you to go to very small lengths. Like I said, we've also have some work done. Said we also have some work done on trapping. This doesn't use phonons but does use trap BCs instead of atom interferometry to constrain dark energy models. And this is the experimental results that have been done in Imperial College and in NASA and some other places in the US. And we show how using the TRAP BC instead, in principle, would allow to extend the parameter space by quite a bit. And we did this for many different models. And you can see. For many different models, and you can see a huge advantage. And yes, as I said, we're now patenting the idea of a gravimeter and a gradiometer with that. And in the gradiometer, we can improve the state of the art theoretically, of course, no experiment yet, but in principle, could give perhaps two orders of magnitude beyond. And with the gravimeter, you could have similar sensitivities, but with the possibility of going similar. With the possibility of going smaller without losing sensitivity. So, this is my last slide, just to say that in my group, one of the main aims that we have is to develop new instruments that will allow us to learn from nature at scales where both quantum and relativistic effects coexist. And while we really believe that we're in desperate need of this interplay between theory and experiments in order to make more, let's say, More, let's say, better theories of nature at these scales. And that's it. Thanks very much for this chance. Wonderful. Well, thank you, Yvette. Thank you virtually. So do you have any questions for Ved? I see Rob's got his hand up. Yeah, can I go ahead? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Thanks, Yvette. Nice to see you again. Yvette. Nice to see you again, even if it's only two-dimensionally. It's been quite a while. So, yeah, the main thing I'm curious about is you had a, I don't know, halfway through the old scheme compared to the new scheme where you add this tritter. Why, how exactly is that boosting the sensitivity? Oh, yeah, it's quite easy to see. Let me show you. Oh, unfortunately, I don't have the. Oh, unfortunately, I don't have a. Oh, why is this not letting me go back? Ah, okay. Yeah. Oh, here. If you look at the scaling with the tritter and without the tritter, you can see that the scaling here with the number of atoms is much better than what we had before. Before we had the number of atoms multiplied by By the square root of the number of phonons. Sorry, my memory is not that good, but I think it's the square root. I could be missing, it's for sure here just the number of atoms that we had in the previous scheme. And here we had either the square root of number of phonons or the number of phonons, but it doesn't matter because the number of phonons is relatively small, so it doesn't give you the big thing. The big thing comes from having the scaling here. From having the scaling here. And the reason why the scaling comes in there, you can see basically the idea from here that before the old scheme was just two phone remotes squeezed, gravitational wave and measure. Whereas now we use the ground state, the pump where the number of atoms are there, and we mix them. And when you mix them, what you get at the output is that. Get at the output is that you get the number of atoms in your equation. So the details are in this paper. It's like on the archive with Richard and it's called as the title of this talk. And you can look at the details there. But it's quite easy to see how, you know, you it's basically you're taking with this operation here of the tritter, you're bringing in the number of atoms into your equation. And it yeah, I guess that part is what's not obvious. That part is what's not obvious, is how the Tritter does that. But okay. Yeah, yeah, well, because you know, it's quite technical, you know. So, but you take, you take here your, let's say you start with the with the coherent state with the pump, and then you two mode squeeze your mode. So you apply this transformation followed by the Twitter. And well, you have to multiply that to the identity matrix and then. Identity matrix and then this one and sandwich. Oh, well, you get quite a complicated one, but still, it's in the paper. I mean, actually, the big matrix is in the paper, and you can see that. And then once you have the covariance matrix, from the covariance matrix, you can calculate the quantum fissure information and you can just repeat the calculation and see that it comes in there. So it's just, it's somehow that gives you that one over n naught squared, basically. Is that right? Yes. And you know what? This week. Yes, and you know what? This we got inspired from a paper called Pump. I should have put the reference here, Pumped Up SU11, in which that's exactly what the authors were doing, but not in my scheme. Sorry? So they showed that in spatial interferometry, you could add some transformations to active interferometry. To active interferometry here that are the trit. So, the trit idea we got from them, only that they applied it for space interferometry. And we said, oh, we can use the same transformation, but in not for these modes that are separate in space, but for our modes. So we made like a frequency version of the Tritter, and that's where it comes from. And they have a PRL on that showing that that increases the sensitivity in anatomy. In not some interferometry. Yeah, sorry, one other thing, I guess. Is this thing actually being tested to see that it really does give the one over n squared in something, like maybe not in gravity waves, but in some effect? Do we know for sure it will actually do this? Or does this remain to be tested? This remains to be tested. And I have, like, I applied with Chris, well, with Chris Westbrook. The end with Chris Westbrook and with Philippe Boyer to like a synergy grant, we got shortlisted, so almost got funded. Not to do except but to do steps of this, like to do the squeezing and to do the long phonon lifetimes and stuff like that. We've got pretty far with the funding applications and well, we keep trying. At some point, we hope that, you know. Yeah, we should talk because I. We should talk because I know that you have some ideas that you have there, but you did it with like free-falling boundary conditions. And I have comments about that. And maybe we should get together and discuss because I have some worries about what it is really to have a Bose-Einstein condensate in free fall. Okay, yeah, and same with the more recent one as well, because you're interacting with light. You're interacting with light to pump out, but when you're doing that, you're creating phonos that are more like indistinguishable from your signal. So, I have some worries, it would be good to talk. Okay, thank you. Maybe we have time for one more question. Okay, I had a quick question about the metrology and the fissure information there that you computed. As I understand that actually that circuit you had up. Actually, that circuit you had up is you're computing the Fisher information for this parameter epsilon, right? The amplitude of the wave. And then you do some measurements here. So at the end, and my question is, like, how those measurements at the end, how close do they come to actually realizing the maximum fissure? Yeah, that's a good question. Thanks. Like, we checked that. So it's very close. It's like almost saturated. And that also in the picture. Saturates and that's also in the paper because this is basically you just do the equivalent of homodyne and heterodyne detection. That's that's really good because usually you ask what's the optimal one and it's like something you can never have a chance to do. So that's that's really it's like with 25 minutes is really difficult to mention all the all the different details. But if you look at this, we're using Gaussian modes. These are Gaussian states and these are Gaussian transformations. So that's why we use the commercial So that's why we use the covariance matrix formalism. So then you can use heterodyne and homodyne detection, which basically saturates the quantum Fisher information. Ah, cool, cool. All right. So we have now about a five-minute break. And oh man, let's thank it. Let's thank Yvette again for that talk. Sorry. Thanks. Thank you. And so we have.
