In the Shen Lab, and today I'm going to be talking to you about how high-resolution single-molecule investigations have revealed new insights into the R-loop energetics landscape. So Svetlano gave a great review, covered a lot of topics for me on what R loops are, but these are three-stranded nucleic acid structures. They generally form co-transcriptionally, and they occur when the nascent RNA here, shown in red, hybridizes to the template strand of the DNA, and you displace the non-template strand. You displace the non-template strand. So you have an RNA-DNA hybrid and an associated region of single-stranded DNA. So I'm primarily an experimentalist in the Chetin Lab, and I study R loops in vitro. And so the way that we generally do this is using plasmid systems. And what this means here, we've got a cartoon of an example plasmid. We'll take some promoter that we like, often the T7 polymerase promoter. Doesn't matter what that is, it's just transcription starts from that. That is, it's just transcription starts from that point, and then we'll clone in or place in some region of the plasma that's either R loop prone or otherwise interesting to us, and then use this plasma system in order to measure RNA-DNA hybrid formation. And the way that we actually do this, as I want to mention, is through single-molecule R-loop footprinting or SMER-seq. And so you can imagine this cartoon is an in vitro transcription reaction just prior to the reaction. Reaction just prior to the reaction. We have a bunch of molecules floating around in solution, some of which have formed R loops and some of which have not. And so we'll put this reaction mixture through the SMERS-Seq library preparation protocol. And ultimately, since we're molecular biologists, we see everything as high-throughput sequencing. Send it for Pac-Bio single molecule sequencing. And the long and short of this is using this technology, we can determine the Technology: We can determine the location, the length, and because this is an unbiased method, meaning we're not selecting for R loop-containing molecules, there's no pull-down or antibodies here. We're sequencing R-loop-containing and non-R-loop-containing molecules. We can use that to calculate the frequency at their occurrence at even a specific base pair within these plasmids. And so, kind of the crux of this talk is this sage wisdom that's been handed down in the China for generations. Down in the chat and lab for generations, that for an ROP to form, it must be energetically favorable. And so, I'm going to talk about three aspects of that today. The first of that, which we've heard about, is DNA sequence and topology. This is well-established parameters within our loop formation, but here we've looked at it with a bit more resolution and detail than has been done previously. And we also looked at kind of two novel components to this equation: one is single. Equation. One is single-strand breaks. So this is where there's a break or a nick in the non-template strand of the DNA, and how this affects energetics will become clear later on. And we also looked at non-template strand stabilization using a protein which binds single-stranded DNA. It's in the name, it's called single-strand binding protein. So, those are kind of our three experiments. So, those are kind of our three experiments we'll talk about today. So, to start with DNA sequence, the way that we tested this was I started by creating this variable region plasmid library. So, this is a library of 31 different plasmids that samples different DNA sequence conditions that are known to or believed to affect R live formation. So, this is a table showing each one of those plasmids, and in the 200-base pair region that we synthesized. Region that we synthesized that's totally synthetic, we modified and set specific parameters for the GC skew, GC content, AT skew, and G clustering. So these are all measurements of the number of G's versus C's, number of G is C's total, or A's versus T's. So different sequence parameters. And this is a map of one of these example plasmids. Here is the actual variable region. Actual variable region. So it's right downstream of the promoter. So, what is happening in these experiments is transcription is starting at the promoter, the polymerase is moving this way, and so it traverses the variable region and then it enters the Snurpin region, which is an R loop forming region. And we included this downstream of the VR because we wanted a favorable region in case we had an R loop that started here. We wanted it to be able to continue further into the sequence. So, this slide is kind of the big overview of the SMR-seq results on this plasmid library. We did a bunch of different SMUR-Seq experiments, but this is showing you separating out each of the different plasmids and looking at the R-loop frequency within that variable region. So, in this plot on the left, we're separating them out by GC skew, and then on the y-axis by GC contact. On the y-axis, by GC content. Most of them separate by these two variables. There's a bunch actually located in this region here. All have the same GC skewed, same GC content, but we varied either the AT skew or the G cluster length. And so kind of as we expected, based on sequence energetics, which I didn't mention before, but generally increasing GC SKU and GC content is associated, thought to be associated with increased Thought to be associated with increased R loop formation. And we can see that as you kind of move up towards this corner of the graph, the pixels get more yellow, which is indicating more R loop formation. And so that kind of fit our expectation. But it's also interesting to see that GC SKU or GC content alone is not enough to really drive, make these strong RLIP formers. It's the combination of both of these factors that really drive their formation in terms of sequence. In terms of sequence. The story was a bit. Yeah, sorry. So GC SKU is the, when you have comparing, it's an overabundance of G's versus C's on a non-tempo-H strand. So it's thought that you have a G-rich DNA and a C-rich RNA, that's conducive to R-loop formation. So that's what that statistic is measuring. Same thing with AT skew, but just with A's and T's. So the C, yeah, the R. So, yeah, the results were slightly less clear with G-cluster length versus AT skew. Initially, we were thinking that G clusters of four would be really good RLIP formers. It appears that in some ways they're not as good as shorter clusters, but this data is still something we're trying to dive into by taking a more fine-grained approach instead of just looking globally. But that's kind of a work in progress at this point. Another way of looking at this data is instead of me just giving you one statistic for the whole. Giving you one statistic for the whole VR region is to show you the frequency at each position in the plasmid. So here we're measuring our frequency base pair by base pair, right? Again, moving from right to left across the plasmid. And in this blue kind of bounding box here, this is the actual VR region of the plasmid. Downstream of that is the Snurpin region. And so when we look at a poor R loop former, we can see that there's very little signal. We can see that there's very little signal in this region, right? Not many R loops going on. And then something we also looked at was to compare this to a statistic produced by the R looper program, which is a program that Sidlana mentioned. It's an energy-based model of RLoops. And so if we compare the mean-free energy of the predicted structures in this region, you can see it's comparatively high, which makes sense, right? Because high, we'd expect. High, we'd expect low energy to form more R loops, and we actually do see this when we look at a more energetically favorable sequence like BR23. We see much more R loop formation going on here, and comparatively, the mean free energy of this location is much lower. And so, generally, the mean free energy tracks pretty well with the R loop frequency that we see actually in the experience. That we see actually in the experimental results. So, all the results that I just showed you were done on negatively supercoiled DNA templates. But we also did these exact same experiments, same SMRF-seq reactions, but on linearized templates, meaning that we cut them with a restriction enzyme prior to transcription. So there's no topology, and the ends can freely rotate. And then we compared the R loop frequency within. The R loop frequency within the VR regions between those samples. And so this is the supercoiled R loop frequency on the x-axis and then the linear frequency on the y-axis. And we can see there's almost a one-to-one correlation between these data points. Meaning that if you're a really good supercoiled R loop former, you're probably going to be a comparatively good linear R loop former. But you can see that when you just look at the values here, the supercoiled values are about twice as much as what you're doing. Values are about twice as much as what you see on the linear. So negative supercoiling gives, it kind of rises, it raises all both, right, equally. So there doesn't appear to be some sequences that are more affected by topology, at least within our library, than other sequences. So that's kind of the sequence story of this. But regardless of whatever your sequence of your plasmid is, all Of your plasmid is all R loops are going to have to start and end. And the locations where an R loop starts and ends are called the R loop junctions, this transition. And the formation of these junctions is actually thought to be very energetically unfavorable, estimated at 10.5 kcals per mole. And so we hypothesize that if you were to induce a NIC or a single strand break in the, specifically the non-template strand, The non-template strand that at the site of this NIC, you wouldn't have to pay that junction energy to initiate an R loop. So you'd be much more energetically favorable to form specifically at that site where the NIC is, right? Because everywhere else, you're still paying that junction energy. And so the way we tested this was using a Cas9 NICase-based system. So, where we had three different treatments using three different guide RNAs. Cas9 is an enzyme. Casion is an enzyme. This specific casion only induces a NIC instead of a double-strand break, and it's guided to a specific location by the guide RNA. And so we had three different treatments of increasing distances away from our promoter. So 91 base pairs, 500, and about 1,000 base pairs away. And we did these in three separate treatments. So there's only one NIC at one site per treatment. This is just an IRS. This is just an agarose gel showing you that on the left lane we have a supercoil of plasmid, and that runs through the gel relatively quickly. But then, when we treat it with our Cas9 and guideRNA, we nick it, we relax all the topology, and therefore it moves much more slowly through the gel. And we can see this reaction is pretty efficient. That there is almost no band at this height, which would indicate leftover supercoiloplasmid from that treatment. So, these are the SMIRSeq results for these experiments. This is, like I showed previously, a plot of our frequency over the length of the plasmid that we did these experiments on, where our promoter is at this location, and then transcription is going this way, and then we're plotting the R loop frequency on the Y-axis. This is the control condition, so just normally transcribed on a linear substrate. And we can see this is a favorable region here. There's a favorable region here, so we form a modest number of R loops. When we add Cas9 into solution, but no guide RNA, right, prior to treatment, so we're not inducing a NIC, we see basically the same result, which is what we expected because we're not changing anything about the DNA. So just a control to make sure Cas9 is not inducing RLIPs, which it does not. And so this is our first real treatment. And so when we induce the Treatment. And so when we induce a NIC at the guide RNA 13 site, which is right here, we see a really big spike in signal basically exactly at that site that kind of plateaus off into the favorable region. And we saw kind of a similar but slightly different story with our next guide RNA, guide RNA 11, which again, the signal basically increases almost right at the site of that NIC, but here the peak is much sharper. We're not exactly sure why what's causing these. We're not exactly sure why what's causing these differences right now, but it's something we're kind of actively investigating. And there may be some evidence from AFM experiments that there is actually something different between these two samples. But that remains to be seen. And then lastly, with our guide RNA-8 experiment, again, it confirms this story where we see a huge induction of R-loop initiation basically right at the site of that NIC. So that was really, really exciting to see. So that was really exciting to see that. This box plot is quantifying the differences between the normally transcribed sample and the Nix sample. So I'm looking at a 50-base pair window around the site of Nix and just asking what's the R loop frequency there. I'm plotting as a box plot. The green is the unnicked versus the colored is the nicked. And calculate the fold change between them. And we can see that at the guide RNA 8, where there's a little At the guide RNA 8, where there's the lowest amount of background R loops, there's almost no R loops forming here. There are some, but there's very few. That there is almost 155-fold change in the number of R loops. So it's a huge increase at the site of the NIC. So that was really interesting to see. And we wanted to use this to go back to our energy-based models to see if we could re-estimate some of the energetic parameters surrounding R loops. Parameters surrounding R loops. That 10.5 kcals per mole value I gave you was estimated from DNA structures. So it's not estimated directly from R loops. And so we thought that maybe we could modify our looper, this energy-based model, to try and fit our NIC data to tell us something about what that actual value may be. And so the way we did this was basically by saying set the junction energy to a specific value everywhere except the slightly. Specific value everywhere except the side of the NIC. And then we played with that energy value until we fit the experimental data as best we could. And so this is kind of the default parameters. The blue is the predictions from our looper at 10.5, the standard value. And then the red is the experimental data. And then we found that we got the best fit around 20 kcals per mole, about double. And so there's some technical caveats that come with this. Caveats that come with this that I can talk more about in my poster if you guys want to check that out later today. But it led us to believe that the current S-energy values for this junction energy for our loops are likely a degree of an underestimate. So the last story that I want to tell you about is this idea of template strand stabilization. And so our hypothesis here was that when you have That when you have an R loop, just a regular R loop structure, that the non-template strand may be sort of competing with the RNA for binding to the template strand. Maybe there's some kind of competition going on while that structure exists. And so because of that competition, once you make an R loop, there's some probability of dissolving it. But since that structure forming is dependent on transcription, it's kind of a one-way path. And so you might be losing. Path. And so you might be losing a lot of R loops due to this dissolving effect in theory. This is a hypothesis. So to test this, we thought that by adding single-strand binding protein, which again will only bind to single-stranded DNA, which is only produced in this experiment after the formation of an R loop, that we could isolate that strand or stabilize it, and maybe we would observe more R loops because of that, because there would be less dissociation. Because of that, because there would be less dissociation. And so to do this, there's two key experimental protocols that I think kind of need to be understood here. This is again an in-vitro reaction, an in-vitro transcription reaction, and our first experiment is a co-SSB treatment, where we have everything in the pot all at once. So everything you need to do is transcription plus SSB. And the key to understand here is that this means that SSB. This means that SSP can bind to R loops at the moment of their formation, right? Because it's in solution at the same time as the polymerase. And the complement to this experiment, the control, was the post-SSB treatment, where we do the same type of in vitro transcription reaction, same plasmids, same conditions, all that, but then we chemically stop transcription by adding a chemical that prevents more. Adding a chemical that prevents more polymerase moving through the template. And at that point, we add the SSB. So SSB can only bind to R loops that have already formed in solution. It's not binding to them as they are forming. So that's the key distinction here. So these are the SMUR-seq results for those experiments. This is, again, the same kind of R-loop frequency plot, but I'm showing you for two different VR plasmids that we did this type of SSB experiment. Type of SSB experiment on. The green line is showing when we treated with SSB, but we did not transcribe. And as you expect, there is no signal because SSB doesn't induce R loops. Then when we actually transcribe in our post-SSB condition, we start to see R loop formation as expected because there is transcription happening here. And also a nice confirmation of our independent experiment with the BRs. We see that BR20 is forming more Rs. That BR20 is forming more R loops than BR10 because BR20 is a more favorable sequence. Then, when we add SSB during transcription, we see the signal basically get pushed up in both plasmids. And something that I thought was really interesting to notice here is that, unlike the NIC samples, the localization of this peak is not changing basically at all. The peak is in the same place, but the signal is being pushed up three. Up three or fourfold in many cases. And so this was telling us that since the peak is in the same location, that SSB is in fact stabilizing these nascent R loops that were likely maybe started to form in this sample, but fell apart before we could measure them. And now, because we're stabilizing that non-techolite strand, we can capture them with our SMERS-C protocol. So, this kind of led us to believe that. So, this kind of led us to believe that there may be more early events of R loop formation than we actually can capture, but most of them fall apart, likely due again to the fact that that junction energy is such a significant barrier to overcome. So, main takeaways, I think, from this work so far have been that DNA sequence. When we compared between the best and the worst VRs in our library, we saw up to around a five-fold change. Around a five-fold change in R-loop frequency, and that was consistent between superpoiled and linear samples. We saw that non-template strands are, can be, or sorry, non-template strand NICs can be very powerful and potent initiators of R-loop initiation, and that's regardless of the sequence context, right? Because we saw that effect in all locations of the plasmid. And then finally, when we stabilize the non-template strand, Non-template strand, we prevent early R loop collapse and are therefore able to observe many more R loops than we do compared to an unstabilized situation. So that's kind of my talk for today, and I want to, of course, acknowledge the members of my lab, especially Taras here. This guy right here, he is a junior specialist in our lab, has been really instrumental in pushing these SmartSeq experiments across the line and kind of spearheaded the SSB. Spearheaded the SSB stuff, and also Stella, who has been instrumental in the SmurfSeq data analysis. And we've also been working, I didn't show their data here today, but if you want to check it out, it'll be on my poster. The Pine Lab has been even doing a collaboration with them to try and image these samples using AFM. That's, I think, going to be really exciting. And of course, our funding from the NSF and UC Davis. Happy to take any questions. Happy to take any questions. Yeah. I thought that was really fascinating working. I was curious about the pH. Good question. I haven't measured it specifically just because it's a really small reaction volume, but.
