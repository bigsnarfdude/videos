Oh, the pointer some problem. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, so it's a pleasure to introduce Aushan from Wisconsin Medicine, and the title of his talk is Universality of 2D Young Meals. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, organizer, for organizing this wonderful conference. Yeah, so this is based on work with Iliya Tevereth at Edinburgh. From this paper, which we just posted a few months ago. So, the Yamios model is from physics. So, let's quickly review the physical background. A physical model is usually defined by an action functional S, where phi can be, say, a trajectory particle or some sort of electric magnetic field, for example. And in classical physics, And in classical physics, one wants to minimize this. It's called the principle of least action. One wants to minimize such an action functional. And this usually produces some interesting PDE. So in quantum physics, one wants to quantize this classical model. So one formulation is a so-called functional integral approach, where you look at a formal measure, which is the exponential of the action. and one wants to calculate correlation functions of such measure. Stochastic quantization is another formulation which is a bridge between quantum field theory and stochastic PDE. Here, one study the gradient flow for this action functional. So this gradient flow approached the minimizer of the classical action. But then we add this space. Then we add this space-time Y noise, Kasi, and then we get this stochastic dynamic. This dynamic is such that this formal measure is formally invariant under this dynamic. And this dynamic, right, by choosing different action functionals, give us so many interesting status PDs. In this talk, the action functional S will be the so-called Young-Mills action, which I define in the next slide. Next, in the next slides, and this is a functional of a field A, and A will be a Lie algebra valued one form. So I first introduce the Yang-Meals model, namely I define the Yang-Meulsse action functional. And then I'm going to introduce a class of lattice Young-Meus models. And these are discretized version of the Young-Mills model. A version of the Young-Mills model such that it enjoys the same sort of symmetry property. And then I'll recall some previous result with Chandra, Teverev, and Haire, where we construct the so-called stochastic quantization of the Amios model on two and three-dimensional torus. That's a construction continuum. And then I'll describe our main result. I'll describe our main result, the new result with Trevor F, where we prove that the dynamic of all those lattice Young-Meose models, they converge to the same limit, which is the limit we constructed earlier. So yeah, this proof involves two steps. We want to show convergence to some limit, and then we identify the limit to be the limit we construct earlier. If time permits, I'll also. If time permits, I'll also talk about the environment measure. So, in the definition of Yang-Miu's model, there is a Lie group called capital G and Lie algebra small G. The field is a Lie algebra at one form. So, what this means is it's a one form, right? It says a D components. And each component is not just a function, it's a Lie algebra value. function it's a Lie algebra value function so if you think of Lie algebra as a matrix so at every x ai x is a matrix state space the the underlying space is a d-dimensional RD or d-dimensional torus and the field is defined on the d-dimensional space okay so this is our field and the IAM YOUS action for the field is defined to be the Is defined to be the L2 of the so-called curvature F, and the curvature is a Lie algebra value two form where the Ij component is given by DA plus the Lie algebra of Ai Aj. So this whole thing is still taking value in the Lie algebra. And what do we mean by L2 of such Lie algebra value to form? It just means, well, we fix L2 inner product. Fix the L2 inner product on the Lie algebra, right? So we take L2 with respect to that, and then we take the square sum over all the indices ij, and finally L2 over the einer line space. Okay, so that's the Yamiyu section. Well, if you just, if it's the first time you see this, if you pretend all the A's are just numbers. All the a's are just numbers, then this action functional looks like L2 of dA, right? If you if they are numbers, you don't have a commutator, so it's just a simplest in that case, it's just simplest action, which is the you know L2 of DA, and the corresponding PD would be a heat equation. So, this is a kind of non-commutative or non-linear generalization of the, say, DA square. Say dA square. There's an important symmetry here, which is called gauge symmetry. If you take any Lie group value function g, apply g on the field. So A is a Lie algebra value one form, and this gives you a new Lie algebra one form. The particular form of this gate transformation doesn't quite matter for the moment, but what matters is this transformation leaves the action invariant. Leaves the action invariant. So, this is the important symmetry. This is infinite-dimensional symmetry because this is invariant under any choice of such function. Okay, so this invariance is just a few lines of calculation to check this. Now, the quantum Yamios, as I said, it's a formal measure, which is exponential of this action. This is completely formal because of many reasons. Because of many reasons, right? For example, here I write a dA, which is kind of infinite-dimensional, the big measure doesn't make sense. Okay, because this measure doesn't make precise sense, physics introduce a class of discretization of Young-Mills model. And those discrete Young-Mills models are well defined. So the phases can use. So, the physicist can use this well-defined discrete model to probe various properties of Yam-Meul's model. And what's important here is you should discretize the Yang-Meul's model such that it's preserved the gauge symmetry. So, how do we do that? This is a discrete Yang-Meul's model. Okay, so we have a D-dimensional lattice. And remember, the field is a Remember, the field is one form, right? It has D components. Therefore, we should discretize the field on the edges because the edges are pointing to different directions. So for the discrete model, for each edge, I associate a Lie group valued variable. So uxy is an element in the Lie group. This already differs. This is already different from the continuum definition. Continuum definition take value in the Lie algebra. So if you discretize such that the field still take a value in Lie algebra, just doesn't work, just doesn't preserve the gauge symmetry. Okay. Yes? Yeah, so I think the in field of the current issue is that the future is So I think the in physics, right, so physicists propose models based on symmetry considerations. The reason that Jan and Muels proposed the Young-Mills model is exactly because they want to extend the abelian symmetry in electrodynamics to non-abelian symmetries. So actually the symmetry itself, in some sense, more important than the model itself, in some sense. Than the model itself, in some sense, right? So, if you lose the such symmetry when you discretize the properties, when you have lattice models, you can do some simulations, you can calculations. But if the symmetry is lost, then all the calculations is not reliable, some sense. Okay, yeah, so now we have a field on the edges taking value. On the edges, taking value in the Lie group. And now we consider this measure. The du xy is a higher measure on the lead group. It's just the kind of translation environment. It's just the generalization of the big measure. And then I have an exponential of the action. So the action now is defined to be this. I look at each p. So each p is a little square. is a little square we call plaquette consisting of four vertices in the lattice xyzw and i'm going to multiply the four unitary of the four lead group element along the four edges okay so this product is a element in the lead group and then the little s is a function from the lead group to real numbers so that this this this whole thing is a number So, that this whole thing is a number. Okay, so this is kind of nearest neighbor interaction of this discrete model. The S satisfy this conjugate environment property. Okay, so as I said, what's important is gauge symmetry, gauge environment, under this gauge transformation. So, I take any function on the lattice, right? It's a G-valued function. I do this transformation. I do this transformation. It looks like a conjugation, but it's x and y here, different. We can easily check that this action is invariant under this transformation because now you multiply the uxy on the right by gy inverse, multiply uyz on the left by gy, right? So they cancel out. What remains is a gx here and gx inverse here, but s satisfy this invariance property. Satisfy this invariant property. So it's very, very easy to see it's a gauge invariant. There are several choices of this function. For example, it can be chosen to be the trace of U and log of heat kernel on the Lie group and the distance from the identity element square. So this is called Wilson action, Vilan, and Manton action. Exactly, exactly, yeah. So there's a very so, you know, Shuv Chatterjee has some papers, you know, studying this kind of properties of discrete Yamius model. And he also has a review paper where he formally, not formally actually, so you just, you just, right, so just look at you look at this action and you let u to be exponential of a. Of A. And then you do some sort of expansion, you can see this action, discrete action, actually approximate the continuum action. You can actually see that. Okay, so what we are going to do now is we look at the stochastic analysis, the gradient flow perturbed by wire noise for this discrete model. And yeah. And yeah, I didn't write this dynamically, but it's just a gradient of this action plus the discrete Y noise, which assign each edge a Brownian motion on the Lie group. This dynamic itself, it's already very interesting. Actually, in some other papers, we proved some log-subblev inequality and mass gap correlation decay and so on. Correlation decay and so on. But I'm not going to talk about that. I'm going to now send the lattice spacing to zero and show that the dynamic for the discrete, for all these discrete models, convert to the same limit in the construction we did earlier. So let's recall the construction we did earlier with Chanjo Traveler Higher. So this is now in continuum, right? So we look at the gradient flow plus the white noise and the The white noise. And the result of the paper can be summarized in a simple picture. This picture, I have an infinite-dimensional space or the fields A, and I have a gauge symmetry group acting on that. And these curves are just orbits under the gauge transformations. In other words, all the fields along the same orbit, they are gauge equivalent. They just differ by gauge transformation. What we prove is that we, okay, first look at that stochast PD from the stochasticization right to look like Laplacian plus some nonlinear term, which are Li brackets. And then there's a renormalization term and a Y noise. And by the way, there's a de Turk term because if you just look at the gradient S, it's not a parabolic PDE, which is not good. But the de Turk term is another drift which is tangent to the orbit. Which is tangent to the orbit. So, adding that doesn't matter. And this makes the equation parabolic. So, what we prove in the paper is that we prove that this equation is locally well posed, but moreover, we prove that the solution has a gauge covariant property. This means if you start the equation from two gauge equivalent initial conditions, okay. Okay, so starting from here or from here, and then run the equations up to time t, then for any time t, the solutions are still gauge equivalent in law. In other words, the dynamic doesn't depend on the representative element you start from the orbit. So it's really a dynamic on the space orbits, on the quotient space. This is what we proved. There's a okay, so that we normalize. Okay, so that renormalization, we have to make a finite shift of the constant. Okay, so there's a particular choice of that renormalization constant such that the dynamic has the gauge covariant property I just described. Okay, so this choice of constant induce a Markov process X on the space of, on the quotient space. So this work raised two questions. This work raised two questions. First, the universality question. So, is this Markov process X universal limit of all those, you know, Vi-Land, Wilson, and the Mante models, and so on, right? The second question is, in the 80s to 90s, the two-dimensional Yamils measure was constructed by many people. And is that really the invariant measure for this dynamic X? In this new paper, we In this new paper, the answer is yes to both questions on two-dimensional torus. Let me point out that the proof of the part two actually relies on part one because discrete model, you can explicitly check that the discrete model is invariant and is a discrete dynamic, because discrete is just a finite dimensional problem. And then we pass the limit, and we can show the limiting measure is a invariant and the Measure is the environment and the limiting dynamic. There's also a nice coloury where we prove that we prove the universality of two-dimensional Young-Mills measure. And this universality actually follows from part one, which is the universality of the dynamic. Because combined with some ergodicity result from SPD, we can show that. From SPD, we can show that this SPD has a, this process has a unique invariant measure. And therefore, we know that all the discrete measures, their limits should be invariant under the limiting dynamic. And since the invariant measure limiting dynamics is unique, it must be the same limit. Okay, so for the rest talk, I'll describe. Yes. We have We have yeah, so we do have a global existence for the 2D case because in 2D case we have an environment measure. So you can combine with the argument by Jean Burguin to use the environment measure to construct a global solution. But if you don't start from the environment measure as your initial condition, then you can prove that after a very short time, Then you can prove that after a very short time it's already very close to the environment measure, and then the Burgundian argument still applies. Yeah. Okay, so let's look at a universality question. Universality just means I want to prove various discrete dynamics convert the same continuum limit. In general, such questions, you know, you might have interest in discrete models from statistical physics and so on. But in general, But in general, the challenge is that such models have they're defined in a form which looks very far from the limiting equation. I believe constantly talk will also see something like that. So in this model, the difficulty is you can see from here, right? So in the discrete model, the field U map. The field u maps, right? Field U defines the edges, they're Lie group valued. In continuum, the field is Lie algebra value. This already look kind of different. The idea is that under certain scaling, as lattice spacing go to zero, the field U becomes more and more close to the identity. Eventually, it becomes kind of infinitesimal perturbation identity, therefore it must be Lie algebra. Must be Lie algebra. But that's just a heuristic, right? And also, okay, so this is our dynamic, the discrete dynamic. The action is defined on the Lie group and the gradient is, okay, so I first fix the bi-invariant remaining metric on the Lie group, and the gradient is with respect to that metric. And then this B assigns each edge a G-valued Browning motion. Browning motion. Okay, so if you really write down explicitly that this dynamic, it looks very far from the limiting SPD. So, how do we do this? How do we? So, we are going to first try to rewrite this discrete dynamics into a form which looks a little bit closer to the limited SVD. And then we can maybe control error and so on. So, our strategy is the following. Remember, there's exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group. The Lie group. And this exponential map is a bijection as long as you're not far away from the identity. What we are going to do is, okay, so here we have a bi-inviron remaining metric, and we're going to use this exponential map to pull back that metric from the Lie group to the Lie algebra. And this makes the Lie algebra is just a linear space. But when I pull back the remaining metric to the Lie algebra, I make the Lie algebra into I make the Lie algebra into a remaining manifold, not just a linear space. And also pull back the action functional to the Lie algebra, and I pull back the Brownie motion. Okay. So then I'm going to compute the gradient flow there. But now the gradient, by gradient, I mean the gradient with respect to the pullback metric. Okay, so after maybe 20 pages of calculation. After maybe 20 pages of calculations, you're going to see that the log, right, the inverse of this map, the A, satisfy discrete equation, which already look a little bit closer to the continuum equation. So the continuum equation is that, right, with the renormalization CA. The discrete equation, we don't renormalize. Of course, we cannot change the model, right? So discrete equation now will have a form which looks like the non-linear terms. Which look like the nonlinear terms, noise, and error term. There are tons of error terms. I just write one of them, which look like epsilon, which is the lattice spacing, times, say, ADAA, something like that. Yeah. There are error terms which look the same for different. Terms which are which look the same for a different model, and there are error terms which look different. Okay, so it's uh, yeah, this is complicated actually. Um, so you might think this epsilon goes to zero, this vanish, right? That doesn't vanish. So it's similar with what Sandra said for the small mass limit, right? Because the a's here are singular, so actually in the limit, it has some contribution. We can show that such error term in the limit contributes. Such error term in the limit contributes to some constant times a. So, okay, so the error terms eventually will contribute a term which looks like a renormalization in the continuum equation, the CA, right? Okay, so to summarize, at this moment we can show that as lattice spacing go to zero, we get a limiting. zero, we get a limit, which is that limit with some C, but we don't know yet if this C is the same as that one. We want to identify the limit now. So our C, as I said, we have tons of error terms, so we have many, many C's. In principle, these constants are explicit, but we really don't want to add them up to compare with us. It would be a nightmare. So. So, the question is: how to identify the limit, right? What we are going to do is we argue that, okay, in the continuum equation, okay, just focus on continuum equation, there is a unique choice of the C such that the dynamics has the gauge covariant property I said earlier. This is important because we know the discrete models present. We know the discrete models preserve the gauge symmetry. So we know the limits of the discrete models are gauge covariant. If there's a unique C such that the continuum dynamics is gauge covariant, then we identify the limit. So the proof of this argument is in some sense topological or geometric. I just showed the rough idea in the case that the Lie group is abelian. So when abelian, you can. Okay, so in abelian in a abelian case, everything becomes linear. So just a you know, heat equation, vector valued, right? So, but I goes from one to D and they're decoupled. So even for this vector-valued linear equation, we can talk about the gauge transformation. Taking any u1 valued, u1 just circle, right? Value function. Just circle right value function g apply g to a we can check that um um yeah so so you also have an action for the abelian case you can check the action as invariant of that okay so now the action the gate transformation just shift a by dgg inverse in the abelian case uh to show our argument for the uniqueness of the gauge covariant limit uh i need to introduce the wilson loop observable The Wilson loop observable. This is defined to be the exponential of the loop integral of A. Okay, I take a loop in my underlying space. I just integrate this vector field A, I exponentially that. And turns out this is a gauge invariant observable. That's important. Because if you do this gauge transformation, you can check this as an invariant because. invariant because that term when you integrate a long loop it's an integer multiple 2 pi i and therefore the exponential doesn't see that the reason that this is integer is because g is circle value so dgg inverse is like an infinitesimal angle and when you integrate when you accumulate the angle along loop you get a winding number along the loop right so it must be an integer um Okay, so our claim is that for the abelian case, the equation is gauge covariant if and only if the C is zero in this case. When C is zero, it's easy to prove it's gauge covariant. So suppose you start equation from A0 and A bar zero, right? You can AT, run the equation, get AT, A bar t. And then we can show that for any t A and A bar, right? A and a bar, right? They are gauge equivalent. We can explicitly construct the gauge transformation which transforms A to A bar. And turns out this gauge transformation satisfy a PDE. Okay, so the PDE has a unique solution and so on. Okay. The tricky thing is we want to show when C is not zero, the equation is not gauge covariant. Okay. For this, we need to get equal equation. For this, we need to use the Wilson loop observable. Okay, so for this, I just need to find a particular example of initial conditions a0 and a bar zero, right? Which I choose to be 2 pi i dx1 and 0. And I show that the, you know, you just start the equation from those two initial conditions, and then at time t, they are not gauge equivalent. To show they are not gauge equivalent, I just need to show their corresponding. not gauge equivalent i just need to show their corresponding wilson loop observable are different right because this this is this observable is is how you detect the gauge environment okay since equation linear you can solve them right heat kernel and so on and this starts from you you know that that equation you have an initial condition part and then uh since the solution is gaussian right this is mean zero gaussian this is gaussian with mean that uh we can mean that we can exceed exactly calculate the exponential of Gaussian so you can see that the excitation right this is just the Gaussian curve this function they are not equal because that extra term here if you take the the the line integral right um the a0 is chosen to be 2 pi i dx which is a close form but not exact form right so the xy not exact form, right? So the x1 is not a well-defined function on the torus. x1 is not periodic. Now I so if you choose the loop to be the loop which winds around the torus, then you integrate that one form, then get a non-trivial number which is 2 pi i. So if c is not 0, then for positive this is not 1. Therefore, they are not equal. Okay, so for c not equal. Equal. Okay, so for C not equal to zero, we do see this is the dynamics are not gauge covariant. So there's only unique C is gauge covariant. Non-abelian case is much more complicated. Okay, so I'm not going to give the full proof of non-abelian case, but rough idea is that we do some sort of order estimates, which shows that for small time, the kind of That for a small time, the kind of non-linear effect when you go to non-abelian, you have non-linear terms. Non-linear effect is some in some sense of next order comparing to the discrepancy we find here. But eventually, here, the crucial thing in this argument is a choice of this special curve. So, the essence of this proof is that we can choose, okay, when you run through this curve. Through this curve in the torus, it traces out a curve in the Lie algebra, right? When you integrate A, you get a curve in the Lie algebra, which connects the zero in the Lie algebra to something non-zero, right here. When you integrate, you get two pi. But when you lift this curve from Lie algebra to the Lie group, then you get a closed curve, right? Go back to the identity. And we want to do this in the non-ability. To do this in the non-abelian case, uh, this sounds easy, but we okay, it turns out to be an application of sub-romain geometry here. Um, so as I said, I want to find a curve value in the Lie algebra such that it starts from zero, but doesn't end up with zero, right? And then I want to, okay, what do I mean by lifting to the Lie group? It just means I um I look at this ODE, uh, it says. ODE, it says the tangent vector of this curve L is given by the right translation of this tangent vector from identity to that point. That's what the OD is saying. So basically, we view the product. We view the product of G cross G as a sub-region manifold. We kind of create a horizontal distributions spanned by such vectors. And then finding such curve eventually boils down to finding a horizontal curve. Okay, so that's almost my talk. So I wanted to say something about environment measure. So we also prove that there's a unique measure. Also, prove that there's a unique measure on the orbit space, on the quotient space, right, which agrees with early construction by Levis and Guberta and so on. And this measure is a unique environment measure of the dynamics we construct earlier with Andrew and Heier and so on and chevrolet. This relies on some idea from this is a famous work by Bogan, which brings probability to PD in some sense. Yeah, you can make use of environment measure. The invariant measure to show such results. And the important input of Bourguin's argument is a moment bound for the invariant measure. For this, Chavarev had an earlier paper which he already has some bound, but we need to sharpen such bound. And in such moment bounds, we also use some sort of rough Ulundek estimates. You know, this goes back to Estimates, you know, this goes back to a famous paper by Ullenbeck, it's called Ullenbeck Compactness Nowadays, where she showed that in Coulomb gauge, you can bound the field A by the curvature and so on. So what we prove is a kind of rough version. It's still very different, but kind of inspired by her result. Okay, I'll just stop here. Here. Thank you very much. Are there questions? Yes. Very general question. So in order to show the discrete model converges to the continuum model, you basically rewrite your equation from the Lie group to the Lie algebra. I guess this has already been done by the physicists, is that right? Because what they do, they start with the continuum model and then. Continuum model, and then they cannot. I mean, it's not well defined, they discretize it. So, they're doing exactly the opposite way. They did that on the level action, right? So that you can look at maybe the review of strategy. It's just a half-page calculation that you can see the discrete action approximate the continuum action. But it's a very different story when you look at the gradient flow perturbed by the white noise. By the y-noise, that calculation is uh is uh okay. The physical calculation doesn't okay. So, that when they derive the discrete model, actually, they start from a different angle. And is that what you mean? Yeah, they started with a simple, much simpler perspective. Just look at the action. Yeah, I see, I see. Okay, thank you. I mean, for example, even action approximate the continuum, it doesn't mean exponential of that approximate that, right? So, so, yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay, so so yeah, thank you. Thank you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, dimension four, we didn't have the construction in the continuum, right? So continuum at this moment, the okay, construction in continuum relies on regular structure, and at this moment, the theory. Moment, the theory mainly applies to subcritical case. In critical case, you know, we have to build some stochastic terms and renormalization and so on. Critical dimension or four-dimension, we have infinite many of such terms. So, four-dimensional Yang-Meals, there's some understanding in terms of perturbation theory, but it's yeah, not. Yeah, not perturbation theory is not very rigorous. Yeah. For example, work by Costello. You can introduce the renormalization. You can show that in the perturbation theory, each term has a limit as epsilon go to zero. But it's just a perturbation. But it's just a perturbation series which doesn't converge. And only rigorous result is by Balaban at the Rutgers. He wrote something like 12 papers on CMP where he showed that the partition function of the four-dimensional Yamius is stable when you pass epsilon to zero, which means the partition function as a number, right? When you pass epsilon to zero, it's bounded from about Zero, it's bounded from above and below. Doesn't say anything about the measure. Also, those 12 papers on CMP, I'm not sure how many people understand. Exactly, exactly. No, I believe exactly, exactly. Yeah, not explicitly, but we argue that there's a unique choice of this C. Yeah. Yeah. So in some sense, you know, you have this renormalization constant C, right? But you do a finite shift of this renormalization constant, you get a different. Distribute normalization constant, you get different. It's like a total versus straw knowit, right? So you get different solutions. So basically, there's one family, one parameter family of solutions, among which there's a unique one, which satisfies the gauge covariant property. And we show that our discrete models converge to that one.
