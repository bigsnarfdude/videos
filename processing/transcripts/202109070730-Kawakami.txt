To thank the organizer for giving me the chance to talk here. So, today I'm talking on the large diffusion limit for the heat equation with a dynamical boundary condition. So, this talk is based on several joint work with Professor Marik Fira in Communist University and Professor Kazuhiro Isige. Maybe he is here. And one of the speakers of the tomorrow session, the first speaker of the tomorrow session. Session, the first week of the tomorrow session, and Dr. Johannes Rankite. Okay, let's start. So, in this talk, we consider the most, I guess, that most simplest equation, this is the linear heat equation, this red guys, and with some coefficient epsilon before the derivative with time. And the equation is very simple, but the boundary condition, this Bruga. Boundary condition, this Bruga is something special. This one is the dynamical boundary condition. We call that. So this boundary condition means that, for example, if the solution U touch the boundary with this angle, then this value of the boundary is go down. And if the solution U touch the boundary with this angle, then the boundary data of the solution goes up. Uh goes up. So the this boundary con dynamical boundary condition, which is a disbc is there are many many physical backgrounds. In particular, one of the most typical example is a thermal contact with a perfect conductor or diffusion of a solid from a well-steered fluid. So for example, if we consider some bounded domain gas that inside control by the heat equation and outside fluid is well-steered. Outside fluid is well thin, then the outside temperature is controlled by the ODE process. So, if we push the heat flow from the into the outside or vice versa, then the boundary data satisfies this boundary condition. And we choose this sign in front of the anomaly derivative because that I remember that the for the bus case. The professor Basque here and Professor Bitraro proved that for bounded domain case, if we consider the special dimension n is greater than or equal to 2 with the other sign of the direct boundary condition, then that problem is imposed. So from this point of view, we choose this sign. Okay. So in this talk, our aim is the form. First one is to construct a Uh, first one is to construct a global in-time solution of solution U sub epsilon of H. And the second one is that we want to prove that this solution, this global in-time solution combines with some function u in a suitable sense as epsilon tends to zero. Here, this function u is a solution of the Laplace equation with a dynamical boundary condition, and that is the equation change to the heat equation to the Change the heat equation to the discrapper equation. Okay. Original one, this one is a heat equation with some coefficients in front of the time-derivable solution. So in this case, the equation changed the heat equation to the Laplace equation and the influence of the initial function phi is lost. So we want to know what happened and can we prove that this. And can we prove the disconvergence or not? And which sense is a suitable one to prove the disconvergence? And I also remark that for this direction, some authors treat similar topics. For example, one is that Professor E. C, with some collaborators, they prove that the similar topics for the Eichner equation and in the sense of the business And in the sense of the viscosity one. Okay. And the second one is that Professor Giga and Professor Haman McKi proved that the similar topics for the fully non-regional degenerate power equation. But both of them treat only the viscosity solution. And in this talk, I want to treat the solution of the integral equation, namely the mild solution for our problem. Okay, so before treating the So, before treating our problem, I want to introduce some known results for the epsilon equal to zero case. So, in that case, we consider this inhomogeneous or nonlinear epidemic equation with an inhomogeneous or non-linear dynamical boundary condition case. So, maybe from the physical background, many also treat the bounded domain case. Okay, in this case, omega is a bounded domain case. So, in that case, so the So, in that case, so the both cases f is equivalent to zero or not, the main also treats this problem. And the J treats several topics, for example, global existence of solution, the uniqueness, understand, and the broad problem, and so on. So, in this case, they use the eigenfunction for data theory for the absorption equation and the spectral theory, and so on, because at this case is omega is a bounded domain case, and they. Omega is a boundary domain case, and they can use several techniques for the boundary domain one. On the other hand, if we focus to the unbounded domain case, in particular, for the half-space case, like the n-major half-space RN plus, there are few results, as well as I know there are few results. So I guess that only the several less than 10 or less than five. Uh, less than 10 or less than five, and so on. So, this paper uh treats the uh critical exponent for the existence of the global intervention solution because that in that case they treat that rappress equation with a non-linear dynamical boundary condition and in that case a function z of u equal to u to the power of b and if we choose the initial data phi b is non-negative then the solution is non-negative one so the the we can consider We can consider some future type results for this problem. So, they treat a critical exponent for the existence of Groving-type solutions and the Borough problem and asymptotic behavior of the solution. So, in this paper, they use a mass solution, in particular, the fundamental solution of the Flux and diffusion equation. As I explained later, roughly speaking, this boundary condition is equivalent to the Flux and diffusion equation in. To the fractional diffusion equation in the case of the omega equal to the n-dimensional house space case. So, from that reason, we can use the fundamental solution of fraction equation, namely the Poisson kernel. So, we can consider the Fusat type result and the signature behavior and the borough problem and so on. So, the and if we consider the non-linear the the non-linear problem with the inhomogeneous uh sorry inhomogeneous dynamical boundary condition case uh i and uh professor market freedom and professor because you see treat several topics and uh in the several papers in this paper we a prove that uh we show that the critical exponent for the existence of the solution this exponent is very special because that this is not only for the global existence but also the local in-time solution Also, the local in-time solution, local existence. Okay, for this problem, we proved that the existence of a global in-time solution and existence of the local in-time solution and existence of the steady state solution. This means that the epic equation with normal boundary condition, the solution of that problem, the existence of this problem is equilibrium. Problem is equilibrium, okay. And we also prove the asymptotic behavioral solution and the relationship between the minimal solution of the time-dependent problem and the minimal stationary solution. Okay. In that case, we use that represented formula of the solution and the Pragma-Render theorem for this problem. Okay, but all of these results treat the ethic problem. Treat the epic problem, namely the epsilon equal to zero case, not public one. So our motivation is that what happened for the epsilon not equal to zero? In that if we consider the heat equation with a dynamical boundary constant, what happened? This is our motivation to treat this problem. Okay, so the first one, I want to explain the half-space case. Okay. Okay, so the most important thing and the most difficult point is that how to construct the solution of this problem. Okay, because if we consider the usual semi-linear heat equation case, for example, in the whole space of a half space with a several boundary condition, Dirt one or Neumann boundary condition, an original boundary condition, and so on. Then we can use a heat current to construct the MySolution and so on. Construct a minor solution and so on. And we can use some scale invariant structure to find or to prove the existence of the solution. But this problem doesn't have a scale invariance property, of course, because that equation have this balance, powerwick balance, like this one, and the boundary condition have the different balance with respect to the time derivative and the space derivative. And the space derivative. So, we cannot use such a technique to construct a solution or to find some critical exponent for the non-linear problem and so on. So, firstly, we consider the epic problem case as before, as I said before. So, in that case, we can construct a match solution very easily because that in that case, this Neumann derivative change to Is this Neumann derivative change to the this uh derivative with respect to the x n direction okay because this is about uh the one is measure half space so applying the Fourier transform with respect to the uh n minus one whole space direction then the equation takes the second order ODE and we can solve it very easily and substituting that solution to the boundary condition then we can write Then we can write down, we can get this representation formula for the boundary data. This part that I explained before, this boundary condition, this dynamical boundary condition equivalent to the fractional diffusion equation. Okay, so if we consider the non-linear dynamical boundary condition case, this is equivalent to the non-rinear problem for the fractional differential equation. For the fractional diffusion equation. Of course, in that case, for example, if we consider this the right-hand side is B to the power P or something like that, then we can get the first exponent for this problem very easily because by using the scaring argument and by using the dispersion part and so on. So, applying this relation, we can easily get the boundary data of this problem. Then, Then the solution U of original problem L is that the harmonic extension of this boundary data. And of course, this harmonic extension of this one is equal to this form. This is the conversion of the Poisson kernel with the boundary data. And the semi-group property of the Poisson kernel, this one changes like this form. Okay, this means that the this means that the variable xn and the variable The variable Xn and variable T play the same role in some sense. And we can write down the solution by using the kernel and issue data only. So the Rapper's equation case, we can easy to get the extra formula for the solution. But in this case, we consider the heat equation with a director boundary going on so that we cannot use such an algebra directory, but An argument directory, but if we consider the foreign system, we can use such a technique. The foreign system is that the following. The one is that the inhomogeneous heat equation, the inhomogeneous term is this function. And the equation, the other guy satisfies the Rappras equation. Okay. Okay, the B satisfies the inhomogeneous heat equation and the W satisfies. Equation and the W satisfies the Rappras equation, and B satisfies the zero-truth boundary condition, and the W satisfies the inhomogeneous dynamical boundary condition. And the initial data satisfied for us, then if we consider the V plus W, it is a solution of the original problem because that on the boundary data of V is equal to zero for all time. This means that. All time, this means that v sub t equal to zero. So the uh from this system, uh, combined after combining combination, that we can get the original problem. And each problem have a representative formula for the solution. For example, the W satisfied the Rappress equation with an inhomogeneous boundary condition, inhomogeneous dynamical boundary condition. So we can write down the as follows by using As follows by using the fossil colour, and after that, we can easily calculate the time derivative of this function w. Then, by using the Juish heat kernel for the half space, we can write down the solution V explicitly. So, from this point of view, we consider the following problem. Following problem. The V satisfy the heat equation with some inhomogeneous term, F sub 1 and F sub 2. They are defined as for us. And W satisfies the Ratbar equation. And V and W satisfy the V satisfy the derivatives boundary condition. W satisfy the inhomogeneous dynamical boundary condition. So we can define the solution of our system. The our system as follows. So the initial data phi and the phi b is a measure of function. And so we call that b and w is the solution of the system s at first. Firstly, the v and the w satisfy this regularity. Okay. V and w is a continuous function and also the derivative with respect to the x-l direction. With respect to the x-axis direction is also a continuous function. And V and W satisfy this integral form. Okay. V from the satisfy this heat equation. So the V satisfied this form by using the Discharge heat kernel and the George term and the W satisfied this form. This came from the Poisson kernel and also the Duchess term. We detected the Poisson. We detect the postcard. So, for this, under this definition, we prove the following. The first one is that the global existence and convergence. Okay, if we consider this problem, the special dimension is greater than or equal to two, because that if we consider the one-dimensional case, the boundary data is only the one point, so that this is a completely different situation. Okay, so in that case, we can prove that there exists a unique global time solution of the system S and the. Solution of the system S and this solution is the NFT normal that that solution is bounded. Furthermore, if we cut the Xn direction for any L, then this function V epsilon goes to zero as epsilon tends to zero. And the function W, the solution W minus S T phi V, this is the solution of the Laplace equation with the diagonal boundary condition is going to zero as epsilon. Is go to zero as it generated zero, okay? So, the by from this theorem, the we get the following quality. So, this is that our one of the goal of the A. Okay. So the V epsilon, the W sign is the solution of the S given in the server one. Then the U epsilon is a classical solution of the original problem H and it satisfies U epsilon combines with the S D phi B. Combines the SD5B by this order epsilon to the half, and this order is this rate is optimal. And from this query, we can say that the U is a correct solution of the this Laplace equation with a diagonal boundary condition. Then U epsilon combines the U in L In V T K. This sense is a suitable sense, as I said before, as epsilon goes to zero. Okay. Okay. So that the two I'll try to prove is very, very simple because that I already said that most important thing is that how to define the solution. So after define the solution, in order to prove the existence, we can apply the control mapping theorem related to the function b because b is defined by itself. Defined by his service, not include the W. Okay. So we consider the several space and the several norms and we apply the boundary construction mapping principle in XT, we find the fixed point of this operating. Okay, so the by the usual public technique, we can find the fixed point and we can construct a solution and the global intellect solution. Okay. Okay, so this is one of the key rema of the proof of our theorem. So, most important thing is that if we consider the if we know the linear part for range, range meaning that any measure half space or all ranges, then we only get the boundedness for the F5 norm. But if we cut the xn direction, then we get. Then we can get some order of the zero. So, from this reason, for any L but fixed L, then we can get the combined V combines to zero as epsilon to zero, like this order. So, this is some key point to how to get this order. And the remote two and the remote three is how to control the jar. Control the geometric, but I want to skip here because the Jara almost, maybe I have only four minutes. Okay. So I also want to explain the extra the integral cases. So this case is the different case of the half-space, of course, because that in the half-space case, the domain is unbounded and the boundary also the unbounded case. Case. But exterior of unitable cases, the domain is unbounded, but the boundary is bounded. So the situation is drastically changed. But in this case, omega is exterior of the unit 4. Then we also consider the several steps. So firstly, we consider the Laplace equation case. Then the The let p is a Poisson colour of the unit ball, and by using the Kerbin transform, we can get this function k. Okay, this is a Poisson colour of our problem, omega extra of the integral. And apply the triangle error, we can find this form, okay, k of the e to the power t x and y. This is a fundamental solution of the this. This is a fundamental solution of the this rappress equation with the dynamical boundary condition for the X-ray of a unit ball. So after that, we can define some solution for the linear case as follows and applying the similar technique for the half-space case, we can define the solution for this problem, this system. This system is almost the same. This system is almost the same, but one point omega is not half space, but exterior of the ball. Okay. Then we define the solution. The regularity is almost the same, but this case is number B, also the continuous function. And the V and the driver satisfy this form, but this case is to show heat kernel for the exterior we need to ball and ST5 also the default bottom kernel. Okay, the this. Color okay, the in this case, bottom colour is uh the I already explained before previous pages. Then we can prove the following. Okay, let we consider the n is greater than or equal to 3 and the initial data inside pi satisfies this decay, right? And boundary initial data belongs to this nice space, not only LPT, but also the Only LUVD, but also the C1C cat class. Then we can show that there exists a unique global in-time solution of this system and satisfy the disorder. Okay, so this meaning that for any time t, our solution is bounded in everything. And furthermore, this function b epsilon satisfy this order, epsilon to the power alpha half and the double epsilon combined with SD5B. epsilon combined with SD5B in LF sense by this same order epsilon to the alpha half and here this alpha is equal to one for if the special dimension n equal to three and if the much higher dimensional case this alpha belongs to the one to two okay so the the from the previous server the server two we can get the point for e the u epsilon So u epsilon, this is equal to the v epsilon plus doups is a cross-cut solution, the original problem, and it satisfies that this one. And we remark that we can also prove that there exists some initial function phi such that the solution of the this system or the system with the boundary initial data equal to zero satisfies this one. This means that if we consider the three-dimensional case, this order is equal to the one-half. To the one-half, so this is the same as this order. So, from this point of view, we can get the optimal rate of the convergence and the dimension of four we can choose sufficiently close to the order. Okay, this is our second main result. Finally, I summarized my talk. So, in this talk, we considered relative. We consider relative rate for the heat equation with the diagonal boundary condition and the two cases. One is the half space, the other one is the exterior of the unit ball. Okay, so this diagram diffusion limit meaning that we first consider the heat equation and what happens if we cause the sign go to zero. Of course, the formally this one converges to the disrapper equation, but what sense? And is it correct or not? The answer is correct, and the sense is LFTK over LFT omega. Everything omega okay. So the finally I explained the future work for this direction and for this problem. So the first one is to control the fundamental solution of the heat equation with a diagonal boundary condition and its application for the Northeaster problem. Because that in this case, we separate this original problem to the system. One is that the solution of the heat equation with inhomogeneous time, and the other one is the rapport. Tampa and the other one is a Rapprosi equation with an inhomogeneous diagram control. So, how I don't know how to construct the fundamental solution of the heat equation because in this case, also we call that NFT issue data. So, now we try to construct this fundamental solution. The second one is that Russia diffusion limit for the boundary action. Okay, now that we consider the Russian diffusion limit for the equation, but what happened if we Equation, but what happens if we consider the boundary diffusion limit? This is our second future work. Okay, so I think my talk. Thank you for your kind attention. So thank you, Tatsuki, for the very beautiful talk. So I think there is a little bit of space for a few questions. If there is any. There is any I have one question. Yeah, okay, I'm okay. So hi, that's okay. So my question is, how much do you do you need in this work of the hit kernel? I mean, do you need just estimates on the hit kernel or do you use at some point the explicit? Point the explicit structure, okay. So, the mainly in order to prove the existence part, we only need the estimate for the heat kernel. But of course, in that case, if we consider the other unbounded domain case, the distribution on the boundary is drastically changed. Now, we consider the half-space of the exterior of the unit of ball case. Over you to ball case. So, for example, the half-space case, this boundary coefficient changes like this one. So, this means that the variable x and direction or variable is almost the same, several, but the other domain case, of course, this relation is drastically changed. For example, the x-ray unit ball cases, that effect is e to the power t or something like that. So, the estimate of the heat equation is not so a problem. Not so problem, but the information of the domain of the relation of the boundary condition is very important. This is a problem.
