Okay, so I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me. And happy birthday, Bill, if you're listening. I don't see him, but I guess he's there. But I gave him permission to skip my talk. Actually, the first time I met Bill, I was a second-year graduate student at Brown University. And I'd heard that Bill I'd heard that Bill Cassman from the University of British Columbia would be giving a colloquium on Delene's theory of differential equations. Now, I thought this was great because Delene's stuff is great and differential equations is great. And I was really looking forward to this. And in fact, I had graduated from UBC a few years earlier. And I know that Bill Cassman was not a faculty member at the time, but people there were very excited about hiring this new brilliant mathematician. New brilliant mathematician, and so I guess this was probably the person they were talking about. And so I arrived bright and early and sat in the front row. And Bill walked in and dropped his rucksack on the table in front and said, well, I was going to talk about De Lean's theory of differential equations today, but I didn't get a chance to prepare it. So I'll talk about Eisenstein's theories instead. And he proceeded to give the worst lecture I'd ever heard at the time. At the time. But then I later learned that he had become part of an event, perhaps unique in the history of mathematics, of awesome scope and complexity and depth. And I developed a tremendous respect for him and the people working in that area. And in fact, we learned that from the From the uh, uh, we were summoned by the disciples of Language were summoned to take up the double-bitted axe and the cross-cut saw and hope that their muscles are equal to them. And in fact, um that's what they did. Um, so you can see these people um all working away at um where are you, Goriski? You're there, you're second from the left. You're there, you're second from the left. No, where are you? Oh, no, I'm not in that. These, these people are all, you know, quite a bit older than me, actually. But through the years, Castle and I got to know each other quite well, and I'm happy to say he's become one of my closest friends. And that's why I feel I boot kid him from time to time. So, so today I'm going to talk about About something we're with, which is giant work with Yung Sheng Tai. It hasn't progressed much since I've talked about it before, and it's published in these two papers in the Pacific Journal of Mathematics. So if G is GSP2N, a symplectic group, then you can form G of the adequates over Q, mod GQ, mod Kf, which is a compact. Kf, which is a compact open subgroup of the finite of Del's times K infinity. It's a standard construction of a Shimura variety. So this is the complex points of the Ziegel modular variety, and it parametrizes principally polarized abelian varieties with a level structure that depends on this Kf. Now I want to do the same thing with a different group. Let D be negative, square free. Be negative, square free, and let E be q of square root of d, a quadratic imaginary number field, and take for the group H, restriction of scalars, E over Q of G L two, and then form the same quotient, H of the Adels of Q, mod HQ, mod a compact open subgroup with a finite Adels and the appropriate group at infinity. Now, Now, if D was positive, this would be a Hilbert modular variety, another Shimura variety, and it would parametriz abelian varieties, principally polarized abelian varieties with real multiplication. And there's an action of the integers in the field E, or maybe an order in E. But D is negative. D is negative. So you might guess that this is an algebraic variety parametrizing a billion varieties with action of the integers in this quadratic imaginary number field. But that's wrong. It's not even an algebraic variety. It's actually three-dimensional. So this set Y is diffeomorphic to a finite union. To a finite union of hyperbolic three-manifolds, arithmetic hyperbolic three manifolds, hyperbolic three-space divided by a group which is commensurable with SL2 of the integers in E. Nevertheless, it's trying to be an algebraic variety. Modular forms on this space are associated with Gamel representations by By old work of Taylor and more recently, Schultz and Piriani. And it parametrizes a certain type of abelian variety. So let me just say why. Given D less than zero, there's an involution, I'll call it tau D, on the symplectic group. It preserves SP for R, and the fixed points under this involution is SL. This involution is SL2C. It preserves SP4Z in the fixed points under this involution is SL2 of the ring of integers. It passes to an involution on the Ziegl space of order two, and the fixed point set is the hyperbolic space of dimension three. And so it passes to an involution on this Ziegler modular variety. Ziegler modular variety and the fixed point set is a union of these associated locally symmetric spaces for the group H as I mentioned. The union, by the way, it's not, the reason there's a union there has to do with the Galois cohomology, so non-abelian cohomology of that involution acting on the finite on this Kf. Anyway, it doesn't matter. There's a finite collection of copies of these hyperbolic. Copies of these hyperbolic three manifolds. So this hyperbolic three manifold, in other words, sits inside the Ziegel modular variety. And so we can ask which abelian varieties lie over it? Which abelian varieties lie over the fixed point set of this involution? And here's the answer. The space fixed point space, which is this union of hyperbole three manifolds, is a coarse moduli space. Is a coarse moduli space for principally polarized abelian surfaces, meaning two-dimensional varieties, with level structure and anti-holomorphic multiplication by the ring of integers or by an order, depending upon what k is. What does that mean, anti-holomorphic? It means that in this ring of integers, you have the usual integers, but you also have purely. Integers, but you also have purely imaginary elements like root D. And the square root of D acts anti-holomorphically on A. And also the syntactic form from the polarization has the property that omega root dx root dy equals d times omega xy, remembering that d is negative. So these hyperbolic three manifolds actually parametrize a billion varieties with anti-holomorphic. With anti-holomorphic multiplication. They're not algebraic varieties, but they sure look like it. There's a similar story with real structures. So let me just say what that is. There's another involution, tau zero, on the syntlectic group with the same story. With the same story. It acts on SP2NR and the fixed points are GLNR. It acts on SP2Z, the fixed points are GLNZ. It acts on Ziegler space, and the fixed point set is the symmetric space for the general linear group, positive definite symmetric matrices. So it acts on the Ziegler modular variety, and the fixed point set is a finite union of GLN locally symmetric spaces. For n greater than 2. For n greater than 2, these are not algebraic again. But again, since they are a subset of the single modular variety, we can ask which abelian varieties sit over these. And the answer is the fixed point set of the Ziegel modular variety under this involution is a union of these GLN locally symmetric spaces. It's a coarse modularized space for principally polarized abelian varieties. For principally polarized abelian varieties with anti-holomorphic involution. In this case, it's not an action by OD, but it's just an involution. It square is the identity rather than its square being D, which is negative. So that means, in other words, real abelian varieties. So real abelian varieties are parametrized by these GLN local symmetric space. This was known already to Shimura. This was known already to Shimura, and there are other, quite a number of articles by various people trying to make this rigorous. But it's another example of a non-algebraic space that parametrizes abelian varieties and for which modular forms are associated to Galois representations. So, my question is: well, how far does this go? Question: Is well, how far does this go? Um, can you reduce these things modulo p? Does it even make sense? Well, oh, so by the way, what does complex anti-linear mean? The abelian variety A is Cn modulo lattice, so it's an evolution from Cn to Cn, which is which is anti-linear and preserves the lattice. Okay, the Zeglomogena variety has good reduction at various points. Variety has good reduction at various primes. And those reductions parametrize principally polarized above varieties over the finite field. So we could ask what happens. Sorry, and Kotwitz counted the number of abelian varieties. So there's this famous counting formula of Kotwitz. I won't go through it, but we'll come back to it later. There's a sum over conjugacy class. Conjugacy classes, G of stable conjugacy classes in GQ, some over conjugacy classes in the Adels and G of the bit vectors, a certain volume, a certain constant, and an orbital integral away from P and a twisted orbital integral at P. And I had to say this because this conference is about orbital integrals, so there they are. So now So now I ask: what happens to the subset when we reduce mod P? What happens to these abelian varieties? Do we get abelian varieties over the finite field with anti-holomorphic multiplication or with anti-holomorphic involution? Well, what is anti-holomorphic? It doesn't make sense. So I'm going on a limb here, and I admit that the limb is getting thinner and thinner. It may break, but I want to say that in some cases, we may be able to make sense of an anti-holomorphic involution of an abelian variety over a finite field. So let's go back and take an example. Let's go back and take an example. Suppose I have a simple Boolean variety with complex multiplication, say by some order or integers in a number field, and good reduction over FQ. So on the complex side, you have the abelian variety and you have complex conjugation. On the reduction mod P, you have the Frobenius. And normally these have no relation to each other, but in fact, for a CM variety, the Frobenius has a lift. Frobenius has a lift to an endomorphism of the complex abelian variety. It lifts to an element pi in the endomorphism of A. And the endomorphism group of A, if A is simple, is just a CM field. In general, it's a CM algebra or a CM field. And this element pi, the lift, is a vague Q number. Pi times pi bar equals Q, which is the order of the field we're reducing to for every embedding of Q. For every embedding of q pi into c but that means that pi bar, the conjugate of pi, the conjugate of the of the Frobenius, is q pi inverse, which is a lift of the Fershibum on A bar, on the reduction. So this means that complex conjugation on the reduction, A bar, if it is to make sense, must switch the Frobenius and the Fershivum. And the Thirshivu. Well, now this is total nonsense because no morphism will ever do that. Morphisms always preserve the Frobenius. So we now have to ask, does there exist a natural enlargement of the category of abelian varieties over FQ in which there are new morphisms, including morphisms that exchange the verbane. Morphisms that exchange the Frobenius with the Freshibo? And if so, is there a moduli scheme or something like that of any varieties over FQ with complex conjugation or with anti-holomorphic multiplication? Well, at this point, I'd say for Q2, the question too, the branch I'm standing on probably broke. But for Q1, there is something to say. For ordinary abelian varieties, there's a good answer. Of abelian varieties, there's a good answer to this question. How to enlarge the category of abelian varieties to include morphisms that include morphisms that exchange the Frobenius and the Forsheba, which is going to be the analog of complex conjugation over a finite field for ordinary Believ varieties. So recall, A is an ordinary Belian variety of dimension n if the p-tarsion points are Targent points are Z1 p to the n. And this holds if and only if the characteristic polynomial is an ordinary vague cube polynomial, meaning that its middle coefficient is not divisible by p. And Delene proved there's an equivalence of categories between ordinary abelian varieties over FQ of rank N and the category of Deline modules, TF. He associates to every abelian variety a Delene module, T A and F. module TA and FA. So here TA is a free Belian group of dimension 2n, which you should think of as the integer homology of the abelian variety of a complex abelian variety. And F is an endomorphism whose characteristic polynomial is an ordinary VQ polynomial. In other words, the roots are all Bay Q numbers and the middle coefficient is not divisible by Q. Middle coefficient is not divisible by Q. And also, there should exist another endomorphism V, such that F V equals V F equals Q. So this is a beautiful category. It's a totally linear algebra category. And Deline's theorem is that it's equivalent to the category of ordinary Belian varieties. And to construct this equivalence, he has to embed the To embed the bit vectors into the complex numbers, there's many choices of equivalence, but once you've made this choice, everything else is natural. Everett Howe amplified this by adding what happens to a polarization. A polarization corresponds to a non-degenerate syntactic form on this Deline module such that. module such that omega of Txy equals omega xvy and R of XY equals omega X comma iota y is symmetric and positive definite. And here iota is a particular element which takes some effort to define. So I'm just going to skip it. I'm going to say you can make polarizations work in this picture as well. Well in this picture every morphism of every morphism of Deline modules has to take F to F prime, but we can consider marginal morphisms, any homomorphisms from T to T prime. And this gives us a natural enlargement of the category of morphisms in the case of ordinary abelian varieties. Let us say that a real structure on a polarized lead module, Tf omega, is an involution tau from T to T so that tau F tau inverse equals V. equals v and omega tau x tau y equals minus omega of x y. And the same thing for multiplication. An anti-homomorphic multiplication by this ring of integers in this quadratic imaginary number field E is a homomorphism from OD to the endomorphisms of T such that root D composed with F equals V composed with root D. In other words, root D acts as complex conjugation. Conjugation. So that's the definition. First remark is that in the case of a real structure on TF omega, you get involutions on the Tate modules and an involution on the Juda Nay module with switch F and V. The construction involution on the Juda Name module takes a lot of work and takes another further universal choice, which I won't go into. It's described in this papers with Papers with Yung Sheng Tai that we published. But you get involutions on the Tate and Judona modules. And the same thing for anti-holomorphic multiplication. Anti-holomorphic multiplication gives you an action of OD on the tate and Judone modules, which such that root D switches F and V. And so here's the theorem, which is in these papers. There are finitely many isomorphism classes of Classes of rank 2n principally polarized Deline modules with real structure, with this involution tau and principal level n structure. And the number is given by a Kautwitz-like formula, but everywhere in Cautowitz's formula, you replace the symplectic group with the general linear group. So, of course, Cawis's formula, the point is to try to link up with the tracer. To try to link up with the trace formula. So this gives you some potentially geometric object which might have something to do with the trace formula for a GLN. I mean, I'm talking about wild speculation here, but this formula is there. We proved the formula for Dale modules. And it's a similar similarity. And it's similarly with anti-holomorphic multiplication. There are finally many isomorphism classes of principally polarized lean modules of rank four with level n structure and anti-holomorphic multiplication by OD. And the number is given by a Cautwis-like formula by replacing the symplectic group with this group restriction of scalars from E over Q of G L2. And so you can write down the formula and it's a beautiful. You can write down the formula, and it's a beautiful formula. I don't have time to explain it, but let me just talk about the very first sum in that formula because every step in this formula is fun. Let me just talk about the first step. The first sum in Kotwitz formula is a sum over Q-bar isogeny classes of polarized abelian varieties. Cotwitz proves that the Q-bar isogeny classes. proves that the Q bar isogeny classes of polarized abelian varieties correspond to Q bar, correspond to Q isogeny classes of abelian varieties without polarization. And by Honda Tate, that corresponds to Q bar conjugacy classes of elements gamma zero in the symplectic group that are semi-simple and real elliptic and whose characteristic polynomial is a Bay Q polynomial. That's the first. Q polynomial. That's the first sum in Cotwood's formula. I'll just say it again: Q bar conjugacy classes of semi-simple elements, and that sum is counting Q-bar isogeny classes of polarized abelian varieties. So in our formula, we have a similar thing. We count Q-bar isogeny classes of real polarized deline modules. These These correspond to Q conjugacy classes of elements A in GLNQ with the following properties. A is real elliptic, semi-simple. It's characteristic. Polynomial is totally real, meaning that the roots are totally real. And ordinary, meaning that p does not divide the constant term. And also the absolute value is less than root 2. Is less than root two. I know I got worried it might be two root two. Anyway, I always get mixed up with this factor of two. It could be just root two. So the first term is the sum over conjugacy classes, just as in Kotwitt's case, but it's Q conjugacy, not Q bar conjugacy. On the other hand, in GLN, Q conjugacy and cube R conjugacy are the same. Conjugacy Stable consciously and unstable consciency are the same for GLN. So the first terms look like they should, except that now the characteristic polynomial is a totally real polynomial. The matrix is what you might call a totally real matrix. Its eigenvalues are totally real. So the rest of the formula goes the same way. The sums are. The same way. The sums are interesting. The orbital integrals become orbital integrals over the general linear group. Everything seems to fit. So my question is, oh, I forgot to say, in the case of anti-holomorphic multiplication, there's a further restriction. There's a further restriction on the characteristic polynomial of Robanius. So back here, this characteristic polynomial B is the polynomial of somehow, in some sense, the real part of the abelian variety that you're looking at. We have, I'm thinking, I mean, I'm thinking sort of philosophically, we have a Have a sub-moduli space consisting of points that have real structure inside the moduli space of a billion varieties. So one of these points both has sort of a real part, the fixed points under the real involution, and also has the whole abelian variety over the finite field, which has itself. Which has itself a usual characteristic polynomial. So the characteristic polynomial for Banius has degree 2n, and you get this real part from it because by a simple procedure, these roots beta. So for the full abelian variety, the roots come in complex conjugate pairs. If you add the root, If you add the root plus its conjugate, you get a real root, and that's the betas. So there's a way of constructing a real polynomial from a characteristic polynomial for radius, which you just add the roots and their complex conjugates together to get the new roots. Okay. So in the case of a real structure, Real structure, every isogeny class has real points in it, has these so-called real points in it. At least every ordinary isogeny class has these ordinary real points in it. In the case of anti-holomorphic multiplications, that's not true. Some isogeny classes do not admit anti-holomorphic, some ordinary isogeny classes do not admit anti-holomorphic multiplication. Do not admit anti-holomorphic multiplication. Anyway, I'm just saying there are many interesting aspects to this formula, which I don't have time to discuss, but it makes me think that there's really something honest here. So that's why I asked the question, is this total nonsense? Well, if it's not nonsense, these constructions should extend to all abelian varieties. I'm only saying I know what to do for ordinary abelian varieties. I know what to do for ordinary abetted varieties. What do we do for the supersingular elliptic curves, for example? My guess is that a real structure on a general abelian variety is a collection of involutions. Tau L, involutions of the Tate modules at L, tau P, involutions of the Dulanay module, which exchange the Frobenius and Vershebung, but with some kind of compatibility condition. Of compatibility condition. And I'm not sure what is the right compatibility condition. In Kotwitz's formula, there's a compatibility condition, which is the Kotwitz invariant has to vanish. And that invariant has contributions at L and at P. And the contribution at L is pretty easy to understand. It's just Galois cohomology. The contribution at P, I don't. The contribution at P, I don't completely understand it. I think there should be a similar COTWIS-type invariant for involutions and a similar Cotwest type invariant for anti-holomorphic multiplication. And then if that invariant vanishes, then this collection of involutions on the Tatant modules should then correspond to what you might call an abelian variety with. Variety with real structure. So that's my dream that it should be possible to make sense of this in the general case. And to be honest, I'm stuck. I don't quite understand the contribution at P to Cotwitz invariant. And I had some other. And I had some other ideas of the compatibility conditions, but they're not strong enough. I think it's got to be something like this. So at this point, I probably really walked out on a limb. And so I better stop there. But I have to say that this formula is really fun. And so it's discussed in that paper. And I'd like to end just by saying happy birthday, Bill. Saying a happy birthday, Bill.
