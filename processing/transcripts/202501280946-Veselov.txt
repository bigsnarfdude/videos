So it's a planner object. It's a really two-dimensional map where countries which are domain labeled by originally it was lex vectors which are vectors up to sine and vertices were super basis. But equivalently we can label them by We can label them by rational and some as a fairy method, right? And this is fairy tree, but I would call it convey fairy because we use a convey double. Convey used to describe the values of binary quadratic form, but it can be used for multiple. But it can be used for Markov numbers. I think it was Ralojek who first used this, but anyway, so Canvey was clearly quite proud of this. He said that everything that was a lectures given to undergraduates, I think, and he said that everything is known except topography from the lecture one is new, right? We should take it seriously. I mean, he was aware of all this. Aware of who this thing. Anyway, it's a little thing, it's a little difference because triples now are located at the vertices, but actually, people are living here. Anyway, so that's why I'm using usually convey just to you. Now, this is springboard menu. So, this is Markov fraction tree. You just replace fairy tree by replacing series. By replacing simply fair immediate by springboard medium. I would call it springboard medium. And this is in the non-reduced. In reduced form, it has this. So these are now integers which are copy. So this is the thing. But the mediant is written here, and I never saw this. I mean, if you've seen this before, so I'd like to call it springboard medium for obvious reasons, because I don't know. And so, in this way, if we just hear, we can see all this is the way Conway described values of binary quadratic form. So, we describe in the same way mark of fraction as fraction on the tree. But it's actually not the whole fraction because it's, I put it one how he is even here, but it's between all mark of fraction between. Between all marker fraction between zero and one half, zero and one half, right? And so and if you want to extend it, so this is I called Markov fraction reduced set, zero, one half. The whole set is just plus minus plus integer, which is orbit of integer of ungroup, which is integer of ungroup, which is okay, so this is the function mu. I'd like to come back to this function mu maybe at the end, because I think it's a very interesting function. And this is the thing, it's a kind of conjugation between fairy mediant and single median. So this is the thing. Okay, but the Markov triples, this is description. This is description, as I said, which I learned from Valodia folk in the 90s. But anyway, so this is quite natural and use Markov triples living at the and there you can't see it's part of the whole convey topograph where you can't see you you can you don't see singular triples one one one and one one two so one two five So one, two, five, and one is. So this is a c a very uh con convenient way to label triples. You don't have to read to write down every triple. You just look at the three numbers living next to the thing, and that's that's it. This is quite well known way. So this is the thing, I mean the lemma. I mean, the lemma from Springborn is that if you consider Markov fraction, this is fine relation. In fact, there are two definitions of Markov fractions in Boris's paper, and he prefers something like this, but defining Markov triples. It's like Markov number. You can define Markov number as part of Markov triple, but in this way, you can define Markov numbers. Markov numbers are all. Markov numbers. Markov numbers are all numbers which you can get from here by the other, right? So this is the thing. I would prefer for the Markov fraction, one Markov fraction. But more natural actually, probably from many points of view, is they all naturally pattern Markov titles, right? Boris actually, you started with this definition, but then saying that it's probably not quite right to start with. Probably not quite right to start with this definition, starting with people. So, anyway, so this is the definition that is predicted. But it's a very easy lemma to deduce this by induction. Simply following the rule, you derive it. And there are some beauties in this thing. So, the fractions which are here are ratios. Here are ratios of consecutive Fibonacci, Fibonacci branch. It's the same, of course. Yeah, I forgot to say that denominators are Markov minus. So additional information, which is extremely important for algebraic geometry, it's exactly a first-channel class, is numerator, right? Denominator we all knew. So it was known that denominators are even Fibonacci numbers, but numerators are... But numerators are actually ratios. But this is quite the natural Fiber Nachi branch. And this is Perl branch, which is similar. It's related to Perl equation with 2. And these are the list of these. And if you define y like this, then this is the ratio of y to k to y to k plus 1. And that would be the The where is it? It's around one half. Sorry. So, did I say something wrong here? The manager branch is right and V is switched to one half. Anyway, so this is other otherwise it's some numbers. It's some numbers, right? Markov numbers, which is now to algebraic joint. So, exceptional vector bundles, I think they were started about 1980s, the beginning of 1980s, and Grésé and Lepotier. And then it was attracted attention of Moscow school of algebraic geometry and many. Of algebraic geometry, and many work has been done in Moscow after that. So, if you have, so E will be algebraic vector bundle and it's natural to fix topological data first before classifying modular space. And the topological data are ranked in two chain classes. Now, churn classes in principle. But it's homology classes, but because H2 and H4 are Z, we can consider them as integers. So slope is the ratio of C1 and R. And why this ratio is natural in a way, rank is additive and C1 is also additive for this. Maybe this is. But to be honest, in this definition, I try to understand why it's natural, but it's probably stability condition, which goes back to original walk of. Original work of Manford is not, I don't know, intuitive to be honest. So, stability means that for any proper subshift, we have inequality for the slopes. It's called slope stability sometimes, right? Why is this stability in the sense of Mamfort? You know, stability needed if you want to create. Need that if you want to create a good movie space, so it's natural from this point of view, geometrically is less, it's not intuitive, but rigidity is expressed by the condition, homological condition, that x1 is 0, which means that it's rigid. So, if you consider if it's stable and rigid, then the corresponding modular space is just point. It's an ideal situation. Just point. It's ideal situation. The simplest one, right? Simplest model in this case, you can pay one. And there is a more general definition which is not requiring stability. Stability is, if you like, homological definition. This is definition in a more general situation of what is exceptional vector bundle. vector bundle. And as I said, Rizier and Repatière started this story and they proved that exceptional vector bundles are uniquely determined by the slope. If you know the slope. So all you have to know is C1 and R and then C2 can be computed. So and this is basically uniqueness because if you can compute by Riemann raw, you compute and then you can derive this. Derive this. I will show the formula maybe a day, which I mentioned yesterday, for C two. And so C two can be computed already from the slope. So the main default question is to describe all possible slopes, right? It's a great question about rational numbers. And the Trésien Trepatier described the set of The set of all exceptional slopes, let's call it exceptional slopes, as image of some special function, which I like to call the Rizier de Patière function. And it has this natural property undefined, zetafine, but it has quite non-symmetric and it's a kind of technical formula, but you will see that it. Formula, but you will see that it can be simplified, and that's that's the thing. So, this is the the thing I I started with. Maybe maybe I should I should I started reading Rudakov and Rudakov, we sure will be built up in Brazil and here. And Rudakov is saying there is a lot of things that can be extracted from Rudakov, there are a lot of calculations, and he in particular. And he, in particular, claimed that ranks of exceptional electron bundles on P2 are Markov numbers. As Peter Sarnak mentioned yesterday, I think this was a conjecture by Tube. So basically, this is the explanation. So this is equal to that. Now, left-hand side is not symmetric, but you have to, under this assumption, for Markov, neighborhood numbers, you have this. this this is easy. I I will skip this. So the proof is actually easy. Everything was prepared by by Tresse Patière Laprov and Springboard, right? So I simply identify two objects from from this paper. Yes. And conversely, all Markov numbers appear. Numbers appear. Yes. So let me mention this unicity conjecture. This I think is quite, I don't know, I think it's a very nice reformulation of unicity conjecture. Unicity conjecture, so let me unicity conjecture is that where is this? Yeah, Markov takes Markov. Markov unique unique ejection means that every Markov number did on this is only once. Right? I mean this is and Springborne reformulation is that every Markov fraction once, which I think is much more stronger, right? I mean it's probably easier to go because it's not only denominator. Because it's not only denominator, the fact that denominators appear only once is Marlesianistic conjecture. And Swingborn, the formulation is that 1229 can appear only once, right? I mean, yes, it appears only once as a fraction because of this uh increasingness of the math from view over Q to the Markov fraction. The conjecture is that twenty nine appears in the denominator of only one Markov fraction. only one mark up fractional feature. 12 over 29 can only appear there and there, because the map from u over q to fractions is increasing. Just a second. Just a second. Is it true? I I agree. I agree with what you're saying. Maybe we need some sound. All the microconnections between zero there's only one for each denominator only one for each denominate If you fix the denominator then you know the numerator it's the same thing as we were saying yesterday Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I wanted to say something on yes. Just a second. I have to think about this, maybe. Yes, indeed. So let me describe something to. Right, right, right. Exactly, right. It's it's uh I wrongly formulate the Springboard conjecture thing, of course, for you, Q, right, right, right. So Right, right, right. Sorry. Then it's probably similar flavor, right? But anyway, and modular this, it means that every exceptional bundle is determined by its run. And this is what I try to explain, because it's known that a first child class satisfying this. The first chain class satisfying this. Well, view is run, and this is first-chain class, and for exceptional terms we have this, but it's also, and then so we have so if Q is prime, then P is uniquely defined defined uniquely defined by by by by view, right? View, right? And this means that unique conjecture in this case is true, and this is indeed proved already by Arthur. So I was playing with this a little bit, trying to characterize this P, right? It's a particular solution, but there are many solutions for composite Um uh Markov numbers which are uh almost uh the the the the the most uh tribes are zero case according to uh uh Burgundian Gambert and uh Sartnak. So it's most of the cases are still Most of the cases are still open here. A little bit about so, but my point is the following: basically, everything we know about Markov numbers can be, we know that, can be reformulated from a spectrum. The same true for algebraic objects. So, and it's interesting that topological data, so P Markov numbers which appeared in colour. Markov numbers which appeared in castles in treatment of before, actually, implicitly, it was appeared before, boys. But you can see it here also, right? I mean, for example, if you want to find C2, which is second charge plus, then the formula is this: you have to find S, which is exactly the solution of this, so it's indivisible, so it's integer, and Q is corresponding round. So here you're taking an exceptional bundle. Suppose you had taken just a bundle, not necessarily exceptional, because we don't understand what this stability means. And is it still characterized by C1 and C2? Any bundle, is it characterized by the first two transcripts? No. So it's not true that you see one thing. You have to fix. Yeah, then you have modular spaces. Exceptional bundles, you have modular spaces, you have modular spaces of such bundles. Which is normally very complicated. So exceptional bundle is the case when modular space consists of one point. Exceptional bundle is so. And I'm saying x of E equals 0, that's not enough. You need stability. You need the stability. Stability. You need a stability. Stability can be get rid of if you assume all x. X1 0 is rigidity. You have to ask all x to be 0. Then you don't need stability. I'm wondering if you could get other rational numbers than Markov numbers as your slopes for other bundles. But then in that case, there will be... I was thinking about this and asked people. Thinking about this and ask people who know much more about this, it doesn't look like it. Looks like it's sorry about Markov numbers, not even about Markov companion of Markov numbers. It's natural to look for maybe companion P somewhere also. Maybe, I don't know. And also Markov binary quadratic form, you know, to write it down, you need this is S and this is P. Right? So it's written in this. In this, in the classical theory, it is also quite natural, all this. But what I want to say is that T is structured class here, and Q is structured class. So now, exceptional bundles on Del Pezza surfaces. This is another interesting natural question, and it was started by Rodakov, his student, and Ponychov, and Arlov, and Karpov-Nakin. So, this is what. Of 19, so this is most school around Chofarieri seminar in the 80s. They started this, and I think it's so this, so it's interesting to look at maybe Diefantine equation, which should be here. So this is what was said, 1, 1, 2, 4. This is, but in general, it's simple. The question is, what is exceptional? The question is: what is exceptional slopes? You have to define exceptional slopes because here H2 is not. That you have to choose paleization. Anyway, I don't know much about this, but I think there are some references. Now, let me mention just what Dylan asked, I think, about this function, right? Which I think is a very interesting question. Exactly the thing. Question, exactly the thing. Let's consider this new map. And you asked about in Willows, right? So this is, I think it's interesting to start map, just map itself. So we have two maps. We have Drésen Patière map, which is the attic, using the attic, and Springboard more, which is using Ferry, right? It's neighboring the attic, and this is And this is Springboard Median, as I have shown, the original this is. And it's very interesting to study basically this function. I think it's a kind of new interesting function. At some point, we should collect this special function which are not differentiable, maybe not even this one, even not even. It's not continuous even because, and this is what Boris showed: that look at the jump at every and jump is this is Lagrange number corresponding to this, right? It's beautiful, so this is kind of thing, and I would expect nice property here, and I would compare the situation with Ninkowski question mark function, which was studied and quite interesting. This Hog function, which In this hog function, which actually Alfonso will be talking about related to Markov numbers and stable norm. You know, there was a lot of discussion about stable norm yesterday and about history, as Peter asked. I think it goes back to indeed to Gromov and Federer in full generality, right? But in the concrete situation, it was Falk and at the same time MacShane and Ryan. So it's quite an interesting object, and this is kind of similar. So they are related, but the relation is complicated and they have different, I would say, not analytic, but peculiar properties. That's it. So this is just references. Markov, there is a repatier. This is the thing of the paper of Bolus. Bogus second of fifty pages long paper about rational numbers. That's my contribution to this. Questions for Sergeant Carr? Yeah, so you have, there's one slide where you took Markov fraction that was the denominator is like 37,000, and then there's 15,000 things. And then there's 15,000 pages. You can go back to that slide. I wanted to show you some big mark of fraction and solutions. So the 15,000 ones show up here as the numerator for fraction. What are those other two solutions corresponding? No clue. No clue. No geometric interpretation. That's the thing. There is only one. Yes. You can think of them as geodesic arcs on the model. Geodesic arcs on the modular torus that go through a large cross point. So they're. So do you take the take again? So the fact that the numerator is square is minus one by the denominator, and it means that this geodesic projects on the modular surface to a geodesic both hands out the cusp that goes through a Weierstrass problem. So it's preserved by the hyper elliptic, by the elliptic evolution. But it's not simple, because it's not level. It has self-intersections, but it's It has self-intersections, but it's for both. Okay. So if we're just that the other one does correspond something, it is symbol. And is there any information of like how many intersections it has with itself then that you could get comparing sizes? That's a great question. The answer is I don't know. But you know can say something geometric. Sorry. The gaps that's that are on the right-hand board there. That are on the right-hand board there from Springboard's talk. Those are, I think of them as mixing gaps, that they're gaps around the cusp that are cut out every time you find a simple arc. So because of the gaps, you can start Xing out where the fractions can lie. So, for instance, the first one is like the fraction has to be bigger than, I can't remember what it's thinking about the golden ratio divided by 2 something, something. So, for instance, 2337 divided by 37666. Divided by 37.666 is too small. It lies in a McSchain gap. It can't be simple. That's hard to turn into more data as we put army tree. But it's not companion by chance. No, the companions don't have Markov names. No, don't have Markov NAND. So you won't recognize this at all, right? So the hope was to. At all, right? So so the hope was to do something like this and exclude all the other solutions from being Markov fractions, but I don't know if there's a change in such case. Do we know at least what the continuum fraction looks like for these values? I didn't look at this, right? Because then we could draw the path in this hexagonal tree and see, I mean, this diagonal path and see if it stays. They can just straight computer anyway. Yeah, but you can see maybe they are simple, like in the path, or maybe they are almost straight, or maybe not at all. I played with this a day or so. I had some conjecture which I throw in myself. So I yes. Yes. So, um on your slide where you started talking about tension funnels and people close to people different um Markov-like equation is called a Rosenberger variation. Um there so you had actually both of those were Rosenberger variations. Rosenberger showed that they were only the Markov equations or uh yeah, I mean Yeah, I mean this at two it's P1 cross P1 and this is in thick I I think X3 it's P2 blowing up at three points. Do you know if there's something that brings up the other equations? I can show you the list, the full list of all the pairs. And maybe you would recognize all of them as some but I was talking about these But I was talking about these yeah, the the equations? Yeah. What's it what's the meaning of this? It's it's a quadratic form with integer solutions and the get in solutions to preserve integers. Ah, but that's too general. That's too general. That's too general, right? Yeah, I know that there's only a handful of them. Oh, only a handful. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Let's look at. Let's look at this list. I have the list of from Kharkov and Nagin have a full list of their managers. And yeah, the beauty of this thing is that all mutations have geometric meaning. They realize it by they lift it to mutation of vector bundles. Kind of nice thing. So this is genuinely, there is algebra geometric way. Geometric way to look at this, which is nice. It fits very well. And that's observation with Markov fractions shows that there is a lot of here. Does the algebra, geometric point of view give you new insight on the mark of numbers, for instance, by taking tensors of bundles or things like that? Or things like that, I think. No, this is the thing. I mean, I thought that. Because in the end, otherwise it's just a connection, so anything you don't extract any data from the conclusion. So it looks like this is number three problem, right? Which is I've heard the talk by Griffiths why Hodge conjecture is complicated. Why Hoch conjecture is complicated. Right? Very, very hard, something like this. And the point was because it's reduced to the number theoretic question. It's a topological question, but it's reduced to number theories in question. And then algebra geometers said that that's too fast, very true to us. So this is so somehow there is this uh n number theory has this reputation for notoriously difficult question, right? Difficult question, which may be not the case in this case. Maybe they can contribute. You never know. So I hope that maybe this reformulation will bring attention also of algebraic jobs. I wanted to tell, of course, to number theories that that is this particular. So we have a coffee break now. The next call is going to be a thing for
