Okay, thank you. And Cheng Hong will talk about sticky particle cocker smell dynamics and the entropic selection principle for the Euler alignment system. Please. Okay. Thank you, Alina. So I would like to thank all the organizers for the kind invitation. Well, it's a shame that they cannot actually come on site. Actually, come on site, but so far, I very much enjoy all the talks here. So, today I'm trying to talk about the OLA alignment system. So, this is a joint work with Trevor Leslie, who's in University of Southern California. So, let me start with the swarming. So, basically, we're talking about models in collective dynamics. Dynamics, which is widely observed in biological, large biological systems. And basically, the idea is trying to model, use the local interaction, then somehow it emerges to some global structure. So one can start with this agent-based models with this Newton's law, where the force is the interaction force. Where the force is the interaction force, so which makes everything to be connected to each other, where there are different types of interactions one can consider. Here today, I'm going to focus on the alignment interactions. And in particular, there is this celebrated Cooker-Smell model, which basically the interaction is alignment interaction, which says that my velocity is going to be my line. My velocity is going to be aligned by yours with some strengths or communication protocol, which is usually a decreasing function, depends on the distance between the two particles. So this is kind of a pairwise interactions. Well, there are other models, but many of these models exhibit this very nice blocking behavior, so that it's asymptotic behavior where basically the group of animals. Basically, the group of animals stays in a flock, in non-time behavior, and they are traveling in a same asymptotic velocity. And this flocking phenomenon has been observed, say, has been proved so-called unconditional flocking if the interaction communication protocol has a so-called heavy tail, so that basically no matter what initial configuration you start with. You start with, you always end up with this blocking phenomenon. Okay, so these are the agent-based models. And starting from the agent-based model, there is this multi-scale mathematical framework. In particular, the kinetic equations play that important roles to connect the microscopic words with the macroscopic scale. Well, so today I'm going to basically focus on the macroscopic equation. The macroscopic equation, which is so-called the Euler alignment system. So it's basically a compressible Euler equation to the left-hand side. And then here are two ingredients. One is there is kind of the pressure and another one is this alignment interaction, which comes from these local interactions. So I'm trying to make comments on both of these aspects. So first of all, These aspects. So, first of all, the pressure. Well, basically, there are different kinds of pressure can be derived there. Well, it depends on what type of hydrodynamic limits you're going to go with, starting from the kinetic representation. Well, for instance, you can take some answers to close this system. For instance, if you take the monokinetic answer, you get the pressureless system. And if you take these Gaussian or this isothermal answer, Egausion or these isothermal acids in the kinetic level, and then the corresponding pressure is going to be the isothermal pressure. Well, there are in terms of the Hooker-Smell type interactions, there are rigorous work has been done for these cases. Well, just for today's talk, I'm only going to focus on the pressureless case. So. So, okay, so next thing is about this alignment interaction. Basically, it is these non-local interactions which kind of drives us to this flocking and alignment phenomenon. So again, so this is the operator in the macroscopic level, which more or less echoes what the Cooker's Mail model is saying. So it's like my velocity. So it's like my velocity. Now it's a macroscopic velocity, is aligned by your velocity with the strengths, which depends on the distance between you and me. So this is the kind of the macroscopic representation of these alignment interactions. So what do we expect about these alignment interactions? Well, so first, if we have a regular communication, say the Communication, say DeFi is just bonded, then basically, what we would expect is that there is a damping phenomenon. So it's very one easy since you can see it is when you simply take this file as just identically once, this is so-called all-to-all coupling. Then this guy is going to actually becomes a local parameter where this M1 is the momentum and M0 is the total mass. Both of them are conserved. The total mass, both of them are conserved in time, so they are just constant. So at the end, this operator is actually just a linear damping term. And in general, if you have a general regular communication, you will expect that there is called a non-local damping effect, and then the result is actually known as a so-called critical threshold phenomenon. Critical threshold phenomenon, namely that whether we will have a global, well, a global will posed solution or we will have a finite time singularity formation will depend on the choice of initial condition. So I'll come back to this a little bit more in detail. Well, if the communication kernel is singular, but we call it not that singular, it's so-called weakly singular, so that means that it is kind of singular, non-bounded, unbounded at the. Unbounded at the at the origin, but it's interval, then one can see that the similar phenomenon happens. Well, another interesting scenario is where you have some kind of so-called sort of like a singular communication where this communication protocol is actually not integrable at the origin. And with this singularity, actually, Singularity actually, these alignment interactions is more or less related to the so-called fractional dissipation. So that instead of having this critical threshold phenomenon, one can actually get the global regular solutions in any initial configurations. So this is basically then dissipation or diffusion phenomenon rather. Or diffusion phenomenon rather and then a damping phenomenon. So these are kind of rather well studied. So, but let me focus on the first scenario for now. And let me also focus on one dimension because there is a very nice things that we can know from the one dimension. So, this is the one dimension. The one dimension. So, this is the one-dimension system. I will put it like here. So, the good things about this operator here in one dimension is that basically there is a very nice accelerator quantity, which looks like this, which basically nicely captures the cancellations in here. So, this looks like a commutator structure. And this auxiliary quantity actually very nicely captures the cancellation. Very nicely captures the cancellation so that these quantities itself actually solves the continuity equation all by itself. So, with that, we actually managed to have a sharp threshold condition. So, here is what is known is that if initially this accelerated quantity is everywhere positive, or you can think about if the velocity slope is not too negative, compare with this guy, then. Is this guy, then the solution is globally regular? On the other hand, if this guy had anywhere to be negative, then there is a finite time shock formation. So this is a kind of a sharp characterization of the solution behavior, either globally regular or there's a finite time blow-up. Okay, and one can have similar results. Have similar results in the weekly single communication code. So, well, so today I would like to focus on the one question is what happens after the singular formation? So what happens after the blow up? So the singularity formation is like the shock formation here. So afterwards, basically, if we would like to propagate the solution afterwards. Propagate the solution afterwards. We need to study the weak solution, and it is kind of known that these weak solutions are not unique. And even if you basically equipped with this energy dissipation restrictions towards the weak solution, and it still can be showed in the paper of Cario and The paper of Carrillo and collaborators shows that there are infinite and many weak solutions that dissipate the natural energy associated to this system. So that means that one needs to impose a stronger restrictions or selection principle in order to single out one weak solution out of all the candidates. So it turns out that. So it turns out that this is not an easy task to do, even without this interaction, this alignment interaction. So let me first try to talk about this so-called 1D pressureless Euler system, where you have just a very simple system of compressible Euler. It is one dimension, there's no pressure, there's no forcing term. And so Term and so if we would like to ask about what happens for this system, especially after the singularity formation, well, we know that the weak solutions are not unique, so we need to get a selection principle. Well, there are many selection principles has been proposed under this line. So, well, a very natural one is to go with these entropy inequalities where you have some convex entropy at. Some convex entropy echoed eta, and then you plug it in, and then and you'll get these inequalities for any convex function eta. So, this but however, this is not a scatter conservation law. Instead, it's a system of conservation laws. So, basically, this entropy inequality is not enough to guarantee uniqueness. So, one can Guarantee uniqueness. So one can actually, Roshan had these counter examples to say that actually there are many examples of this type of entropy solutions, I mean, with many different types of solutions. So there are other selection principles as being proposed and kind of. That's been proposed and kind of very successfully to handle this depressionless Euler system. There is this generalized variational principle from Le, Rikov and Stenai. And also there's a work of Juan and one. Basically, they make use of this variational principle to show the one-sided Lipschitz condition, where the one-sided Lipschitz condition is sufficient to Sufficient to ensure the uniqueness. There is a series of work by Bouchon and James using so-called duality solution to select a unique solution. And here I would like to highlight one of this approach from Brenier and Grenier, which is basically trying to connect this system to a scalar conservation level. So let me try to. So, let me try to very quickly expand their ideas. So, basically, the idea is the following. If you see that these two equations, they basically rho and rho u are two quantities which both satisfies the continuity equation. So if we take the primitive of these two quantities, call it m and q, they will satisfy the transport equation. Okay, and so since they both Okay, and so since they both satisfy the transport equation, so actually these two quantities are linked to each other, namely that M is a function composed with Q, and this A actually doesn't change in time, so it can be determined, this mapping can be determined by initial configuration. So at the end, you can see that basically another observation here is that this is basically here, this is rho u, which is nothing but q. Impact q so so basically at the end we will end up with this uh scalar conservation law which is um very easy i mean where this flux a depends on the initial condition only depends on the initial condition so well once we have a scatter conservation law basically we we know that their entropy solution is going to be uniquely defined so so now if we have a So now, if we have a uniquely defined entropy solutions for this M, then we can kind of recover a unique solution of this system, rho U, where this serves as one unique weak solution to this system. So, what would try to ask whether this Whether this is a good selection principle to use the entropy, say the entropy inequalities on the M equation in order to do the selection principle. Well, actually, one can see that this selection principle is actually compatible with so-called sticky particle dynamics. So let me move back to the particle level. So if I have this so-called sticky particle. This is a so-called sticky particle model introduced by Zedowich in 1969. Basically, it says that I have the particles are just travel-free, right? Unless until they collide. And when they collide, they will have the complete elastic collisions. So at the end, they will stick together and then travel together afterwards with the same velocity. Afterwards, with the same velocity, of course, there is going to be the velocity is determined by the conservation of momentum. So, this is basically so-called sticky particle dynamics. So, the interesting thing here is that this sticky particle dynamic is very nicely connected towards the entropy selection principle in the following sense. So, if you think about this, M is the cumulative distribution of this atomic measure. Of this atomic measures here, and one can easily verify that any so any of these solutions of this system is actually a weak solution towards that. But then to have an isolated unique entropy solution, this unique entropy solution is precisely the solution which Is precisely the solution which respects the sticky particle collision. So at the end, that means that the corresponding, the unique entropy solution through this procedure is going to be compatible with the sticky particle dynamics. So somehow you see that this M equation serves as a link between the microscopic road and the macro. Microscopic road and the macroscopic work, sort of like the doing the business of the kinetic equations, if you want. So, this is what is known for the pressureless oil. So, now how we would like to try to put this idea or to embed these ideas into this EU alignment system with all these alignment in. Alignment system with all these alignment interactions. So, the questions that we are trying to address is the following. So, I start with this one-dimensional pressureless oil alignment system. I give some initial conditions, and I would like to know that I would like to construct a unique wake solution. So, I want the uniqueness so that to to to make use of this entropy selection principle. Entropy selection principle. So, well, this is kind of a little bit different from the, actually a lot of different from the pressureless Euler because of this non-local alignment interaction. But in 1D, thanks to this very nice auxiliary quantity, we can find a quantity psi, which is sort of doing the business of this velocity u in this case. Of this velocity u in this case, so that you see that both u rho and rho psi, these two quantities, satisfies the continuity equation. Okay, so you can think about this psi as a generalized momentum, rho psi, the generalized momentum. So once we have these two equations, then we can do the same business as before and reach this scalar conservation law. Well, it's not a conservation law because of the additional terms here, because of the mismatch of psi and u. So we Psi and u. So we actually have to pay an additional term. So it's a kind of a scalar balance law with these long local term on the right-hand side. But still, it is a scalar quantity. It is a scalar equation so that one can basically study the entropy solutions of this equation. And if we can have a Equation. And if we can have a unique entropy solution here, and then we go back to reconstruct my solution in the macroscopic level. And this is going to be the unique solutions that we have. So a very quick word about this equation. So basically, one can use the standard theories to show existence and uniqueness. To show existence and uniqueness of the entropy solution, well, modular one have to take care of this non-local interaction. So, existence can be actually done by the front tracking scheme, which is well known in the conservation law. So, basically, you first discretize your system, and then you push with Push this discrete system using the front tracking method. And then this will give you a discrete solution. And then you're going to basically pass the limit to show that it actually converges to the actual solution. Okay. And the entropy solution. And the uniqueness and the stability can be done using the Khushkov method, which I'm not going to. Which I'm not going to go into the details. But one important or one interesting thing is that its connection towards the microscopic system. So it's really, this is actually connected to the so-called sticky particle cooker smell dynamics. So basically, it says that everybody is going to flow according to the cooker smell dynamics. Into the Cooker Smell dynamics, until if two particles or two agents collide. When they collide, they will stick together and follow the sticky particle rules. So one can actually see that if you place these crate atoms and then flow it using a sticky particle dynamics, you'll get precisely the solutions. The solutions by this front-tracking approximation. So, again, just like the pressureless Euler, it really tells you that this entropy selection principle for the unique solution, unique weak solution, is related to the entropy solution of the M equation and it is related to the sticky particle rule. So these rules are the selective. These rules are the selection principle in different scales. Okay, so let me very quickly go through the actual presentation of the results. So you do not have to pay attention with the details, but let me just guide it through. So initially, we just need rho is a probability measure, which is compactly supported. And U is just needs to be U is just needs to be L infinity with respect to this probability measure. If we start with this, and then basically, what we actually do, just like this, we start with creating the initial condition M, which is just a cumulative distribution function, if you see that, and also the flux. And now we are in the M equation, and we solve the M equation uniquely. And we solve the M equation uniquely, the entropy solution, and then we kind of move back to define my solutions in the appropriate wake sense to the Euler alignment system. Okay. Well, another thing is about this sticky particle approximation. So basically, we can actually show that if we're trying to If we're trying to discretize it, okay, so the discretize it using this atomic initial data, actually, one can show and using the round the sticky particle Cooker Smell dynamics for this atomic initial data. And at the end, we can have the convergence of the density. I mean, it's the convergence in the Washerston 1 distance. And also, we have the convergence of the the uh of the uh um the the the the momentum so what's more actually we have we managed to get some explicit rate of of convergence and you see that the rate of convergence depends on two ingredients and number one it is uh well it is it is about the um the the singularities uh for this phi so if if this is uh if if this is this guy is regular then uh This guy is regular, then alpha equals to one. So actually, you can get optimal n to the minus one decay rate. But if you have some weakly singular case, then you have to pay it from here. Another thing is the regularity of the initial velocity. So initial velocity, if this leaps, then basically we will obtain the optimal decay rate of n to the minus one. Rate of the n to the minus one. Okay, but then if it's less regular, then it will affect things like that. Okay, so kind of this framework is very friendly for numerical implementations, which is ongoing work. So finally, just quickly talk about the asymptotic emergent phenomenon. So it's a flocking and alignment, which actually it is well known that the flocking phenomenon for strong solutions. How about for this weak? Strong solutions. How about for this weak solution where we need to somehow define the notion of alignment in a more careful way because our solution is very weak. But we actually managed to show the unconditional flocking if the interaction has a heavy tail, just like the previous result for strong solutions or for Cooker's mail dynamics. We also have some kind of a strong flocking argument. Strong flocking argument. So basically, the solution is going to actually converge to a traveling wave solutions. And there are some works have been done or is ongoing in order to understand the structure of the limiting density behavior. Okay. All right. So I think I'm running out of time. So let me allow me to just use this diagram as my summary. Summary. And so thanks for your attention. Thank you very much. Any questions here in the audience or online? I actually have a question here on this slide, and another more philosophical question. Question. So when you start with this, suppose you start with this pressureless gas dynamics. Is there any freedom of choosing this psi function here? Or how do you actually choose it? Yeah, actually, I think actually this is one of the key things of this thing. So basically, this So basically, this psi, you think about this rope psi as this psi is kind of a generalized velocity field, which kind of taken into consideration of the right-hand side or this interaction. So basically, for different models, you will hopefully get a different side. For instance, if you have the Euler-Poisson equation where the right-hand side is a Equation where the right hand side is this Newtonian interaction, then this psi is going to be is going to be different. So the whole idea is to try to somehow link this system of equations towards the dynamics of the single equation. And in order to do that, one do needs to try to To try to figure out how to handle whatever the forcing is, in particular if they are interaction force. So this has to be chosen case by case. Right, I understand that, but within the one case, it's still the freedom of how you can choose it, right? That's right. Actually, it's actually not very easy to choose. not very easy to to to to choose one so it's not the like i would view it it's not that like additional freedom but it's kind of more restrictions in order to make it work for instance i i you see that all these things i only talk about one dimension i have nothing to say about the multi-dimension partly because of uh this uh uh this y is actually psi is uh is is not available in the multi-dimension in the for for the alignment interaction so um so so yeah so so basically So so yeah, so so basically this psi captures the very uh uh nice capture nicely the cancellation for for this operator. Yeah, and uh we're a little bit restricted in time and maybe I will talk about the my next question with you offline. But I always puzzled again this pressure gas dynamics. There are this type of solutions when you have a blow-up, I mean a sticky particle when you have a concentration of particle, but there are. Have a concentration of particles, but there are also cases when you have multi-valued solutions, right? And it's a completely different type of problem, which probably doesn't fall within this framework, right? Yes, I think a sticky particle is just one selection principle, which is which basically help us to define our unique solution. But if you have some other principles, which might give another ways to get into the unique solution, To get into the unique solution of a different kind, maybe. But yes, we are adapting this sticky particle rules just because it will actually lead us to a unique solution in the macroscopic web. Right. Thank you. Thank you very much for your nice talk. And we're now switching to the first in-person talk of the workshop. Person talk of the workshop and the talk is by Henry G from
