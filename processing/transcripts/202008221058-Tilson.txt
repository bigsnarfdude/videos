You see the screen all right now? Yeah, thank you. All right. So, as I said, I teach in a business school at University of Rochester Operations Management. And Syed and Armand, who you might be familiar with, are at University of Alberta. And this is the work we did together. And it has to do with operations of emergency departments and application of queuing models to these operations. Of queuing models to these operations? How can we use queuing models and queuing theory to help emergency departments improve their operations? All of three of us are interested in applications of mathematics and operations research to healthcare. So this is one of the papers that, you know, each of us has a number of papers in this area, and this is a paper we worked on together. So to tell you a little bit about our motivation, About our motivation, I will tell you a little bit about emergency rooms and what are standing orders. So, one of the most common complaints with which people arrive to emergency departments is chest pain. And when a patient arrives with chest pain, it is a life-threatening condition. And one of the quality measures of emergency departments is whether a patient receives an EKG within 10 minutes of arrival to the emergency department. Arrival to the emergency department. I hope many of you have not had a chance to visit an emergency department recently. But if you have, my husband recently had to go to one at our hospital, they're trying to improve the operations to speed things up. They're very congested, very busy. And for example, in my husband's recent visit, sort of two people were working on him at once. One was a nurse who was. One was a nurse who was triaging him, and the other one was a registration clerk who was registering him at the same time. So you could be in a situation where people are trying to speed things up. Multiple people are working on the patient at the same time. But these people all have different roles and different privileges. Some of them are regulated by various licensing boards and so on. Boards and so on. So, for example, in many states in the US, triage nurses work in ED triage, but they do not have the right to prescribe tests. They cannot order an EKG. So, a mechanism that is a regulatory mechanism that's used is that there's something that's called a standing order. When a patient with certain symptoms arrives, if Lives. If the patient has these symptoms, this test, for example, Nikg, can be ordered by a nurse, even though normally it cannot be. So this kind of a protocol, a condition-specific protocol, is called a standing order. And this is an example with an EKG where time is of the essence. But we can think about it that it doesn't have to only be in cases where it's a life-threatening emergency. So, for example, So, for example, patients show up to ED with something not life-threatening, a sore throat. And when they come up there with a sore throat, it's something that's low acuity, and a patient can end up waiting for a really long time for a visit with a physician as patients with higher acuity are prioritized. At the same time, we have to be aware that somebody complains of a sore throat, a likely thing that's going to be done is a That's going to be done is a bacterial culture test to see if they have STREP. These tests can take a long time. So, why not expedite it? Why not start this bacterial culture test right away when a patient arrives to the AD? Why have the patient wait, then have the doctor order the test, then wait for the test results, then have the doctor confirm and decide on the treatment? So we can have something like a standing order. Something like a standing order protocol for less serious conditions as well, strep throat. Here's an example of a protocol. So there are a certain number of points for various symptoms that correspond to the strep throat, and then a nurse can decide, depending on the total score, whether the patient needs a test or doesn't need a test. So, standing orders, if we think of them that way, they can reduce. They can reduce EDLOS, so length of stay in the ED, for target patients, patients who are subject to this order, by reconfiguring the default process in the emergency department. So the default process in the emergency department looks something like this. A patient arrives, is triaged, goes into the triage queue, is triaged by a nurse who determines the priority level for evaluation by a physician. Evaluation by a physician. Then the patient waits for the initial evaluation of the physician. The physician may be something simple, and the patient then departs, but most frequently, then the physician orders additional tests, so maybe some treatments. Then there is a post-test and post-treatment evaluation. And then the physician decides: does the patient need to be admitted or maybe has can Can depart, go to be discharged from the ED. So that is the normal flow without standing orders. Standing orders changes this flow. So we have, if we look at the standing order triage, what happens here is the nurse at standing order triage determines whether or not patient meets the conditions covered by standing order. So if the condition So, if the conditions are not met, then the process continues as before. Patient goes to the provider queue, waits for the initial evaluation, and so on. If the conditions are met, then a nurse may decide whether or not to invoke the standing orders. If the nurse decides not to invoke the standing orders, then the process continues as before. If the standing orders are invoked, Orders are invoked, then this whole what we have is early task initiation, something that's been identified in operations management literature as a behavior of servers in service systems. Sometimes we would see, and this was observed actually in the medical setting, this idea of early task initiations. Workers, servers observe what's going on in the system and they think, well, we could reorder the tasks. Well, we could reorder the tasks, some tasks we can initiate earlier. So we can have this early task initiation of tests, but in addition, what happens here is that this first initial evaluation treatment by a physician is no longer needed. By the time the tests are completed, we can have just a single evaluation with the physician. So these standing orders, they are used. They are used in medicine, right? They are used in ADs, and AD practitioners have looked at and evaluated whether or not they improve the flow in AD. So about 11 papers we found, we reviewed the earliest one is from 96, looked at this idea of standing orders, and 11 of these papers look at the idea of whether or not patients need an x-ray. Patients need an x-ray when there is an ankle injury. And since you are Canadians or the conference is in Canada, maybe you would appreciate that this is called Ottawa Ankle Rules Protocol. So these 11 studies that we outlined here look at the use of it, and most of them find that for target population, using standing orders decreases length sustained AED. People have looked at applications in other settings, not just for In other settings, not just for limb injuries. They're looked at for chest pain, for pediatric emergencies, for throat pains, and for other conditions, multiple tests and multiple conditions. And the majority of these papers found that for target population, the length of stain AD decreases. One of the things that we will bring up in the course of our study is that they should not just be looking at target populations, right? Target populations, right? They should be looking at the ED overall, but all of these empirical studies have looked at are looking at target population. Although most of them report a reduction in ED LOS, there is one paper here, Huang et al., that reports actually no improvement or actually the opposite of improvement, right? For patients suffering from chest pain when the standing orders initiated tests early, not only Initiated tests early, not only there was no improvement, there was in fact an increase, significant increase in the length of stay in the ED. But there is a correction that comes with this paper. Huang et al. noted that their study looks at retrospective cohort study, and when standing orders were invoked, the ED was already quite congested. So we have to. So, we have to think about whether this lack of improvement had to do with the fact that the AD was congested when the protocol was in vogue. So, out of these 17 papers that we found relevant to standing orders, there are three that mention the idea of congestion-based policies, that the standing orders should not be invoked all the time, but only when the congestion level in the AD is at a certain level, and they measure the congestion. And they measure the congestion by time. There's two different ones. One measures is by the time till the patient can be seen by the doctor, and the other one by the fact that the test takes less than a certain amount of time. So that's the empirical literature, and it also identifies some of the reasons why these standing orders are not used. Standing orders are not used universally. So, what are some of the reasons? First of all, there's difference in regulations by geography in the U.S. In some states, I live in New York State, nurses here are not even allowed to use standing orders. In other states, like Colorado, they are. When nurses have to execute standing orders, it increases the workload on them. Organizations in general may have difficulty. Organizations in general may have difficulty in changing business processes. Sometimes you run a test early, but it's not ready in time for an evaluation by a physician, and then there's no benefit. And then there is something that we are focusing on in our study, the problem of over-testing. If the nurses could do as good a job of the doctor, there wouldn't be a problem with standing orders. But there is an observation that one of the problems is that more people. The problems is that more people are sent to testing than a physician would send. So there's this question of over-testing. And over-testing causes a problem in two ways. It increases the load on the testing resource, right? So that increases the waiting time for all the patients that need this resource. And it can also increase the workload for the physician. Because even though the physician has the test results, the physician has to be careful to interpret these unnecessary tests. Unnecessary tests so as not to miss an incidental finding. So overtesting can cause increase in service time that patients spend in the system. So we want to understand what is the benefit of standing orders, how does it affect overall ED length of stay, and we create a model, a queuing model, where we look at the following five parameters. At the following five parameters. We create a model where we look at target patients, the percent of patients that are subject to standing orders. So our patients fall into two groups, target patients and other patients that are not subject to standing orders. We look at this over-testing, probability that a nurse would identify non-target patients as target. We look at testing rate, initial examination rate, how long does it take? Examination rate, how long does it take an MD to do the initial examination, and the post-test examination rate. And I will speak about our analytical model, but we also do simulation. And the values that we have to run our simulation are the values that we obtain from the empirical medical literature. So, for example, average time that a physician spends with a patient is 22 minutes. 22 minutes. What percentage of it is initial examination versus the post-test examination varies between 20 and 50 percent. Depending on the kind of condition that a standing order covers, the target population can be between 10 and 70 percent of ED patients. The overtesting rate varies between one and ten percent, and how busy physicians and testing is varies between fifty percent and ninety five percent. Between 50 and 95 percent. So that's to give you an idea of these parameters. So here is our schematic of our model. We model our ED as a queuing network where there are four queues. So there is a queue for testing. So when patients are sent for testing, there's queue one that's a testing queue and it is served by a testing server. And then there are three queues that are There are three queues that are served by the physician, the physician server. There is the queue for the patients that are triage as target, there are queues for the patients that triage this other, and there is a post-test queue. And one, two, three, all these three cues are served by the physician. And we have a routing decision when a patient arrives and is triaged as target. We make a routing decision whether the patient should be sent to the Whether the patient should be sent to the physician's queue or to the testing queue. So that is what we want to optimize. We want to make this routing decision so that it would minimize the average number of patients in the system. I guess this is the only equation I will show. Oops, sorry. This is our formulation of our. Formulation of our average cost and bias function, the Bellman equation, which we use to analyze our problem. So there is a probability that there is a patient arrives who doesn't need test, who is not a target patient. There's a probability that a patient arrives who needs testing. There's a probability that a testing completes. There's a probability that physician completes the service. Completes the service, and there is a probability that the system remains in the same state because we're using uniformization to transform continuous time space into discrete time space. So, with this formulation, we are able to prove that the optimal routing policy is monotone in the length of each queue. And I think that makes intuitive sense. Sense. If it's optimal to route a target patient to testing, if there are n patients in testing queue, if there's one less, given everything else is constant, you would route the patient. If there's one less in the testing queue, you would route the newly arriving patient to testing. If it's optimal to route a target patient to testing when there are M patients in the physician queue, if the physician queue, physician is more basic, right, there's M plus one patients in the physician queue. There's M plus one patients in the physician queue, you would again route the target patient to testing. And similar, when do we route to physician? If we find that there are n patients in the testing queue, then we route to the, and we route, it's optimal to route to the physician. If there are n plus one in the testing queue, we again route to the physician. And the other way, and the physician is less busy, then we are, it's still optimal to route to the physician. It's still optimal to route to the physician. So there is this monotonicity, but want to remind you that we are dealing with three physician cues. So we show numerical evidence that this optimal MDP-derived policy would be too complex for real-world implementation. You can see here the threshold is not very nice, right? To implement something like this in real life would be too complex. Complex. So we are proposing a heuristic that's a simple heuristic, and it uses a single threshold instead of multiple thresholds. So we say, let's look at the difference between the number of patients waiting for the MD in all three queues and the number of patients waiting for testing in a single queue. And if it's greater than some theta, we will route to testing, else we route to the AMD. So we can find this theta by enumerating. If we have a limited capacity, that's B, the number of beds in the system or the number of places to hold our patients. So we can enumerate two B plus one thresholds and find which one is the best. And a policy like this includes the policies of never using standing orders and always using. Standing orders and always using standing orders. So, using numerical experiments that are based on data published in medical literature on the numbers for the rates and the target population and the overtesting. We find that this very simple policy with a single threshold performs very well. On average, our optimality gap is less than 1%, and the worst case is 2.5%. Percent and the worst case is 2.5 percent. So, we can use this simple policy. Now, the next thing that would be nice is if we did not have to do this computation all the time of 2b plus 1 systems, and especially given that our system size grows exponentially with the number of beds in the system. So, if we could find a way to estimate the threshold instead of evaluating all these. Evaluating all these systems. So, after some extensive trial of different parameters, we found that there is a very nice linear predictor for theta. And this linear predictor, beta, comes from this definition. So, what goes in is percentage of target patients, average time they mutually. Average time the initial exam takes, average time the test takes, and average time the post-test exam takes. And here, sorry, this keeps appearing. Not sure how to get rid of it. So, anyway, we have an expression based on models primitive. Expression based on models, primitives, that allows us to forecast, or predict, or estimate this threshold that will work well for our system when we should send the patient to testing and when we should send the patient to the MD. And we also think that in the real world, it is much easier for a nurse to know, especially now with more and more information available at the nurse's station, how many patients are waiting for tests. How many patients are waiting for tests? How many patients are waiting for the physician? So, this number, what is the difference between these two cues, should be available for nurses to be able to make a decision where to route the patient. Here I'm just showing you that we did some linear regression models to estimate this threshold and the error in the worst case, the optimality gap out of sample. The optimality gap out of sample was 3.9 percent. So we do very well. And just optimal threshold error with regard with respect to the optimal MDP policy is just 2.2 percent. So after we have finished our MDP analysis, we use discrete event simulation to invest, to relax some of these simplifying assumptions. Assumptions. So, for example, if we're looking at and to investigate impact on different patient groups. So, for example, this is our data with one patient and one physician, sorry, and then we used discrete event simulation to look at the system where we have two physicians. We looked at what happens with different groups. We saw, we found this example. Want to draw your attention to this one, like we're using optimal threshold. Using optimal threshold, we see that for all the patients, the ED length of stay is decreasing using standing orders and threshold. But interestingly enough, if we just look at the target patients, then for them, ED lengths of stay is increasing. So when medical professionals are looking at the impact of this policy, and if they're looking only at the target patients, they could find a situation where it doesn't. Find a situation where it doesn't help the target patients, but it may be helping the system overall anyway. So they should not just be looking at the target population. They should be looking at the system overall, because you could also have the opposite effect. You improve things for the target patients, but it doesn't work as well for the system as a whole. So, in summary, what did we accomplish? So, we are the first to examine standing orders. First, to examine standing orders analytically using a network queuing model and MDP-based analysis. We demonstrate potential unintended consequences of this use of standing orders, including over-testing and spillover effects for non-target patients. We show the importance of investigating the impact of standing orders on AAD as a whole. And we propose simple but near optimal three. Simple but near optimal threshold policy that can be used in practice to identify the situations where it is beneficial for the AD to use standing orders. There are more details in our paper, which is available on SSRN, and I want to thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, Professor Tilson. Any questions? Yeah, I have a question. Yeah, I have a question. And Vera, thank you for.
