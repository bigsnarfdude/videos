To this very nice and for letting me speak. So, let me start by explaining the plan of the talk. So, and I should say everything I'm going to say is joint with Jenny August, Joanne HÃ¸glan, Karl Njakops, Njampalu, and Hippolyto Trefinger. So, the plan is as follows: so, let's be So let A be a finite dimension of algebra. Then it's well known by work of Adachi Yama-Reiten that there's a bijection between functor. Functorially finite, which I'll just abbreviate by FF for the rest of the talk. Torsion classes in the module category of A and two-term shelting complexes. So Silting complexes. So silting complexes in concentrated in degree minus one and zero with projective components. And the goal of this talk is to explain. A generalization of this result to higher our standard right interval. So, more precisely. So, more precisely, if you have, say, a declutter tilting subcategory. Then we construct a map from a controller finite the Portion classes. In M and two silting complexes, and now they should have be concentrated in degrees minus D, where D is this integer here. So let's say D some integer to zero. So in D plus one term complexes. Plus one term complexes of projectors. So this thing on the left-hand side is a notion which can be introduced purely using intuition from higher Aussie-and-Wrighten theory and higher homological algebra, but then it spits out some proper silting complexes. Okay, so it's important to note that this is Not a bijection when D is greater than one. For D equal to one, it just restricts to this bijection. The construction for D greater than one is very analogous to the construction in the D equals one case, but it doesn't give a bijection, even when you restrict the domain further by some natural criteria. So somehow So, somehow, an equally important part of my talk is also to explain what doesn't work and not just what works. Yeah. Okay, so the structure will be as follows. So, the first part, I will just tell you what the D-cluster tilting subcategory is and what's from Toronto Finite D-toshing class. And then, in the second part, I will explain how to construct this map. Okay, so let's start with a definition of T-cluster tilting, which was produced in a paper by YAMA published in 2007, which is that let N in mod A be a functorally Be a functorally finite subcategory then n is the cluster tilting abbreviated DCT if we have the following rigidity condition. Following rigidity condition, so M is equal to all the A modules which have no extensions with M in degrees between zero and D, and also the same, but reversing the order. So, what this tells you is first that M is a rigid subcategory. It has no extensions in degrees one to d minus one. And also that it is maximal with this property. If you have any other module which has no extensions with n, say on the left side, then it has to be contained in m itself. So we've seen in previous talks the definition of D-cluster tilting in triangulated. Of D-cluster tilting in triangulated categories, and this is one of the analogous ones for abelian categories. So an important point is that if you put d equals one, then this implies that m is just the module category of A, because this condition becomes empty, so it has to contain all the modules. And for high ID, you can think of M as some kind. Think of M as some kind of replacement of the module category where you can do some higher Aussie-Wrighten theory. So, several classical constructions also have analogous constructions in higher Auschwitz-Wrighten theory inside the cluster tilting subcategories. In this talk, I will only mention one of them, which is the concept of the torsion class, which is a generalization of torsion classes. So that's Classes. So that's the second definition. And I don't remember the years, so I need to check. Yes. This was introduced by Peter Jorgensen in 2016. So let's assume M in mod A is the cluster tilting, then. Then a whole subcategory U of M is what's called a the torsion class if the following criteria holds so for ordinary torsion classes you have uh you can divide any module into a torsion part and a torsion free part and this gives is described by a short exact Is described by a short exact sequence. In this case, you have some similar statement, but you need an exact sequence of length t plus two instead. So three would be a short exact sequence, t equals one. So it is the following criteria for any object in your decluster tilting subcategory, there exists an exact sequence where you have. Where you have X, then you have a submodule of X. This should sit in your youth, your candidate for detos in class. And then instead of just taking the co-kernel, you take a sequence of length B where all of these. Where all of these should be contained in M and such that now you need so let's see M and M and then such that and now you need a replacement of the fact that there are no morphisms from the torsion class to the torsion free class. You need some way of expressing this using Expressing this using this longer exact sequence, and what you do is you require that the sequence on lambda u y one on lambda u y two on Um lambda u y d sequence is exact. Yes. So for d equals one, you would just have zero, home of something zero, which would mean that the home set would be zero, and hence you have the And hence you have the homorthogonality or the torsion part. So one challenge with torsion and detorsion classes when d is greater than one is that there's no corresponding detorsion free class. At least nobody has made sense. At least nobody has made sense of any useful definition so far. So that's one observation. So there's no corresponding torsion three class. And the second observation is that. Is that P equals one recovers the classical definition? Okay, so now let's go to part two of my talk. Now we have defined what this set. What this set here on the left side means. Here I should. And then I just need to tell you what this map is, how this map is defined. So to define this map, we start with, let's say, you fix U in M some functorally finite detersion class, and I'll just have this fixed for the rest of my talk. Fixed for the rest of my talk. You want to associate a silting complex to this. What you first do is you start with your algebra itself. You take a minimal left U approximation. This is precisely where we use from chlorole fight nan net. Use from chlorofine finiteness of our U. You will take the co-kernel of this C0 and then you repeat the process. So again, you choose a minimal left U approximation and by some And by some small argument, you can show that in the second step and all the next steps, this will always be a monomorphism, but it's not necessarily a monomorphism in the first step. So we do like that, then you get C2 and you continue. And then you do this for D steps until you end up with U D minus 2A. You take the The co-kernel, you take a minimal u approximation into u d minus 1a, and then the last term is u d a. Then maybe I want to keep this, so I continue here. And then this last term will actually, this last co-curriculum will actually be in you. Core kernel will actually be in you, so the process stops after these steps. So then UDA is contained in U. So you have all these modules in U which you constructed, and what you do. And what you do is you can take the sum, which I can denote u A, U I A. And then it turns out that this is what's called a tau D rigid module. And that's our first result. So let me just recall what tau D is. Tau D is just the Auslander Reiten, classical Auslander translation composed with a D minus one. Composed with a D minus one plasticity. So, this is what's typically called a D AR translation. And we prove the following proposition A H J K E T Which is first that as I stated u d A how d u d sorry not u d but u the sum u a is zero. So this can be just phrased as u A is how the rigid Rigid. And then the second part is that if you let P U be the maximal basic projective A module satisfying that home it has that there are no morphisms to our detosing class so it's like the super Detosing class, so it's like the support part, then Pu plus UA is equal to A. And here we are counting the number of non-isomorphic in decomposable summats. And for D equals one, this is precisely how you would consider. This is precisely how you would construct the corresponding tau tilting, support tau tilting pair associated to a functorally finite torsion class. Then you would stop in step one, but since we're in higher degrees, we have to continue a certain number of steps. Okay, and then Let's explain the next part. Yes. So, as I said, this forms what's called a Taudi-rigid pair. So, we say that the pair where m Where M is in the D cluster tilting subcategory and P is on projective. In A, this is how the rigid here if, first of all, M is taudi rigid, and secondly, there are no morphisms from There are no morphisms from P to M. Now, the proposition we proved implies in particular that UAPU is what's called a Taudi regid pair. So next I will use a result by Martinez and Mendoza. Result by Martinez and Mendoza, which to any Taudi-Regi pair associate a pre-silting complex. So, let me tell you how to do that. So, let M be some declusting in the decluster tilting subcategory and consider P D minus one plus one P D Plus one, P D P D minus one P zero. Let that be a minimal projective resolution of M and then what I do is I truncate it at degree D. So I put all the P's greater than D equal to zero. And I'll just call this. And I'll just call this p bullet n, say. So that's a complex which is just zero zero zero pd pd minus one p zero. Yeah, and this should be zero and it's zero here as well. Yeah, so now let's go maybe here. So then we have the following proposition, which at least is proven in. At least, as proven in the paper by Martinez Mendoza. It might in 2023, and it says that whenever you have a tau d rigid pair. Then the complex given by taking the d projective resolutions, as I described there, p bullet m and adding the shift of p. But d degrees is pre-silting, so it has no positive extensions. So, to summarize what we know, we have this U, this functorial finite d torsion class. Then, from the proposition, maybe I should call it proposition one. I don't think I gave it a name, proposition one, proposition two, we get A pair UA P U, which is a powder rigid pair. And we had that the number of summands was equal to the number of summons of the algebra. And this by proposition two. And this, by proposition two, by Martine and Mandoza, implies that you get a pre-silting complex, say S, which is P bullet UA plus P U shifted by D, which is pre-shelting with the number of somands. The number of summands equal to the number of summands of the algebra, but yeah, so I started two minutes late, so I'll take two more minutes if it's okay. So yes, but this is not enough to immediately conclude it is tilting. In fact, if we had worked with two terms as complexes. Complexes. Then one knows that a two-term pre-silting complex where the number of summats equal to the number of summats of the algebra would automatically be shilting, but this is not known for higher D. So not include. So this is not enough to conclude it is silting. And in fact, it's known that there exists pre-silting complexes which have. With which have the where the number of summments is equal to the number of summments of the algebra, so the rank of the Grotnik group, but which are not tilting. So, this was a counterexample in a paper by Martin Kalk from this year. So, we need some extra work, but the conclusion is that anyway, it's true. So Theorem, which is that let's say P bullet U right below here P bullet U A plus P U D is silting in the bounded homotopy category. Bounded homotopy category of complexes with projective components. Yeah, and our current result of our current proof of this result is somehow, I would say, a bit technical and not for me not very illuminating. So I'm hoping to try to find some different arguments which explains why this is true. Anyway, I'm out of time. So thank you very much. I need the microphone, but I'm not sure if I can do it. How your correspondences for Your correspondence is far from being bisectible. So there are three objects: detours on cross, tau d is the pair, and well, determine preceding. Yes. Maybe I can write down a quick diagram if I have like one minute. Because so you can find silting complexes which do not arise from the torsion classes, for example, and you can find how the rigid appears. Taudi rigid pairs which do not arise from detorsion classes. Yeah, maybe I will not write it down. It would take some time. Even and you could also imagine putting some more stricter restrictions, right? So these are not just any filting complexes of length d plus one. They also have no homologies, for example, in the degrees in between. And they can also maybe in also assume that it has homology in N. Homology in n in degree zero, but even with those two restrictions, you can still find examples which do not arise from details in classes. So it's a bit mysterious what's going on.
