A variety of different topics. I'm going to be skimming through a few different topics without always going into a lot of detail, but I'm very happy to talk about details afterwards. Or if you have any questions as we go along, please do ask. So, this is I'm going to give an overview of a variety of topics that involve collaborations with a variety of people. Some work I'm going to touch on at the end is a Some work I'm going to touch on at the end is a collaboration with a PhD student, Adam Stanway, Helvin Johnson, and Jeff Ridley of the Met Office, starting to think about parameterizing fjord dynamics in relatively simple ways for connecting to ocean and ice sheet models. Some work on scaling melts in stratified fluids with Sam Magorian, some DNS and turbines with Srikanth Topadoni, Keaton Burns, and Glenn Flow, and Ian Earle and Claudia. Earl and Claudia were involved in some work looking at interactions of subglacial channels with the ocean. Okay, so I'm going to be thinking about marine terminating glaciers involving carving faces, so relatively steep ice faces in contact with the ocean. And a particular feature that I'm going to be interested in is understanding the flow of either meltwater off the ice base or subglacial discharge. Or subglacial discharge introduced from below the ice, and how that generates turbulent mixing and heat transfer towards the ice face. Okay, so when you go and look at Greenland settings where you've got ice melting at calving faces, you typically find many of these locations occur in fjords, which are relatively long, narrow conduits that head up towards the ice sheet. Head up towards the ice sheet. And these fjords are mediating exchange of heat and fresh water between the ice and the ocean. They have a whole lot of complicated dynamics going on. So you can have things involving iceberg melt and iceberg drift, buoyancy-driven exchange flows, wind-driven flows. There may be roles also for mixing, potentially wave activity too. So you've got a lot. To. So you've got a lot of processes going on, and most of these processes are happening on scales at which you really would prefer not to have to resolve in an ocean model if you didn't have to. So I'm going to talk about some approaches for coming up with simple predictions of melting rates and exchange. This is going to be a talk involving airing watts of dirty laundry, so talking a lot about uncertainties and things that. About uncertainties and things that we don't know well, as well as some ideas about how we might tackle some of these problems. And I'm particularly going to focus on this bit in here, looking at the boundary layer along the ice face, where you've got relatively steep ice face melting into the ocean, potentially with some subglacial discharge, and how we might characterize this highly non-hydrostatic flow in a relatively simple way. So, what would we like to know? So, what would we like to know about this problem? So, if you talk to ice modelers, they're interested in the mass loss or the combination of melting and carving at ice faces. So, there are actually empirical scalings based off observational data that give you a way to predict this. But, in particular, if you're interested in the spatial distribution of melt, you have to start getting into a little bit more detail. So, in particular, Bit more detail. So, in particular, as was mentioned yesterday, this spatial distribution of melt can start to feedback on carbon dynamics. So, ocean modellers might be interested in the freshwater exchange, both as liquid and solid parts, and also the heat exchanged through the fjords out into the far-field ocean. And one particular question of interest is: what is the depth dependence of the freshwater input? So, if you put all of your melt at the top of the ocean, you generate a very different stratification. You generate a very different stratification and resistance to mixing compared to what would happen if you distributed it over depth. Okay, so I'm going to start by just running through how we model plumes next to ice sheets. So it's a particular type of model that comes up with a simple description that's averaged over the width of the boundary layer. So I'm going to step through thinking about a So I'm going to step through thinking about a two-dimensional setting here. So we've got a planar ice place and this plume continues into the plane. You've got either melt or subglacial discharge. And then this fresh, buoyant melt water is mixing with the background ocean via some entrainment and then rising buoyantly up towards the ocean surface. And it's mixing with this ambient fluid that may have some properties, so temperature and salinity that vary with depth. When you zoom in, pretty much. When you zoom in pretty close to the ice base, you're going to get some gradients in temperature and also gradients in salinity moving up towards the boundary. So here I'm thinking on scales potentially of meters or even less, getting down to millimeter scales for some of these boundary layers in here. And then you've got this flow structure. So this is already a level of complication trying to characterize this variation. So what's often done building Variation. So, what's often done, building on some theory that I think was put together very early on for plumes in the atmosphere, is you take relevant boundary layer equations for the turbulent flow and you basically integrate these across the width of the boundary layer. And then that lets you work with some average quantities that are defined in terms of the fluxes across sections with some characteristic width B. So, I'm going to use T for temperature. B. So I'm going to use T for temperature, S for salinity, and W for the velocity along the ice face. And I'm going to start out by looking at 2D cases, although you can do axis symmetric or half-axisymmetric cases. So when you go through, take your Reynolds average and Abby-Stokes boundary layer equations and do this averaging procedure, you end up with equations that look as follows. So they've got a number of unknown terms that need Unknown terms that need some kind of closure. But basically, your vertical mass flux on a slice of fluid is changing due to entrainment from the background and input of fresh water by melt. The flow is accelerated by buoyancy forces and resisted by drag. Your heat transport is changing due to mixing of background fluid and exchange at the boundary, so melt input and also turbulent. So, turbulent fluxes across this now unresolved region of the boundary layer. And similarly, for salt. And then you couple this with interface conditions, so basically conserving energy salt and a relationship between the freezing temperature and the salinity. And if we know what some of these turbulence closure terms on the right-hand side are, this is enough to predict a one-dimensional profile of how things evolve. Profile of how things evolve along the surface of the ice, given an equation of state. Okay, so the art form of this kind of modelling and the assumptions that are made are buried in these turbulent terms in here. So one term describes the turbulent mixing with the background, and so-called entrainment. So a commonly used approach for this is using this linear relation in the velocity. So you say the inflow is So you say the inflow is related to the only velocity scale in tan. So this was what was used by Morton, Taylor and Turner. You can postulate drag forces might scale quadratically with the velocity of the flow. And then you have to wonder a little bit how these heat and salt fluxes might behave. So most models that have looked at this problem have assumed the following fluxes, and I think these are things that are commonly or often used also in Or often used also in detailed ice shelf and ocean models, too. So you've got your heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference between the background and the ice face, and similarly for the salt flux. And then there's some transfer coefficient, which if you assume that there's strongly shear-dominated turbulence, you can put an argument together that it should scale linearly with the magnitude of the velocity that's controlling the shear and the turbulent mix. Controlling the shear and the turbulent mixing in towards the boundary. So, we can also rationalize this looking at details of the boundary layer. So, if we write our heat fluxes as involving some conduction across a narrow molecular sub-layer very close to the interface, which has some thickness h of t. If you just calculate a conductive heat flux, you would get something of this form. You would get something of this form, so temperature difference divided by the boundary layer thickness. Similarly, for salinity with relevant diffusivity in here. And if you assume you've got shear-driven turbulence, you can characterize that flow in terms of some specific value of a Reynolds number, controlling your boundary layer thickness. And this ends up, when you unwind it, recovering these flow laws in here. So Andrew quickly, is is T A and S A are they the kind of the same conceptually as T bar and S bar or are they different? Yeah, so if I was being a bit more careful I should probably have put that as T bar so I'm thinking about what's happening and thanks for catching me. So you'd formulate it in terms of the difference between the boundary layer out here and the interface. Thank you. Yeah. Shouldn't have spotted that maybe. This is why you shouldn't write your slides. Shouldn't write your slides in the minutes before you talk. Okay, so some recent experiments and some theory that goes with that suggests that this is not necessarily the only game in town. And particularly for these vertical melting ice faces, some lab experiments show a slightly different scaling for the melting rate and the heat and salt fluxes that go with it. So this is something. Go with it. So, this is something that happens at relatively low speeds, so this shear-dominated flow is no longer the dominant mechanism. And actually, what's controlling the fluxes away from this boundary is how efficiently you detach small plumes of fluid and then mix them into the background. So, this gives you something with some kind of buoyancy type of criteria involving a Rayleigh number for the thickness of the solutal boundary layer. Of the solutal boundary layer and some scaling between thermal and solutal boundary layer thicknesses, and this predicts a slightly different scaling for the Melbourne. So, this comes into play with relatively low flow speeds. So, this transition has empirically been constrained at about three centimeters per second for particular salinity conditions. Okay, so I'm going to step through how we might use this. I'm going to look at one. Use this. I'm going to look at one particular example, but there are a variety of different cases that could be relevant. So I'm going to think about what happens if you've got a stratified background. So if you didn't have a density stratification, your buoyant melt water would just rise all the way up to the ocean surface. But when you have stratification, because you're mixing with dense fluid or you're exchanging temperature and solidity with dense fluid, Temperature and solidity with dense fluid. At the bottom, as that parcel rises, it can eventually find a level of neutral density. So, this was nicely illustrated in these experiments by Huppett and Turner for a fairly laminar flow with an ice block put to melt in a salinity gradient. The melt water flows up, so the ice block was dyed, and as it flows up, you get these layers of fluid peel out and flow out into the background. And flow out into the background. And this is something that's oceanographically quite interesting because rather than injecting all of your fresh water at the surface, you're actually distributing it somewhat over depth. Can we restoring very quickly on this? What the it's the limiting factor is the width of that particular tank or something, because they don't go don't spread far out, they can't remember. So this was a photo taken before the intrusions have spread to the very edge of the tank. Of spread to the very edge of the tank in this case. So I have a complete answer to this, but this is reminiscent to me of one of the cases of double diffusion. So this experiment is definitively double diffusive. I'm just trying to get the staircase I always thought was the one where it's salty at. So this is a little bit different because you're putting in the buoyancy flux at the side into an existing stratification, so it's a little bit different to the classical vertical convective layering. But there are whole theories about this. There are whole theories about this, and there are theories that very nicely describe this fairly laminar experiment. Is that in the paper issue? Okay. That and the citations of it. If you've got a lot of patience, come and talk to me afterwards. That should keep you busy for a while. Okay, so what you can also do is you can try to model this kind of flow. Is you can try to model this kind of flow using a turbulent plume model, so accounting for something with some more turbulent mixing. And here we've thrown out the double diffusion apart from any differences in the exchange coefficients at the interface. So if you take a linear stratification and you solve a plume model, the flow rises upwards. Eventually the plume comes to a halt, and when it does that, the plume width starts to diverge in the theory. And what will happen in reality is the flow. And what will happen in reality is the flow will start to intrude into the background. And associated with that, you get these scallop-like melting patterns where you get an acceleration of the flow that brings in more turbulent heat flux and starts to melt more rapidly, and then it decelerates as the flow is slowing down and reaching neutral buoyancy and going slightly past. And then, once the flow has intruded into the background, you can start a new layer from the melting. Start a new layer from the melting of this ice face. So, one thing you can do with these kinds of approaches, so I'm going to show you one case, but you can do it with most of these types of problems for different conditions, whether you put subglacial discharge in or not, whether it's stratified or not, is you can often find for quite clean problems with linear stratification or uniform density with depth, you can find quite simple scalings. So, for this linearly stratification, Scaling. So, for this linearly stratified case, you can collapse things down quite nicely by basically non-dimensionalizing by this stratification scale that I'm going to call Lρ, that's the relevant length scale, which is basically the density difference of a parcel of melted fluid mixed with some mixing ratio with entrainment with the background fluid. So, taking fluid coming in that's specified with some effective density at the boundary. Boundary and mixing that up. And then, if you combine that with a simple scaling for how the flow evolves in an unstratified case, you can get some nice clean scalings that are able to collapse at melting rates over a range of conditions. So, this is one such problem. You can look at a variety of these, so don't worry about taking in all of the details. This is basically just to show that there are a variety of different scalings that come into play if you've got subglacial distribution. If you've got subglacial discharge, this often plays a significant role in controlling the flow. You can get non-linear dependencies and melt rates on temperature if your temperature and the melt supplied off the wall is having a significant impact on the buoyancy of the flow. So don't worry about taking in too much of the details. There's a very nice review paper that Ian wrote last year that summarises most of these. Summarizes most of the time. And can you just comment on your description of the plume coming up and spreading out? Yeah. What about the next layer? How do you initialize the next layer? So what I did in the previous calculations is, so for those particular ones, I just took the ambient fluid at the depth. So I let the flow go up until its stopping point along the wall. And then you just took the ambient fluid at that, the ambient properties, mixed those up to match this self-similar solution. To match this self-similar solution. So you can do a small Z asymptotics that basically shows on a small scale it looks fairly unstratified, and then you get a power loss solution and you go there. Just a really quick one. You said that the Hupper experiment was inherently double diffusive. I think it means there's a strong ratio, large ratio of temperature to salt diffusivity. Is your result, your numerical result, compared, I mean, dependent upon W. Dependent upon double diffusion. So in here, the mixing parameters have no double diffusion, so the mixing with the background is assumed to be controlled with fairly large eddies, so the diffusivity ratio doesn't make a big difference, or is assumed in these theories not to make a big difference. You do account for the diffusivity ratio when you're calculating the fluxes in this small molecular sublayer, so it's important very close to the interface, but once you start to form large eddies and mix things up it Form large eddies and mix things up. So, the scales don't depend on double GP sorting. They've got differences in efficiency of heat and salt transfer at the boundary involved, yeah. Okay, so you can also use these kind of plume models, so they've been incorporated and in terms of exchanges of fluxes as a parameterization in the ocean models. So, there's some nice work done by a group involving. Nice work done by a group involving Tom Cowton that basically integrates a plume model numerically, vertically. Where you have entrainment, it's pulling in water from the neighbouring cells, and then where you have outflow at the top, you re-inject that intruding plume out into your ocean model. So put the appropriate fluxes in. So this does quite a nice job of characterizing modeled plume dynamics. One little thing One little thing that's in missing in this particular or the first implementation of this is there's actually a bit of a tendency for the plume to overshoot at neutral density level. So this is something that was naturally omitted. So there's a bit of uncertainty of how this plume will slump and over what particular depth range this intrusion is actually flowing back out into the background. So it'll tend to go past its neutral buoyancy level, overshoot and then slump back down. Overshoot and then slump back down, and that slumping process I don't think is fully understood, at least if not in the context of these fice-face plugs. Okay, so moving a little bit on to some uncertainties. So, there's been some recent attempts to evaluate these plume models, so they are models, by comparison to observations. So, I'm going to step in a bit of detail through this before. In a bit of detail through this before skipping through to the end. So, this is looking from comparing some observations of melt rate that were done by multi-beam scans on the face of an ice sheet. So, this red line in here is showing you the depth profile averaged horizontally across the ice face of the melting rate, and then you've got just some vertical mean shown by the coloured red shading. And it's been compared to two different. Compared to two different versions of the plume theory. So one just looks at the maximum peak melt rate in an isolated subglacial discharge plume, so where you have a single point source and fluid rising up, and you get this black dashed profile in here with some corresponding uncertainty for the particular setting they're in. And then you can also compare, what's a more accurate comparison is what would happen if you average that with all of the background melt over. All of the background melt over the rest of the ice face, and that gives you what's given in this grey shading in here. So the average melt across the entire ice face is actually quite significantly smaller than what you measure using these particular observations. So that presents a bit of a challenge. And there's also some unexplained facets in terms of understanding this distribution of melt rate with depth. Operate with depth. So, this is quite a complicated problem. So, some insights into what might be happening have come from some nice numerical modelling work from Donald Slater. This is on a different fjord, but where you get these subglacial discharge plumes intruding and spreading out into the background, it can generate something of a secondary circulation to where you start to draw fluid across the eye space as a result of this larger scale circulation. As a result of this larger scale circulation, and this might start to enhance some of the background melt and pull some of these two together. There's also some uncertainties over what the ice geometry will do with a plume. So these interfaces are quite non-planar. That in itself is not necessarily a problem, although it wasn't in the theory on that previous slide. But one of the challenges is actually some of the observations have actually revealed these adverse slopes, where if you look at how the eye Where, if you look at how the ice profile varies with height up towards the ocean surface, you've actually got the ocean on top of the ice sheet. So you're releasing this buoyant melt water that's going to give you a boundary there that's unstable to separation, and you're going to get some convective mixing up here. And this is something that's not currently described in any way with plume theories. You could also have potentially there might be a role for roughness. So these are some experiments from a study of convection relevant to Of convection relevant to sea ice, where we did some work with a fractal boundary on the top of the domain and started to look at the mixing. And interestingly, we actually found that the exponent of how the heat flux varied with temperature for this convective problem is actually varying with the fractal dimension of the boundary for this particular system. So the roughness may also start to impact heat transfer too. There's some observation that I'm quickly going to skip over that varying the sediment load within the plume could actually change the entrainment coefficient. So this comes from lab experiments, although with rather high sediment loads. And another interesting feature is actually how do the plume source conditions impact its evolution? So you can show mathematically that they matter particularly close to the Particularly close to the grounding line and discharge points, so you eventually lose memory as you move further up. But one interesting thing, some recent lab experiments done by Earl Wilson and theory suggests is you might actually be able to get salt water and its corresponding heat that's coming with it, able to mix actually and penetrate in a salt wedge some distance into a subglacial conjuate. Okay, so I just wanted to mention very briefly. So I just wanted to mention very briefly some ongoing work and preliminary work that we're heading towards about thinking about a parameterization. How might we incorporate some of this dynamics? And what we're thinking about is using a relatively low-order flux conservative description, so something like a box model where you've got inflow exchange rates and outflow exchange rates. You can drive it with meltwater plume dynamics at one end. Plume dynamics at one end, and then you can start to think about how other factors, such as winds and buoyancy-driven exchange flows, might start to change these exchange rates in and out of the fjord and the storage of heat and salt in this particular configuration. So, I'm just going to jump ahead. So, with some very initial work, we introduced a sub-basial discharge plume into a model fjord, looked at how that flow developed in the outflow developed along the field. And the outflow developed along the fjord. So, this is a relatively simple problem. The scaling for the salt flux is perhaps not too surprising in here. But we found that we could use the plume theory to nicely predict the salt flux out of the bounce of the fjord and the exchange flow coming inwards, and importantly, the depth at which this flow is penetrating out into the background. And we could do this rather than using the full stratification, you could do it with a relatively simple approximation. Approximation. And I should shut up and I'll leave you with some conclusions. Yeah, we have a time for a couple of questions. So is the idea with the box models to, or can they be used to drive large-scale ice sheet models? Like the idea that instead of modeling every fjord, we'll have some sort of a Every fjord will have some sort of a transfer function from the ocean to the island. So, the basic idea behind this is you'd come up with scalings for how the exchange, so basically the fluxes, you'd treat this as a series of boxes that could have some storage and exchange fluxes in and out. And you could calibrate the exchange fluxes based off parameters such as the depth of the fjord. It could respond to changes in the stratification, sill depths. Soil depths and also width and length of fjord. And actually, it turns out quite a few of these parameters actually don't make a significant difference, at least in this particular case. But you could then use that as having a relatively simple description. So for each ocean grid cell, you figure out what your characteristic fjords are within that ocean grid cell in your course resolution ocean model, take in the ocean conditions, force this relatively simple exchange, and then you also can feed your mouth. Exchange and then you also can feed your mark rates back to the ice sheet in those fjords as well. One of the things I've always found hard underhand is the attraction parameterization that goes into these blue models. It also is a diversity of these things and change the print, you get quite different results. Are there laboratory experiments that help us constrain these a little bit better, or is there a particular one which you can use? Yeah, so the scaling in here. So, the scaling in here. So, scaling that's commonly assumed is you take the, you have a mass inflow, so some inflow velocity, you scale it proportional to the vertical velocity, or the velocity along the boundary there. So, that's the only direct velocity scale that there is to know about. But there's some exchange coefficient in here, which in principle could be a function of different things. Different things. So, in principle, this can depend on stratification and other things. So, there's some evidence that if you have very strongly stratified experiments, you can actually detrain quite a lot of fluid and not only entrain, so you can get some kind of peeling detrainment of parcels of fluid going out. If you've got strong subglacial discharge, there's reasonably good lab experimental constraints on what the entrainment coefficient is. So, usually Efficient is. So usually you actually measure it indirectly based off just the volume exchange. So you measure the flux coming in, how much entrainment and mixing you've had over the depth and the velocity, and then you can use that to calculate the outgoing volume flux. So for the subglacial discharge plumes, there's fairly good constraints because you've got quite strong, vigorous turbulence. But I wouldn't trust values to better than 50% or so. So that there is still a little bit of spread. Little bit of spread. And it gets a lot messier when you tilt things over and you've got stratification really starting to kick in. Okay, great. Well, let's switch over. And if anyone has a question whilst this is happening, feel free.
