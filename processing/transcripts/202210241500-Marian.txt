It's going to be Michael Marion going to be telling us about the Hagard flow theory of 1-1 knots. Cool. Thanks. Thanks for the invitation. This is great. Yeah, it's wonderful. So yeah, I want to tell you about the stuff that I did a while ago for my master's project with Liam at UBC. It's, yeah. It's yeah, I've been flip-flopping as I was rereading my thesis and not understanding parts of it. I was wondering, yeah, I guess we'll see. I was wondering which parts of this story to tell you. So let me just tell you what one nots are right away. And I think, please interrupt me if I don't define something, but I think every Don't define something, but I think every most people know what Hagar floor homology is and stuff like that. But if someone doesn't, please ask me. So let me just first of all tell you what a 11 knot is. Here's a picture of a figure eight knot. Oops, I think it's a little bit. Oops, one twist too many. One, two, three, four. That's an alternating diagram. And okay, cool. I flipped all of my crossings. Great. That's fine. So it's this figure eight knot. There's a certain way to give it a PGA diagram. It's a Higa diagram, a doubly pointed Higa diagram that has genus one. And the way to do that is to draw a torus that encompasses most of the knot. This is this torus that I'm drawing in yellow. And that intersects the knot. So it contains a large portion of the arc. Contains a large portion of the arc and inside of the solid torus. And it intersects the knot on the boundary in two points. And the hope is that if this diagram, if this torus is good enough, then you can perform some elements of the mapping class group of the boundary of the torus to unknot this arc that's on the outside. So, what that means is that this solid torus Taurus, so the boundary torus has two attaching curves on it, both of which bound disks that don't intersect the arc. So let me show you through a sequence of pictures what I mean by that. All right, so we can perform two twists over here to get a picture that looks like this.  Right, so if I performed, if I forget about the inside of the solid torus, just on the outside, there's this arc that's running around the complement of the solid torus. If I performed some mapling class group element that twists these two base points on the boundary torus, I get this picture. And in this picture, it's clear that the complementary solid torus inside of this. Inside of this Hagard splitting of S3 has this disk inside of it that does not intersect the knot. Oops. Like this, as such. So, this part of the arc is sitting behind the disk, and this part is sitting in front. And now, if you undo these twists, if you go backwards, you find that these twists, you can carry the boundary of this disk when you apply this nothing class group element, and you get back a boundary. And you get back a boundary of a disk that still doesn't intersect this arc, but that now is going to look way different. And what that does is exactly this. We'll show you in a second. So look at the displace points here. And um, yeah, so you can verify that that's an exercise you can play around with the picture, but this um this blue. This blue circle is still the boundary of this disk. I just moved around. And now, if I put back in this disk over here that did not intersect the arc of the knot inside of this yellow solitaurus, this gives me exactly a genus 1. This is a genus 1 doubly pointed. Pointed Higar diagram for the figure eight knot. It's not exactly the same thing. There's an implication that goes one way, I think. I'm not sure. So I don't really remember what it's like. So I think tunnel number one knots are one, one knots, but not all one, one knots are tunnel number one knots. If I'm remembering this correctly. So I guess this is a process through Is a process through which you take a knot that is a one one knot. Maybe you need to take a knot that is a tunnel number one knot. I'm not sure. No. Yeah, I'm not sure how to answer that question. But that's interesting. Yeah, I don't remember what a tunnel number one knot is exactly. It's like the complement of the knot. You can adjoin a single tunnel to make. To join a single tunnel to make um right I see. What's my arco in this case? It would be um I suppose an arc that connects these two points inside of the solid torus, right? Uh-huh. Yeah, uh, great question. I will not answer it. Will not answer it. Yeah. So I guess in general, right, so maybe a definition one one knots. I'd admit exactly these doubly pointed. These doubly pointed admitted genus one doubly pointed Haguard diagrams. Yeah, and what's cool about these knots is that, so again, this gives an example of a one-one knot. What's cool about these knots is that the Higger-Flohr homology can be computed completely combinatorially. You don't need to know what a pseudo-holomorphic disk is to compute because these. These so for as a reminder, Higar flow homology is computed using the G-fold symmetric product of this Higard surface, where G is the genus of the surface. In this case, this G-fold symmetric product is just the surface itself. And any pseudo-holomorphic disk inside of the surface is actually going to be inside of the surface, yeah, it's going to be just a holomorphic disk. holomorphic disk and you can um you can lift it into the universal cover and that's going to give you by the you know you can count these disks and you can um appeal to the remote mapping theorem to see to say that the disks you see the bygons you see like like this little bygone over here this little region at physical uh two cell inside of this decomposition of the surface is an actual uh surface is an actual like a unique holomorphic, gives you a unique holomorphic disk for the differential. Any questions about that? No. Cool. Yeah. So let me tell you some great. This stuff is due to this kind of procedure comes from this paper by Goda, Matsudo and Mori Fuji from 2005 called, I think this. I've called, I think, the same thing as my title, Hagar floor homology, or not floor homology of one, one knots, something like that. Yeah, here, let me just put up two more examples. So the trefoil, either the left or the right-hand trefoil. Either the left or the right-hand trepoil can be given a diagram that looks like this, with one small difference, that I'll tell you about in a second. Right, and then just to have one more example. To have one more example, let me tell you the 3-4 Taurus knot, which is the 819 knot inside of the Ralphson table. It's like this. So I'm drawing in pink, which I believe is invisible probably on the camera. The alpha curve. The logistic curve, right? Let's see what happens to the darker. So this looks like just double check five one one one. 511. Okay, so it has just for notational reasons, this arc over here. Over here is called the alpha curve. And the blue arc starts with B, it's called the beta curve. Okay, so these are my alpha curves down here, and these are my beta curves up here. Any questions so far? Yes, that's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. So this, so let me just tell you. They will be connected if I connect this point with this point over here. Okay, so the identification, that's very good. So these are diagrams in the torus where you perform this time of identification. where you perform this time identification on the horizontal arcs of the vertical arcs of the torus, but then the horizontal, there might be some twist that happens. And that's taken into account by this some parameter. So what Jacob Rasmussen figured out in, I think in a 2005 I think in a 2005 paper called not polynomials and knot homologies, is that every every one one every one one knot has a diagram a Hyga diagram As follows. So you can always find these nice parameters. They're all right. They're pretty good. They're not that easy to work with for, well, for me. But we can still do a lot. So every Giga diagram. So, every Higar diagram looks like this. It has a bunch of these rainbow arcs on the bottom. It has an equal number of rainbow arcs on the top that enclose the other type of base point. And it has a bunch of these things called bridges. So the number of The number of total intersection points between the alpha and the beta curve is called p. Over here, the number of rainbow arcs is Is Q The number of these arcs these these bridges that that turn is called R turning bridges and then S is this parameter that tells you that the base point on the bottom if this is called If this is called xi, then the one on the top is called, we'll label it xi plus s, meaning that you need to, well, this specifies how you how you glue the top and the bottom, specifies the twisting. And indeed, if you have any non-zero number of these non-turning bridges, you're going to have to twist at least once or something to get. Something to get to get the beta curve to be a connected circle. Cool. So this, yeah, the computation of the Notflower homology is really, really easy at this point. You just like stare at these diagrams. Maybe you want to draw them in the universal cover, and you can compute maybe CFK as a Um, as a I'll fill in the blanks in a bit, but let's see for this. Um, I call this base point W and I call this base point Z. So I, for some reason, I don't know. These are the W and Z base points in standard here for homology. So we know that for 3, 1, the let's see, for the right-hand. Let's see for the right-handed trepoil knot, the homology looks like this. Well, it's not really, it's a maybe I'm writing down CFK as a maybe type D structure. So this is a This is a type D structure over this string is a group. It's a vector space over F with some generators and a differential that's specified by mapping between the generators with by attaching some algebra element of this algebra, FO join UV. So in this case. So, in this case, this is how I write it down. This contains all the information from the Higar floor chain complex. I know this means that there is a pseudo-holomorphic disk between these two intersection points that covers the W base point once, and similarly over here. And for 4,1, it looks like this. This is the pictures that I got in the habit of drawing. And then for 819. 819, it's which is the knot on my t-shirt. It's the first thick knot. It looks like this. So, this thickness in this context corresponds to seeing some bigger than one powers of u and v on the algebra elements. U and V on the algebra elements. U U V. Cool. So the question that I'm that was asked and that, oh, okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. So, yeah. I can only sit with the two. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. So instead of saying like R turning bridges, I could have shifted the top to a different diagram with the other set of straight bridges within R. Yeah, yeah. So these diagrams are non-unique. So I guess maybe I should say that let's see. Let's see. S should be some element of Z mod PZ. And indeed, these diagrams, these PQRS, don't uniquely specify a knot. And I think they also don't uniquely specify a genus one Higgard diagram. Is that true? No, I mean, if you twisted them the other way, then your diagram wouldn't look the same. You'd have to also like wrote, like, your turning bridges would turn right. Your turning bridges would turn right instead of left, and then you're like, Yeah, I yeah, so um, so I have, yeah, it's it's a diagram that is exactly like this: some number of rainbow arcs, some number of left-turning bridges from bottom to top, the same number of rainbows, and then these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Cool. So let me just tell you quickly what So, let me just tell you quickly what theorem Green, Lollin, and Bafay approved in 2018, which is this very nice, very, very pretty result for the detection of when are you able to do surgery on the knot and have the result be an L space. Should I define L space? Or is that okay? No. Okay, cool. So K. K is maybe you know these, but these guys are L-space knots. The right-handed trefoil, the torus knot, torus knots are L-space knots, and this one isn't. And they notice that the there's an underlying result which you can use to look at this diagram right away and see if this is an L-space naught or not. And they use that, but let me just, I'll just tell you. But let me just, I'll just tell you the result because it's very, it's very easy to detect. So, k is an L-space knot for K11. So K is 11. This is if and only if K admits a genus one, a one-one diagram. One, a one-one diagram that is what they call coherent. But I'll just tell you the definition of this in one shot. That is to say where an orientation is. Orientation. There exists an orientation on there exists an orientation on beta such that alpha and beta coherently orient the boundary of every So you pick an orientation on beta. Let me tell you over here that I sort of lied to you a little bit for this. So this s is one down here. And over here, if I pick the parameter s equals to zero, I can. S equals to zero, I get the left-handed trefoil, but I don't know, I have the right-handed trefoil over here, so I'll just tell you that you can get the right-handed trefoil by putting over here also s equals to one. So if this is x1 and this is x2, then we get the right-handed trifoidal. So that means that this is x2 and this is x3. And okay, this is okay. By their theorem, this is an L-space knot. If I put any diagram that has a single rainbow arc is going to be an L-space, a diagram for an L-space knot, because you can always pick an orientation over here that whatever orientation you pick, make it go over here in this direction. And then this rainbow is going to, its boundary is going to be coherent. Its boundary is going to be coherently oriented by alpha plus beta. Same thing over here. Great. But then if you look at a diagram for the figure eight, so you can take this and put it in normal form. So for four and for one. If you follow the orientation around, no matter what If you follow the orientation around, no matter how you orient beta, you're going to end up having opposite orientations on these two rainbow arcs. And that's all it is. That's what their theorem says. Super easy. You follow the thing around. You can write a computer program that takes in these parameters, PQS, and tells you very quickly from a 1-1 diagram whether or not is an L-space. Is um an L space not or not? Yeah, what was a rainbow bygone? Oh, sorry, a rainbow bygone is one of these bygons that's really obvious. This is uh the question was, what was a rainbow bygone? One of these bygons that is you see it immediately inside of this, um, inside of. Inside of this, inside of this square diagram of a torus. There's only two of them, but there's always two of them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's always two. So it turns out you can just check the bottom, the bottom rainbow bygons. Oh, there's also this one. This is a rainbow bygone. Maybe also this one is a rainbow bygone. Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, so it's a bygone that is bounded by a rainbow arc together with a piece of the alpha. Together with a piece of the alpha curve. Yeah. Thanks. Cool. So in the background, there's this theorem by Jake and Sarah Res-Mussen, which says that in my notation over here, K inside of an L space is Is well an L-space knot. So a knot that admits, again, these are non-trivial surgeries. These knots, they are all knots that live inside of a lens space. So I defined for you how to do this procedure for knots inside of S3. In general, if you remove the base point W, you're going to get a Higher diagram for the ambient manifold, and then you can. ambient manifold and then you can you see that it's a genus one he get diagram so on um so there's always the zero or the infinity surgery that is going to give you an l space but um we're looking for non-trivial l space surgeries so is an l space uh not if and only if the statement is if and only if cfk consists of staircases Of staircases. Okay, this is a little bit false because you can have positive L-space naughts and negative L-space naughts, and I'm just omitting all of that. And I guess you have positive staircases and negative staircases like over. Oh, no, these are all negative staircases. But yeah, so this is a staircase. This is not a staircase. And this is a staircase. Okay, a definition by example. Questions? So this is kind of a hard. Well, I think this is this theorem of. This theorem of Jake and Sarah S. Musson kind of relies on pretty good analysis of the, like, it relies on some stuff that Ojvad and Sabo did, and also Steve Boyer and some collaborators. And my project for my master's was to provide a reproof of this theorem, which is very nice, only in terms of immersed curve, the immersed curve formalism. immersed curve formalism. So I succeeded in doing that, but not really, I mean, for some for some 1-1 knots with an additional technical restriction that I think probably doesn't apply to any knots, but I kind of stopped thinking about it after my master's. So let me tell you. Yeah, so the goal Merced curve techniques, maybe. Yeah, any questions? Yeah. Oh, Joshua Green, Sam Lawalen, and Fara Mars the Fire. The fair. I'm gonna try to pronounce that last name. Um, cool. So the idea isn't Rasmussen theorem just for one, one knot. No, it's for any knot inside of an L space. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, this is a that's actually a very cool characterization also. But this one, um, This one, this theorem right shortcuts the computation of the chain floor complex in figure floor homology. The yeah, chain floor complex. Yeah, so in these last 15 minutes, maybe I'll tell you a little bit about what I did. So, I guess I do need to tell you a little bit about this notation. So, in So, in 2018, Robert Lipschitz, Peter Auschwatt, and William Thurston figured out how to do bordered floor homology. Bordered floor theory. And what they do is that they take a manifold with boundary. manifold with boundary that you know you have to identify with a specific you have to identify its explicitly its its homeomorphism type of the boundary um which is some surface this is a um something like an oriented maybe compact three manifold With boundary, they give they spit out these two invariants. They're called CFD of Y, and it also depends on the specified identification, and also CFA. And this is algebraically a little bit more involved. This, you need to use type D structures. This is a type D structure. D structures. This is a type D structure over some algebra. And this is an A infinity module, I think, something like that. And they tell you how to spit out these two invariants. This Y should really be an M. And they also tell you how to. And they also tell you how to glue together two manifolds with boundary along their common boundary and compute the Higger-Floor homology from the bordered invariance of the pieces. And the way that they write that down is also, so this, one, and then two, the epistemology of a manifold identified along its boundary of sorry, two manifolds with similar Two manifolds with similar homeomorphic boundaries identified along their boundaries. This is you can identify this with something like CFD hat of M1 tensor product, but it's a funny tensor product where the differential behaves in a slightly more complicated way with CFA hat. And so what Hanselman, Rasmussen, and Watson. Rasmussen and Watson showed in around the same time. I think, yeah, probably. The publication date. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How about that? Yeah, they realized that in the case of Taurus boundary, if the boundary of the manifold is Of the manifold is you can identify it with torus, then the algebra, you know, the algebra is simple, and CFD hat of the manifold is homotopy equivalent to a kind of a simple a simple type D structure. Structure. And this can be embedded inside of the torus, the boundary torus, with a point removed. And this embedding is sort of faithful. So if this the dotted transformation is the same. The dotted transformation is something that they call HF of M2. And yeah, so the idea is that this chain homotopy, this simple type D structure, when you embed inside of the correctly parameterized torus, has the same, this curve over here. So embed as a curve. This curve contains all the information of the type D structure. Of the type D structure. It's a curve with potentially some extra complications, which is a, what is it, like a vector bundle on the curve, maybe. And what happens is that, let me just tell you for these, yeah, for these examples. Over here, let me take you through the universal cover just for comparison. In the universal cover, this picture looks like this. Let me just give you a second. So this one, where the base points are here. So, to draw this picture correctly, I have to. So, this is the way that this shift manifests itself, this S parameter, it makes the picture, it makes these base points be aligned a little bit weirdly, but it makes for some nice pictures, I think. So, let me tell you what HF hat is. So, this is a universal cover picture of the Of the of just the Hagar diagram. So the Hagar diagram in the universal cover, Higar, the immersed curve invariant in the universal cover of the torus that is punctured once. So this torus looks like this. So it turns out that this is out that for one one L-space knots, the immersed curve invariant is really the same thing as the Is really the same thing as just the Higar diagram, up to figuring out what to do with the base points. And that's kind of curious. And that's basically the underlying reason why I started looking at this, I think. This is what prompted Liam to ask me this question, I think. This diagram looks a little bit This diagram looks a little bit funny, but I'm not going to draw it. I'm going to draw this diagram instead. So I'm going to draw the diagram for the figure eight knot. In the universal cover. And it looks something like this. And it looks something like this. Sorry. So, um, this I think the picture looks something like this. That's right, right? Cool. But over here for non-L-space knots, it's not really clear what the procedure is from looking at this. I mean, you can, so the way that the immersed curve thing works is that you construct these, you construct a chain complex, and then you have to do this reduction where you delete any. Where you delete any arrows that have both u and v on them. So you're taking a reduction, you're losing some information. So you take this type D structure over FU adjoined V, and then you basically look at it as a quotient where you make U times V equals zero. And that allows you to do some, that allows you to do the linear algebra that goes inside of this chain homotopy that takes a type D structure here to something that's very, very simple. Structure here to something that's very, very simple that can be embedded inside the torus. So you're saying you have these equivalents for electronic three on the one one knot from 819 the 01? So these are all 1,100. This is no longer 819. I'm sorry, that's confusing. This is now, I'm trying to show you an example of a trying to show you an example of a knot that is not an L-space knot. Yeah, so what I was saying is that for L-space knots, you have this equivalence, but then Have this equivalence, but then for non-L space non it's a little bit confusing. So, what I did for my work that I did is that under some additional condition, it turns out that these, like looking at these bygons can be quite, quite complicated. You can have all sorts of crazy stuff happening. And it was not at all clear to me at that time how to really get a good hold of the combinatorics, like how to control it to check whether. You know, check whether certain bygones can exist or not. But yeah, so under an additional technical assumption that I won't, well, I'll just tell you the name, but I won't tell you what it is. So this is the theorem without appealing. So it's basically the same thing as GLV. The same thing as GLV. This is, I guess, due to me. I can, how do I say this? Maybe proof of GLV. Without appealing to Appealing to that theorem of Jake and Sarah Resmussen or so-called graphic pure one one knots. And this is really just a condition to ensure that certain really crazy bygones don't show up. The main idea, I guess, let me just tell you the main idea is that you see over here that, I mean, the work of Hansel von Rasmussen and Watson tells us that if you want to compute surgery on a knot, you look at the border invariant and then you take your surgery. Invariant, and then you take your surgery slope and you put it over here, and you overlay these two lines and you count intersection points, which is a very pretty result. It's a very pretty way of thinking about things. Like once you have the curves, getting the curves sometimes is a little gnarly. But once you have the curves, you can do this. And you see over here that there are a bunch of surgery slopes that give you that intersect this blue curve in a single point. So these surgery slopes give you. So, these surgery slopes give you L-spaces. And what happens over here, any surgery slope that you draw is going to intersect the curve in at least two points somehow in each for each, yeah, yeah, because of this figure eight that shows up. And the reason that this figure eight shows up should really be because somehow there's a curving backwards that happens inside of the diagram over here, which is the same reason why when you orient the beta curve. When you orient the beta curve, you get rainbow arcs that go in opposite directions. Yeah, so it's sort of, I guess, as concluding remarks. Concluding remarks. It's still kind of an interesting question to short circuit the passage from a Higger diagram to the immersed curve. That would be a cool result. I mean, I can, it's fine and all for L-space 1, 100s, but even for like for other 1,100s, I'm not really sure what to do. And yeah, I think I think this. I think this condition should somehow doesn't matter. Shouldn't matter. I couldn't find any example of a 1-1-0 that doesn't satisfy this condition. But to be fair, I mean, I didn't look at super, super many examples. I wrote a computer program that basically does implements GLV's criterion. But then I still kind of have to, I'm not sure how to do except by looking by hand at these knots to figure out. At these knots to figure out what the pythons look like. Um yeah, that's all. Anybody here or online got any questions for me? Hi. So, I don't even know if I know enough to state this question properly, but if you wanted to study health-based surgery, If you wanted to study health space surgeries on satellite knots, do you get more mileage from understanding it in the immersed curve picture than just in the sort of the original sort of just the base knots Hagar diagrams picture? So I was just kind of curious if, for example, reproof or the ideas that would go in, you know, go into this kind of thing, if they're better suited, for example, to understanding L-space surgeries on satellite knots where you'd want to use kind of, you know. Where you'd want to use kind of the bordered structure here. That wasn't available if you were just looking at straight up one-one knots in fail space. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure about that. I should clarify, I mean, like with like one-one patterns or whatever the appropriate notion is. But I'm not sure. Is that something that maybe Wang Zhao would know about? Liam? Okay. So what I did not say, but Liam said, is sorry. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what you said. I'm sorry. I was wondering if, like, I know that when Ja was talking about tetra knots, and you have this like interesting, interesting. It's interesting of computing the immersed curve invariant for satellite operations. And I think, yeah, Liam answered the question, but I'm not sure in what sense, to what extent. Well, I could repeat the words I remembered of what he said, but I don't know if that would be helpful. Anybody got any further questions in the room or online? If not, then let's thank me high again.
