Thanks a lot for the invitation to be here. It's a pity that we cannot meet in person, which would be much nicer. However, even like this, it's really nice to have such a nice meeting. So I'm going to talk about joint work with two friends, Carmen Cortazar and Navy Bolanski. The problem The problem looks quite simple, except for this value alpha here. This is just the heat equation. So, this is a heat equation with an initial data, which is assumed to be in L1. At some points, I will also ask it to be in Lp. And well, what's this alpha all about? I have here a caputo fractional derivative. It is called like that. It is called like that. It is named after Caputos, though it has been introduced in several contexts by other people. The first one that apparently used this kind of non-local derivatives is Louville in the 19th century. So let's look at this definition of derivative. Here you have a derivative of a non-local integral, an integral An integral of fractional order of order one minus alpha. So you have a derivative of an integral of order one minus alpha. This is a kind of integral of order minus alpha. That's a derivative of order alpha. The interesting point is that this is good to model problems with memory because in order to compute the derivative you need all the history, all the past history of the solution starting from the initial time. The initial time. Hence, as I have said, these equations are good for to model materials with memory. And it's also good to model phenomena with anomalous diffusion in which the mean square displacement does not grow asymptotically like linearly, but like power t to the alpha. Then this equation looks so simple that one wonders whether So simple that one wonders whether there's still something to be said about it, and in fact, there is much more than one believes. In this talk, I will discuss the large-scale behavior of solutions. Well, it's easy to see that solutions go to zero. So the question is how they do so. We are interested in the intermediate asymptotics. We would like to understand, we would like to obtain the rates at which solutions approach zero in different Which solutions approach zero in different LP norms. And once you correct the solution with the, in order to cancel the decay, we would like to know whether we approach whether the solution approaches some profile. And this has just appeared in the Journal of Functional Analysis a couple of weeks ago. So let me review what happens in the local case. In the local case, when alpha equals to one, when you have the local heat equation, I want to do this because of two reasons. The first one is to see whether we can get some ideas from the local case. And the second one is, as we will see, there are big differences, not only quantitative difference, big qualitative differences between the local and the local cases. And I want to stress that. Want to stress that so? Um, let's start from the local heat equation with the local heat equation. I have the local heat equation with an initial datum in L1, and well, I can construct the solution with this initial datum just taking the convolution of the initial datum with the fundamental solution of the equation. And everyone in this audience knows that the fundamental solution has a similar form, it's given by a similar. It's given by a certain negative power of t, t to the minus n over two, times a profile which is evaluated in a self-similar variable, which is x over two to the one half. This is important, this will be important. And the profile f has the well-known Gaussian form. Okay, this profile has several. This profile has several nice properties. First of all, it is positive. Second, it is C infinity. And third, it's in all LPS spaces from one to infinity. And this produces nice smooth effects. Even when the initial datum is only in L1, the solution will immediately enter into C infinity and will enter all LP spaces from 1 to infinity. Then, by using, for example, scaling methods. For example, scaling methods plus compactness, one can show that any solution of the problem approaches a multiple of the fundamental solution. In the sense that when you multiply the difference between u and mu times gamma, this mu is nothing but the integral of the initial datum. This goes in L P norm to zero, even when you multiply this difference by This difference by this power, this power. That is dictated by the homogeneity of the equation and by the norm. Okay, so this gives you an optimal decay rate for the solution since, well, an easy computation, direct computation shows that the LP norm of the fundamental solution multiplied by the same power that they had here, the same The same power that I had here, the same power that I had here, this same power, this kind of the natural power, this is equal, this is equal to the LP norm of the profile. This is a constant. And hence, if mu is different from zero, remember that mu is nothing but the integral of the initial datum. If mu is different from zero, this tells you that the global LP rate of u at time, the global LP norm of u at time t. L p norm of u at time t is comparable to t to the minus n over two times one minus one over p. Okay, if mu is zero, then you have a faster decay, but I wouldn't want to discuss that. This global result that I have just described gives precise information on the profiles, on the profile of the solution once you scale. Solution once you scale the solution properly in different space-time scales. But now I have to distinguish between different space-time scales if I want to have this precise information. So first of all, I have inner scales. Let's call them like this. In inner scales, x may go to infinity, but it will do so more slowly than the square root of t. So, I have in some sense slow scales, slow as compared to the scale dictated by this similar variable. So, I'm going to consider inner sets I of g of t that consist of points x that have norm less or equal than c times g of t, and this g is a little o of t of the square root of t. Hence, in cell. Hence, in self-similar variables, in self-similar variables that are given by x over the square root of t, the self-similar variable for such points is going to zero. Hence, okay, when I look at the fundamental solution, I am only seeing the value at the origin of the profile because xi is going to zero in these sets. So, what I have from now on, I am only going to From now on, I am only going to describe what happens in the n-infinity norm, but things can be also obtained for other epinores. But in order to, for the sake of probability, I will only consider this case. Then what I have is that if I multiply u by t to the n over 2, I am going to approach a constant. The constant is just the value of the Gaussian at zero times of the profile. Times of the profile, yeah, times mu, which is all that you keep from the initial data. Then, in the diffusive scale, it is here that most of the dynamics is going on. In the diffusive scale, the diffusive scale consists of points that are of the order of the square root of t. So let's consider this kind of sets. Let's consider this kind of sets, d of t. Points in these kind of sets, if you look at them in self-similar variables, you have a that the self-similar variable is bounded between constants. This constant from below is away from zero. And then what happens is that you will really see details of the profile of the self-similar solution when you study the asymptotic behavior. Behavior. And finally, have outer scales. I'm looking here at points that go to infinity faster than the square root of t. Faster than the square root of t. These are outer scales or fast scales. These fast scales in self-similar variables correspond to points going to infinity in self-similar variables. Okay? But then when I look at the fundamental solution, I am looking at the tail of the profile. Am looking at the tail of the profile. And well, the profile is going to zero at infinity. So, in fact, in this case, the global result that I have just described does not give such a nice information. It does not give information about profiles. It says something, but the only thing that you obtain is that the only information that you obtain is that in fast scales, the solution is going to zero faster than t to the minus n over two. Okay. Okay. If you want to know something else about fast scales, then in general, you have to give a more precise information about the initial data. Not much is known about this issue, not even for the local heat equation. But let me talk about this very nice paper by Reis from 1999 that is not very well known, but this paper is really very interesting. It gives a lot of information. lot of information, of interesting information. One of the things that the paper says is that in the case in which the initial datum looks precisely at infinity, like a times x to the minus beta, with beta bigger than n, so that so that the initial datum is integrable. Then do you still The fundamental solution still gives a precise description of general solutions in this family in slightly fast scales. What do I mean by slightly fast scales? What I mean is that this description by the fundamental solution, this description is not only Is not only valid for points that move like the square root of t, you can also add here a log t. So you can go a bit further away. And the important point is that you in such sets will behave like mu times the fundamental solution and in relative error, in relative error. So the rate at which you approach The rate at which you approach the profile, the asymptotic profile, will be a bit different if you are in a slightly faster scale, but you will still see the profile. If you do the right correction, you will still see the profile of the, you will see the Gaussian profile. And then what happens in very fast scales, if you move faster than what I said before, then what happens, and this is very interesting, is that in fact the behavior for In fact, the behavior for times bigger than zero of u still satisfies that x to the beta times u is equal to a, like I had for the initial data. And then you have an error, but essentially in first approximation, the behavior in very fast scales is given just by the initial data. So you don't have diffusion in very fast scales. Fast scales. Okay. Well, from this, there's an idea that I would like to keep in mind, an interesting idea. This idea is that global results do not always give optimal results in all scales. Okay, so the global result that they have for the heat equation gives optimal results in all scales, but not in fast scales. And well, the idea is that it may be. Well, the idea is that it may be interesting to study separately the large state behavior of this kind of equations of evolution equations and separately in different scales. As we will see in the case of equations with memory, like the one in which I have this Caputo derivative, this is essential. It's not just to study some funny, very fast scales. We will need to do this. Very fast scales. We will need to do this to understand, for example, what's going on in compact sets. So let's pass to the fractional case, to the case of a caputo derivative. So now alpha is going to be, alpha is going to be between 0 and 1. In this case, I also have a fundamental solution. Let's call it z here. And I, okay, by taking the convolution of the initial datum with this fundamental solution. Of the initial datum with this fundamental solution, I get a solution in some sense of the equation of the problem. This is a linear problem. So let's discuss a bit how this fundamental solution looks like, because this will be very important. I can take Fourier transform and then I will get that the Fourier transform of the fundamental solution satisfies a nice OD for each fixed. For each fixed value of the Fourier variable mu. And what I get is that I get this OD. It's a fractional ODE. This is the novelty. It's a fractional ODE. It's a fractional OD and I have an initial data, which is one. And then, unfortunately, people know how to solve these fractional ODEs. And the solution of these fractional ODEs will... the solution of this fractional OD is well known. It's given by, okay, it's given now it's not given by an exponential, it's given by a special function E alpha, which is a metag level of function of order alpha. We do not care much about the details of this, but there's a special function giving you the solution. And it's this special function evaluated at minus nu squared times t to the alpha. Then when I take inverse Fourier transform, when I take inverse Fourier transform, When I take the inverse Fourier transform, I get that the fundamental solution also in this case has a self-similar form. But now there are three changes. Now the power that I have in front of the profile is a bit different. I have here the alpha. I have alpha also in the subsimilar variable. Here, now I now have that the subsimilar variable is x over t to the alpha halves. And now f is not a Gaussian anymore. f is not a Gaussian anymore. Now f is a special function of family. Well, there's this family has been well studied. We do not care much. I will explain things that are important for us about this F, but this is a radial function, a radial FOXH function, whatever this means. And okay, the first novelty as compared with the local case is that F does not belong to the local local location. case is that f is does not belong to c1. And as a consequence, the solution that I obtain, the function that I obtained by convolution of z with the with u0 is in general not a classical solution. It's only a mild solution. My solution, this is a kind of weak solution. Well, in fact, it's a solution in some sense. When I talk about solutions, I will talk about solutions of Solutions, I will talk about solutions obtained by convolution with Z. So let me say a bit more about this F. Let me see what the problems are. I know that this is not C1, but things are even worse in some cases. This F, there are nice bounds for them. They are positive and they are bounded in dimensions two and three by the fundamental solution of the Fundamental solution of the Laplacian, of the Laplacian. So f is less or equal than En of psi for n greater or equal than 3, and this is less or equal than 1 plus E2 of psi when n is equal to 2. This EN is nothing but the power 2 minus n for n greater or equal than 3, and it's the logarithm for n equal to 2. And if n is equal to 1, things are nice. Well, nice. As I said, the function is not C1, but it's bounded, the profile. The profile. These bounds are sharp at the origin. In fact, if you take the quotient between f and the fundamental solution of the Laplacian, this approaches a constant. This constant will be important in the sequel, a constant kappa as psi goes to zero if n is greater equal than two. So there is really a singular, these functions are singular at the origin. And this This has to do with memory, and this yields memory effects in the solutions because when you look at the solution at MT at a certain point, the initial datum at points close to the one you are considering are much more important than the initial datum at other points. Okay, and well, what happens at infinity? At infinity, things are not so bad. The solution. So, but the solution is f is smooth outside the origin, and f has an exponential decay at infinity. Okay, you have here a power, but you can kill this with the exponential. So the main problem comes from the behavior of this function at the origin, not at infinity. So the first consequence of this singular behavior at the origin is that f does not belong to lp for all values of p. For all values of p. So, what I have is that it belongs to L P if and only if, well, in dimension one, there's no problem, it belongs to L P for all values of P. In dimension two, it only belongs to L P if P is finite. And in dimension greater or equal than three, F belongs to L P if and only if F is below some critical value P C, which is nothing but n over n minus two. So values of P in this range, values of P in this range here, In this range here, are called subcritical. And well, I have a smoothing effect, L1 Lp, if P is subcritical, but I do not have this smoothing effect if P is not subcritical. So if I want to say something for P, for not subcritical values of P, in principle, I have to, and I want to say something about L P norms. I need an additional assumption on the initial datum. On the initial data. For example, it would be enough to require that U not is in LP. And this is enough to guarantee that U at later times is in L P. And I will make this assumption. This can be weakened, but okay, to make things simple, I will make this assumption if P is not so critical. So what is known about the rates? What is known about the rates? For the rates, If P is subcritical, if P is subcritical, the decay rate is the expected one. This is the expected one. I have this alpha here. This is the only difference as compared with the local case. But there is a big difference if P is not subcritical. If P is not subcritical, instead of having the natural expected rate of decay, I have a fixed decay that does not depend on N or on P, and it's the same for. And it's the same for all values of p or of n, it's t to the minus alpha. Let me tell you that this rate of decay is exactly the one that you have for the problem posed in bounded domains with zero Dirichlet boundary condition. And there is an exception in this result. And well, this exception comes from the case n equal to 2 and p equal to infinity. Here I have, so to say, two critical problems that I have the problem of dimension, technicality. Have the problem of dimension, the criticality coming from dimension, and the criticality coming from the fact that I have P equal to P C. And well, this was proved by Kempine, Siljander, Bergar, and Sacher in 2016. If P is finite, and for P finite, it was proved in this paper with my collaborators. And well, in fact, this change in behavior was described, was already noticed by Campaign in Netal, but they described it as a critical. Described it as a critical dimensional phenomenon. They considered p-fixed, and they noticed that if n is above this critical value, then you have this fixed decay rate. While for dimensions that are below this value, then you have the spectacle. Okay, so what can you say about the profiles? The first thing is that I have a global. The first thing is that I have a global result, but only for p self-critical. If peaks are critical, then you will approach a multiple of the fundamental solution, even when you multiply the difference by this expected factor. And this was proved in a certain range by Kempagni Netal, and we completed the proof for values of P up to the critical value in our paper. What, okay, this, as I said, As I said, there is a problem with the fundamental solution, but the problem is only at the origin, not away from the origin. So we were able to prove that in outer sets, in outer sets, if x is greater or equal than c times g of t, with in fact taking g of t like t to the alpha over 2, so that in self-similar variables I am away from the origin, then I still have this result that I had here. This result that I had here. But I have to avoid, I have to skip the origin. Okay, I have to skip the origin in self-singular variables. So from these two global results, I can obtain local I can obtain results in specific scales. In dimension one, even in compact sets or slow scales, I am in the subcritical case, so everything. Critical case, so everything is more or less like in the local case where alpha is equal to one. In the diffusive scale, in the diffusive scale, I can use this result in outer sets, this result in outer sets. And I still, from now on, I will always explain what happens in the L-infinity norm, but things can be said for other LP norms. In the physical scales, I still approach a multiple of the profile, which is fine. Profile of the profile, which is finite if ψ is finite. Xi is the subsidiary variable. In fast scales, again, the global result says something, but since I'm only seeing the tail of the profile of the fundamental solution, and this goes to pseudo-infinity, then what I get is only that the solution decays faster than t to the minus alpha n over 2. Okay, and then I again we can Again, we can do something similar to what the right did. If we demand some specific decay at the origin from the initial datum, then in slightly fast scales, slightly fast scales means this, this here, I can go a bit further than the diffusive scale, then I still approach the fundamental solution in relative error. And the way, if I mean, if I look at faster. I mean, if I look at faster scales, if I look at faster scales, then there's no diffusion. What I see is the initial datum. And the fact that you can prove this has to do with the fact that F looks at infinity like, okay, that it has this behavior at infinity. So let me tell you that the difference, what tells you what is the What separates the slash fast scales from very fast scales? This happens when the initial datum is equal to the fundamental solution. That's how you decide what will dominate. And let's pass to the what does it remain? It remains to say what happens in dimensions two bigger or equal than two in slow scales or compact sets. And this is. Compact sets, and this is what we have the main novelty for these non-local problems. And okay, I will tell you what happens for dimensions greater than three. In dimension n equal to two, you have other critical phenomena, but okay, things are not look more or less like what you have in dimension greater equal than three. So, for dimension greater, I'm going to describe first what happens in the slow scales, slow scales going to infinity. So, I'm looking at points that go to infinity. At points that go to infinity, go to infinity, but they do solve more slowly than to the alpha over 2. This is the diffusive scale dictated by the scaling invariance of the condition. So I'm looking at points of the form eta times g of t. Eta is between small c and capital C. These are constants, finite constants is different from zero. And what I get is that Get is that this, if I look at u at such points and multiply this by t to the alpha times g of t times n minus 2, so for each scale I have a different decay rate, I will approach a multiple of the fundamental solution of the Laplacian. So this is kind of new. This constant comes from initial data, the mu, and kappa, okay, this kappa has to do with the behavior of the With the behavior of the profile of the phenomena solution at the Earth. And well, in fact, this looks very different from what I had said before, but it's not such, there's not such a big difference because, in fact, the point is that, okay, you are looking at, in fact, if you look at the fundamental solution at points of the form eta times g of t, and g of t is a little over t to the alphabet 2, in fact, these points in sub-similar variables. These points in subsimilar variables are going to zero. So you are just seeing the fundamental solution, the fundamental solution at the origin, and then you can substitute it. You can substitute the profile by its behavior. So in fact, this looks like precisely like t to the minus alpha times g of t to the two minus n times kappa times the fundamental solution of the Laplace. Okay. Okay, so this is not how you prove things, but this is how you know what you have to prove. Okay, and then it only remains to say what happens in compact sets. In compact sets, okay, compact sets are kind of the limit when you take G equal constant in this computation that I had here. But if you take G constant, this will, if G is constant, the rate of decay will be. decay the rate of decay will be just t to the minus alpha okay t to the minus alpha and in fact what you will have is that in in an infinity norm t to the minus alpha is a is a more is it decays more slowly than t to the minus alpha times n over 2 okay which is the decay rate in outer sets so what i am saying is that i expect What I am saying is that I expect the decay rate like T2M alpha in compact sets and I expect them to dominate the global decay rate. And this is what I have in my last slide or last, yeah, nearly last slide. In compact sets, what I have said is that I expect to have the same decay rate as for the D-D problem, for the problem posed in a bounded domain with. In a bounded domain with zero boundary conditions. And this, okay, it's not written anywhere, but it's known, it's for clear that the solution approaches a solution in separate variables that is given by t to the minus alpha times, a constant times, a profile u. And this profile u is nothing but the solution of this problem, minus Laplacian of U equal to U naught. This is the initial datum. This, okay, this is, these are all. Okay, this is these are all memory effects that make the initial database play an important role. And then, okay, this makes sense also if you look at the solution in the whole space. How would you compute the solution of minus Laplacian of U equal to U naught in the whole space? Okay, this is nothing but the Newtonian potential. And in fact, this is what we have. What we have is that in compact sets, the solution will approach after being multiplied by T to the algorithm. After being multiplied by T to the alpha, it will approach a multiple, a multiple of the Newtonian potential of the initial data. Here, this is the phi, this is the Newtonian potential of the initial data. Okay, this is multiplied by kappa, because in fact, where does this power come from? This power comes from the behavior at the origin of the fundamental solution. And this behavior at the origin has a kappa. So, to summarize, the main idea. To summarize, the main idea to keep in mind is that in all these kinds of problems, it may be a good idea to study separately the large-time behavior in different scales. And in fact, in this case, we observe different behaviors in compact sets, slow scales, diffusive scales, and fast scales. And the point is that if P is not self-critical, if P is not self-critical, the global decay rate, and hence the global profile, will be dictated by what happens in compact sets. By what happens in compact sets, while if P is not sub-critical, and this includes large values of P, in particular P equals infinity, okay, no, the other way around. If P is not sub-critical, this includes P infinity. The behavior is dominated by what happens in compact sets. If P is sub-critical, this includes the case P equals one. What matters is what happens in the diffusive scale. That is where most of the mass is. is. So p equal one, diffusive scale dominates, p equal infinity, compact sets dominate. And this is all I wanted to say. Thanks for your attention. And okay, this is a picture of Oaxaca where we should all be now enjoying such a nice place. So thanks a lot for your attention. Thank you, Fernando, for the very beautiful talk. Okay, so any question? Hi, Mateo. I'm Nikita here. Can I ask a question? Yeah, sure. Hi, Fernando. Hi, how are you? Very good. Thank you. I have a question. I have a question. I didn't understand. So, the fundamental solution for this parabolic equation of memory has is not in L infinity. It's not in L infinity in dimensions, except in dimension one. So it's singular at the origin. Yeah, that this is what makes the solution uh singular when uh when you are in dimension bigger than three. When you are dimension bigger than three, yeah. So, if you want to have a, for example, a bounded solution, you have to ask the initial datum to be in L infinity. If not, the solution will not be there, but well, even if you ask the initial datum to be in L infinity, to be bounded, so that the solution is bounded, the behavior is not going to be given. So that's the point. Even when the solution is bounded, because the missile datum is bounded, the behavior cannot be given by the fundamental solution. Behavior cannot be given by the fundamental solution because it's not bounded, okay. But it's not bounded at the origin, so it's at the origin or in compact sets that it will not be given by this, the behavior will not be given by the fundamental solution. But in outer sets, the fundamental solution is still giving the behavior. And do you think that you can prove convergence in that error in outer sets for sufficiently the? For sufficiently decaying initial data? Yeah, you can do this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you can do this in sufficiently large sets. But well, this reminds me to what you did with Matteo for the fast efficiency equation. We only know how to do, okay, we know how to do this for very specific initial atoms like these ones. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, okay. So it resembles more or less the situation that is known for the classical heat equation. For the classical heat equation. And I know that for fast efficient equations, you can say more. But not in this case, you can say more or less the same as you can say for the local heat equation. The only thing is that what are slightly faster scales is a bit different. Instead of having this here, you have here an alpha and you have a power. Uh, you have a power that involves alpha also on top of the logarithm. So it's it's here. I think it's here. Yeah. Yeah, this is the result. Yeah, but it looks pretty much the same as what you have for the local case. For the local case. Yeah, so this is not so different. I mean, this has to do with the behavior of the profile at infinity. The main difference, what is really different, comes from the fact that the fundamental solution is not bounded. The meta solution is not banded at the only. So it cannot give the behavior of bounded solutions. It's impossible. It's not in LP if P is supercritical or critical. So it cannot give the behavior in LP norms if P is not subcritical. It cannot. Okay, thank you. Yeah. So Fernando has. So, Fernando, I have a small question. Can you show me the value of P critical? Because maybe I don't remember it. It's n over n minus 2. Okay, so it looks like, well, it doesn't depend on alpha, actually. No, no, it doesn't depend on alpha at all. This has to do with the, I mean, with the fundamental solution of the Laplacian. Okay, so. So, in fact, if you are at PC. In fact, if you are at PC, then the fundamental solution is in the machine chemical space, and in fact, you have a smoothing effect and so on. And okay, so let me tell you something that is related to this. We also have results, I mean, and they have also been published if you substitute the Laplacian by the fractional Laplacian. And then, okay, then this plays a role. So, this does not depend on alpha, but the critical value. Uh, the critical value will depend on s, and you will have instead of n over n minus two, you will have n over n minus two s. And uh, okay, yeah, and that's it, yeah, yeah. And then, but you more or less, but then the computations are once you understand how you have to deal with the cases equal to one, you more or less do the same things and you get s different from one. The only difference between these two cases comes from very fastest case. Very fast scales. In very fast scales, there are some differences in the computations, but except for that, what I mean, all this is done by doing a careful analysis of the singular integrals that define the solutions. And you have to make a lot of decompositions and you need to have really very good, precise estimates for the fundamental solution and its profile, for the profile of the meta solution. And fortunately, you have all these estimates. These estimates they are available. But the behavior at the origin, as far as I understand, it's always the same. It's independent of alpha. It's independent of alpha. It may depend on the power of the Laplacian, but it is independent of alpha. Yeah, it's independent of alpha. So the value of alpha enters, okay, this comes from the fact that the solution is self-similar and it enters in the self-similar variable. And so, okay, so alpha tells you which scales are fast and which scales are slow. And which scales are slow, and which is the diffusive scale. But as for the critical values of P, it has nothing to do with that. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I also had one. This is just a curiosity. So I guess you always work, like you said, with the convolution formula, basically, that defines the solution. But you didn't say anything about the fact that solutions do solve the equation. Fact that solutions do solve the equation, or you just said that you don't know. I didn't no, no, no, I didn't say exactly that, I said, okay, um, okay, is there any way in some funny sense, but let me tell you that these mild solutions given by convolution, if you're not, okay, if you're not this in L1 and its Fourier transform is also in L1, then they are classical solutions. So it's not a stupid way of defining. It's not a stupid way of defining a notion of weak solution. Okay. So the name mild is not a good one because these mild solutions are not the ones, I mean, this is not a semi-group. So the fact that you use the name mild may induce you to think that this is a semi-group and this is not a semi-group. So I'm using the name mild because this is a semi-man. So, I'm using the MILE because this is what people use in the literature. But it's not a mild solution in the sense of 7. What I had in mind is a sort of weak formulation. No, no, no, it's not a weak formulation. But anyway, I mean, even when this is not a classical solution, the formula makes sense. And the formula makes sense. And when U is smooth enough, when you notice smooth enough, it yields a classical solution. So it's kind of... So, it's a kind of weak solution on substance. Okay. Okay, thank you. Any other question? So, let's thank again Fernando for his nice talk. And well, let
