COVID hit, and so I had two years to not think about this. But during that period of time, I was working a lot on COVID vaccines and so on. And there are some manipulations that I think sort of apply to this. So this is going to be outlined is in two parts. The second part is sort of what motivated the first part. So working on COVID vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, there were some interesting things we thought. Interesting things we thought we could do in terms of surrogates. And so that's doable. I'll talk about that. And then to support that, I worked with Mike Fay and also John Fincy, but the first part in particular with Mike Fay is a theoretical justification for what I'll talk about later. And basically, I wanted to talk about two kinds of experimental manipulations. One is where you have more arms or you have crossover within it baked into a study, and this will allow greater. A study, and this will allow greater understanding of the surrogates mechanisms. So, typically, as statisticians, we're sort of given a data set and you know we work with it. But if you can sort of design something additional, it can be quite helpful in trying to answer fundamental questions. And in particular, you can identify cross-world means with some of these manipulations if we're thinking about the mediation analysis approach to surrogacy. And then, in the second half of this talk, I'll get into the details. Talk, I'll get into the details, a lot of practical details about how we're applying these thinking this thinking to COVID vaccines and also monoclonal antibodies. So what really motivated this was to try and support antibody as a surrogate marker for COVID vaccines. And here's sort of a simplistic version of the paradigm here. We know that the benefit of vaccination is mostly or is partly due to vaccines, I mean, to antibodies. Seen, I mean, to antibodies, but also due to many other things. When you're vaccinated, it induces a whole suite of responses culminating in antibodies and a lot of other things. So we know that, and we can estimate vaccine efficacy as a function of antibody doing different methods. But we also know within the prevention world, there's another experimental design or another approach that results in prevention of COVID-19, monoclonal antibodies, which are nothing but antibodies. Which are nothing but antibodies. So you directly infuse or inject antibodies into a person, they wane over time, but during the time there's a lot of antibody around, they're protected, as we will see. And so we want to estimate protective efficacy as a function of antibody, and then just compare these two curves and then say something about the role of antibody. And to say something, we want to formalize it in some way, which would be the first part of the talk. And the goal here is really to use these antibody. To use these antibodies for the variants. So, for antibodies that are specific for Omicron and beyond, will allow us to license vaccines for Omicron and beyond. And similarly, for monoclonal antibodies. So that's sort of the end game of this. So I've mentioned antibodies a few times. I'll probably mention it a few more. And I think it's important to just go over a brief description of these. These antibodies are Y-shaped. Y-shaped proteins that are produced in response to vaccination. And what they'll do is they'll exquisitely sort of latch on to an outside of a pathogen here, a virus, and sort of neutralize or prevent the virus from continuing its life cycle. So that's how antibodies majorly work. They work in other ways as well. And then how do we measure this? Well, this is kind of ingenious. What you do is you take someone's serum, so you draw blood from them. So, you draw blood from them, get their serum, and then you dilute it out again and again and again. And maybe after you dilute it, so it's one-thousandth of the original intensity. If this still avoids, if you keep the lights on with this pseudovirus assay at 50%, then you're still showing some protection. So, we try and see how much antibody is required to keep the lights off, basically. And so, we'll be talking. Off basically. And so we'll be talking about an ID50 as the dilution at which 50% of the light, the lights are still 50% on within this pseudovirus assay. So this is also sort of for the ancestral world. When we have an ancestral virus, say the Wuhan strain, and also antibodies that are specific to that, the virus evolves, as we know. And so what we do to keep up is to measure Omicron assays using Omicron. Assays using Omicron virus and Omicron antibody. And so, what I've done here is to try and do something a little better than what Dennis did, where he had X Out and Miller. So, I show here, we make a pseudovirus that looks like Omicron on the outside by changing its spike. We make green antibodies that are specific to Omicron. And once again, we want to see how well they work. So, this is a little different. It's not really the same surrogate because we've modified it to be relevant to what's happening. To be relevant to what's happening now. So, with that as background, I'll go into the more theoretical part of this. So, this is kind of familiar notation to us at this point where we have an outcome, an arm, a mediator, a potential outcome, which would be someone who's randomized to A. What is their outcome? And along with that randomization to A, we get a mediator response or an antibody response to that outcome or that. Or that manipulation. And we can also talk about cross-world potential outcomes where someone who's randomized, say, the vaccine, and we imagine manipulating their antibodies to what it would have been under placebo and think about what that outcome would be. This can't really be done in a standard vaccine trial or a standard two-arm trial because people get the mediator value that's associated with that arm. But still, this is an important. But still, this is an important quantity within the mediation literature. And I'll also denote the factorial study outcomes where we manipulate the arm and the mediator directly, and we'll have confounders as well. So I'm going to just work through a real few simple examples of these different experimental maneuvers we can do. They generalize a lot, but I won't get into that. This is meant to be more conceptual. And I'll start out with the simplest example, I think, where we have a vaccine that we're I think where we have a vaccine that works really well. And so you randomize to arm A, which is placebo, given by that clear syringe or vaccine given by the red syringe. And that induces a strong antibody response in everyone. So you see the potential outcome is realized in the placebo group, Y00, everyone who's got placebo has no antibody. And in the vaccine arm, everyone produces antibodies. So that's a potential outcome that's revealed. Potential outcome that's revealed. So we can represent the mean responses for these two conditions here: mediator zero for ARM one up in the upper left, and then mediator is one in the vaccine group. There's complete separation of the mediator here. And we're interested in the role of antibody, but in this situation, we're sort of dead in the water. There's complete separation of the mediator by arm. So we see the total effect, but it's impossible. See the total effect, but it's impossible really to know what's due to antibody. So, this leads to the monoclonal antibody arm basically. So, we'll imagine a three-arm trial where we have the two original arms, but we have a third arm here where we directly and immaculately manipulate antibody to whatever level we want. And here we want to set it to one. And so we do. And now, these are three realizable potential outcomes in the context of this additional arm. Of this additional arm. And so now, you know, I had these two means up in the upper left and the bottom right with the two-arm trial. With a monoclonal antibody arm, I'll say, well, whatever I get here, the expected potential outcome from the monoclonal antibody is sort of definitionally the effect you get from vaccination when there is no direct effects of vaccination. It's all due to antibody. So with this manipulation, I can get at this. So, with this manipulation, I can get at this cross-world mean and, you know, I'm hoping I can go back. Oh, I got to press down. So now you know everything. I'll just sit down. Okay. So, anyway, you can decompose the overall effect kind of directly here with this mean from the monopoly. Here, with this mean from the monoclonal antibody arm, and this proportion looks about 80 percent, say. And we can do sort of this algebraically as well. So, here's a version of the mediation formula. The total effect is due to the indirect effect through antibody, the direct effect through other bits. I've grayed out the cross-world outcomes, and in this line, I substitute them with the results from the third arm, and we get this, which is if like 80%. Which is just like 80% of what you saw from the other slide. So that was simple. You know, there's perfect separation. The vaccine worked perfectly in everyone. And now we'll try and get a little more realistic where we have a three-arm study with non-takers in the vaccine arm. So the vaccine doesn't work perfectly in everyone. So we randomized to arm A. Some people develop antibodies and others don't. And so this is more of a maybe realistic situation. Of a maybe realistic situation. The potential outcomes that we see are given here in the right column. We have two possibilities for the vaccine arms corresponding to whether you make antibody or not. So now I'll introduce another experiment you can do, another design issue. So let's suppose we vaccinate people who weren't originally vaccinated. So those in the vaccine arm, we've measured their counterfactual. arm we've measured their counterfactual or actual response to vaccination the antibody response to vaccination and now in these two arms weren't vaccinated we do vaccinate them to measure their antibody response not to follow them up we could and try and get and see what happens there but just more narrowly getting their antibody response so now we measured the mediator in everyone so here's um another decomposition Another decomposition of the means. This is the third arm, the vaccine arm, the placebo arm. In this situation where not everyone is a taker, there's overlap of the mediator. We're interested in these two counterfactual or cross-world potential outcome means. And we don't know just from the data we have here what, say, this particular mean is. But with the crossover vaccination, we can do a similar kind of decomposition that I showed earlier. That I showed earlier, we have these two cross-world counterfactual means that are unknown in a standard trial. And so I'll do a couple things here. One is to just break down this mean into an iterated mean. The overall mean is conditioning on event times the probability of it plus the complement event. And then I can sort of fill these in because I've measured the mediator and everyone in the placebo group, and I can get that. And I can get that mean. Done it similarly for everyone who got the monoclonal antibody. This is the third R mean outcome, and so now I've decomposed it. So I get at this cross-world mean in the more realistic case where there's variation in the mediator response in the vaccine arm. I should point out, and this is, I won't go into this, but this is even more interesting in a way. With vaccination, if you're in a vaccine, well, with In a vaccine, well, with if you get infected with SARS-CoV-2, you'll produce your own antibodies. And if you vaccinate someone who's been infected, you get a mediator value, but it won't be meaningful. It won't be the M1 you would have had at baseline. So this trick only really works if the uninfected's in those two arms, and yet I can still recover this. So here's, I won't go into the details here, but these are the two lines that allow you to do that. That allows you to do that. So let's summarize. With a third arm and crossover trial, we can identify these cross-world means. We don't need to make the traditional assumptions. And so with this, this is sort of a different way to get a mediation. It can provide stronger and complementary information about the strengths of antibody as a surrogate. I should mention that there's been work done by David Benkasser and Peter Good. Done by David Ben Kesser and Peter Gilbert and others who've done a more standard approach to mediation analysis. And this is meant to complement what they've done. So that was a theoretical work. Now I want to talk about sort of ongoing work and trying to apply this kind of thinking to COVID vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. And there are two major things that we're interested in right now. One is to use new. Neutralization antibodies as a surrogate for protection for monoclonal antibody intervention. So, we, well, I'll show this like in detail in a minute. So that's one thing. And another is to decompose the role of antibodies in vaccines for COVID-19. So these are two things we want to do. Things are a lot more complicated than I showed earlier, where we had just a binary outcome, binary mediator, and so on. Become binary mediator and so on. The mediator was set to a fixed value. And so, in the real world, this is like more complicated. The vaccine will induce multiple levels of antibodies. Some have good responses, some poor. Antibodies decay over time. So, in some way, this is a time-varying surrogate. And I was interested in Dennis's talk and how he approaches it in, I would say, ultimately a different way than I do. But I'd be interested in talking more about it and understanding more about his approach. So, what I've done here. So, what I've done here is to use Cox regression to reflect the time-varying antibody aspect of this. So, this is different what Dennis did. A couple other things is that instead of a three-arm study, we have two different studies, a study of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. And when you know they measure antibody in different ways, so that has to be sort of corrected for and adjusted as well. So, I'll start with the monoclonal antibody study. Monoclonal antibody study. So, this was done early in the pandemic when the ancestral strain was circulating around. What this study did was to identify index cases, people who had SARS-CoV-2, and then they would go to people who lived in that household and randomize them to receive either the monoclonal antibody or the placebo, and then follow them up. So, it's really a smart design where you're sort of really enriching the trial for people who will have the. The trial for people who will have the events. And then, over the first 28 days of follow-up, which was the primary endpoint, they show about an 81% reduction in COVID-19 over the first month. They've done an extended follow-up, which shows that the benefit continues over about eight months. So, this is the monoclonal antibody arm. There's nothing happening here. There's no cases of COVID. In the placebo arm, it's increasing. So, we know that. It's increasing, so we know that there is infection pressure, people are getting infected, and still the monoclonal antibodies are working. At some point, they quit working, and we have breakthrough here. So this is just the data presented in a slightly different way. Early on, during week one, there's partly an effect of treatment. So some of the people who are infected at baseline, we won't know. They'll be randomized in the study and still. They'll be randomized in the study, and still, the monoclonal can have a benefit in terms of that. After week one, pretty much everyone who's infected at baseline is out of there, and this represents more the pure prophylactic effect of the monoclonal antibodies. And then during about up to month six, there's no cases at all in the monoclonal antibody arm. So, this is like a biological facts: antibodies decay exponentially. So, if you take the log of Exponentially, so if you take the log of them, they look pretty linear. So, here's my surrogate trajectory. It's a lot simpler, it's almost like a deterministic infunction, which is in sharp contrast to what Dennis had to do. And so this makes life here much easier in a way. These are 10 randomly selected trajectories based on a model for antibody kinetics that I'm displaying here just to show that they decay over time. So now to my Now to model the risk of COVID-19 as a function of the surrogate, which is decaying in a predictable deterministic way, I'll use a Cox model with a time-varying covariate and kind of an unusual parameterization, a three-parameter logistic curve. This is commonly used in assays, and it's sort of simple to describe in a way. We know what logistic curves look like. They're kind of S-shaped. And so we're going to say the risk of disease is this S-shaped logistic function. Shape a logistic function, there's going to be a ceiling effect. This is the third parameter of the logistic function. Thinking that, you know, even if you're saturated with antibodies and you can't really get any more in you that would have a benefit, you won't have 100% protection. It'll be something less than that. And also, if you have no antibodies, your protection should be about zero. So, anyway, this is the curve we're fitting. And here's the estimate of the protective efficacy for the monoclonal. Protective efficacy for the monoclonal antibody here is a function of the amount of antibody at the time of exposure. So, here, if you have a lot of antibody, you're about 95% protected. As the antibodies go down, protection goes down, and when antibodies are close to nothing, the COVID rate is the same in the two arms. And I should mention, you know, this is work in progress, so this is a very crude approximation to what I think the antibody is. The antibody is as measured by the neutralization assay. So, this might change with time, but the shape of the curve will look a lot like this. The x-axis might differ. So, that's what we're doing with monoclonal antibodies. And so, what we want to do is to argue that this curve provides important evidence that antibody level is a surrogate for COVID-19. Level is a surrogate for COVID-19 protection in the ancestral world when we had ancestral antibodies and ancestral viruses floating around. And we want to say that we should be able to transport this and make an argument that Omicron antibodies should work in the Omicron world. So there's some details involved in that I won't get into, but this is like the fundamental bit of evidence that we'll use to try and make that argument. So the other thing we wanted to do was try and So the other thing we wanted to do was try and decompose the role of antibody in vaccination. And so we've got the third arm there, I just talked about that. And this is more the traditional two arms from a randomized vaccine trial. This is a study that I was involved in, the Moderna vaccine trial. So this was conducted in the fall of 2020. The results came out in December 2020 with an emergency use authorization. This dose ring regimen is two doses of Ring regimen is two doses of drug or placebo 28 days apart. Overall, through the end of the blinded phase of follow-up, we have the cumulative incidence of the two arms up here, and the vaccine efficacy overall was about 93%. So what we've done with the vaccine trial is to model their antibody decay as well over time. It's interesting that they decay at different rates than the monoclonal antibodies do. The monoclonal antibodies do. I think that's because when you do some vaccination, a lot of things happen, including B cells that are slowly going to pulse antibodies for a period of time, sort of making this decay more languid than it is for the monoclonal antibodies. So here is a standard directed acyclic graph showing the decomposition of the effective vaccination through antibody, which is the indirect effect, or Which is the indirect effect, or directly through non-antibody route called the direct effect. And so we're going to assume for this, we'll have covariates that will make this directed acyclic graph appropriate by assuming the covariates are enough that we have no unmeasured compounders. So here's the detail for this. Once again, it's a Cox model with a time-varying covariate, but now I include the But now I include these covariates because antibody in the vaccine arm is not randomly assigned. It's sort of based on how good your immune system is, how well you develop antibodies. And that could be related to your risk score, your age, and so on. And so we try and control for those in this approach. So this is the estimated curve for the vaccine efficacy. So this is the Vaccine efficacy. So, this is the predicted vaccine efficacy using the Cox model using as x-axis the amount of circulating antibody in your body at the time of exposure. And so this is really the whole goal of what we wanted to do was to compare these two curves here and look at for different levels of antibody, how much of the protection of vaccine is due to the amount of antibody at that time. And so, for example, here, if you have So for example, here, if you have one in 1,000 dilution, so the log 10 is three, the protective efficacy is 94%, the vaccine efficacy is 97%, and you can do this mediation decomposition for risk reduction. It's different than the differences we used for means, and it's about 80% here. And I should emphasize again, this is really based on a crude approximation for the x-axis for the purple curve. So when we get the real. Purple curve. So, when we get the real data for this, this might change. But we want to superimpose these two curves here, talk about it, and then also do a mediation decomposition. Anyway, this is the formula for the multiplicative mediation decomposition. The total effect is a 97% reduction, so a hazard ratio of 0.03. For the antibody alone, it's a 94% reduction. So, a hazard. So, a hazard ratio of 0.06. Can we decompose it in this way and solve? And that's where you get the 80%. So I'll finish up. I gave two parts to this talk. One was theoretical, one was more practical. The theoretical part talked about augmenting studies with experiments, additional experiments that you can bring to bear. This can be helpful in determining the role of the mediator or the surrogate. Role of the mediator or the surrogate. We talked about a third arm where it's sort of perfect because you have nothing but the mediator that you're manipulating. You're not manipulating it through something else. And we also talked about a crossover. You measure mediator in the control arm after the study is over to measure M1 in everyone or in vaccine trials, at least those who are uninfected. And then for the practical things we're working on for vaccines, Working on for vaccines, we're trying to understand better the role of antibody in protection, and for monoclonal antibodies, we're trying to use pseudoneutralizing virus readout for Omicron antibodies to provide a patholicensure for Omicron disease. So, one thing is, you know, I've been here for a few days. I was supposed to talk on day one, but I've noticed Layla's interested in diabetes. So, I was trying to. Diabetes. So I was trying to think about how we can generalize these ideas beyond vaccination. Vaccination, like I mentioned, is kind of special when we have monoclonal antibodies purely, nothing but the mediator. And so I think in most situations, you won't get something like that. But like generally, I think you can do this crossover maneuver. Let's suppose you're randomizing the drug or placebo. You measure HBA1C after you get the. After you get the drug or placebo. So, this is M, this shouldn't be baseline, post-baseline, but MB0 and MB1. You run a trial, crossover placebos, and then measure their HBA1C at the end of the study. And then you could sort of assert, which I implicitly did, that whether you're getting the drug at the end of the study or at the start, the response in terms of HBA1C would be the same. C would be the same. Maybe you want to assert that, or maybe that's a little too bold for you. So you could try and construct a model using the crossover value of H, B, and 1C, and maybe other covariates, H, X, other things to try and infer what the mediator would be at baseline. So that's one thing, the crossover thing. And then the other thing is when we don't have a perfect third arm that's nothing but the mediator, you can also. nothing but the mediator you can always always um you can always conceive of a different trial that tries to maneuver or manipulate hba1c by via a different mechanism maybe insulin and so this could serve as a kind of third arm and you could then fit a model for the first trial and for the second trial and look and try and see if the slopes for hba1c are similar and if they are that would say that the indirect effect through the mediator is similar Through the mediator is similar for drug A and drug B, sort of supporting it as a kind of universal surrogate. The effect of the mediator doesn't really depend on how it's delivered. As long as you get a contrast, you have the same effect. So anyway, this is another thing you can do. And actually, one thing I was thinking about, like Peter showed a slide for the COVID-19 vaccine trials where no matter what of the different vaccines you use, the slopes. Different vaccines you use, the slopes of the effect of antibody and protection was similar. So I think this is sort of aligned with this point I'm making here. Anyway, this is joint work with Michael Fay and John Fincy and a lot of others. And it's really been a collaborative effort with a lot of people. And so I wanted to thank all my collaborators as well. So I'll stop here. Thanks, Dean. I think we have time for maybe one quick question. Either in person or online. Oh, sorry. Yes. I didn't see whose hand was raised, so please speak up. Oh, Erin. Can you unmute and ask your question? Yeah, sure. I can defer to Peter, though, and ask Dean later. Okay. Erin, go, please. Yeah. First of all, I wanted to come. First of all, I wanted to comment stone soup, very nice. But then I want to ask: have you considered in the theoretical framework adding multiple mediators to the situation? So you thought about one mediator here, antibodies, but also looking at T cell response or some other type of antibodies like general neutralizing or, you know, just any other set of mediators. Set of mediators or more than one? Yeah, it's a great point. We have thought about that. It's sort of hampered by measurement because we don't generally get T cells within these large vaccine trials. And so, as I mentioned, vaccination induces a whole bunch of things, T cells being one of them. And we'd like to know the role of each of those. But that's something we can't really easily measure and so can't really decompose it. There is a study at NIAID ongoing now where they do. At NIAID, ongoing now, where they do measure T cells and so on over time, and so we might have some opportunities with that. So, it's a good point and something we would certainly want to do and hope to do with that smaller study. Because I was thinking that, sorry, this won't make so much sense to everyone else in the room, but our paper on cross-direct effects, those estimates could be used inside here. Right. So, anyway, we'll talk more, Erin. Okay, all right. We do have that study that will measure that. We do have that study that will measure that. We'll see what we can get out of it. All right, cool. Thanks. All right, thank you. And just for sake of time, we'll keep moving on. Thanks, Dean.
