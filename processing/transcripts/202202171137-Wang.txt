Hope I could be there, but even though remotely, I think I greatly enjoy it. And I hope we can talk more maybe during a discussion. So I will talk about something a little different, but hopefully complementary, what we have heard about. So this is a work done with former postdoct Milos Neczwic and current graduate student Honda. So both are in some interesting California landscape. Landscape. So, the work I'm talking about is what the immune cells do, namely physically in this talk, to sense their surrounding and use that information to guide their evolution. So, this is a picture we often have when we think about antibody repertoire. So, here in yellow, it's some antigen that's presented by the immune system to the B cells. To the B cells. And there's a variety of shapes and properties of the B cell receptor that leads to different efficacy in recognizing this antigen. And this na√Øve repertoire, of course, comes from this genetic recombination process generating the initial diversity. And following that, hypermutation in the germinal center reaction will lead to subtle or more significant changes in the shape. So, So the better ones will expand at the expense of the less effective ones. And this repeats, and we get an evolving diversity of this recognition machinery we get through affinity maturation. So we heard of this from First Day's talk of Erie and Amita. So it's a cyclic action of competition, reproduction, and mutation. Mutation. But a major assumption behind this picture is we assume the equilibrium binding energy between the antigen and the receptor is largely determining the clonal fitness of the E-cells that carries this receptor. So it's like the dependence on gene of the clonal fitness is through this binding free energy. But if this is the picture we take, Is the picture we take? There are some puzzles that are a little hard to reconcile. So, here are two of them. One is: we know the affinity maturation is not like long-lasting. It can hit some so-called affinity ceiling. That means a naturally evolvable affinity in vivo is often orders of magnitude lower than those that can be achieved in vitro by direct evolution. So, there are some natural limitations in this. So there are some natural limitation in the affinity matricion. And on the other hand, there are always low affinity ones, not so good ones, hanging around without being really removed effectively. So indicating, so this is also related to what we heard first day. There's always some ineffective portion that somehow persists by certain mechanisms. Are they useful or they're just some byproducts? So to answer these questions, So, to answer these questions, or partially at least resolve these puzzles, I want to present a view that we need to put the cell back in the picture. So the reason is this. We're looking at E-cell in green. It comes in in touch with the antigen-presenting cell. And another example. So, as a result of the contact, it carries a little piece of the antigen and goes away. So, it's really far from equilibrium binding. So, it's a pretty active dynamical process during this information extraction from the environment physically. So, this communication between the cells is definitely multilingual. So, it starts with the physical interaction, which then translates into processing inside the cell. To processing inside a cell through biochemical signaling, and that will finally lead to matter flux through the interface. By that, I mean the internalization of antigens through the so-called synapse, which is the dynamic interface between the P cell and the antigen presenting cell. Right, so if we look at the interface between them, here are some nice images. Here are some nice images. If we're thinking about naive and memory cells, we see this very classic centralized synapse. So red is antigen, green is indicating the boundary or the contact between the cells. And there are a lot of previous classic works that I read when I started this project. But the surprise is some recent experiment. Experiment that imaged the terminal center B cells that are undergoing affinity maturation found a very distinct contact pattern. So you see the red clusters are much smaller and they are kept apart from each other, pretty much near periphery of the contact region. So this is the first puzzle that we don't know how this pattern is generated and maintained. Uh, generated and maintained. So, that's the first question. So, what is the structural role, or how is this structure arises from this contact, this very dynamic interaction process? So we know from for the passive system between two cells, we can use some very simple model to capture the configuration or the morphology of the contact interface just by. Interface just by including two terms in the configurational energy. One is elastic elasticity, so it includes bending and tension due to deformation in the membrane upon contact. The other term is, of course, the specific interactions between the membranes mediated by multiple molecular species. The key thing is you have very short BCR antigen pairs and much longer. Pairs and much longer, three times longer adhesion molecules co-inhabiting this interface. So, this height difference, I'm sure you heard from Omer, is enough to drive a phase separation, or you can see it as enrichment of short ones and long ones in different spatial regions. And this is the dynamic process, which is slow because. Process which is slow because it's pretty much a nucleation. So, this is a passive feature. So, the Bruce Eye pattern we saw for naive and the memory cell can be primarily captured by this. But to capture that multifocal pattern we saw in evolving cell, we got some hint from this high sensitivity force sensor based on DNA hairpin. So, the idea is pretty nice and simple. So, the idea is pretty nice and simple upon force application in pulling the antigen upward. The hairpin will unbind. So the fluorescence, red fluorescence dye will be displaced from the dark quencher. So when you see red flashes, that indicates force is applying above certain threshold value, dependent on the design of the DNA sequence. So here and see the red flip. And see the red flashes only occur for the maturing or the gymnacent V cell. It remains no force for the naive cell. So this gives us some possibility or some hypothesis that the force that's orthogonal to the surface might play a role in generating and maintaining that. So we can do that in So, we can do that in our model by including a term that describes phenomenologically what I just said. So, we include a term that describes the energy cost of applying a pulling force on a cluster of bound receptor and antigen once it exceeds certain threshold size. So, this is intended to capture the phenomenology we know from measurements. One is the clusters would grow and emerge. Would grow and emerge before it eventually gets arrested to form those multifocal patterns. And the other is, we know, even though it's not very clear, it's still controversial, we know sufficient clustering often precedes the signaling, which subsequently instructs the force application. So the picture roughly in cartoon version is like cluster growth to a certain size, or supplies. So two things can be used. So, two things can happen: either it will shave the cluster from the boundary due to the rupture force, or the whole cluster occasionally is ruptured. And the result of this is receptors get recycled. So the originally bound ones will now be freed to join existing ones or form new ones elsewhere. So this will then lead to this very dynamic pattern. This very dynamic pattern in the contact region. Red are receptor antigen-bound receptors, and green ones, you see this constant exchange between red clusters. Those are free receptors. So what this tells us is you can have this dynamic maintenance of contact. At the same time, you can sample different regions for threats. This is showing this. Showing this quasi-steady distribution of the cluster size. And in addition, the morphology in 3D is very similar to what's seen in the TERF imaging, this pod-like structure in contact with the antigen-presenting cell, concentrating receptor at the tips. Right, and we can place this kind of diagram and see the force application. And see the force application is essential to generate this multifocal pattern. And this is an example of you can have this normal forces that both detect and regulate the inplane receptor organization. And that's what's one way to understand what we saw. And of course, we will delay the percolation of the cluster and maintain. Proglation of the cluster and maintain this base for a larger affinity range. This is a structural aspect, but what's this good for? Why do the cells bother using forces causing energy to do this extraction process? So to understand that, we use a very simple model, a very coarse-grained description of a target of work configuration. By that, I mean, Configuration. By that, I mean the antigen is coupling the receptive cell receptor on one side and some presenting receptor on the antigen presenting cell. And the force applies to pull on this whole chain of protein complexes, which can be captured by some binding energy profile in this 2D space of bound extension. Of bound extension. So the key here is it will deform this whole complexes and the antigen will couple the binding interfaces. And with force, this binding landscape will deform, shifting both the attractor, meaning the bound state, and two saddles, which are the transition states. Once you exceed one of these boundaries, rupture happens either at either interface, leading to success or failure of extraction. Or failure of extraction. So if the affinity of finding increases slightly, the force application will lead to a stronger contrast between the extraction success probability compared to without force. So we might look complicated, but the idea is we think this configuration. This configuration is translating a comparison between binding affinity to a comparison between rupture kinetics. So which bounds will rupture first determines success probability. And this actually can capture the mechanical sensing behavior we know from literature. So depending on the stiffness of the presenting cell, increasing pulling force can either Increasing pulling force can either suppress or enhance extraction probability. And we know for germinal center evolving B cells, the presenting cells much stiffer than those for the naive cell. So the fully curved dendritic cells are much stronger stiffer than the normal dendritic cell, which presents to naive cells. And in addition, so why the B cells use force? The B cells use force to reduce the activation signal. So, one benefit they can gain is to increase the contrast between the extraction. So, the discrimination ratio is the extraction probability between a low affinity and a slightly higher one. So, this requires thief presenting cell. So, it is lost when it softens. So, this is indeed what's observed in X. Observed in ex vivo imaging and the force measurements of germinal center versus naive cells. So, this is one benefit they can gain. In addition, in contrast to T cells, which normally make a binary decision between self or suspend cell, life's death decision, but B cells they need to evolve through affinity maturation. So, they need the kind of ranking mechanism to rank. Mechanism to rank between themselves, which are better binders, so to keep that in higher fraction. So to realize a grading scheme, the B cell needs a large dynamic range, meaning they can distinguish small difference between affinities over a large affinity range. So we find using this TAGO4 configuration and considering And considering the deformation of the landscape, the curve, the response curve of extraction as a function of affinity, will stretch compared to if you ignore the deformation, then it's pure shift to higher affinity. And this stretching then translates to a broadening of the distinguishable affinity range. And this is a non-linear effect of the force. And this we thought. And this, we thought, is essential for sustaining affinity maturation. As affinity gets higher and higher, we need to have some mechanism to sustain the range of selectable differences between the cells. So that's for the receptor level mechanism of broadening discrimination. And there can be cellular level mechanism. By that, I mean, if we think about those clusters, right? Clusters, right? We saw at the GCB cell interface. There are at least two readouts of the affinity. The one is this extraction, which is like a counter. You count, the cells count, how many signals, how much signals they acquire, or they can measure time, like how long-lasting the clusters are. So this is more like the kinetic perforating scheme. Actually, we found this is basically a stubble. This is basically a stochastic description of plastic rupture and the force. We find this, we call tau discriminator lifetime measurements, is good for relatively low affinity in terms of acquiring information or accuracy of discrimination. But this counter and discriminator is better at higher affinity, and that range extending. Range extending to higher values when force increases. And these are independent receptors. If there's cooperativity, for example, there's load sharing between the receptors, then it can further extend this at some cost of absolute level of accuracy. But you can see this, our point is this lifetime measurements and physical extraction might be complementary. Extraction might be complementary in achieving a broad discrimination as the cells transition from naive to evolving stage. And there's actually evidence that there's some simultaneous, pretty dramatic change in both signaling and force usage and the cytoskeleton organization during this transition. All right, so finally, how is this related? How is this related to evolution? And what sets the natural limit of evolvable affinities? So, to do this, we just take the natural wisdom, which is subject the physical phenotype, in this case, the extraction efficacy through this TACO4, to natural selection, which is the affinity maturation program. So, yeah, we earlier developed this pretty fast program to do this, and now we incorporate this cellular. We incorporate this cellular processing into this cyclic action. So, this is a little complicated, but my point is the black symbols are the ceiling affinity, meaning the saturation affinity as a function of force. So, you see, the force is indeed because by extending the discrimination range, you can raise the ceiling. But eventually, the limitation is coming from survival. Is coming from survival of the germinal center because the negative feedback due to the reduction in activation signal eventually will limit how much force is tolerable in terms of supporting response amplitude. So this balance will then lead to some optimal range of force. And the interesting thing is, this is a pure population level argument or statement. Argument or statement about what's preferred force, but that match very well with the single molecule measurements of the rupture force within this range. So we think maybe this molecular level design is really selected on much larger organismal scale. So the last thing is if we now look at the trajectory of the evolutionary path in terms of the intrinsic property, which The intrinsic property, which are the binding affinity, like the barrier height the cells the receptor need to overcome to rupture, and the bound length, which is a proxy of the flexibility of receptor. You can see the trajectory can go in different directions depending on how strongly the cell pole and how stiff the environmental presenting surface is. So two interesting, one interesting thing is you can see the stiff. Interesting thing is, and see the stiffness actually is matching the environment, which is interesting to sustain the selection pressure. And more strikingly, if you look at the clonal fitness, which is measured by how effectively the B cells can acquire antigen, there are two possible solutions. Either very weak force and very flexible tether. Tether is the presenting receptor. And but there's the other. But there's the other red block at strong pooling against steep APC. All right, so that's the GCB cell regime. However, if you look at intrinsic binding quality as a result of the evolution, there's no such an optimum anymore. So there's a conflict or a mismatch between the training condition. So the training is in this membrane environment and the force that Environment and the force that favors the solution. But the testing is conducted by just free binding, equilibrium binding of receptor to antigen in solution without force application. So these two seem to be conflict. So why do the B cells are doing this? Basically losing quality of the trained antibodies. So we think one possibility is the organizer. The optimization objective is not simply the binding quality to the current antigen, but maybe they use the force to prepare themselves for future. So one possible mechanism of that is really inspired by Alex Group's work. This will be Simon Michel's work. So there's finding and evidence that And evidence that the founder B cells can have heritable heterogeneity in the molecular circuits. So the force generation is definitely originated from one of these molecular circuits. And if we incorporate this heterogeneity in the force magnitude, and essentially it has to be inheritable, and then one finding we see is See, is this a finished landscape, and only for some intermediate range of heterogeneity, there can be long-lasting diversity, phenotypic diversity among the surviving or evolved B cells. So by phenotype, I mean the combination between the force they apply and the flexibility of the receptor that will evolve as a result. So you can see this bimodality is a result of some subtle point that. Result of some subtle point that results directly from the type of configuration. So, the outcome of this is you can have a wide range of quality of evolved antibodies, but the cells that carry them can have very similar fitness, so they can coexist. I'll finish up very quickly. So, this, I think, is related to what Kwan. What Kwang talked about yesterday might be some phenotypic route. In this case, the gene doesn't change, but the B cell can use the force to diversify their binding phenotype. And that might be a useful mode to broaden their short-term memory. And I think for long-term memory, we have done some work. I think there, the most important parameters are the statistics of the environment. The statistics of the environment, time scale of environmental changes. So, those are on the more longer time scale about the correlation between the antigens that are encountered. So, this is also showing by a Weiling plot that diversity of the resulting response is maximum at some intermediate force heterogeneity. So, that means the physical constraint. means the physical constraint on the force magnitude is required for the lasting diversity which is kind of interesting if you have a very large diversity to start with eventually it's very quickly lost so only in the intermediate regime this can be sustained so that's all and a short summary i hope i show you some um thoughts we had about how physical dynamics About how physical dynamics of immune recognition can directly shape the selection pressure is done in two ways. One is this TACO4 antigen extraction setup provides a way to broaden the distinguishable of immunities. And on the other hand, this heritable heterogeneity, if present in the force usage, may provide a way to diversify the short memory. And so, in all, And so, in all, I think this demonstrates we need the systematic or sorry, systems approach or perspective to understand small-scale processes through this cell ensemble that reach the molecular to the organismal level. So, thank you very much for your time. Sorry, the room might be muted. Go ahead. Oh, sorry. Thanks, Shen Shen. It's fantastic talk. So you showed something comparing FDC to other Ron-Ten presenting stars, and you were arguing that they are stiffer, right? To make it more stiffer for FDC. Are stiffer for the TC cells. And is there any regulation where the antigen-presenting cells, based on its engagement with B cells, would stiffen up its membrane to kind of ramp up these forces? Exactly. So at least one source is the inflammation signal, actually. We directly steepen up the presenting cell. So that's one thing. It seems to coordinate the innate and the adaptive. May tender adaptive components to respond to more complex. Well, but even faster, like based on signaling, right? Like, you know, if you are presenting something and you get engaged to be sales, you would even like ramp up like locally, maybe by forming the synapse or maybe Mike can comment on that. I don't know from that side, but like something more on the minute time scale to really ramp up the force kind of more dynamically. Right. I believe there's this feedback. I believe there's this feedback. I didn't know for antigen presentings on this case, but I think more generally, like the actual cellular matrix, there is a feedback between the pulling of the cell and the stiffening of the resulting network by aligning of the filaments that make up the network. So, I think in general, the physical mechanism is there, and I think that's a very interesting thing to look at. Thank you. Omer, a quick question, maybe. And then, John, maybe you can start preparing. Yeah, very nice talk. I wondered, I might have missed it, but the bond length, obviously that determines how, or like the quantitative way that the bond will respond to force. Can I ask, is that the same as the bond length in like Bell's model? I might have missed it. And where did you get those estimates from? Like, why do you think it's, I think, four nanometers, for example? Four nanometers, for example. Exactly. So, yeah, that's something I skipped. So, this bump lens is basically for the landscape, that's the distance between minimum and the barrier, like the attractor and the saddle. And one estimate one can get is by feeding the rupture force distribution to force back measurements to extract the intrinsic parameters defining the landscape. Binding the landscape. And so just out of curiosity, like, because I'm only aware of one study that has done that or some antibodies that bind fluorescene like 20 years ago. And the numbers were like 0.1 to 0.4. I wondered, like, is there some other study where you're getting these kind of larger numbers? One study I knew, yeah, I can send you later. It's recombinant antibody segments. Body segments. So they try to use different recombinants to measure this bum lens. I think the estimate is about 0.9 nanometers, so one nanometer. Yeah, here it's slightly longer because we are thinking about the complex, so it's like a cluster. It's larger, okay. Yeah, longer. Yeah, I'd be very keen to see that.
