We are more kind of doubling around with not so beautiful, more complex structures where we don't see defects at this point. I hope to see some defects at one point, but we didn't. And I want to talk you through some mechanical feedbacks we see here, which have to do with the external matrix plasticity, which guide the formation of memory gland organoids, and then also maybe I've Organoids, and then also maybe I have time to go to the pancreatic cancer kind of organoids. Chairwoman, please let me know a couple of minutes before I should stop. I'm ready to stop anytime. I don't see the time here going, right? So just chime in. So I just will present some results, and I just want to thank people who were involved in this from the beginning. It is actually. It is actually Ben actually who did most of the work together with Hilary, Christine, and Lisa Engelbrecht, actually. And our pancreatic studies we did together with Max and Aris at the medical school. So normally we are interested in structure formation in active systems and molecular systems. So we look at actin dynamics and how they move around and how they. How they move around and how they develop more complex shapes here. And this is something where we wondered if this kind of active matter concepts would be something which is applicable also to cellular systems. And that's where we started to go into this organoid field basically. And we ended up in looking at memory gland organoids, how they form from individual cells into these structures, and then also the pancreatic cells. And then, also, the pancreatic cells, which go into these kinds of structures. That's basically what I want to talk about. So, I get started with memory glands. So, memory glands are the multi-producing kind of globular structures, branch globular structures, where you have this alveoli here, and they are formed and rejuvenated during the lifespan of a human at different stages. So, they have some plasticity in them that they can build. That they can build and rebuild branch structures to have a functional kind of milk-producing structure, basically. And they are bilayered, they have two layers of cells, epiphilia cells, and that's actually where they kind of form. And branching, this process of branching morphosis is quite universal. You see them in all kinds of different organs, most famously, I guess, studied extensively in the fetus cells and muscularization. In the fetus cells in muscularization, where you have these kind of gradients of some morphogenes, which guides the extension of the capillary cells and do the job there. So in this system, people do a lot and did a lot that they use xenographs now from human tissue and throw them in martygel and watch how they grow. And this is something how they would grow, that they kind of proliferate these cells and build up these structures. And I think you see that they are. And I think you see that they are kind of more surface tension driven because you have this kind of more or less spherical shape and they're kind of bulging out just by the proliferation. So, what we started off is now with the essay of Christina Scheer, who developed that actually originally, where they put individual cells from human breast reduction operations. So, these are really kind of primary cell lines now we are working with, which is a pain. But anyway, so you use these primary cells and you use. These primary cells, and you use individual cells of them and put them into a collagen network. And after two weeks or so, you get these kind of hardened, beautiful, kind of alveoli-like structures inside of the collagen. And it really depends which kind of cell type you start. You need to fuck sort them to get first the basal cells to throw in. If you use the luminal cells, you would not get these structures. You start off the basal cells. And importantly, they become kind of more differentiated. They become kind of more differentiated, kind of differentiated in real luminal cells. They do not lactate. We lack important receptors for that, but they develop into these bilayer structures where you get more luminal-like cells and more basal cell-like kind of outside. So starting with the individual basal cell. And so the thing is now that they do it in collagen, and we started off, and that's what you do as a physicist. You say, well, that's. That's what you do as a physicist. You say, well, it's easy, it's evident, it has to be mechanics. So, and then you look at the model and you see there's no big deal. So, Mardigel is behaving basically the same as collagen in terms of more linear model. So, that's the G prime, G double prime. These are the linear model. And it's a bit higher for the martial we have here, the concentration we have. But if you go down with the concentration, you would get the same modulus. So, there's nothing big in there. So, nothing to be seen here. To be seen here. An interesting observation is actually what they had already is that they get only these beautiful alveoli-like structures if they have the gel detached from the surfaces. So the boundary condition of the gel really plays an important role. So if you confine them into a collagen, which is attached to the gel, and it's a big chamber, it's a two-valve chamber, then you get completely different structure or they don't grow at all and you don't get the differentiation. It really depends on the detachment. On the detachment of the collagen from the bones. So, what I will talk now about is this ductal elongation phase, the day 7 to 10, where we look at how they grow. And this is basically what you see here. This is the collagen. You have some fidgetial particles inside of it. These are kind of latic spheres. And you just see how the gel is deformed by the growth of these kind of arms and the branches out of these kind of individual cells. So, in the first Individual cells. So, in the first few days, the cells get adapted to the medium, they start to proliferate a bit, and then at a certain day, they start to see that they're big enough, and then they start to elongate and have this massive deformation of the collagen in front of these branches. So, what I told you about, it was the linear elasticity. It is just the modulus, linear modulus. So, it's just the G prime and just the slope of this thing. That's what you normally think about if you talk about biomechanics. If you talk about biomechanics or mechanical transactions, that's everybody's talking about linear elasticity. As soon as you report a modulus, it is a linear modulus. So that's a linear response. If you are a bit more advanced and more from physics point of view, you know that there are relaxation types. You know that there is some linear visculasticity. So there's retardation in some Maxwell bodies, and you can adapt them and you get some peculiar kind of time behavior of that. What we in physics. What we in physics, I guess, we never care about is non-linear kind of plastic behavior because this is complicated. We don't know what to do. It's not linear response, so we don't do this stuff. But all the engineers know that we are surrounded. Everybody from daily life know that we are surrounded by non-linearity. So the whole thing is nonlinear. And that's also for the college. And now this is now actin, actually. I just show kind of a paper of actin crossing by alpha-actin. Crossing by alpha actinin because we have nice microscopy data which shows it, and I will come back to the collagen in a minute. So, what we do is now that we just apply a strain ramp in time and we go back. We go forward and go back, go forward and go back. And that's a response curve of the stress. So, that's the first time we do the circle. That's the second time. That's the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seven, eighth time. So, each time we do it, we train the system in a different and get a different response of it. And this is kind of a Response of it. And this is called Malins effect, or the Malinz effect would be that the maximum stress goes down, so we call that a bit anomalous. But it is a highly plastic and non-linear response what we get here. And what happens kind of microscopically, you can easily make it visible by a very simple setup where we just have a piezo which shears a glass slide back and forth. We did that later with a rheometer, but I think that's the best. I think that's the best movies we have where I really see what's going on. So we just shear this thing by the glass and we take a picture each time. I go back. I go up and then I go back and I take a picture here. So that's the first time, that's the juvenile thing. And that's the second and then we go on. And I think you see what's happening. You get these massive bundles. Basically, the thing, while you shear it, it collects everything which meets. So there's some gluiness to this fiber. Gluiness to this fiber. So, every fiber glues to each other and really fortifies each other and gets this massive bundle. And now, at the very end, I will have a movie now. Here, now it goes where we do stepwise images, and you already see that these bundles encode the strain we applied at the beginning. So you get a mechano memory in this thing because you reorganize your filaments by the strains you apply. And that's what it is. So, this is now for the collagen this response. Now, for the collagen this response, that's the first time you go up, then the second, third time. And then, if you extend farther, you go up to the juvenile curve, and then you have the one, second, third, fourth time. You go up to a higher curve, you go to this, and you get these kind of circles. So, that's this shape memory and reorganization by mechanical forces you observe in collagen. And I think this is greatly, greatly underappreciated in literature because everybody is just reporting a modulus because that's the only thing what people care about. The only thing what people care about because that's the only thing you can understand. So, the linear response. So, it's highly plastic, it really depends on the history. Martyr gel doesn't have that. You see here now something that's an artifact of the rheometer, because you just go back, so I can explain that in detail, but it doesn't matter. So, there's nothing nonlinear in there. There's no plasticity in there. So, there's some elasticity clearly, but it's not any plasticity in there. And if you now do a reflection microscopy of these growing organoids, These growing organoids, you really see how the collagen is deformed by the forces of the cells crawling inside of this thing. So you really see how the collagen gets bundled just by the pure strain and stresses these guys apply to the network. And what happens now is that the motility of the cells and the forces of these exotic matrix lead to kind of bundling of the collagen network. Bunding of the collagen network and by that to a formation of a cage surrounding and casing the epiphilia cellulum. So, this is a three-dimensional object clearly. The cells migrate, why they migrate, they pull in the collagen and they build this kind of cage in which they are encased and that's kind of a bit higher resolution object kind of microscopic thing. We already see some holes also in there still, but it's really a stable cage of the collection. Really, a stable cage of the collagen in there. The whole thing is under strain, you cut it, it relaxes. And if you kill the cells, whatever you find in the fridge, with a tried mix in this case, you really see it's a mechanically stable cage formed by the cells. This is circumstantial, and we have to be very careful. And I already have to do this as a disclaimer. This is a breast tissue, which was cut, a human breast tissue, and there you see also this collagen kind of really nicely kind of aligned around. Nice kind of aligned around the alveoli. So, again, it's only circumstantial. Nobody knows how that works in the human body, but it's interesting just to note. You do have also metallopotinas kind of working. These are small enzymes which digest the collagen. So if you sneak through the network, the metallopotinase help to digest it, to make some holes that you are able to crawl through. If you inhibit the metallopotinase, then you are not able to extend the branch. You are not able to extend the branches. The branches are not able to go through this anymore. And the basal cells you have here deposit their own exodics. They start to deposit also laminin, fibunectin, I think we saw also with some stainings. So the basal membrane becomes more complex by the growth of this thing. So they adapt themselves by expressing it. Here, you do see this motion. This is now just the nuclei labeled, and you see this. The nuclei labeled, and you see this motion of these cells in it. And again, you see the deformation field of the matrix by this motion. So there's a back and forth motion of these guys in this channel. They build themselves by crawling out. And then by that, you extend more and more. You get thicker and thicker branches. And you see really this back and forth motion. And going back, this makes a collective motion of this cell. And this collective motion is the force which is needed to deform the external matrix of this cell. Form the X-ray matrix of the surrounding and to build the cage to crawl in to begin with, to be collective to begin with, to have enough forces to kind of deform the structure. And you see, if you analyze now more the back and forth motion of these guys, this is now just the time code of the directions they go to. You see that there is always a traffic jam actually in the outflow here because there is this cage there. So, and that forces the cell. There. So, and that forces the cell to move back. So, this is actually why you get this kind of nice oscillation of motions of these collective motions inside of these branches. So, basically, what the picture is, is that you have a collective cell migration because you live in an epiphilarious cell layer, which is encased by a collagen. This generates the tension which deforms the collagen outside, which builds these bundles. You have locally metalloproteinase expressed, which enable. Teleport is expressed, which enables them to sneak through this kind of network. We have certain beautiful movies where we see really how individual cells kind of sneak through this kind of mesh it was producing to begin with. And then with that, you build your cage and this forces the thing to do a collective cell migration. By that, you have some circle, which kind of guides the self-organization of the structures we observed here. Let me jump over this luminal cells. Over this luminal cells, that's something else. So, so there, there's if you can go also to the alveogenesis at the end of it, that's where you start. And I think these are really stunning movies here. The color code is just the three-dimensional depth of this thing. But you see already what's happening here, that the cells start to rotate in this kind of more spherical shapes you have here. Here you see that also beautifully, that here you still have this back and forth. That here you still have this back and forth motion, but here, once they round up a bit, the cells kind of migrate. And what we looked at is now to really understand how this transition of this anisotropic movement of the back and forth to this isotropic movement in the sphere colour works. We didn't see any defects, Karen. I was very unfortunate not to see any defects there. Maybe we didn't look enough and close enough, but there have to be defects clearly in the movement. I think change. In the movement, I think Chase saw some of them in some really spherical there in the movement in the dynamics of that. But here, what we were interested is really how the transition of this motion of these cells, how that goes to the anisotropy and how this leads to a Rayleigh instability, basically, where you start to round up these things. So there's a tension, there's a certain critical value where the thing kind of is anisotropic enough that you have something like a similar, like a Have something like a similar, like a pearling instability. And I don't want to go into this detail, that's what we did with Ermin Fry actually at the end of the day. So, but at the end of the day, you get these beautiful Christmas kind of spheres here, which rotate in every direction. So there's no prepared directions, and you get this massive rotation of these alveoli-like structures. What this has as a biological function, I have no idea. We cannot say at all if this is important, we don't know. Important, we don't know it's beautiful for sure. So, that's that's what we see here. Um, okay, so I in the second part, I want to talk. We thought about now we understood branching organoid, uh branching morphogenesis in memory gland. So, we have to, that has to be the same in every other kind of organoid which branches. So, that's why we teamed up with Max, who is an expert in pancreatic ductal adenoid called Sinoma. And we thought about looking at how they About looking at how they form inside of this collagen again. So, what we do, we do exactly the same essay. We start off with in a real cell, in a two-well, and look at the structures which emerge, and they look amazingly similar to the pancreatic or to one form of p-duct you find inside of humans, actually, which you don't want to have because that's really kind of a cancer you run. Can't say you rally are able to survive. It's really a dangerous one. So, and you really see now here the actin staining and the Derpy staining, you see that you get a really beautiful lumen forming here. You get an anisotropy of the cells aligning this lumen. And the question is, how is that formed? And is that the same kind of way I just described you? You see again here that this is a highly branch structure, massively big, it's up to millions. Massively big, it's up to millimeters at one point, and you really see this kind of beautiful lumen inside of that. And the E-catarillin kind of being anisotropically kind of distributed here. Basically, it is somehow similar as in the memory gland, but distinct differently. So we get different phases here. We have this extension phase. The cells crawl not in such a massive thick epiphilia or mesentinal kind of branch. It is more a single cell movement. Branch, it is more a single cell movement. So there's one cell after the other. It's not so thick as it was before in the extension phase. There are rather individual cells crawling into it with not so much deformation of this network because they don't need it. It's a rather thin thing, which is able to crawl through the meshwork of that. So we get some deformation of this network, but the major deformation of the network we get in the thickening phase where we get a Thickening phase where we get a mesenchymal epiphilia transition of the cells. So they stop crawling around and they just proliferate and then they also stop to proliferate and the whole thing starts to thicken and open up a lumen. So that's the process we were interested then to look into it. And that's where you see really how the lumen is forming. So here you see this fault line. And hang on. So let's see this movie again. Here really see how. This movie again here, really see how the actinins are accumulating here in the middle of this, and you see this nice epiphilialization of the cells where they become very regular in the epiphilial cell layer and really forming this lumen. And while doing so, they do this contractile foci here, where you get really kind of distinct contractile points inside of the epiphilus cell layer along these branches. And these are the kind of docleation points where the lumen starts to form. To form. So that's what you beautiful. See here, how they really kind of start to have these contractions here. This is a bit too thin for that, but here you really see here down here, you see this kind of really regular kind of rosettes we call in this kind of branches where the actum eyesin network contracts and really builds this kind of multi-solonar kind of connection points, and there the lumen starts to nucleate. And these some rosettes. And these rosettes kind of start out of fluctuations. I think this, I have to think about the talk of current and the hydro a bit more. There has to be somehow a connection. I have a feeling I don't get it yet. But I think you get also these fluctuations of these contractions of the cells, all the cell shapes are changing during this. And by that, the cells kind of acclimerate at a certain point and do this contractile foci here. And they resolve or dissolve. Dissolve or dissolve then later when the luminous forms. You see, these are massively kind of there. There are 17 or whatever kind of, let's run this movie again. Cells. Why is that not running? There's a huge amount of cells really kind of meeting at this point of overlap, where you really have this foci. They often start. This foci they often start to nucleate first at the branch points where they start to branch, and there you really see that there are a lot of cells kind of meeting at a certain point by the contraction of the actomyosin. Yeah, so and this contraction we believe now is now the origin that we start from this disordered array of the mesoinsheimotte cell migration we have. That this contraction leads then to an order because you need to. Because you need to kind of order your nuclei basically. The cells are amazingly nuclei heavy, so the volume is occupied by the cell nucleus mostly. And by contracting these things, you have to put some order to the nuclei. And that leads then to this kind of epiphilization and this order inside of a filiocell. Exactly. So that's, and then you get apoptosis. And by doing this apoptosis, you really see the You really see now the you see all the dead cells here in this red. It's just DNA labels here. You really see how the cells are expelled then from the epiphenyl cell layer and you get these lumen formations of this kind of cells here where you start to have really an empty lumen with dead cells inside there. And this lumen is again, it's coming, it looks like very much like a Rayleigh instability in my eyes. In my eyes, you get really nice, nice regularity somehow in this kind of droplet formation. We still kind of try to understand in which circumstance they really appear and really see that this luminance starts to be connected throughout this kind of branch you have here. And I think this is just a nice, nice movie here where you see these cells that they're still contracted and you see this dirt, this kind of dead Denard kind of debris kind of being transported. Kind of debris kind of being transported inside of that. So it's a connected kind of lumen throughout the space. I'm not really sure how I'm doing in time. Can somebody tell me where we are? Do I still have five minutes? Seven minutes left. Yeah, excellent. So let me continue with this. So one thing which I didn't tell you was. One thing which I didn't tell you was that if you look at your samples of the pancreatic cancer organoids I showed you, this is the brutal truth of the assay, and this is a huge challenge for the whole field. It is very heterogeneous. So you see a whole sample and you see all these different organoids now in it, and you see all sizes and shapes basically. And clearly, we choose the most beautiful ones and then we try. Most beautiful ones, and then we try to concentrate and repeat it in a proper way, but still, you get all kinds of different sizes and shapes basically. And the standardization of the organoid cell culture is a huge challenge here. So, what we thought when I was in Boston and in Dave's White's lab actually, that we use their technology of microfluidics, of double microfluidics, to have organoids inside. To have organoids inside of droplets. The special thing here is that these are not spheroids, these are branched organoids and they grow out of single cells. So, we want to encapsulate individual cells inside of these droplets. And this is not microfluidics because they are so humongous. They are really big. They are 300 micrometer. So, you want to have huge droplets. So, it's more millimeter fluidics, I guess. So, we have four or five hundred micrometer, half a millimeter droplets we want to produce. And the idea, the conceptual idea. And the idea, the conceptual idea, is that you encapsulate these guys, and then you would be able to select certain shapes and certain sizes, and with that, you homogenize your samples. That's the basic idea you want to pursue, I guess, at one point. So that's just the standard setup of droplet microphilics. You produce them. One kind of nice side effect we figured out is, and which is important, I think, is that we are able to standardize. Are able to standardize somehow the collagen polymerization. So, one pain in the whole field is, and that's one of the reasons very few labs work with collagen organizing collagen networks, because it's a real pain to work with collagen, because it's a huge batch-to-batch and preparation preparation variation. And by having now a microfluidic chip, you really standardize the way or how you polymize the collagen. The collagen polymization step is really essential to have the right collagen. Essential to have the right collagen, that the thing can grow nicely. And what we figured out also is by having now not kind of we try to minimize the number of cells, not one cells, because of Poisson, you want to have a bit more cells per droplet. But having then this done, you really get a more homogeneous kind of response. Actually, the things grow in a more similar way from droplet to droplet. So the variation between the organoids is not that big. That could be Is not that big. That could be kind of just the fact that they don't grow that big, so they look more similar. But I think there's something in there. They develop in the same way. You get also the lumen. They really have the same kind of stainings for the EEN calorine. We did some, I think that comes, we did some sequencing that we get the same sequencing signature for the developmental phases. We get a decent yield. Again, it's difficult really to quantify if the yield is now bigger per. If the yield is now bigger per cell of growing these organoids. But what we do see is that, and I think that's an important one, is that we accelerate the development of the lumens. So we get on day seven already the lumen formation compared to normally we get that on day 13. So by confining the growth of the organoids into smaller volumes, getting the boundaries closer to this thing, and getting And getting, that's our interpretation. This kind of more feedback of mechanical feedback of the boundaries of the collagen of the sample it's growing in, that gives triggers somehow the faster maturation of the organoids. And with that, I'm ending here, and I think you and I'm happy to take questions.
