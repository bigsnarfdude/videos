Thank you, and thank you for the organizers for putting this together. I imagine that it is quite different from sort of organizing in person, and I do hope that one day we will get to see each other in person, maybe even in band, because it's a beautiful place. So, before we start, I do recommend that we open this poll so that we could get it ready when we actually reach push. When we actually reach questions that matter, there is actually a first question on there: How comfortable are you with Reaction Network? I do have to say our talk today, really the motivation came from Reaction Network, but you should see it more as it's a very interesting mathematical problem that I am posing here. And this is joint work with George Cratian and Jiajin Jin, who actually did most of the work in this talk. So let's get started. Yesterday we saw we saw that mass action. Saw we saw that mass action system actually has a lot of interesting dynamics that are possible. I mean, we talked about bi-stability or multi-stationarity, but we also talked about the possibility of limit cycle, sort of continuing the trend of what we talked about this morning. And what you see here is are just three different face portraits of dynamics that are possible by mass action system simply in R2, right? Only in the plane. And our focus here is actually. And our focus here is actually the most boring dynamic of all. We're looking at cases where there is a single positive steady state, and in fact, we're going to ask it to be extremely stable in the sense of complex balancing. I will explain what complex balancing is. But we're not restricted to the plane, but we are considering mass action system whose dynamics are the most boring sense that you can think of. It just converges to a unique positive steady state within every stoichiometric compatible. Within every stoichiometric compatibility class. So as a three-minute, oh, yes, so I will actually go do a three-minute recap of what do I mean by reaction network as well as a very geometric way of seeing reaction network. So for me, a reaction network is a directed graph where the vertices are attached to these labels. Well, you know, we're seeing kind of the symbol XYZ and then kind of the symbol xyz and naturally you're thinking okay polynomials inter with variables xyz then there's a very natural representation of all of these labels on vertices with vectors so for example instead of 2x i could simply write the vector 200 right um after i count how many uh different symbols there are in my graph similarly x plus y 1 1 0 z is just 0 0 1 so really for me One. So, really, for me, a reaction network is a directed graph where the vertices are associated to these vectors. And if you care about polynomials, we're going to ask that these vectors have non-negative integer coefficient, but really it doesn't matter. So, what is a mass action system? Well, you take a reaction network, like I talked about, and you throw these positive constants on the edges. These are what we call rate constants. And I mean, they're nothing more. And I mean, they're nothing more than positive weights. And for most of the talk, we're actually going to say, well, we don't really know what these things are, so treat it as a symbol. But just keep in mind that these are supposed to represent a positive real number. So that's a reaction network. And given that, given this weighted directed graph, so mass action can, yes, Alexander, thank you. A mass action system is going to be the real. Sum is going to be the reaction network, which is the graph with the vector information, plus these rate constants. And once you have this weighted directed graph, then you can write down a polynomial ODD. And the way you do it is you look at the rate constants, multiply by the monomial associated to the sources, which I'll explain, and then you have to multiply by the direction that the edge is heading. So let's say, for example, if I look at this particular reaction, x plus At this particular reaction, x plus y goes to z. Well, in this case, the rate constants is k23. The monomial is going to be the monomial associated to the sources. So we're going to have x to the power of 1, y to the power of 1, and z to the power of 0. And then the reaction vector is, well, if I follow this particular edge, what is the kind of direction that's being given by this reaction? Well, it's going to be minus 1, minus 1. Well, it's going to be minus one, minus one, one, and that is just one of these reactions. If you have, let's say in this case, four reactions, you're actually going to have to add up four different terms. So, in this sense, that's why if you kind of restrict yourself to the vertices being associated to non-negative integer, you're going to end up with a polynomial ODE. If you say, you know, it could be real, it doesn't have to be integer, then you end up with some sort of ODE where you might have slightly strong. Where you might have slightly strange exponents, but nothing changes in what I'm going to talk about. Now, the way I talked about the graph is that we're going to replace all these vertices with vectors. So instead of having these abstract labels, I have these vector labels. They're vectors. Why not just plot them? And so this is what we call a Euclidean embedded graph or an e-graph. Simply, you take the node. So for example, 001. You plot it right here. It right here. 200, you plot it right here. And then you respect the graph structure. So because I have this edge from z to 2x, I'm going to make sure that I include this edge from z to 2x. And so you simply take this map and you pinpoint all these vertices in the correct places, then you end up with something called the Euclidean embedded graph. What's really useful, this perspective will be really key for what I will talk about. What I will talk about. And one important thing is you can read a lot of geometric information from the Euclidean embedded graph. For example, take the convex hall of all the source vertices. You end up with the Newton polytope. If you want to think in terms of like the stoichiometric compatibility class that we talked about yesterday, well, simply it's going to be the span of whatever where the edges lie. So in this case, sort of the Newton polytope and the span of Of the reaction vectors kind of coincide, except no triangle versus a plane. So, this view will be very useful, and we will make use of this particular view of the action network. Pauline, may I clarify about the last thing? So, are you saying that this stoichiometric compatibility classes from yesterday will be in this case planes parallel to the triangle you have? Exactly. Okay, but you should not, but you must. But you should not, but do not see it in this particular graph. What will happen is instead of having these abstract labels as graphs, you're going to have a state space in terms of these additional variables. And then, yes, you will see kind of triangles that contain the particle planes that contain this particular triangle. So, there are sort of two different R3 in this particular case. One is In this particular case, one is where you embed the graph, that's sort of one geometric object. And then, yes, you also have the state space, which happens to be R3 positive. And there you sort of just take your triangle, translate it over to the new space, and say, well, any affine plane that contains the triangle. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So with that, we're going to move on to what I call the boring dynamic. Boring is actually a misnomer and a misadventure. Actually, a misnomer and a misadvertisement because these happen to be, they share, they have a lot of great algebraic as well as dynamical properties. And these are called complex balanced systems, or they're also known as toric dynamical systems because there is some sort of toricity hidden in their algebraic structure. So, in terms of definition, we're going to start with a steady state. So, this is a fixed point of your ODE. We're going to say that a fixed point or a steady state. That a fixed point or a steady state is complex balance if essentially the flux flowing across each vertex is balanced out. So, for example, if we look at the vertex 2x, there are two edges coming in. So, I'm going to want the weighted rate function and calculate, well, what is the sort of net flux flowing into this vertex? So, for example, this one over here, you're going to have k4 times z. Going to have k4 times z, whatever the state z is, and we're going to want to evaluate it at steady state. And in addition, there's also this flux coming from the k2 vector. So the net flux flowing into the vertex 2x is going to be k2xy plus k4z. And we're going to want to balance that out with the flux flowing out of there. So there is one edge flowing out. And so we want sort of the polynomial k2xy plus k4z to be. xy plus k4z to be equal to k1 x squared. And then you repeat this for every single vertex of your graph. And that's how you define complex balancing. Right, so we have three vertices, so you have three equations. Now, what's special about these is that once you have one steady state that is complex balanced, it turns out that every single positive steady state is complex balanced. So that's why instead of calling a steady state complex balance, we'll end. A steady-state complex balance, we'll end up calling the mass action system itself complex balance if it has one. And like I said, they just have amazing sort of algebraic structures as well as dynamical structures. So in terms of the algebraic... So just to clarify, so if this complex, these conditions you had on the previous slide, if they hold, this will be a steady state. Will be a steady state, but not every steady state has these conditions, right? So, actually, the way it's defined is that if, let's say you find X, Y, Z that satisfies the equations I wrote on the screen before. Like, let's say you found a solution to this. It will happen that this is a steady state. So, okay. And you could, yes, and separately, you could prove that any other steady state of your ODE, of your mass action system, will satisfy these equations. Okay, so all or none. Exactly, it's either an all or none scenario. So that's why we're going to end up calling the system itself complex balance if it has one solution that solves these polynomial equations. Yeah. And I did kind of mention that another name that complex balance system goes by is Tauric Dynamical System. And it's sort of hidden inside these monomial parametrizations that you can find. And it is in terms. And it is in terms of both the rate constants or like polynomials of these rate constants and the state variable flows. We could define these binomial equations, which I don't have time to get into. So I just sort of put in an additional slide for anyone who might be interested in the toric structure of these systems. And sort of in short, I just want to say algebraically, they're amazing. Dynamically, they're very, very stable. So we know that there's the Eliapunov function. Eliapunov function, so it's asymptotically stable, all the semi-states within their compatibility class. We know that they're linearly stable, and in fact, it's conjectured that they're globally stable. So, you really should think of complex balancing, complex balanced systems are these very amazing, very stable systems with a lot of algebraic properties. Unfortunately, it's not that easy for a system in general to be complex-balanced. There are Be complex balance. There are these equations on the rate constants that you need to satisfy. And again, I don't have time to go into it, but roughly speaking, the number of equations that you need the rate constants to satisfy are kind of dictated by this network invariant called the deficiency. So we're going to say deficiency is going to be the number of vertices. So in this case, you're counting and you're like, okay, that's five. You're like, okay, that's five number of connected components. So, in this case, two. So, already you're counting five minus two minus sort of the span of the reaction vector. So, sort of the dimension of the stoichiometric subspace or stoichiometric compatibility class. So, in this case, two. And I sort of realized I just skipped a poll question because I gave you the answer already. The answer already. So, in this particular case, I'm going to skip the question, the poll question, because I gave you the answer. This particular network has deficiency one simply by counting the number of vertices, number of connected components, and then you're reading: okay, what is the span of all these reaction vectors in your network? So, this particular network you see here, this is actually a variety. Here, this is actually a version of the network that Selkoff studied for glycolysis, and it does exhibit oscillations for some choice of parameter values, for some choice of rate constants. And yet, I'm telling you that, well, there are these other algebraic equations that if the rate constants satisfy, actually the system would be complex balanced and you have all these nice stability properties. And this is just to illustrate that, you know, if I have an algebraic I have an algebraic condition on the rate constants. In general, if I randomly pick a set of rate constants, you're not going to satisfy those equations, and so you can't be complex balancing. So on the one hand, you have complex balancing, which have these amazing dynamical and algebraic properties, and yet they can be very, very rare. So, can we kind of extend it? Like, ultimately, if you think about it from a dynamical perspective, I care about the dynamical. I care about the dynamics. Maybe I care about the parametrization of steady state, and not so much about the network structure itself. So, is there some way for me to relax the network structure and essentially get the same dynamics as complex balancing? So, that's kind of the goal of what I'll be talking about. And the way we do this is through something called dynamical equivalence. And here, you have to take back that Euclidean embedded graph perspective of reaction. Graph perspective of the action network because it makes so much more sense when we're talking about that. So here's an example of a network. We have 0 goes to x plus y, which goes to x, and then you also have 2x going to x plus y. And here's the Euclidean embedded graph. So you simply take the vertices and you put them in the correct place in R2. If you calculate the deficiency, it is deficiency 1. So in general, you would kind of So, in general, you would kind of think: okay, there are these algebraic constraints that the rate constants have to satisfy. And the thing I didn't, I kind of hide under the rug is that you also need some graph structures in order for your system to be complex balancing. And the graph structure is that the connected components have to be strongly connected. That aside, right? So, you have to kind of, for this particular example, you have two things that prevent you from being complex balancing. You have the Balancing. You have the lack of the proper graph structure, and you have this positive deficiency. But let's focus on the middle reaction right there. Now, let's think back to linear algebra. You have this downward pointing vector. I can just split it up. Like, I can just split it up to go to the left and to the right. They add up to the same thing as long as you correct for the rate constants. But really, we haven't changed the polynomials at all. We haven't changed the system of. At all. We haven't changed the system of ODEs. And the only thing that you have to be careful is that your rate constants might end up slightly weird looking. Your new rate constants for this orange network would be kind of linear conditions on the original rate constants. But once you do this, you end up with the same ODEs. But if you now calculate the deficiency here, it's deficiency zero and your connected components. Your connected components is strongly connected. The graph itself is strongly connected. So, automatically, it doesn't matter what K1, K2, K3 are, your system ends up being complex balanced. And if you think about it, so for this kind of weakly reversible network with this two pairs forming a 10, you know that there is, well, okay, if it's higher dimension, you could parameterize there are these like toric structures behind it. You know that you basically have very nice stability property. Have very nice stability property. In fact, this is globally stable. And yet, when you look at sort of the original network and the original polynomial system, it's not so clear. So this is kind of the idea behind dynamical equivalence to complex balancing, because now I can end up saying, well, any positive study state of this kind of ugly looking network, it's also globally stable. So this is how we kind of extend the property of complex. Extend the property of complex balancing to non-complex balancing systems that share the same property. Officially, we're going to say that two weighted reaction networks or two mass action systems are dynamically equivalent if they generate the same ODE. And what's important is: okay, at first, it looks like that you have a non-linear relation between these k's and k primes. So k's are the k primes. So k's are going to be the original rate constants from one network and k prime would be the rate constants from a different network. It looks like you have a non-linear relations on these, but you're going to need this to hold on the entire state space. So why not use the linear independence of monomials and you end up pulling kind of the rate constants times the reaction vector and you only have to balance a system of these, one for each monomial that One for each monomial that shows up, or for each vertex that shows up. So, kind of we're taking dynamical equivalence. On one hand, you remember that, okay, it means that they generate the same ODE. On the other hand, really, there are linear conditions on the case, right? If you know what the reaction vectors are, so some of the common operations that you could easily Operations that you could easily imagine. Kind of what I did for the example that motivated all of it is that you could combine vectors, right? You add these two up, you end up with a vector in the middle. You could break up a vector like I did. So take this one vector, you know, split it open. As long as the rate constant on those two edges kind of satisfy a certain linear relation, it's okay. What's maybe not the first thing you think of is, well, First thing you think of is: well, why not just create random new vertices as sources? So, for this particular one, let's say, you know, I draw these three edges coming out of nowhere. As long as the weight constants on them satisfy a linear relation, so that the weighted sum of these reaction factors add up to zero, I haven't changed my ODE. So, these are kind of, you know, keep in mind, these are some common operations that you could do, and it doesn't change your ODE. And it doesn't change your ODE, but you are changing the graph structure every time you do this. And as a backup slide, I do have like a quiz-yourself section where you could look at it and ask yourself, okay, when is it that, you know, for every rate constants that I start with, does there exist some rate constants on these other networks so that you could generate the same ODE as a quiz yourself, see if you could kind of understand what's going on with dynamical equivalence. And actually, those are very. Equivalence and actually, those are very, very good questions because then we're kind of looking at possible dynamics that can be generated by different networks and look at okay, what are their intersections? So, if those things are interesting, you could take a look at the additional slides once the slides are posted. So, coming back to the motivation, we basically want dynamical equivalence to complex balancing. And I'm going to kind of echo back. Sorry, I think there's a question. I think there's a question. Is this similar to the system theory idea of indistinguishability of structure? Basically, it is. And another related term is like, well, can you identify network structure that satisfies this ODE? These are all very, very related ideas. In fact, I would say in this case, probably the same. All right. So dynamical equivalence to complex balancing. So Alexander yesterday talked about sort of Yesterday, I talked about searching parameter space from which you get certain dynamics. I'm going to ask the same question, but for dynamical equivalence to complex balancing. And as a motivating example, we're going to talk about single target network. So here I'm going to say poll time. Let's see which question I am on. All right. So let's open the poll. Which of these is not? Which of these is not a single target network? And think of these as kind of abstract representations of Euclidean embedded graphs, right? And highlighted in pink is the Newton polytope in this case. Yeah, I just see the number growing. And you guys are absolutely right. It's not a trick question. Right, it's not a trick question. The one with two orange targets are not a single target network because there is more than one target. I sort of enjoy these polls, even though some of these are not very serious. My questions are not very serious. Anyway, so we start looking at this whole family of single target networks, which is exactly what it sounds like. You have these sources, and it all directs to a single target. And we're asking ourselves: okay, when is the case? Asking ourselves, okay, when is the case that any of these networks or systems, when you put arbitrary k-constants on there, when is it dynamically equivalent to a complex balance system? And this is our theorem. Essentially, whenever the target is in the relative interior of the Newton polycode. So, you know, this example right here, your target is sitting firmly inside the Newton polytope. So it is that. Polycope. So it is dynamically equivalent to complex balance, no matter what the rate constants you start with. These other two examples, when the target is not in the relative interior, so either you're on the boundary or you're outside the mutant polytope, turns out that these have no positive steady states no matter what the rate constants are. So we completely characterize the single target mass action systems depending on the Systems depending on the geometry of the network. And just as a note, what we end up doing is for what we call the stable single target system, the network that we end up using is just make all the edges reversible. So you kind of add these edges that go back out. And the fact that the target is in the relative interior of the Newton polytope means that you could generate these rate constants so that they all balance out. They all balance out. So, when we put these rate constants out there on these outgoing edges or outward-pointing edges, the weighted sum of all the reaction factors just add up to zero miraculously. And in addition, we could show that, in fact, you could have the new system is complex balancing. Now, even though we're using this target vertex, in a separate result, we actually showed that if you're looking for dynamical equivalence to complex balancing, Dynamical equivalence to complex balancing, you actually don't need it. So I can actually find yet another network which doesn't use this target vertex in the middle. It's just for convenience, for the sake of the proof, we use it. That brings me to the next question. Okay, we're done with one target in the relative interior of Newton polytope. What about more than one target? Like, what happens there? Can we do the same thing? Can we prove something about About dynamical equivalence to complex balance in terms of the network structure. Because that's really what we're interested in in terms of kind of the geometry that you start with, the relative, sorry, the Newton polytope, and kind of where the reaction vectors are pointing. And this is where we run into a problem. So let's start with a one-dimensional example. What we have is on the real line, starting at zero, you have this edge. Zero, you have this edge, no, and then at two, at three, and at five. We just picked them out to be spaced out very regularly because this is kind of the simplest, interesting example that we could think of. And instead of working with the rate constants for dynamical equivalence, it doesn't actually hurt for me to kind of put in symbolically the monomials in there, just because if you think about it, whatever the same monomial is going to show up on both sides. Monomial is going to show up on both sides of the linear equation, so let's just put it in there. And the reason I do this is because when we talk about complex balancing, actually, I want the rate constants multiplied by the monomials. So that's kind of the variables that we'll be working with. And because I said, okay, no new nodes, so really the graph that the graph structure that I will be considering is going to be the complete graph on those four vertices. And this mess. And this mass is just to indicate, you know, how do you label the rate constant, yeah, the new rate constant. So from one to four, this edge, you know, it has subscript one, four. The equations that we start with is, well, you're going to need the dynamical equivalence relations for vertices, four linear equations in terms of the j's, and the qij's, which are the rate constants times a monomial. Complex balance condition on the complete graph. So you're going to again get four linear equations in terms of the Q's alone because kind of the old fluxes don't come into picture. For convenience, we also throw in the steady state equation of the original system. So just to show you, what you end up with is this massive scale, like this massive system of linear equations in terms of the j's and the qij's. So these are rate constants times the monomial. Times the monomial. And the only condition that you require is that the j's actually have to be positive and the qij's are non-negative, reflecting the fact that an edge might or might not be there in the complete graph. So what's important here is that, you know, this is a system of linear equations and linear inequality. And it turns out, if you ever want to look at it, the complex balance conditions, there's always going to be some sort of linear dependence, and you could cross-house the. Your dependence, and you could cross out the extra equations if you want. So, what we did is we just kind of brute force calculated. And then, so we first obtained some linear inequalities in terms of the J's. So the Q's actually don't feature into here, even though we use them. And then you substitute back the monomials and the rate constants, and miraculously, you end up with an inequality in terms of the rate constant. An inequality in terms of the rate constant, right? And in fact, you could show that this is an if and only if. So we managed to show just by force calculation that the system, the four reactions pointing kind of to two targets, is dynamically equivalent to complex balance if and only if k1 times k4 is bigger than k2 times k3. And we're like, is this a fluke? Like, I mean, you kind of see that x to the 5 factors out when we do this calculation. Can this When we do this calculation, can this be generalized? So we move to a 2D system, and the same thing happened. You end up with these inequalities in terms of the rate constant, again, Bruteworth's calculation, and you get an if and only if condition in terms of dynamical equivalence to complex balance. And the networks that you end up using is kind of some sort of substructure of the complete graph using the source vertices. So we're like, is this a correct? So we're like, is this a coincidence? Because the reaction network that we picked out are very rectangular and very regularly spaced? Or are we asking a good question? In general, can you do this? Start with some sort of network where the targets in the relative interior of the Newton polycode, and then somehow be able to obtain inequalities in terms of the rate constants for dynamical equivalence to complex balance. Chemical equivalence to complex balancing. And that's, and ultimately, the goal is to understand that in terms of the Newton polycope and the vectors that you originally start with, which way are they pointing, the geometry of the reaction network itself. So with this, I just want to summarize and say, you know, when we're talking about dynamical equivalence to complex balancing, there are two steps that you have to do. There's a linear feasibility problem in terms of these fluxes. Be problem in terms of these fluxes, and they're going to be involving kind of the rate constants and this indeterminate state variable. It doesn't matter what they pick. But you end up using doing a linear feasibility problem, and you end up with these linear inequalities in terms of the J's and the Qij's. Then the next step is, well, focusing on the linear inequalities involving just the J's, the rate process that you started with, can you eliminate the state variable? Can you eliminate the state variable and get non-linear inequalities in terms of the weight constants? That's the ultimate goal. And based on what we heard yesterday in David's talk, it seems like real quantifier elimination might be the answer. And there is actually progress towards this problem. And that's given by Stefana on Friday. So you should attend this talk if any of this is interesting. So with this, I won't take up more of your time. Thank you very much. Thank you, Pauline. Are any questions? Just please unmute yourself or ask in chat. Oh, yes, actually, I agree with Alicia's question. So, some of the expressions you had looked like determinants. Looked like determinants? Yes, so I think Stefano will talk about this. She ends up, they actually end up getting these determinants and discriminants of the polynomial system. But for us, we didn't look too deeply into it. We're just like, can you do this in general? So the answer is, I think yes. You get some sort of determinants coming out of there. I have a question. May I ask a question? May I ask a question? So, is the following statement true or false? The equivalent dynamical equation, differential equation, would be that it is either complex balanceable or not. Yes, well, um Well, um yes, it is. It is. It is. Okay, thank you. If we kind of understand complex balanceable, meaning there exists great constants like that, yes. Then the answer is yes. So therefore, therefore, complex balanceable is a property of a dynamical system. Yes, it is. It is. But you should also remember there's a spectrum, right? Either it is completely Of the spectrum, right? Either it is completely not complex balanceable, or it is complex balanceable for some region of parameter space, or it is always complex balanceable as in the single target network. Oh, I see. So, when I say a dynamical system, I meant a particular A particular coefficients, also. This is what the reaction constants. So they are fixed in the dynamical system. Where, I don't call the, let's not call the reaction constant coefficient, rather coefficient for any numbers appearing in the dynamical system description. So maybe the way to make this precise is: let's say your polynomial. Is let's say your polynomial system looks like this. So you're gonna end up with these indeterminate case. Actually, you're also gonna have these additional coefficients that come from the reaction vectors times x to the yi. So maybe I should say you're gonna fix the AIs, you're gonna fix the monomials, and then you leave the ki. And then you leave the KIs indeterminate. In this case, then again, you kind of get this big spectrum is that either you're never complex balanceable because of the way the monomials and the vectors AI are pointing, or you're always complex balanceable, or maybe there's some region within the parameter space that makes you complex balance. What about just you use the you're writing the size simply a polymer Writing the size simply a polynomial, fixed polynomial. Fixed polynomial, so like you basically get rid of the case. That's right, okay. That's right. Yes, so in this case, yes, either you come from complex balancing or you don't come from complex balancing. Okay, thank you. Yes, but my kind of the goal is to say you have these parameters and then you want to search for like how complex balanceable are you? Are you in terms of fantastics? Thank you. Thanks so much. Okay, other short questions? If not, let's thank the speaker and continue with longer questions during the coffee session. Thank you.
