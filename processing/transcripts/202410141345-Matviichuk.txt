Okay, thanks. So I this is joint work with Brent Pym, who is an organizing of one of the organizers of this conference, and Travis Schedler, whose name almost appears in the title of the workshop. But uh so we we we've done So we we we've done a few projects before which were mostly in the Poisson algebras and we kind of use uh we study geometry of those Poisson algebras using deformation theory but uh then we still noticed that some of the arguments and some of the ideas sort of apply also for non-commutative uh algebras and non-commutative geometry and we think they lead to some interesting results. So it's like perfect conference to present these results at To present this results at because maybe it would be good to get feedback from people working in non-computative algebras. And also, of course, Poisson geometry. So what the idea that I'm gonna explore, so I want some new examples, I want new constructions for non-commuter of non-commutative algebras that satisfy Of non-commutative algebras that satisfy nice regularity properties. So I want to start with sort of simple looking, or like a, yeah, I'll put in quotation mark simple and non-commutative, let me just say short the quantum P. Let me just say short, a quantum P PM, quantum projective space. And learn how to deform it. And see what kind of examples we can obtain this way. So this is the object that I'm gonna deform will be the following. So it will be Algebra AQ, I denote it by AQ. So, what that is, is quotient of the free algebra on n plus 1 variables, let's say. Modular relations that you obtain following ways. So, relations say that when you commute to two of the variables, you obtain a factor. obtain a factor. So Qij is just a matrix of coefficients, complex coefficients. So the question I want to study is how to start with this non-commutative algebra. There are n different names that you can find in the literature for this. So sometimes we all probably Sometimes we all probably start saying q polynomial algebra at some point. So it's almost like polynomial algebra, except there is slight non-commutativity. And also sometimes you can see it's called toric quantum projective space. So you can think of this as a coordinate as a graded ring, graded polynomial ring, small non-commutativity. And Torik refers to the fact that when you rescale any of the variables, the relations remain unchanged. Okay, so I'm gonna study deformations of these. Now Now if I just consider any combination of coefficients q, then the formations of this would be very complicated to study. Because for instance, if all q's are ones, then we would just get polynomial ring. And studying deformation of a polynomial ring is more or less, well, in particular, it contains studying all posts, on brackets, on in all on all posts, on all quadratic posts. on po all person all quadratic Poisson algebras. And that's very complicated problem. It's known to be very complicated to uh try to classify all uh quadratic Poisson algebras. So I'm gonna I'm gonna impose some non non-degeneracy conditions on the coefficients Q that will allow me to describe the deformations nicely. So if I want to get control over the deformations of this, for instance some finite dimensionality of deformations Finite dimensionality of deformations, stuff like that, I need to impose a condition on the matrix Q. So, okay, so I'm gonna assume that Q is obtained from a skew-symmetric matrix pi by exponentiation. So pi So, pi is a skew symmetric. And also, I'm gonna impose the following non-degeneracy condition on pi. I'm gonna assume that rank of pi is n, which is one less than the size of pi. So Pi has n plus one entries here. I'm gonna assume that rank is n. So in particular, n is even. And so this is sort of important, this is sort of degeneracy condition, which is important for us. And one additional condition which is debatable, but I'm just gonna impose it for convenience is that for Is that for every i, the sum of i th rho of the matrix is zero. Sort of normalization condition. Okay, so what can we say about the algebras? Ah, and the idea didn't say that h bar is just a complex number. Okay, so Okay, so um what can we say about the algebra AQ in this case? Oh yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah. One of the most important things that this is just notation for entry-wise exponentiation. Thank you for the question. So I don't want to take exponent of the matrix, just exponent of each energy. Exponent of each energy. Okay, so the matrix, sorry, the algebra AQ, Q polynomial algebra, well in fact, so it's always Kazoo. I don't even need these conditions. Say that it's Kazoo. So it's always Kazoo. It's always Artine Shelter Regular. And it also in this case collabi yao this the property that was discussed in the first talk today. So it's always skewed kalabiau, no matter how you choose coefficient skew, but it's going to be honest kalabiau because of this condition. That's why we impose. So this condition in particular implies that product. This condition in particular implies that product of each uh row of matrix Q is one. So, and that that that property is equivalent to the algebra being kala B R rather than skew kala B R. Okay, um so it's very nice algebra, very well understood. So, I'm I'm gonna use now the property of Kuzilness. Uh that's Of Kazulness, that's going to be important. So, if you have an algebra that is Kazul, then it makes it easier to calculate its Haushel cohomology. Because instead of using bar resolution, you can use nice Kazul resolution, which is much smaller and much more manageable than bar resolution. So using this Kazul resolution for AQ, we can actually calculate the Hochshell cohomology. Which and why am I even talking about Haussl cohomology? Just to recall, because I want to consider deformations of the algebra and those are controlled by Hauchel cohomology and Gersten Haber bracket on it. But anyway, so okay, so what I want to show the problem is the rank of uh pi is only important here for the Is only important here for Colabiao. So it's always skew cola BL. But I know, sorry, yeah. Yeah, sorry. So far, so far rank is not important. So far, rank is not important. It's going to be important in a minute. So far, I don't use the fact then rank is maximal possible. Uh yeah, so I I assume yeah, so I assume that uh Qii is one always and Qji is Qij inverse. I mean it follows uh from the properties that pi is squishymetric and I'm taking exponent of it. Okay. So I want uh to consider a cochshelf homology of this algebra. Well because this algebra is invariant under the scaling of all variables, in fact the Cochrane homology splits nicely into direct sum of its weighted piece uh weight pieces with respect to the action of the the torus. The torus, there is n plus one-dimensional torus that acts by rescaling the coordinates. So I can split cauchial cohomology into its weight pieces with respect to the section. So I'm gonna, you know, this use this notation for the weight piece. So the piece so piece, so the piece, so the vector, the the the so the torus acts with weight w on this subspace of clockship homology. So that's sort of you get for free. Now what I really want is only consider C star invariant part of the Poisson of the Hochschull homology. Uh 'cause uh I really want to consider deformations of Consider deformations of this algebra that preserve the diagonal action of C star. I want uh quadratic deformations. Those are the the most interesting. Just C star with diagonal action. With diagonal action, yeah. C star embeds diagonally in C star plus n plus one. plus one. And that precisely corresponds to the weights where the sum of all coordina uh coordinates of the weight is equal to zero. Okay. And so one additional refinement of this decomposition is that when you write down Cozilla resolution, you kind of quickly Down Cozilla resolution, you kind of quickly see that the only weights that are relevant, the only weights that can potentially contribute, are the ones where each coordinate is minus one or greater. So it's sort of very easy to see for the Poisson cohomology, unlike the compositions of Poisson cohomology, you only consider polyvectors. So you consider polyvectors as echo chains, and they automatically have this condition. Automatically have this condition just because polyvector does not have more than one d by dxi. But in Haushoch homology, this is also true. So all relevant weights have this bound. So what we want is to what we want is really to find out for which w this is non-zero. That's sort of the basic question that you we want to understand So okay, so that's so far again I'm not using rank anywhere just yet So a quick calculation shows that W contributes to Hochschlich homology. So here I'm assuming that W is satisfies the conditions I spelled out. So this happens if and only if for every i such that w i is equal to a sorry is non-negative. Equal to a is non-negative, you have that product over j of qij to the power wj is equal to 1. So some some very very very concrete condition uh on on on uh coefficients q. Now I'm st gonna start now using Now I'm gonna start now using some of these assumptions. So first I want to assume that H bar is generic enough. And by generic, I mean avoids finitely many bad values, so to speak. And if I assume that H bar is generic, If I assume that H bar is generic, then in fact you can rewrite this left-hand side as exponent of some linear combination. And if H by is generic, then you can take logarithm and you can obtain some linear algebra condition on pi's instead of q's. Okay. So if h bar avoids finitely many values, then you can rewrite condition or Hawkshaw cohomology being non-zero just in terms of linear algebra. And so that's our idea. So we reduce this problem now to just linear algebraic equation. Linear algebraic equation, or yeah, basically a bunch of linear algebraic conditions. And now I'm gonna finally use the condition that rank pi of pi is maximal possible. So matrix pi is not uh invertible on the nodes because it has corrupt one instead of corrupt zero. However, you can sort of you can invert it anyway by using the following procedure. Just extend the matrix pi with minus ones and ones, so just add uh column of one. add column of one and row of minus ones and then then you can invert it and the the inverse will be of the following form so there will be some matrix B here you'll have some row some column which is not so important but I'm gonna write it explicitly but it's like whatever that is It's not so important. So I'm gonna extract this matrix B by sort of inverting pi. And the idea that this matrix B is gonna make this condition look much nicer. And the the the reason for introducing this matrix be that it has top some topological interpretation. has top some topological interpretation. So a topological interpretation of B is the following. So if pi has full rank then after projectivizing it with the of the after taking the projectivization of C n plus one you obtain projective space and pi induces a Induces a log canonical log symplectic bracket on the projective space. But the coefficients, they don't have nice coefficients of that log canonical bracket don't have very nice interpretation. However, so topology, so B is coefficient of the two-form that lives on the complement of the Uh hyperplanes of Pn. So let me write it down. The periods of symplectic form on projective space minus coordinate hyperplanes. So in this way, B is topological. So symplectic form will have poles over these hyperplanes, but so you can, if you want it to be holomorphic, you have to throw them away. But then you get some topology and encoding topological data, you can extract this B. That's sort of geometric interpretation of this matrix B. Of geometric interpretation of this matrix B. But if you kind of want to be very concrete, then you can just do linear algebra here. Okay, so using B now, I can give you a little bit nicer form of this condition over here. And let me give you let me give you a condition. And let me give you the answer in the most important case for us. Let me give you the answer for second Hauchel homology. Because second Hauchel homology represents infinitesimal deformations of the algebra. So the C star invariant part of the second Hochschl cohomology has the following. Has the following decomposition. So it has zero weight part. So that's no surprise there. You can just try to to deform algebra uh A Q by d just deforming Q's uh and so so that it remains So that it remains Q polynomial algebra. So that there is always this big high-dimensional summant. However, more interesting summons come next. So then I'm gonna introduce this notion of NHIJ being colored. And for each colored edge, there will be one-dimensional summoned. So let me explain what this means. So you color in an edge connecting two vertices i and j in complete graph on n plus 1 vertices if uh two conditions hold for this uh Conditions hold for this matrix B. So, first of all, Bij is not equal to zero, and secondly, for every k which is not equal to ij, there is a certain quotient that has to be non-negative integer. Okay, so that's uh that's a sort of calculation that you that's That's a result of the calculation if you calculate cistern invariant part, so scaling invariant part of the second Poisson homology. So there is this zero weight piece, which is very well, I mean it's very easy to see what it is. But then there are this less trivial pieces which come which you c you obtain them whenever conditions one and two hold for a pair of indices for i and j. Indices I and J. So whenever these two conditions hold for a pair of indices, you get one-dimensional contribution to the second Hochschlipper homology. And so you get infinitesimal deformation coming from this pair of indices ij. And the weight of the contribution Of this colour page Is the following. So you have minus ones in coordinates i and minus one in coordinate j, and everywhere else you have something non-pos uh non-negative. And precisely what that non-negative number is, is precisely this quotient. So wk is equal to that quotient that I wrote. Okay, so uh sorry for giving you uh so ma so many details about this, but um So many details about this, but so what do we get from here? That by finding this matrix, by checking some conditions, linear algebra conditions, you can find the first order deformations of the algebra. So for instance, let me give you an example how it works in practice. Here is one interesting example. One interesting example that you can obtain. So we start with matrix pi, like so, but somehow matrix pi is less convenient to work with, so I create matrix B instead, which is sort of inverse of pi. And then for matrix B, I'm checking all these conditions. And I obtained the following four contributions to the second-person homology. So let me draw. So let me draw. Yeah, anyway, so what do they mean? This four contributions means that if you have four possible ways to deform the relations in such a way that the deformation of the AQ is flat, like dimension of graded pieces doesn't jump. So if you use one of these four possible ways to deform the relations, meaning you just deform one relation. I mean, you just deform one relation and the re the other relations are undeformed, then I can check that the deformation is flat. So you kind of get new example of, you get new non-commutative algebra this way, with the same Hilbert series as original one. Epsilon is just any. Epsilon is just any any non-zero. Epsilon is just any number, which is the number of numbers. Epsilon is just any number which is non-zero. Oh, but uh now the expression of the number I mean oh those are just three, this is not epsilon, sorry. No no I mean the epsilon the uh the V the V equals maybe H is not exactly the same. Oh what's what's H? No no no I mean the if the epsilon is not I mean the wrong polynomial or polynomial is actually a constant. Yeah, epsilon is just a constant. Any constant. Any constant, as long as it's non-zero. Um however, I I want to say something that uh if you deform them all together, this is not gonna be flat deformation. So I'm gonna talk about this in a little in a moment. So for now, I'm just saying that if you choose one of these four options to deform, then that gives you flat deformation. However, if you start combining them, that's a little more complicated. So I'm gonna get to that. Any any questions so far? Any questions so far? Yeah? Anyone? Pi has one dimensional kernel. Pi has one dimensional kernel because I want to work with homogeneous coordinates, but on a projective space. So I want the Poisson structure to be non-degenerate on the projective space, not on the vector space. So the yeah, the Euler vector is the only one vector in the kernel of that matrix, yeah. This one doesn't have to be integer. No, so is this a natural example? It just isn't. A natural example, so I'll say in what sense it is natural, hopefully. Can you say it again? After deformation, you can choose the same. After deformation, you can choose the same Gro- Grobner basis. Sorry, I'm thinking PBW basis, yes, and Grubner basis. So if you say Grubner basis, then yes. So the P so P B W basis you can still choose You can choo still choose the monomials where you have monotonicity in terms of indices if you want. So this sorry, I forget right now about the Grobner basis, but the PBW basis remains the same. Sorry, you're asking about Grubner basis. Uh so you you asking about group bases. Ah, okay, so okay, so I'll get to the why in what sense this is smaller than this monomer. Yeah, okay, yeah, that's a good question. So let me let me get let me get right to it. So, the key thing here that we're gonna now exploit is that whenever you have a bunch of separate deformations in this diagram, sorry, in whenever you have a bunch of separate first order deformations, they correspond, you can construct certain filtration out of them. out of them. So how do you construct filtration? Let me also, yeah, right. So how do you construct filtration? Let me just quickly say that how you encode this information pictorially. So we're gonna encode the Encode the deformation about the second possible Hochschule homology using the diagram where we color edges color contributing color the edges IJ that give you That give you a con uh that that contribute to H H two. So what do I mean by that? So in this example, I can encode the simple. I can encode this information about the weights that contribute to the Haushok homology in the following way. I I'm drawing a graph involving five vertices and I'm coloring the vertices, the edges of the The edges that correspond to two minus ones in each of the weights. So, for instance, the first weight has minus one in the coordinates zero and one. So, I'm coloring this edge. And I'm also indicating that coordinates one and one, so sorry, the non-zero entries show up in the place two and three. Then the next one, I'm next weight that contributes, has minus one at positions one and two. So I'm coloring that edge. And then I'm indicating that you have two occurring at the position zero. So I'm putting two colored arcs at the uh vertex zero. And then I continue like that. And then I continue like that, and I obtain some some diagram Like so. So just obtain some diagram where certain edges are colored and now I'm gonna now I'm gonna introduce I'm gonna introduce the filtration. So if the diagram does not contain a cycle Of colored edges there is a filtration that you can construct out of such diagram on algebra AQ. On the cupolinomelary. So you construct filtration in the following way. So let me denote that by theta one, capital theta one, to be the set of contributing weights. Two infinitesimal deformations and then for higher M I def define theta m to be Theta M to be just sum of M copies of theta one. So meaning that an element in theta m will be just sum of m elements of theta one, possibly the repeating. And so you define filtration, decrease in filtration. So you say that a monomial belongs to this graded to this piece of filtration if and only if, by definition. This vector beta is greater than or equal to W for some W in theta greater than or equal to M. Okay, so let's Okay, so uh l let's let's digest that. So um so theta one will will consist of um right, okay, so here, so here, so x1 and x2, so x1 times x0 and x0 times x1, they belong to the same piece of filtration. But x2 times x3 will be one piece deeper, one step deeper in the Deeper, one step deeper in the filtration. This is because if you take a weight of x1, x0, which is this weight, then the weight of this monomial will can be obtained from the weight of the uh of of x one times x zero by adding some element of theta one. Element of theta one. So the weight of this is 0, 0, 1, 1, 0. And you can see that you can obtain the weight of this perturbation from the weight of the original monomial by adding something in theta 1. And so sorry, um yeah. Any questions so far? So you can introduce this filtration. Now the the goal of this filt the usefulness of this filtration is that it can now we can construct deformation using this filtration of our original algebra. Let me state the main result. The main result. Maybe I'll state it. Let me state it here. So theorem. So let me list the assumptions explicitly, what I what I want. Okay, so What I want. Okay, so first of all, I want Q to be entry-wise exponential of some h bar times pi, where pi pi has size n plus 1 times n plus 1. Now the rank of pi is n Is n the sum of the rows is zero and h here is complex number, but I'm assuming it's generic, meaning avoids uh finitely many values. This finitely many values would depend on pi. But when you fix pi, then you have to throw away, you want, for instance, you throw away h being zero, h by being zero. That's uh we can't, we cannot deal the case when q is just identity matrix. Okay, so those are assumptions. Now, furthermore, we're assuming that you have a set of contributions. You have a set of contributing weights to the second pos Hochschuck homology. Such that the corresponding diagram does not have a cycle. Meaning, so each weight would correspond to one edge, one edge being colored in a diagram, and you don't want these edges to form a cycle. So, if that happens, then there is, then there exists filtered The formation of AQ that incorporates all All first order deforma all infinitesimal deformations coming from at least weights. So let me come up with a notation for this deformation. I'm gonna so it kind of depends on what kind of set of edges you choose. So I'm gonna denote this deformation by AQI, where i is the set of edges that you use to deform. Okay, so maybe now I'm I'm gonna ask uh to show the slides of the example. The example that will show the example and how it works in example. Okay. So this is the same example, but now instead of deforming just one of the correlations, I am deforming all four of them. And the the answer that that you obtain  four relations that correspond to the four colored edges. And the outcome is that you can do it, however, you might need to add some more terms that would go deeper and deeper in the filtration. So you can always So you can always read out what those terms are using combinatorics of this theta1 and theta2, theta3 and so on. So you can read off the exponents of these additional terms in the deeper filtration pieces. However, you might not know what are the coefficients. So theorem doesn't tell you what the coefficients are. Theorem only tells you that the there exist coefficients. Tells you that there exist coefficients, the C capitals, such that this deformation is a flat deformation of the AQ. So to find this coefficient, you just need to solve them term by term by imposing flatness of these relations. So can you move next slide? Oh yeah, okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. So in this case, you can solve the coefficients and you get some big expressions like that. But it's sort of like you have to use computer to do that, but it's pretty straightforward. And you know that like Ethereum gives you uniqueness. So in principle, you don't have to compute them to know that algebra exists, but you can be very explicit and calculate all the coefficients. Okay. Any questions? Okay. Any questions? About the Ramo examples. Number of parameters of deformations. So there are no parameters. So there is only a discrete parameter, which is what set of edges you use. Now, when you fix the edges that you are deforming along, it doesn't matter what parameters you put. So if I were to put here like epsilon. put here like epsilon one here, epsilon two here, epsilon three, epsilon four, then in fact you wouldn't obtain, you would obtain an isomorphic algebra to this one. So this algebra does not really depend on, that's why I sort of didn't write epsilons here. So you could put epsilon here, but it wouldn't change the isomorphism type of this algebra. As you see, I'd not This C are not really parameters, they are uniquely determined by the first order terms. So the C okay, I guess there is one parameter which is V, so which is exponent of H bar. So maybe that's one parameter. Sorry, yeah, I guess I was wrong. So yeah, so the V is a parameter which is e to the power h bar. So there is only one parameter h bar. I forgot about that. Right, so this this first order deformations here They uh they represent infinitesimal deformation, so they they correspond to classes in HH2 in the second Hochschlick homology. Coefficients of the rational functions are integers. Okay, I guess they are. I'm not sure if that's a common phenomenon. So coefficients of these rational functions are integers. That's a good question. I think in all the examples they are integers, but I don't know if that's if we can prove that. That the coefficients of V in the expression for C are integers. I don't know if we can. C I integers. I don't know if we can prove that. That's an interesting observation. Yeah, so this expression, once you've uh yeah, once you decide I'm gonna deform alone four edges, not three or two, then once you decide okay I'm gonna deform alone all four edges, then this expression is completely canonical. And this expression is completely canonical indeed, up to choice of H bar. Okay, any further questions about theorem or example? Okay. Maybe you have ten minutes. Okay, thank you. So let me so this gives you you know this gives you vast supply of examples. So how many examples can we obtain this way? So how how representative is this example of Is this example of other examples? So let me comment on that. So these diagrams we actually started drawing when we're considering deformations of log-symplectic Poisson algebras. So we were not deforming non-commutative algebras, we were just deforming Poisson algebras. And so we did some classification results for the h just how many pictures can you obtain in each dimension. So we we we considered dimension four. On P four, so we classified all these pictures that you can obtain, you know, by some five by if you start with any five by five matrix of rank four whose uh rows add up to zero, and you draw all kinds of pictures like that, how many pictures can you obtain? So we we calculated that and there are forty. That and there are forty uh smooth smooth smoothing diagrams. Yes, so yeah, exactly. So, the result is of deformation is a non-commutative algebra whose Hilbert series is the same as the Hilbert series of polynomial ring. So you can say that there are from this it follows that there are 40 quantum P4s. But that's that's so forty families of quantum P4s. So that would include the the family we started with, like AQ. Started with like AQ. So this Q polynomial algebra is one of the 40 families, but the other 39 are different. And we can prove, so if you have no cycle condition that I was imposing. We can prove that the deformation, so it remains Kuzu remains collabial so it's very easy to check. So it's very easy to check that it's skewkalabiao. It's just what Professor Wu said in the morning, that if you start with something that's skewkalabiao, you deform, it remains, you use filter deformation, it remains skewkalabiao. But in fact, we can also check that it's not just skewkalabia, it is honest Kalabio in this case. And so as a result, it's also Artien Sherlin regular, as a consequence of The consequence of Calabiao condition. So we have a vast supply of new examples of, you know, Calabiao, Kuzul, articulate regular algebras, whose Hilbert series is that of a polynomial ring. Okay. And um And just maybe in the remainder, few minutes that I have left, I'll just want to make a comment what happens if you have a cycle. So when you have a cycle, then our theorem does not work anymore. But the corresponding deformation actually does exist. And it was constructed by Fagin and Odesky in the 90s. So you can sort of classify combinatorially when you have a cycle of colored edges. And all this, there are not that many options. And all of them lead. Many options, and all of them lead to Faginodesky algebras which are elliptic, so they are related to elliptic curves. The geometry is related to elliptic. Yes, I'm I mean, yeah, right, I mean just one cycle. Let me say, there exists unique one cycle, then you obtain Fagin Odesky elliptic algebra. We'll have a talk about them later today. So you will see that they are very complicated and And Q52. For P4, yes, yeah, Q52 and Q51, yes. Yes, thank you. But that's true in any dimension, actually. So in higher dimension, you just have Q and K for some K. So right, so I lied a little bit before when I said that we can treat 39 examples. That we can treat 39 examples. We actually, two of them were treated before us by Fege Nodeski, and they are sort of very complicated, they lead to very complicated elliptic algebras. So our algebras are not as complicated, they sort of have simpler, they have this filtration, which helps you to deduce many properties about them. But we can construct much like like w many more examples using this approach. So yeah This approach. So, my intuition is that whenever you have a cycle, that corresponds to something elliptic in the deformation. But when you don't have a cycle, then you have filtered deformation. Okay, so the preprint is not out yet, but we're hoping to get it out by the end of this year for sure. Thank you.
