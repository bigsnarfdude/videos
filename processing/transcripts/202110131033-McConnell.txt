Quadratic forms and Hecke operators for SL2Z. Thank you. Thank you for the invitation. This is going to be joint work with Eric Banson and Kerry McIntosh. So Eric and Kerry are actually juniors at Princeton right now. This was a project we started summer a year ago during the beginning of COVID tide and also continued this past spring and summer. So, a slide on background. So, let boldface G be the group SLN for a finite divisional division algebra D over Q. And then let ordinary G be the real points of that. So, you know, in this week and last week, we've heard talks about Bianchi groups where D is an imaginary quadratic field. We've heard real quadratic fields. We've heard about quaternion algebras. I want to have that. I want to have that level of generality available during this talk. With that said, most of this talk will have d equals q, and so the ordinary g will just be a good old SLNR. Then x is the symmetric space, g mod a maximal compact subgroup. Gamma is going to be an arithmetic subgroup of g. So x mod gamma is a locally symmetric space. Then I'll take any coefficient. I'll take any coefficient module with these provisos. Any coefficient module means a rational finite dimensional representation of g so that gives a representation of gamma. Hence, it gives a local system on x mod gamma. I'll suppose the representation satisfies integrality conditions so that Hecke operators are defined like Hecke pairs in Avner's talk. So, the overarching goal of all of this is to compute Hecke operators on the cohomology. Hecke operators on the cohomology of the locally symmetric space with coefficients in this arbitrary module. Now, Avner and his collaborators have, many people have done computations like this. Avner and his collaborators have done such computations for GL3, excuse me, for SL3 and SL4. So for a wide range of subgroups, gamma and a variety of different kinds of coefficients. A variety of different kinds of coefficient systems, m, characteristic zero, characteristic p. The typical pattern of these computational projects is to compute a range of Heke operators on the cohomology, sort of as many as you can, identify the Hecke eigenclasses, identify Galois representations which match the Heke data that you find. Therefore, these Galois representations are at least conjecturally attached up to the limits of the data, attached to the eigenvalue. The limits of the data attached to the eigenclasses. Though Aubner's talk on Monday in his joint work with Darren Dowd, that was different. That was Ash and Dowd had done something where they were provably attaching Gauer representations to classes, given two classes of the direct sum. Well, for computational projects, Aubner and Paul Gunnels and I have a series of papers for SL4, current project in progress. Current project in progress is where M is of dimension bigger than one. So these projects are based on the well-rounded retract. I'd like to devote a slide or two to reminding you of the well-rounded retract, although I think many people here know it. So take Rn with any positive definite quadratic form. We'll be considering lattices of rank N in that Rn. Then the arithmetic minimum of the lattice ranks of rank ranks. The arithmetic minimum of the lattice is the length of the shortest non-zero vector. The minimal vectors of the lattice are the vectors whose length is tied for being equal to the minimum. Then we say the lattice is well rounded if its minimal vectors span Rn. So if there's enough vectors tied for minimal length to span Rn. W is going to be the space of, I have to say, bases of well-rounded lattices. Rounded lattices. And the theorem about this that Agner wrote in the late 70s is there's an SLNZ equivariant deformation retraction from the symmetric space down to this W. So W is the well-rounded retract. The dimension of W is the VCD, the virtual cohomological dimension, which in this case is entrust two. And then W is a locally finite regular sum. Locally finite regular cell complex. So for any well-rounded lattice, you can ask whether it's minimal vectors. On some fixed bases, you consider the coordinates in Zn with respect to the basis. And then the cells in the well-rounded retract are characterized by like the sets of coordinates of their minimal vectors. Then when you mod out by S, L, and Z or finite index subgroups, you get a finite cell complex. Finite cell complex. And as you may know, the well-rounded retract is dual to Voronoi's decomposition of X into polyhedral cones. Voronoi's decomposition, the 1908 work going back to perfect forms. So Melody this morning gave us a very nice talk on perfect forms, and a lot of the speakers have mentioned it. In fact, the vertices of the well-rounded retract are the perfect forms. Now, and Ash in 84 wrote up a paper where he generalized this to SLN over any number field order division algebra. Let's see. Now, the Ash-Rudolph algorithm computes the HEC operators on the cohomology of the locally symmetric space when you're at the VCD. So, of course, Paul's last talk told us a lot about the Ash-Rudolph algorithm and extensions. But I don't think Paul mentioned that an algorithm of his own is what you use when you're working in for SLN and H at one degree less than the BCD. And so our papers are based on Gunel's algorithm. But of course, one, you know, I have a dream, like I've heard some young women sing that song to want to do it for all I. So McPherson and I introduced an algorithm. McPherson and I introduced an algorithm for Hack operators for any SLN, for any division algebra, D over Q, and for any I, for the cohomology of the locally symmetric space with any coefficient module. Now, again, in principle, we do it for any division algebra. This talk will just take SLNR for the simplicity, and therefore I'll keep two. And therefore, I'll keep to gamma is a subgroup of SLNZ for simplicity. So I have working code for this for, say, SLN for n equals 2, 3, and 4. It could be generalized, but you get fewer perfect forms when n is 4. You just have two different kinds of perfect forms, the Desargs configuration and the raised configuration. One could generalize it. The work with McPherson is written up in an archive paper in 2020 for the In 2020, for the general division algebra. Another source one can read is for GLNR. Dylan Galt and I have a paper in the Tbilisi Math Journal. I think many people in this conference were involved in this volume of the special edition of the Tbilisi Math Journal on these computations for arithmetic groups and lattices. The paper with Dylan Gaul, we talked about S. We talked about SLN, and the goal was to talk about how to generalize it to SP4. There's a couple different ideas that we have for generalizing it to SP4R. I'll mention more about that in a few slides. Now, the algorithm in this paper with McPherson generalizes the well-rounded retract to what we call the well-tempered retract. The allusion to J.S. Bach is due to Tony Bari, who thought of that name. Tony Bari, who thought of that name. So I'll spend the next few slides describing the well-tempered eject. Let's see. So we want to compute HECA operators, and for SLN, that's T of L K, where the basic set is K goes from 1 to N. So I need a prime L. So L is a prime for the rest of the talk. K is the number from 1 through N. Okay, I'm going to take X, the symmetric. Take X, the symmetric space, and cross it with an interval from 1 to L. So I'm going to take this symmetric space crossed with one higher dimension. See my hands. This new extra coordinate will be called the temperament, and it's a real variable tau between 1 and L. And so I think of x, see my hands are vertical, and then tau is going to the right as a real parameter. So the slices are. Parameter. So the slices are where tau is a constant, slice, slice, slice. So in each slice for a given tau, we'll perform a variant of the well-rounded retraction from Ash's paper. That variant depends on the value of tau. So here's the definition. L in Rn will be any lattice of, again, full rank. Take any sub lattice of M of L where this quotient is Where this quotient is z mod L to the kth power. So the quotient is elementary abelian at prime L of dimension k. Then we're going to say a vector y in the lattice L has tempered length if the tempered length of a vector is you take the length of the vector if it's in the sublattice M, but if it's not in the sublattice M, you lie about it. You say it's longer than it really is. Longer than it really is. And how much longer? Well, by a factor of tau. And as tau keeps growing, you are lying more and more, because that's the cynical perspective. I'll show you some movies in a second. So for each fixed tau, you do well-rounded retraction with this notion in each tau size separately. We have a space of dimension, the dimension of capital X, which is the V C. Capital X, which is the VC, well, it's not the VCD dimension X plus one extra dimension. You're doing retractions in each slice, you get something which is actually a piecewise linear complex, and it's a cell complex in its own right, but it's sort of one dimension higher than what we had done before. So it's called the well-tempered reject. So here's a few more comments to fix ideas. So W tilde is the well-tempered complex as a whole. Complex as a whole. W tilde sub tau is the slice of tau. Now, w tilde one, when tau equals one, it's just the well-rounded retract of Agner. That's sort of one side of this thing, and tau grows from that side on. At the other side of this thing, the last temperament L, it's the well-rounded retract again, but it's twisted. There's a conjugation or a general multiplication by this diagonal. By this diagonal matrix 1111 LLLL with K different L's. That you recognize that as the thing that generates the HEC operator. And now, as we go across with this one extra dimension, the complex as a whole, W tilde, it interpolates between Augner's retract and this twisted version of the retract for the heck graph where we want to compute. So the gamma action preserves each slice individually. Preserves each slice individually. But as we go across, we're making cells in general one dimension higher that are interpolating between the well-rounded retract and the well-rounded retract for the HEPA operator with its twist. But as you go across, there's going to be a finite number of like discretely spaced, not evenly spaced, but discretely spaced critical temperaments where the cell structure abruptly changes. You think of the my left, I guess, the side of this. Left on this side of this picture, you think of the well-rounded retract in the palm of my hand here. As you go across, the cells of the well-rounded retract stretch out. There comes a moment where they touch each other and then change to other connected by other cells. There comes another moment where they change differently. And after a finite number of changes, you're another copy of the well-rounded retract here. Where they change is called critical temperaments. Yeah, so I want to show you a movie of this for a moment. A movie of this for a moment, and I hope this is okay with the recording. I have to stop sharing and share my movie instead. Where's the share? So the way this movie viewer goes, it's at the end. That's a picture of the main cell of the SL3 well-rendered retractor Soleil cube, but that's what in a moment I'm going to click this button on the left and we're going to Going to click this button on the left and we're going to see the movie. So the movie is for the SL2 well-arounded retract, which is a graph, which is a tree. So we're going to see in a moment a tree, and then the tree is going to start moving continuously. What I should be showing you is a three-dimensional picture whose slices are graphs and they move across in the third dimension. But okay, the third dimension is time, basically. The third dimension is time basically. So, um, one, two, three, go. So, there's the well-rounded e-track, it's deforming itself. There's going to come a moment where these vertices bifurcate, they cross each other, and then they're they change in that way. Now, see, my mouse, there's another moment they're going to cross each other and they change in that way. Um, up to duality, there'll be a third crossing later, but now the movie. Be a third crossing later, but now the movie gets slow because a parameter is actually going up to the number 25. So I'll just keep talking. So my parameter tau went from one to five. I'll express it that way as the movie went along, say time one to time five. At time square root of three was the first crossing. And as later parts of the talk will explain, tau equals square root of three. Tau equals square root of three had a crossing because the Eisenstein integers have a ramified prime at three. The second crossing was at tau equals square root of five, and as the later part of the talk will explain, that's because five in the Gaussian integers is a split prime. So all the crossings were interpreted in terms of interesting prime ideals in certain imaginary quadratic number fields. In the imaginary quadratic number fields. So that's the gist of this talk by the end: we're going to explain things for these retracts, at least for SL2, using imaginary quadratic number fields. So go back to sharing that. And now I need to reshare the main screen. Any uh any questions right now? Okay, let's uh let's see, go back to full screen. Okay, here's a um just a theorem summarizing the well-tempered retract, deliberately meant to sound like the theorem about the well-rounded retract. The well-tempered retract is a locally finite regular cell complex. finite regular cell complex, its dimension is one plus the V C D. Cells are characterized by the coordinates in Z to the M of their minimal vectors, but now I have to look at when the minimal vectors are in the lattice L versus when they're in the sublattice M and also as you project down to the tau coordinate there's there are in general intervals of tau and the cells lie over intervals of tau or at critical temperament cells lie over points of tau. Then when you mod out by gain Then, when you mod out by gamma, it's still a finite cell complex, essentially, because the base was compact and the fibers were compact. Mark? Yes. So here you say the V, it's one dimension bigger than the, but like it seemed like, oh, sorry, the dimension was the time. Yeah, the dimension was the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. I need, I wanted to spend a little bit of time. Let's see, I need wanted to spend at least half a slide defining or reminding you, sort of defining a HECA operator. So in this setting, like we want to define the HEC operator TLK. I think everyone's familiar with what gamma naught means. It's matrices that look like that in congruence mod L. The lower right star is a k by k square block. The upper left star is a complementary n minus k. star is a complementary n minus k by n minus k block. The hec operator tlk for an arbitrary gamma in like I say I'm in SLNZ right now we um we make this you know multi-to-one map where it's w mod gamma downstairs yeah that's the single well-rounded return and upstairs it's w tilde mod gamma intersect this gamma naught so you're in this Gamma naught. So you're modding out by a finite index subgroup of the gamma, therefore you get more sheets. So it's a ramified cover upstairs. Two projections. P is the projection of the left-hand slice, the ordinary well-rounded retract from upstairs to downstairs. Because it's a finite index subgroup, that's still a many-to-one map. On the right, it's a twisted thing by the matrix of the Heck operator 0MO1LL. 101 LLL. So we've got two slices. The HEC operator technically is: we'll take cohomology everywhere with your favorite coefficient module, do Q upper star here composed with P lower star there. But for cohomology, P lower star is the one that's harder to define. But to compute this, I said these maps are on the two edges. So to compute this, I need to use all the cells going across the middle and sort of do the Do the going the cells across the middle of the top are all quasi-isomorphisms from a critical temperament to the wider stuff in the middle to the next critical temperament to the next wider stuff in the middle. All these quasi-isomorphisms back and forth. But I can compute them like I said, I've got working code, n equals three and n equals four. And so that's the definition of the HIPAA operator in this context. Now, yeah, this slide is about computational obstacles in this project. So, an approach I have been using to computing the well-tempered retract is to compute a polytope dual to it, which, well, I call the hecatope. What this is, is to the well-rounded retract, there's the dual object, which is the Voronoi polyhedron. Voronoi polyhedron, and last week's one of the talks called it the Ryskoff polyhedron. That the Voronoi polyhedron is a dual way of expressing, or it's another way of expressing Voronoi's perfect forms. Here I would add one extra dimension to the Voronoi polyhedron for the temperament and do something called the hecatope. So I compute this in my code using, again, we've, I know many of you have worked with perfect forms. I know many of you have worked with perfect forms. You've heard of the Voronoi graph, where from a perfect form is a vertex of the Voronoi polyhedron. If you just want to compute other perfect forms, you walk along an edge of the Voronoi polyhedron to get to the next kind of perfect form. But I want to compute all those faces of the Voronoi polyhedron, at least to the V C D. So I want to compute the whole polyhedron. So I have used Sage's class polyhedron over Q. I believe this goes back to the I believe this goes back to the Parma polyhedral library in the back end. But now this is getting big. So the dimension of this polyhedron is n times n plus 1 over 2 plus the x of 1. So for SL3, it worked okay, but I choose a bounded subset of this polyhedron to get a complete set of distinct faces, modulo. Well, my gamma. Well, my gamma naught of LK, and intersect the gamma. And to choose a set of faces large enough, it proved to be quite delicate. I have to rewrite the code to take more faces in the direction of the k's or fewer faces in the direction of the k's. And then for n equals four with a seven-dimensional, no, a larger dimensional polytope, well, I mean, it's 11, this is quite slow. This is quite slow. As I mentioned with the paper with Dylan Gold for Tbilisi, we'd like to get some really good SL4 computations going using these methods, getting the heck operators in all degrees, because then there are methods, actually Paul suggested this to me years ago, intersected with the locus of symplectic symmetric matrices, understand that cell decomposition, and then we'd be computing. And then we'd be computing HECA operators for sp4 in all degrees. I mean, many people, for instance, Gunter Harder and Herbert Gongle, have specific questions about SP4, just for like the lowest HEC operators. So that's my ultimate goal, but it's too slow to use like 11-dimensional polytopes to get there. So that suggested this project, and then I suggested it to Kiri and Eric. Let's understand these, if we can, the cells of the well. If we can, the cells of the well-tempered retract intrinsically, not just by brute force computations, but let's actually try to figure out what these things are. So a couple comments about understanding them intrinsically. I claim it suffices to understand the vertices of these retracts, the well-tampered retract, because we can compute all other cells from them. This is actually reasonably practical. Given a Reasonably practical. Given a set of vertices, you take a large enough set so that you have some of each mod gamma and a neighborhood around your basic set. But then you can take multi-intersections of them and just use sort of linear algebra, plain old Voronoy linear algebra, to check what kind of cells the intersections determine, whether it be a one-cell or two-cell. So I have working code for this kind of thing because I use it for the asymplated stuff. Another thing to point out is Another thing to point out is that vertices only occur at the critical temperaments, as I've described intuitively. There's a real parameter tau flowing along. Until you're at a critical temperament, the cells also flow along in a piecewise linear way. In particular, they all have dimension one or greater, but at critical temperaments, you get interesting vertices. So we focus in this current project on critical temperaments. High time I give a High time I give a definition then, because just as the vertices of the well-rounded retract, Voronoi stuff, are perfect forms, we define vertices of the well-tempered retract to be tempered perfect forms. A proposition, you have to think a little bit more than Voronoi did, but then you can prove, it generalizes Voronoi's work that a tempered perfect form has a rational gram matrix always. Gram matrix always. It always has a rational gram matrix, also has a rational tau squared. So that helps us very much. Now, the present project is about SL2. So for the rest of the talk, I'm talking about subgroups of SL2R. So the classical stuff, you know, good old 19th-century stuff. The reason is for getting started. For getting started on this project, I want to connect it to the classical SL2 version of binary quadratic forms and all the class field theory that comes out of that. For SL2, there's only one HEC operator that we sort of take as a generator at k plus one. So I'll always be doing a lattice, now a rank two lattice with a sub-lattice index prime L. So heck operators will be doing a T sub L. Sabelle. So, the result, I'm going to say I think we've got a complete, quite a complete description of tempered perfect forms for SL2 in terms of binary quadratic forms and in terms of class field theory. And I'm very happy to see how class field theory connects with all this stuff. So, let me begin to describe this stuff. So, this marks a bit of a turning point. So, this marks a bit of a turning point in the talk. In that I've been saying general things so far, but now I'm going to take a somewhat different tone, show you a lot of pictures, explain things by example. Okay, so tempered perfect form. So we've got a lattice L and a sublattice M. There's vectors in both L and M. Let me jump to this picture for a second. Let me jump to this picture for a second. In this picture, L is the lattice of black points. M is the lattice of red points. Let me jump to this picture instead. L is a lattice of black points. M is a lattice of red points. You see red points. Here is a financing sublattice of the black points. There's two vectors on this inner circle. They're tied for the shortest length. In the red lattice, In the red lettuce, there's also two vectors tied for the shortest length. But because we're multiplying by a factor of tau, we're telling lies about that the black vectors are really longer than they are. So actually, all four of these pairs of vectors are tied for shortest length in the tempered sense. So this kind of picture is actually could be called a doubly well-rounded form. Doubly well-rounded might be more suggestive to this audience because we're looking for forms that are. We're looking for forms that are well-rounded, but not vectors that are all the same length on a certain circle, but vectors with two circles are in play, but you got to have enough vectors on the two circles together to rigidly specify the form. So that's the kind of template perfect form we're looking for. Now, one rich source of them is when on the inner lattice L, there's already three vectors tied for equal length, and then like maybe. Equal length, and then like maybe one more in the M. So in that case, we understand it because with three vectors tied for equal length on a plane lattice, there's only one possibility. There's only one perfect form in the plane, and that's the hexagonal lattice, or pack your pennies on your desktop. So I'm going to change coordinates right away to look like the pennies, or rather the Eisenstein integers. So let omega be the primitive cubic unity. Primitive cubit of unity. So L is going to look like this. In my sublattice M, at least one vector must also be in this lattice and must be tied in tempered sense for shortest length. But that means one more vector must be in the ring of integers of the Eisenstein integers. In other words, tau squared, the squared length, must be the norm of one of these Eisenstein lattice points. Now, if you remember, norms in the Eisenstein integers. Remember, norms in the Eisenstein integers are a squared minus a b plus b squared. Like I grabbed this off the internet, but they used 3 plus 2 omega. That has norm 7. Okay, the moral of this story is that picture, the fact that there's a prime of norm 7 in the Eisenstein energy, excuse me, is going to imply that for hecta operators T L for all L greater than or equal to 7, To seven, our well-tempered complex is going to have a critical temperament at the square root of seven. So they're always at the square root of seven for L greater than or equal to seven. You'll see a picture like this, and it'll contribute to a critical temperament. So the general picture is: here's a go-to prime bigger than seven, how about 11? I'm going to argue that this picture gives me a vertex of the well-winded well-timed return. So I take the hexagonal lattice, that's L. I take a sub-lattice at the index 11. Well, now this picture isn't great in that I tried to draw the sub-lattice in red, but you only see three red points on a line. There are independent red points. They're just up here, a little off the picture, sorry. But so there's a red sub-lattice. So there's a red sublat x of index 11, but the ratios of the length, the ratio of these two circles will always be the tau. So these circles are in length the ratio squared of seven. So the something of index 11 can't have two vectors on the circle of index seven. There's not enough area there to fit. But you see, I've got a perfect form in the middle that's three points and a fourth. Perfect form in the middle that's three points and a fourth point of m out there, and that's enough to rigidify the picture at square root of seven. Now it gets more special when the L happens to be equal to the prime, and that that's going to be called a three in three form because I've got if I let L equals seven, I've got three points on a hexagon in the inner circle, three pairs of points on a hexagon. Three pairs of points on a hexagon in the outer circle. See, six points on this red circle and a perfect hexagon. And their ratio of lengths is the square root of seven. This picture arises because you take the inner circle, multiply it by the Eisenstein integer, three plus two omega, and you get the outer circle. I can argue that because see this line where I'm moving my mouse. Okay, that's the axis going through the number one, it's a little slanted. The number one, it's a little slanted. So let me count one, two, three plus two omega plus two omega. I go up at 120 degrees plus omega plus two omega. Yeah, so that red point is three plus two omega. It's a multiple of the number one. So to summarize that, it's a classical fact that a prime, a rational prime is the norm of an element of the Eisenstein integers if it's three or if it's one minus. It's three or if it's one mod six. So, what we're saying here is if L is a prime that's either three or it's one mod six, then the well-tempered retract for any Hecke operator of prime p bigger than or equal to L, you'll encounter a three-in-one form if P is greater than L, and you'll encounter a three-in-three form if P equals L. Okay. Similar pictures for the Gaussian integers. These are going to be two in two forms, which means there's two vectors tied for equal length on the, in L, the smaller lattice, and there's two other vectors tied for equal length on the larger lattice. So here's a rather fine picture I also grabbed off the internet. The dots, the black dots, that's the lattice L. The blue grid is the lattice M. Is the lattice M you see that yellow point there? That's is shown in yellow minus one plus four i that has norm 17. So this I have a picture here. Imagine a circle of radius one through the basis vectors E1 and E2. They're 90 degrees. Also imagine a circle of radius root 17 through the closest two vectors. Through the closest two vectors of the blue lattice. So, Gaussian integers give you doubly well-rounded things where you've got 90 degrees in the inner cycle, 90 degrees in the outer circle. And they arise whenever primes in the Gaussian integer split. So I just proved this yesterday in an elementary number theory course. L is the sum of two squares if it's two or if it's one mod four, if and only if. Here, you know, m has two vectors. M has two vectors as its minimal vectors, and L also has two vectors. So when I do my scaling, I've got to carry a basis to a basis. That means I've got to land exactly. It's not three and one, but it's two and two. The result then is let L be any prime that's two or one mod four. The well-tempered retract, when you compute the L-Heck operator, is going to see this kind of picture also. It's going to see two and two forms coming from the Gaussian integers. It's going to see them as. Integers, it's going to see them at the middle temperament exactly square root of L. That was the middle, five is such a prime, right? L is going to go into one by four. So the second bifurcation I showed you in my movie was this kind of square root of five. Okay, but even for small L, we see two and two forms that are not just based on equilateral triangles or not just based on squares. So at the prime 11, At the prime 11 middle temperament, we looked at the data and saw the square root of negative 35. We see lattices where to plot them on the graph, you need to use numbers from the square root of negative 35. Well, that's interesting. And 35 is five times seven, huh? Product of small primes. But when we really knew this was going to be something cool, was we found a two and two form where this We found a two and two form where this tau squared was suddenly not an integer. And there's different angles in the two circles. So this inner circle is almost a hexagon, but it isn't because that point where my mass is a little bit off. So the angle is, say, not 120 degrees, but like 110 or something. And meanwhile, on the red circle, I got two points, but they're closer to 90 degrees, but they're certainly not. They're closer to 980 degrees, but they're certainly not 980. I think I checked it once. It's 80 something. So, and this example occurred at the prime 23. So, at the prime 23, suddenly you're getting these rational number tau squares occurring. And at first, we didn't know why. And what's more, it's like a festival of small primes. So, my new favorite composite number is where this occurs. My new favorite composite number is 1155. Composite number is 1155, which factors as three times five times seven times 11. But then the ratio of the two circles, it's like it's trying to avoid primes 3, 5, 7, 11, but it's trying to get all the other primes involved that it can. 17, 19, and 23 are involved in this ratio. So that is what we've got to explain. Okay. So that's where binary quadratic forms come in. So let me got to remind you of a few. Let me got to remind you of a few things about the class group. So we consider positive definite quadratic forms in the style of Lagrange and Gauss. So x and y are integers. A, b, and c are relatively prime integers. Always positive. The discriminant is b squared minus 4ac, superseding the old use of capital D. It's now a discriminant. It will be a negative integer throughout this talk. Throughout this talk. So now there's a correspondence between the quadratic forms and certain lattices, again, known to Lagrangian before. These lattices are fractional ideals in the imaginary quadratic field of square root of minus d or square root of d. This talk also, I have to bring in orders that are not the maximal order. All the examples I've shown you are for maximal orders, but we start to see these. Orders, but we start to see the order at negative 32 and others. So, well, you know, in general, for a quadratic number field, we have its ring of integers. Let that have discriminants say d sub k. The ring of integers is generated over z by one element with a familiar formulas in the footnote. Call that R. But any order in this ring is, well, the definition of an order is a subring which contains. Is a subring which contains the number one so that it's a ring, and also it's a lattice in the okay, it has rank two. OK is the maximal order, but every other order is just f times the gender, where f is a positive integer. And it's a discriminant f squared times the field discriminant. Conversely, by the way, a discriminant determines, well each discriminant determines at most one order. So there's a correspondence in that sense. So, there's a correspondence in that sense. But also, it's important that for a rank 2 lattice L in this field K, so for a fractional ideal, the lattice has an order that belongs to it, like the order for L. Now, that's the ring of all alpha in your field K, such that alpha times L is contained in L, carries the lattice into itself. Now, something one has to check is that this ring actually is an order. Is an order, so it you know, you could always multiply a lattice by an rational integer, but you have to check that no, you there are also actual like irrational quadratic numbers you can multiply by their, they are algebraic integers in their own right. And so these alphas form a subgroup, which is an order. I guess another way to say it is these L's have complex multiplications. Let's see. The product, okay, this slide has. Okay, this slide has a couple things that one has to check, but are known. The product of two lattices or fractional ideals in the quadratic field K, if the two lattices have order O, then the product has the same order O. So this might be false in general for cubic or higher fields, but it's true for the quadratic fields. And so we use it. Also, there's a notion of norm. Norm is still multiplicative, you have to check that. Is still multiplicative, you have to check that. Say the two lattices are similar if you can get from one to the other by multiplying by a complex scalar in your field. So the main theorem, going back to a disquisitionis arithmeticae Magrange before that, is that the similarity classes of these lattices in K, the classes having a given order O, they form a finite abelian group under multiplication, which is called the class group. Which is called the class group. It's tied into binary quadratic forms, but I'll skip that for now. Okay, now for connecting it to homology of groups and well-rounded stuff, there's a small but subtle shift in thinking one has to do. You know, a lattice in a magnetic quadratic field is well-rounded if and only if every similar lattice is well-rounded. Proof. Multiply by a complex number, that's a rotation by a Complex number, that's a rotation by a homothy, rotation times a homothety, and that preserves well-roundedness. So we have to change our thinking from well-rounded lattices for SL2 to well-rounded ideal classes for SL2. So certain orders have well-rounded ideal classes. One has to check that in our setting where you have a lattice L and a sublattice M of prime index L, and if it's a two and two form, And if it's a two and two form, then these two things have the same order O. So we can talk about them in the same context of the same class group. That had to be checked. It's a computation. So now here I could state sort of like the main theorem of this project. Fix a discriminant D less than zero. Let O be the order of this discriminant. Okay, think about the class group of the order O. Let's assume it has. O, let's assume it has some well-rounded classes. They could either be the same or different. Column C1 and C2. Also, there's a, you've got a prime L around it's going to have ideals in some ideal class. In this theorem, assume that the lattice has norm L. In other words, the prime splits in this order, is not inert, or could be ramified in principle. Okay, the theorem is with two different or with two well-rounded classes in play. Well-rounded classes in play. There's a two-in-two form in the well-tempered retract for TL, where the minimal vectors in your big lattice are going to come from your C1 class. The minimal vectors in your sub-lattice are going to come from your lattice class C2, be the same or different. When you have this, then the tau squared is completely determined by the norm of the two ideal classes, the norm of L class versus norm of M. Classes, the norm of L class versus norm of M class, I scale them into O by the same scale, times L. This explains the formulas we got with 23 times 17 over 19. And conversely, every two and two form arises in this way. So that's let me just finish up with like one more slide, which explains that theorem in the with the example of. With the example of 1155. So consider the discriminant negative 1155. So it belongs to a certain this time a maximal order. I told you I had factors. Okay, you got to sit down and compute the class group of this using Lagrange's methods of reduced quadratic forms. It's quite easy to do it by hand. The class group is Z2 cross Z2 cross Z2. It's order 8 and elementary. So I've drawn it as a key. So, I've drawn it as a cube. So, those are prime ideals in the class group, and everything squared is back to one. Fractor P with a prime is that's like the rational prime that's in the subscript, the subscript is a, I took the smallest rational prime that gives me a split prime in that class. So the smallest primes are three, five, seven. Three, five, seven, as you know, are, as you see, are ramified in this field. Ramified in this field, as is 11. So they're going to generate this class group. So I laid them out on the X, Y, and Z axes, respectively. But you have to then sit down and check, this class group with eight things in it has precisely two well-rounded classes, 17 and 19. As I showed you before, they have different angles. So the question for our So, the question for our main theorem is: how do you get from a lattice in the class of 17 to a lattice in the class of 19? Well, you got to multiply by something in this group that goes down and to the right on the top face of the cube. Well, but it's mod 2. So that's the same as going down and up, excuse me, up and to the right. You know, 19 is also one step over here where my mouse is. So, to get from 17 up to 19, that's you multiply. That's you multiply by 23. So that explains this picture. There was 1155. Here. Yeah, that explains this picture. The inner circle is root 17. The outer circle is root 17 times root 23. I'm not saying that 19 equals 17 times 23, but I'm saying that the times 23, but I'm saying that the prime of 19 is similar to the prime 17 times the prime 23. So that's why you have these two shapes doing that. And the one more slide. Basically, once you start thinking of ideal classes, every ideal class contains infinitely many primes L. So if you want to compute a single hect operator T sub L, you want to know that there's only finitely many descriptions. That there's only finitely many discriminants you would have to check. And, like, the current was well, Kiri and Eric. I think you're on this call. We need to talk about the last time the three of us talked, it was L squared. I have a better proof now, but it grew to 4L squared. Anyway, there's a bound on to it. For any given L, there's only finitely many D. You have to check looking for these vertices. And so for any given L, it's a finite computation. There's other slides. There's other slides here, but they were less important, and it's high time I stopped. So I'll just say thank you very much. Let's thank the speaker. Can you not hear us? We can hear you. Oh, okay. I was just curious. You asked for clapping after clapping. So I was wondering. Oh, I did not hear your clapping. Okay. Clapping. Okay. Anyway, are there any questions for the speaker? I have a question, Mark. So, the theorem you explained to us is about two and two vertices. Are the other perfect tempered perfect vertices that they're also, I mean, they're all come from the Eisenstein integers or something? Yeah, I guess, yeah, I didn't definitely say that. Right. So it's So it's basically there's you need four conditions to specify a tempered perfect form because you need you would need three for Voronoi and then there's one more for the tau. So it's either going to be three and one or it's going to be two and two. And three and three is like an extra bonus. So three and one are sort of easier to get because it's any split prime in the Eisenstein integers. But then these it's either three and one or two and two. And then two and two, we had to do more work to get them all. More work to get them all. I guess I have one more question. I mean, if you go up to GL3, will there be a similar picture with right, yeah. So that's, I've been certainly been thinking about it. Everything I said in the latter half of Everything I said in the latter half of this talk relied on there being an order. Like if you have a lattice, there was also an order or a ring in an interesting number field where the multiplications by that order sort of spanned all the directions in your lattice. I guess, but when you take these tempocrific forms, I think when you work out the I think when you work out the number fields, it's always sort of going to be quadratic or quadratic on quadratic, because it's basically a Cholesky decomposition to compute them. It's square roots and then square roots of square roots. So, and you're not going to get cubic number fields out of iterated square roots. So I want to read up more on Hermitian lattices. So think about just what the complex multiplication cases look like. Multiplication cases look like, and that's sending maybe I've heard it said maybe jump directly to sp4 and go from there. Are there other questions? Let's thank him again. Let's thank him again. And we'll res
