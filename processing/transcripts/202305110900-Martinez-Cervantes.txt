Today, so well I'm going to talk about linear response lattice embeddings. This is the name that my talk was given. So well this is essentially the same talk that I gave in Madrid last year, so I apologize. But in order to make Vladimir happier, this time I'm going to use the blackboard, not my slides. So well, let me fix some notation. We all know what the Savannah Gladys. What is a Manach lattice? We all know what is a positive operator between Manach lattice, what is a lattice homomorphism. But let me tell you what is the notation that I'm going to use. So x and y are going to be Banach lattices. So if I write this, then I'm going to refer just to the fact that there is a linear embedding. So, in the sense of bad spaces, so x and y are going to be bad lattices. So, if I write this, if I write this, I mean that there exists a linear embedding, so a linear isomorphism from x onto each image. And if I write this, then I mean that this linear embedding is indeed positive. As a positive As a positive and also negative. And we are going to deal also with lattice embeddings, which are going to be linear embeddings, but respecting their lattice structure. Every operator in my talk is going to be linear. So if I say linear embedding, I'm saying linear. If I say lattice embedding, I say lattice linear embedding. So if you're interested in just lattice non-linear embeddings, you have to ask any other person. So maybe Danny Leon, he has worked on lattice non-linear embeddings or lattice non-linear isomorphism. So in this talk, what we are going to do is, well, if you Going to do is, well, if you see this condition here implies this condition here, this one implies this condition here. So to have a lattice embedding is stronger than to having a positive embedding and stronger than having a linear embedding. So we are going to study under what conditions to have a linear embedding implies to have a positive embedding or to have even a lattice embedding. So let me start recalling some classical results in anaglattis theory. Classical results of metagladist theories. So, for example, a result of Yersanovsky from 1968 said that for a ballot lattice X, it is equivalent that C0 can be linearly embedded into X or linear 1 can be lined into X or linear one can be linearly embedded into X that indeed these two spaces can be lattice embedded into X and this is in turn equivalent to the fact that X is not reflexive so I'm interested in conditions like these two so whenever we are These two. So, whenever we are able to embed as a linear subspace, C0 or literal one, then we are going to be able to embed C0 or literally one as a banach sub-lattices. So, this is the first result relating these kind of embeddings. There is also another classical one which is usually attributed to measured leader. I think this one is from 1973, which says that. Which says that indeed for a banana GLADIS X, it is equivalent that we can embed C0 as a vana subspace and that we can embed C0 as a vana sublattice. So if one sees these two results, one may think that indeed it may be equivalent the same result. The same result for little one, that's looking at these two results. So maybe it is equivalent that we are able to embed little one as a subspace, then maybe we can embed it as a sub-lattice. But if we think on x as, for example, the space of continuous functions over the unit interval, this space contains intele 1 as a subspace, so it's at this space 1, but it does not. 1, but it does not satisfy 2 because these joint sequences in C of the unique interval behave like C0, so they cannot behave like the 1. So this is not true, but we can just add here these conditions. So for example, what we need to add in order to have a statement which is true is that this embedding must be as a complemented subspace. Which means that the one as a subspace of X is complemented in X. And this result is also attributed to Mejer Nive. So these kind of results can be found in the book of Melier Nive, the book of Alexandria Mutinsau about positive operators. And there are even more results. And there are even more results of this nature. So, for example, this result here is also true if we put little infinity instead of C0 and we assume that X is the incomplete. So, if we assume that X is a dual banach lattice, and there are more results of this nature. So, what we are going to do in this talk is to ask whether this result of Mayor Niver holds Holds for some other paragraphic apart from CC. So, this is the idea, the main question of this talk. Well, so suppose that we have another banach that is y having this property. So, suppose that we have y such that whenever we can embed it in. We can embed it in a manner that is X, then we can embed it as a sub-lattice. So we can do this for every X, for every banana lattice X. In particular, well, if we suppose that Y is separable, just to start with something, let's say, simple, if Y is separable, then any separable Banach space can be embedded into of the unit interval as a banach subspace and therefore if y has this property here what we have is that this space can be lattice embedded as a sub lattice of z of the unit interval so banach lattices which might share this property with c0 must be banach When C0 must be Banach sub-lattices of C of the interval in the separable case. So as Banach spaces, they must be isomorphic, linearly isomorphic to CKL spaces. And so then what are the natural candidates to Banach lattices having this property here? So we have C0 and other infinite-dimensional Banach lattices which. Infinite-dimensional manages, which might have this property, might be in the separable case, what the space of continuous functions over the unit interval. And well, indeed, this is what we are going to try to prove in this talk. This is going to be the main result of the talk. That unit here, the unit integral has this have this property here. So this is a result of So this is a result of Antonio Riley, myself, Aberdeen Branafoca, and Pedro Drafe. So we were able to prove that it is equivalent that C of the unit interval. C of the unit interval can be linearly embedded into a vanach lattice, and that C of the unit interval can be embedded as a value sublattice of X. Okay, so let's try to Let's try to keep the idea of the proof. Of course, if we have a lattice embedding, then we have a linear embedding. So, what we have to prove is that if we have a linear embedding, then we have a lattice embedding. So, suppose that we have a linear embedding from this space. From this space into X. What we want to do is then to construct an embedding which is not just linear, but even a lattice homomorphism. So this is the main goal. How can we do this? So if we are optimistic, maybe we can think that maybe some perturbation of S can be even a lattice homomorphism. But if our starting point is just a If our starting point is just a linear pedding, this is like a very weak starting point. So maybe it's good to take a look to the literature. So let's go just to Tuesday. On Tuesday, on the talk of Antonio Villes, we saw what is a projective Banaglatis or recall that he said that at the end. He said that objective valid lattice is a valid lattice P, so that whenever we have a quausient map from a valid lattice X to a quausient, Y here is a clausio, an ideal, so P is a projective value lattice. If whenever we have a map in T, which is a lattice homomorphism, then we can find an extension map, let's say, so a map in T, which is also a lattice. Shakes of a mapping T, which is also a lattice homomorphism and which makes this diagram commutative. And one of the things that he said is that CK is projective or even one plus projective whenever K is an absolute neighborhood of Japan. I'm not sure if he gives examples of absolute neighborhood retracts, but the point is that over space, the unit interval, it is an absolute neighborhood attack. So in particular, what we have is that C of the unit interval is one plus project. So this is due to the factor and mixed it and And well, what are we going to do with this? The point here is that if this map in D, this lattice homomorphism is an embedding, a lattice embedding, then in such case this hat must also be an embedding, otherwise this composition wouldn't be an embedding. So what does this tell us? This tells us that, let me say that this is a consequence of Of the backed and mixed study of projective manac lattices, so in particular as a consequence of the results, what we have is that whenever we are able to embed C0 of the unit interval, C of the unit interval as a varietial lattice into a positive, then we are going to find We are going to find a lattice embedding not into the cosine but into X. So, this is a consequence and this is a property that projective banana clattices have. If we are able to embed as a sublattice, a projective banach lattice into a quausium, then we are able to embed it as a sublattice into X. So this is essentially our main goal. Essentially, our main goal in this proof to construct an embedding of C of the unit interval into X. So the vector and the result tell us that it is enough to construct this lattice embedding into a Causion of X. Or maybe even into a Causion of a sub-lattice of X. At the very end, what we want is just to find a sub-lattice of X, which is lattice isomorphism to C of the unit integer. Okay, so. Okay, so this is great, but okay, so maybe we can try to make some quotients and to transform this linear operator into a lattice homomorphism. But this starting point is still quite complicated to deal with. So we are going to dive a little bit more into the generature. And now we are going to go to our result. I'm going to go to a result of Lord and Present from 1978, which says the following. It says that for a banner claddling X, it is equivalent that C of the counter set, I'm going to denote the counter set with this capital delta, can be embedded. Can be embedded as a through a positive embedding into X, that capital 1 can be embedded into X star through a lattice embedding, and that the whole dual can be lattice embedded into X star. So, as you can see, there are a lot of results relating lattice embedded. Relating lattice embeddings, positive embeddings, linear embeddings, so results of this stature. And the point is that in this paper of Loz and Rosenthal, they asked whether these three conditions are indeed equivalent to the fact that we just have a linear embedding from C of the counter set into X. So this is what they asked in their paper. So essentially, this is quite. So essentially this is quite close to what we were asking. We were asking for what manner of lattices the existence of a linear embedding implies the existence of a lattice embedding. And here they are asking whether the existence of a linear embedding from this space implies the existence of a positive embedding. So it is more than similar, but instead of working with lattice embeddings, they work with positive embeddings. And the point is that this was proved to be true by Proved to be true by Gusuf a few years later. So let me remove here this question mark. So we have that if this space can be linearly embedded into X, then it can be positively embedded into X. At the very end of the talk, recall that you can add here another control. That you can write here another condition, which is the existence of a positive lattice embedded from this space into here, just because of our theorem. Notice that C of the counter set as a banana space is isomorphic to C of the unit interval. So this condition here for is equivalent by Billing's theorem to our condition one. So we also have this condition five. Due to our result. So, all these five conditions are going to be equivalent. Okay, so our starting point here was a linear embedding from C of the unit interval into X. As I said, by Milutine's theorem, I can put instead of the unit interval just a counter set. These two 1x spaces are isomorphic as one x. Are isomorphic as one X spaces. So then we are in this situation here, and by Boussoup's theorem, instead of just starting with a linear embedding, we can start with a positive embedding, which is better. Okay, so we are getting closer, but we still. But we still need to construct a lattice depending of C of the unit interval into some cosine of X or into some cosine of a banana sublattice of X. So what else can we do? So as I said, what we are gonna do is to try to construct such a quacient in such a way that composing this quotient with first is gonna give this lattice embedding. Lattice embedding. And well, the point is that it is not clear how we can work with C of the counter set. As a van and gladis, I would say that C of the counter set is nicer than C of the unit interval in the sense that what functions do we have in C of the counter set? So think on the counter set just as a set of the unit integer. Set of the unit interval. So let's try to think a little bit on what functions do we have in the counter set. We have, of course, the constant function one. If I'm working on the counter set, the standard embedding is just to remove here an interval from the middle and then to remove here an interval. And then to remove here an interval from these two remaining intervals, and so on. So we have this constant function one. We have also the function which takes the value one here but zero here. We have the function which takes the value one here and zero here, and so on. So we have And so on. So we have another function which takes the value one here, zero here. So let me put names to these functions. So let's say that the function in white, I'm going to call it f of the empty set. So by doing this, what do I get? I are a family of functions taking the value 0 and 1, which are indexed in the dyaric tree. So the first one is going to be the constant function 1. To be the constant function one, then I said that I'm gonna take the function in red which takes the value one here and zero here. This is what I'm gonna call f0 and the one which takes the value one here and zero here is the function that I'm gonna call f1. The function, the orange function which takes the value here one and in the rest is going to be zero, I'm gonna call it Be zero. I'm gonna call it f of zero one. So you can imagine the next function is going to be sorry, this is f of zero zero. The next one, which is the one which takes the value one here, zero here, zero here, zero here. This is going to be f zero one. Here we are going to have f one zero, the function which takes here the value one and in the rest of integrals is going to be zero. The rest of the intervals is going to be zero, and here is going to, we are going to have f of one, one, and so on. So we are going to have a family of continuous functions indexed in the dyadic tree. So H sigma is going to belong to the family of finite sequences of zeros and ones. And these functions are going to satisfy some conditions. So for example For example, these functions, in this case, we have that they have norm one. And well, we do have that, for example, the first function, the constant functions, is the sum of f0 plus f1, f0 is going to be the sum of f00 plus f01, and so on. In general, f sigma is going to be f sigma is going to be the sum of f sigma zero plus f sigma one. And this is even better because these functions are positive and indeed these functions are going to be disjoint. So these are some of the properties that this family of functions have and And well, notice that the linear span of these family functions coincides with the lattice, the closest linear lattice generated by this familiar function. By this familiar function, and indeed, this is just C of the counter set. So we have a system of generators indexed in the directory which are, let's say, well behaved. So which have this property here. Now think on our starting point. We have a positive operator from C of the counter set to X. To x. So this is sending its function f sigma to a function that's saying j sigma. What properties does this function j sigma have? Well they are going to have none close to one and this is because of this result of Lancer Rosenthal. Indeed they provided Indeed, they provided more equivalent conditions, and one of them was that if we have a positive embedding, then this positive embedding can be taken in such a way that it has norm as close to one as we wish, and such that the index also has norm as close as one, as close to one as we wish. So these functions, j sigma, in norm they are close to one. Since s is linear, we are going to have also condition. going to have also condition two on the functions the sigma and the main problem that we are going to have is that they might not be disturbed so j sigma zero j sigma sigma one might not be this joint they are positive So we do not have the third property, but okay, so I think I'm not gonna use this result here. So suppose for a moment that we do have that these functions are deserved. Functions are disjoint. But we are in this situation. If D were disjoint, then the lattice generated by the functions J sigma indeed also coincides with the linear span of this family of functions, because if they are very wise disjoint, then what you get when you put What you get when you put lattice combinations or lattice operations on this function is just linear combinations. The supremum of two functions of this form is going to be the sum of these two functions. And what you get just including lattice operations are just linear combinations of these functions. So we do have in this situation that the linear span and the lattice span coincide. And indeed, in such a situation, In such a situation, if we think on this mapping here, we can also define a mapping sending its function j sigma to f sigma. This is going to be a well-defined map, and indeed what we are going to have is that if j sigma 0 and j sigma 1 are very disjoint, this mapping is going to be an inverse for x. An inverse for S. So the linear span generated by the sigma, which is that the lattice generated by this coordinate function, is indeed lattice isomorphic to C of the counter set. So if we are in this situation, what we have is just a sub-lattice of X, which is lattice isomorphic to C of the counter set. And since the counter set can be mapped onto the unique interval, To the unit interval, this mapping provides a lattice embedding of C of the unit interval into C of the counter set. So in this case, we are done. We have an embedded of C of the unit interval into a sub-lattice of X, which is lattice isomorphic to C of the Z. And so we are done. So, what is going to be our goal? Our goal is going to have these functions to be disjoint, to be. These functions to be disjoint, to disjointify these functions, at least in a Pausing of X. As I said, at this step, this function might not be disjoint, so the lattice generated by this function at this step might not coincide with the linear span, so we might have more functions. And our goal is just to obtain that passing through a constant of x functions which are deserved. Okay, so let's try to do this. So I want to define some quotient of x where these functions j sigma are some functions h sigma which satisfy, of course, if this is linear, I'm going to have this. Course, if this is linear, I'm going to have this condition 2. If the operator is more or less close to having norm one, and I have taken, you know, and I take her with this function, then I'm going to have this property. And what my desire is that this function, when I look at HC mark, requires this juncture. This is what I really want to get. But how can I define a causing of X? Of x, which is good enough for us. This is now the problem. Maybe you might think, okay, take the infimal of these two functions, then define the idea generated by this function, and take this quasi. So you want only G sigma zero G sigma attributes or every every G sigma attribution? This for every sigma. So okay, for example if you have different for example you don't For example, you don't want this one, those one to be disjoint from this sigma, right? No, no, no, just these two functions. So think of the counter set. In the counter set, we have said that the function one is like the first one, so you cannot expect this to be disjoint from the second function, which is this one is the f0 and this is f1. So indeed, this one is smaller than f sigma always, so the infimum of Sigma always, so the infimum of two functions which does not belong. Think on the dieletic tree. So we are indexing these functions on the dielectric tree. If we look at functions indexed with the same level, then what we get are functions which are disjoint. But when they are comparable, the index, then what we get is something like in the diagonal tree. Okay, so we would like to have some closed idea of y so that when we pass to the quotient, these functions in the quotient are destroyed. This is what we want to have. This is not This is not at least trivial as far as I think on this problem. So, how are we gonna get this? We need to touch these functions, we need to know something else about these functions. And well, for doing this, we need to go further into the literature. So, let me learn his talk. Then he learned in his talk he used PCL magic. And now we are gonna use the magic of some people in this room. So we are gonna use the magic of Leo, Lee, Eugbert, and Tursen. They proved a very nice result, which says that if Y is as the parallel is assemblable by neck lattice, then y can be lattice embedded, and indeed it is even on the symmetry, into the space of continuous functions from the cantov set to capital L1. So this provides us a setting where we can Where we can think of these elements j sigma, so without loss of generality, x can be supposed to be separable since this space is separable, so the image through s is separable. So at the very end, without loss of generality, x is separable. And by this result here, then we can think of x just On X just as a sublattice of this space. So now J sigma is no longer to be just an element of X, it is going to be a function from the counter set to capital 1. And there I know how to play a little bit in order to define quotients, and I have more tools. So this provides us with a wonderful. Provide us with a wonderful setting where we are able to construct quotients and nice operators. So, for example, what is going to be our first quotient? Our first quotient is going to be just a restriction map which is so which is going to send its function j sigma to h sigma And this compact K is going to be just a subspace of the counter set. How is this going to be defined? Well, K is going to be, we are going to fix epsilon and then we are going to take the points of the counter set where these functions These functions take a value close to one. So if we take the union of all these functions where the length, notice that sigma is just an element of the dynamic tree, this is a finite sequence of zeros and one. So if we take the union of all the sigmas on the same level, and then what I get is this is an What I get is this is a compact set, and if I take then the intersection of all possible lengths, what I get is an intersection of decreasing compact sets. So this is going to be a disjoint, a non-empty compact set. And what we get is that in this compact set, my functions, J sigma, are going to be, are going to have norm close to one. Have norm close to one or is there norm close to zero? So I am. Is that G sigma or F sigma? This is J sigma, yeah. So I am restricting my functions to a compact set where the evaluations in norm are either close to one or either close to zero. So I'm just removing some part of the rubbish. So what do I get if So what do I get if I do this? Well, I get a familiar function which satisfies that the norms are close to one. Since this is a linear mapping, I do have this. And well, these functions might not be disjoint, but at least since the evaluation are either close to one in norm or close to one. Close to one in norm or close to zero in norm. And this, what I get is that this influencer is going to be non-close to zero in this sense. So this is going to be smaller than epsilon. Otherwise, I would have a point t where this function has norm close to one. This function has norm close to one. But if I take the sum. But if I take the sum of these functions on this t, I must have x sigma. But if both have norm close to 1, notice that these are functions in capital L win and in capital L1, they are positive. So if they both have norm close to 1, the sun has norm close to 2. And this is impossible because then H sigma has norm close to 1. They cannot be, it cannot have norm close to 2. Norm close to two. So I have this condition here. So they are still not disjoint, but almost disjoint in the sense that the norm is small. Okay, so I must go ahead. I have to on the capital L1 part. So now I'm gonna define a quotient q2. q2, which is going to send its function h sigma now to a function x sigma. And well, this is going to be, I'm going to lose continuity of the functions. So now my functions are going to be just functions from k to capital L1. And this q2 is going to be an operator which is going to send its function. is going to send its function f to a function q2 of f so that when I take the evaluation in an element s of k what I'm going to have is just the function f which belongs to capital L1 but times the characteristic function of a set let's say L sub S. So for each S in K, we are S in case we are going to choose a suitable, the suitable set L sub S so that we are going to have this operator. By doing this, at this step I have almost disjointness in the sense of norm. By doing this, then what I get are functions x sigma which are going to be close. Which are going to be close in order to one, which are going to satisfy this condition here. They are not going to be disjoint still, but they are going to satisfy also this condition. And the point is that they are going to be more or less, let's say, disjoint in the sense, almost disjoint in the sense of the order. So this I don't know that this infimo is going to have a norm smaller than epsilon, but if you think on capital L1, something with norm smaller than epsilon might be the characteristic function of a measurable set which has measure close to epsilon or even smaller but which the value is quite peak. So, what we are gonna do is what we are gonna get in Do is what we are going to get in this step is that this integral here is going to be smaller. Notice that these two functions are always smaller than x sigma, it's one. My problem might be that the intimate of these two functions might be close to one half of this function at some point, at some evaluation, and by choosing a suitable set. Suitable set L sub S, what we are going to do, what we are going to obtain is that the integral of these two functions cannot be one half of this function, so they are not going to be at any point close to the middle of this, they are going to be something close to one third of this mass. So let's say that I'm getting closer to this identifying this pairs of elements, this Space of elements is still not disjoint. And now we are reaching the last step of the construction. Excuse me? Yeah, I mean your Q2 can surely not be a subjection, right? Maybe you didn't say that. No, no, this is not a subjection. At the very end, I'm gonna look to a sub-lattice here, and I have to take care so that the image through this composition is a closed sub-lattice. Yeah, but yeah, of course, this is not a subjection. That's true. So, what is gonna be the final step? I still don't have this jointness at this step, so I have to still make some modifications. And now I'm not trying to take a quasi map. What I am at this step, what I'm gonna do is to perturb. Do is to perturbate this sequence. So, at this step, what I'm gonna do is to take another sequence, y sigma, which is defined in the following way. The root is going to be just the same element. And elements of this form are going to be defined in a recursive way. So, in terms of the previous ones. in terms of the previous ones and in terms of the corresponding point of x sigma zero and x sigma one. So what we are going to do is to take if I do this recall that this element here is smaller than this element here. So this is what what I'm trying to get with this perturbation is just to focus on the part of exit. On the part of x sigma zero where the norm is concentrated, and I am trying to remove the part where these two things might be non-disjoint, but I know that they are small. So if I do this, then what I get is more or less x sigma 0. What I'm going to do is to make the difference with x sigma 1 and then And and then I have to take here the positive part. This is how I'm gonna define y sigma zero. I'm gonna define y sigma one in the same way, but changing the rows. So this is like this, this is like this. Sorry, this is why sigma. So this is defining in terms of the previous one. No, it's okay. No, it's okay. And if I define my family of elements y sigma in this way, now, finally, I do have what I want. This is going to be linear, which is not for free. You have to make the computations here and to see that the sum of these two elements gives this element here. And in order to solve this, you have to have the To have the definition of this set L sub S, which I'm not giving to you, I don't want to go into the details. So let me just say this, that at this step what you get is this, and finally we have that this are disjoint. So finally we have what we want. So in particular, as I said before, if we have a family of elements of this form, We have a family of elements of this form. The linear span of these elements, the closest linear span, coincides with the lattice generated by these elements, and this is just isomorphic to C of the counter set. So now we have here these elements, y sigma, which belongs to this panel lattice. I want to find a sub-lattice of x which is mapped onto the closer linear space generated by these elements and then at this step what I'm gonna do is to define set X sigma just in the same way that Y sigma was defined in terms of X sigma but using J sigma. So recall that if I have defined Y sigma If I have defined y sigma in terms of x sigma by this formula, what I'm going to define now is set sigma just using the same rules, but just changing the rows. So this is going to be x, x is going to be g, this is going to be z, and so on. So by doing this, By doing this, since these are lattice commomorphisms and these are just formulas taking these lattice operations, I can ensure that this z sigma is going to y sigma. So if I take the closed linear uh lattice generated by this set sigma, This Z sigma, not the closed linear span, because at this step I don't know if this Z sigma are disjoint or not. I know that when I take the quotients, what I get are disjoint elements, they satisfy this condition, but if I put Z, they might not be disjoint. So here, what I do is to take the closed linear sub-lattice generated by these familiar functions. This closed linear sub-lattice must go at least to must go at least to a tense subset of the lattice generated by these functions. And if I make the computation, this is indeed a surjective button. So what I get is a quotient. This quotient is lattice isomorphic to C of the counter set and since C of the counter set contains a copy of the C of C of the unit interval, then I conclude that they have a lattice embedding of C of the unit interval into X. C of the interval into X. So I'm done. This is the main ideas of the proof. Okay, so let me say a few more things. We have finished the proof. So we have an example of a separate company lattice. Avanag lattice, which has this property that whenever it can be linearly embedded into a vanac lattice, then it can be lattice embedded into the lattice. And now we wonder whether there are even more Vanac lattices with this property apart from C of the unit interval and apart from Czech of. So recall that we have said that uh well, what I'm gonna write is again a result of Avilais. A result of Adelaise, myself, brotherfook, and parading. Recall that we have said that this is for us the variable variant lattice y. We have said that if y satisfies this condition, This condition, this is for every x, then y must be a sublattice of c of the unit interval. And at the very end, what we get is that indeed every sublattice of c of the unit interval satisfies this condition. And this is And this is because of another nice result that we have proved, which says the following. It says that if y is a sublattice of C of the unit interval then. Y is lattice isomorphic to C0, or C of the unit interval can be lattice embedded into Y. So essentially, if Y is not C0, then Y contains a lattice copy, a sub-lattice, lattice isomorphic to C of the new integer. And if we are, well, let's. And if we are, well, the proof of this fact is essentially because if y is a sub-lattice of C of the unit interval, if it is not C0, then it does not have order continuous norm. And then, since Y is a sub-lattice of C of this space, using Cacutanius representation theorem, if it does not have all the continuous norm, then the conditions that appear in the Cacutanius representation. That appear in the Carcutanian representation theorem are not too strong, and we are able to find a copy of C of the unit interval inside Y. These are more or less the ideas. The proof is short. You want to see it? Just go to the paper. Okay, so if we know this, then the proof of this is just trivial because suppose that we have a sub-lattice, Y, of z of the unit interval. Of z of the unit interval. In such a case, if y is lattice isomorphic to z0, then by Meiller-Niver theorem, we do know that this satisfies one. But if it is not lattice isomorphic to z0, then it must contain z of the unit interval as a subnaturist. So the situation is this one. So this is standard argument. Then Then if we suppose that y is linearly embedded into x, then c of the unit interval, which is lattice embedded into y, is linearly embedded into x. Since c of the unit interval has this property, c of the unit interval is lattice embedded into x. But then, since y is lattice embedded into c of the unit interval, we conclude that y is lattice embedded into x. Okay. So we have characterized all separate. All separable lattices which have this property. So the last question is: are there non-separable parallel lattices with this property? And well, I think what would be the natural candidate for non-separable banach lattices with this property? We don't know any example. No, in the example, and the natural candidates, I would say they would be let me put this as a question. By this property, I mean property one or property one here. So, this is something that we don't know, but for us, this is the most natural candidate for to. For to a non-separable Banach lattice having this property. So indeed, if gamma is a finite set or just countable, then this space here is a continuous image of the unit interval, recalled Viano's work. And therefore, this space here is a sub-lattice of C of the unit interval. And therefore, we are in this situation. So, for countable gammas, or finite gammas. Countable gammas or finite gammas, this space has this property one. And we don't know what happens in the non-countable case. Let me just say that this condition one has been studied for not in the banaglatti setting but in the setting of CK spaces. So think just on think that X is just a CK space. And this problem has been studied by Haydon. Studied by Hydron, Revalek, Fremlin, and they have positive results for this question in the CK setting, but just for some special cardinals. And they don't have any negative example for these cases. So the results point in the positive direction that this space here might have this property even for every uncomfortable graph. From double capital. This is all I wanted to say, so thank you very much. Thank you very much for the really interesting book. Are there any questions? When you constructed this subspace K of the Cantor set, and Epsilon appeared, and then we never saw epsilon again. So epsilon again. So well, I am writing at every moment things like this. So epsilon is there behind this. Sure, but is there some sort of limiting process over epsilon at some point? Or, I mean, that was my question. When when did epsilon somehow disappear out of the problem? Or how did it work? I mean, epsilon i is uh every step Is at every step, and at the very end, I do not have at the very end. This lattice embedding, the norm, depends on epsilon, so at the very end, epsilon is hidden in this embedding that we find. You have to make epsilon a smaller number one, three. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think around one over three. It doesn't have to be no necessary. Okay, so you could have said like let it run be a portal and then just Meditation portal and then just take that throughout whatever, maybe a temper. You can do it for any effort, and you get better products. Yeah, so kind of a naive follow-up to your last question. So, what happens to little L infinity? Uh do we have any uh e examples where little infinity turns uh as a subspace but not a sub lettuce? Subspace, but not the subordinates? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I mean, little infinity if you embed this into this dual ball as a linear subspace. I think this cannot be embedded as a sabotages. No, I was thinking of the free banana quantities. This is the other candidate. So we have two natural linear empathics of any one acquisition. Embeddings of any banach lattice. So one is this one, and the other one is just a linear embedding onto the three Vanach lattice generated by little and infinity. And one of these two spaces are not gonna contain little infinity as a sub-lattice. The reason? I don't know. I can't give you a double reason for this. I think I think every every CK space which can be embedded here, I think it must be something close to be a connected computer space. Connected compact space, if it is a sub-lattice. So there is another result which I haven't turned into that we proved in our paper, which is the following. So here I say that if I sublattice of C of the unit interval has this condition, we have also studied what CK spaces can be embedded into C of the unit interval. So if C k is the interval, So if CK can be lattice embedded into C of the unit interval, then K must be a disjoint union of Peanut compact. A finite disjoint union of Peano compact. So continuous images of the unit interval. Images of the unit interval. So I guess that the same argument gives that little infinity, which is just a CK space, but with K being quite, well, totally disconnected, I think that the fact that K is totally disconnected doesn't allow you to have a largest embedding into this space, just because of a similar argument. I was gonna ask about if you'll get C0 uncountable set for that question. Yeah, this is easier to answer. So think on C0. So think on C0 of an encountered set. It can be embedded as a linear subspace into three of the binary glattis of C0 of this uncountable set. And the point is that this space has the countable check condition. So any family of disjoint elements must be at most controlled. And here you have uncontrollable in many disjoint elements. So we Maybe this choice element, so you never have a lattice embedding of this space into this one. Yeah, I was wondering whether in this case, maybe taking questions, we can make a similar argument. So just working with the remainder of beta m or something like this. Maybe there might be some kind of argument like this one. Like L infinite 1C0? Yeah, I think so. Like some kind of token. I was going to ask about the year you wrote that, 2019. No, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, yes. You're right. You're right. The year of publication is 22 years.
