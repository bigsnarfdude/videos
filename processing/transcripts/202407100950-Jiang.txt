diplomacy spectrum meaning that the what kind of pi occurs in this restriction and in general you as we hear from many lectures so you can use the geometry of the pair to control this problem or you control the size of this the bigger representation The bigger representation. Yeah, this means you control the wavefront set so that you can have a better theory about this restriction. And we may also consider the opposite problem by giving a representation in the small group and try to look for a representation in the big group so that the restriction Contains this small, small advantage. I mean, repetition of small group. But of course, if you didn't put any condition on theta, this is basically the reciprocity law, right? It's easy. But the point is, if you put a restriction on this big problem, big representation, theta, and then this could be very technical, but also very. Technically, but also very interesting. But I don't know if I really have time to talk about touching this problem. I think we have two. I have a paper with Bay Niu and Bayen Liu and another paper talk about this practical branch problem in the Dian Posar setting. Okay. So we will see. So we will see. All right, so for the automotive setting, you have the learning ideas, so which is the restricted product. Product so you take this element on each local places, and then almost everywhere is the paddock indicator. Yeah, so and then you have the lateral field, the diagonal embedding discretely, and then this the quotient will be compact. Yeah, so the group will take is like a reductive group. Like a reductive group in general. So, and then you consider this quotient. This has a finite volume. In general, it's not compact. And then you consider this L2 space. Yeah, so and then the light translation gives you automorphic functions in this setting. Yeah, so and then you consider this is the big. This is the bigger unitary representation. You consider the sub-regionation, and you take here the sum, right? So this is called the discrete part. And you have the L2 multiplicities like this. And then the function called cospido, if for any parabolic subgroup, this period, what you call the constant, right? for the constant right uh term like this integral unipotent integration will equal zero right and so this sometimes this is called a galvan condition for cospidality and you can show that the cospidals are locked decay on this quotient space so that it will be l2 function and yeah so this consists uh so-called a cosmic So-called caspido spectrum. Yeah, I think this should be discreet. Yeah, this should sorry. I'll correct this. Yeah. Okay. And then the classical theorem in such a generality will be like caspidal spectrum. You have, you can write a Haber Sun with this multiplicity is fine. With this multiplicity is finite. Yeah, so that's a classical theorem. Yeah, so for this composition, the main idea is you consider the converging operators. Yeah. So you're from CC infinity function. So the operators are the integral that we're defined. And then you should. And then you show that you can find this operator abandoned and then it's a compact operator where you restrict the caspital part. Of course, you have to show that if V is the cospital and then the convolution operator takes to the cospital. So over some other groups? What? Any reductive group. This yeah, not this for the moment. No H. This convolution is on G. This is this because the X is the right translation is on X, right on here. Yeah. So for the moment, there's no H, no branching first. Yeah. Branching first. Yeah. Okay. So the point of the point is you have to find the Dillag sequence of this compact operator. So once you get this, I mean, it's a general theorem of function analysis will show that the space will be the delay sum here space. You know, here the delay sum of the basics. Okay. And there's a question, of course, now. And there's a question, of course, now: what is the multiplicity? Yeah, and then Piatric Shapino and Shaleika show that for GON, the cosmetic multiplicity is one, almost one. Okay. Yeah, take it if you take a unitary representation for GA. And the other mock show that for classical group, quasi. For classical groups, quasi-split classical groups, the multiplicity is bounded by one if this guy is not an even orthogonal group. If for even orthogonal group, you may have multiplicity two because there's an outomorphic. Okay. But for other groups, you may have interesting high multiplicities. Okay, even for GON. See for GON, it's multiplicity one, but for SON, if n equals two is multiplicity one, yeah, by Lannon's Law-Bes and Krishna, but if n greater than two, yeah, so three or higher, and then the multiplicity, you can find high multiplicities. So, this multiplicity, high multiplicity depends on the base field. Depends on the base field. Yeah, you change the base field, you get the high multiplicity. And for exceptional groups, you can have different reasons for getting high multiplicities. So I did with Gen, Vitek, and Nadia Grevich, find a family of cos forms so that this multiplicity goes through this family is unbounded. This family is unbounded. You can go each is finite, right? By Gaff and Pietist Shapiro theorem, each is finite, but this finiteness can go higher. Yeah. So even the base field is fixed, fixed base field, and you can construct these members so that you can go unbounded. Yeah. And JSOL has resulted in a long time ago, I think. Which long time ago, I think in 90s. So, you know, if non-spray classic group, you can also produce higher multiplicity. Yeah, so yeah, in some sense, this multiplicity problem is a deep, interesting, deep question. And now, let's say for GON, because this is supposed to be introductory lecture, so I give a proof for multiple. proof for multiplicity one for GON. Okay, this is based on this Wiedaker Fourier expansion of cus form. So you take a maximum unipotent, like you know upper triangular of GON. This is called the genetic character. Generalic character means for each simple roots you have non-zero coefficient in these additive characters. In this additive character. Okay. And so, and then you find the full expansion of this. Okay. So in this sense, the cross form is recovered by Whitega coefficient if there is at least one White coefficient non-zero. So, in other words, I give you a class form if you consider this period. If period, Period. If period is non-zero, the classiform can be recovered from this period. Okay. But this happens for GOM, but for general group, this is not the case. But there is some special situation, but in general, it's not. Okay, once you get this, you can prove multiplicity one, cast be the multiplicity one by the u. By using the local unique uniqueness or local with one, okay. So you take this function, like take a Whitega integral, you evaluate one, this is the functional, so in the harm space, okay. And by the uniqueness of local White model, and then you show that this harm space almost one-dimensional, okay. Now, if you have a hospital multiplicity. Has to be the multiplicity more than two, you know, and then you have two sort of realizations, right? Give me your representation, you have two realizations. And these two realizations, you apply the with because caspido previous free expansion means that if this field non-zero, you can have at least one term here non-zero. So this means that the cross form is generic. That the class form is generic, has a Wittekman, right? So this means that as long as you have pieces realization, you can have non-zero with. And then you take subtraction by Schulz lemma. So these two guys are upper constant. And so you get equality like this. So this means that this C phi minus tau phi is still cost below, but has no weighted remote, right? Has no weight of remote, right? So this means that, on the other hand, cusp form is generic. So this means this must be zero. So this means that the phi and tau phi should be proportional to each other lives in the same space. So this contradicts. If we have realization has no non-trivial intersection, that will be contradiction. Contradiction. So this proves the multiplicity, constant multiplicity one. And so the point I talk about this is like a local uniqueness, like a period multiplicity one, right? Local uniqueness with the model can have a deeper impact to cosmic multiplicity one, global, automorphic. Yeah, so that's that's my point to show this classical proof. Proof okay, so now in general, you consider like a closed subgroup, but you have usually you take a character, and so you consider these integrals. Okay, so yeah, if this phi is a cosmetal, and then this integral is well defined, okay. So now the branching problem is you can have local, global, Local global theory and related automorphic L function, poor, special values. These are Kobe arithmetic, and CETA correspondence, automorphic descent, endoscopic correspondence, and Language-Cyrobe method, and so on. And also, like Lannan's functority, relative Lannance program. So, all these kinds are related to this integral. Okay, a lot. Okay, a lot. Okay. Okay, so now let's talk about the local global relations. Okay, since this idyllic has such a structure, right? So this group, idyllic point or group is the limit of this partial ideals. So the partial ideal point is really Point is really the product. Almost everywhere is compared, right? So, in this process, this will be the open set of this group. So, make this group still locally compact. Okay, so that's a lovely idaic topology. And for any unitary representation, you know, possibly automorphic form unitary are admissible. Unitary admissible, and so that you can have a family for each local process, you have irreducible unitary representation attached to local group. Almost everywhere is unramified, meaning that they have like sophisticated means fixed point with respect to maximum open compact subgroup. Okay. Yeah. So if you take a spray group, If you take a split group, it will be you take a periodic integer, this is a compact open. Yeah, so this will be one-dimensional by you know Sapphi theory. Okay, and since this is a unitary condition, and then this is one-dimensional, you can choose so that the norm one vector, right? So that will be unique. So you normalize it like this. And then you can take this solution. Can take this repetition. The original Hilbert space will be the closure of this span of these so-called tensor factorizable vectors. Yeah, it's a tensor type. Almost everywhere is the fixed character. Okay. So this means that when you talk That when you talk about the global theory, so definitely you want to show each component. And in particular, almost everywhere it's spherical. So this representation theory, first you have to consider unramified representation and what is going on, and then you put together two automorphic. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so now for the unramified, you have Sataki theory, which corresponded to the semi-simple conjugacy class in the dual group. Okay. And then there's tons of basic questions, in particular, like Lamanujin conjecture. See, if this guy gives you automorphic representation of GOM, hospitality is given by. Cospidality is given by period integral, right? So, period integral would imply that this local Sadakic parameter has such property. Yeah, that's the Laman Eugene conjecture. Yeah, so in general, if not the GON, and then you have to assume that two periods. First, its constant term should be zero, and then Should be zero, and then the width of the period should non-zero, and then almost everywhere the local component will be tempered. Yeah, so in other words, you have global integral condition implies local behaves of these matrix coefficients, right? Sorry, I just lost track a little bit. The C sub P of pi, I could just recap what that meant. This is like a semi-simple conjugacy class in the dual group. Can't you see class in the dual group? And so is this a different notation for C of pi p or is it an independent definition? C C N C C P pi? Is it a definition or a statement? This is the definition here, right? This is the Sataki parameter. And we just denote because C p pi means the means the local Sataki problem at the P of the global guide, which is the local component of Sataki problem. It's a complex issue. Okay. So in other words, you know, the period condition implies the behavior of the local component. So this is another like a local global game. Okay. So now Okay, so now since the pi is a restricted tensor product of the local conditions, and now you look at the period condition will be local global, right? So first of all, you utilize this harm space as a restricted cancer or local harms. And we have We have to use these three properties, like a Gavin properties, in other words, multiplicity one, local, right? And for unramified, this local harm, you know, you have to achieve the spherical vector. Yeah. So, in other words, you know, you have infinite dimensional space and you have a functional, you know, we. You know, we require that this spherical vector should not live in the kernel, right? It should not be nihilated. Yeah, so that you require this spherical achieve this functional. This is the kind of typical, like a test vector problem for analytic number theory applications. You know, you always consider this. Yeah, so period, like a restriction problem, you have once you do. Once you do go further applications, you have many precise, much precise questions to do it. And then the restricted product is almost everywhere you fix this guy. And so this means that the global period, locally, you each have multiplicity one, right? So you have this guy. Almost everywhere, I take this LZ. Almost everywhere I take this L0 fixed. And so only finitely many places you have this ramified type. And so suppose were in the global harm space. And the global harm space is one-dimensional, so they should be proportional, right? But the thing is, this is like abstract harm, right? Functional, and this is giving explicitly by integral. And the question is, when this is the abstract harm space. This is the upper character harm space can be represented by the global integral, right? So, this means the measurement is this constant. So, how do you understand this constant? But that's like a very deep question. I think early work like Bernstein and Loznikov, you know, in ideas, they did a They did it like a GO2, right? And now it's like relative Lanan's duality. This problem basically claims that in such a generality, you expect that this constant should eliminate Ly. Yes, has something to do with the L function. Okay, so that's a general. So that's a general sort of framework, but not much has been proved. Okay, but it's a framework. Okay, so now Lana's functionality. So you have two groups. For this talk, we just assume this is a spray group. And so you have homomorphisms. In general, you can have Galois. I don't know how much. I don't know how much time it's got in about two minutes in three minutes. Well, you can take home and read it. I write it carefully. So, this is London functority. And then you define the L functions, you know, London conjectures. You know, Lana conjectures thing. Maybe I skip a little bit more about the functor dating things. Yeah, so this is like a Lanan geanoscopy all related. Okay, so now let's look at this relatively related question. So you can consider a simple question like a GO2N, and so you have external score naf. Exterior score map on the dual side. And so the theorem is like a very typical theorem in the automorphic setting. So if the cosm has external square as a pole, and then this Lananda transfer from orthogonal group, and then this has a shalleka period, non-vanish. Yeah, so that's a typical. But the proof of this is highly non-trivial because a lot of work. Yeah, okay. So So this is like a typical question in the automorphic setting. Yeah, so let's explain a little bit like a Shariga period. So you have GO2N, you take no, this is like a typical non-reductive subgroup. Yeah, so you have this and you take a character, the Panchogan duality character, you take a stabilizer of this, it will be the diagonal embedding. Be the diagonal embedding, and so you have like a semi-directed product of this non-reductive group, like this, and then you define the character like this, and so you can define so-called the Shaleka period, okay? And then this period you have like a local global relations, and then the Chang and so improve the uniqueness, and then you can improve the local version. you can prove the local version of similar theorem okay replace the l function by gamma okay but this also a lot of work yeah so for tempered okay and now we come up with a very nice symmetry yeah so let's explain a little bit about this so the lq means you take means you take Lannan's quotient here. Okay. So this is the levy subgroup here. You take, say, you put a supercospital or tempered representation. You take a standard module and then you have Lannant quotient. So this is like a generalized Shibet representation here. Okay. And also you can do this by saying. And this together is like a TC theta correspondence. Okay. And then you have Okay, and then you have Bessel descent, and this guy is the Fourier Jacobi descent. Okay, and this is Lannand's transfer. So LT means Lannand transfer, Lannand transfer, and this also related to CETA correspondence. The claim is this is the commuting diagram. You like it. Yeah, so this is. Yeah, so this period and land functority transfer, you know, all go together. Like a perfect. Yeah, so I think I have like a few pages more to explain this in a setting, but maybe you can read it and then you can talk to me if you are interested. Thank you. Thank you. We have time for some questions, I will speak what important is that in this book or doubling method or related this, yeah. Is there a relation with the doubling method? Not really a double method. This is like maybe we do Explanation that you know, this period will go like Lana's plummeter will affect slow days. Yeah, so that's the why you know you go you go here. If this guy has Shelega period, this class form will come from other sogon group. So the period controlled this diagram. This diagram. Yeah, if you put a class form or representation here, has no such structure, and this won't work. Okay, so in other words, you put here, it controls by a symmetry. Yeah, so and then the interpretation you can use, you know, the functionality is it's proved. And then you're even more fancier. And then you're even more fancy use like a fans of chakra to monk dash. They already these data, why these data match up. So, but it will take time to explain as a homework. I have a so this is, I should interpret this as a global global, local. Also, every place. Yeah, every place. That's very pretty. Yeah, metro. Meta because this this L T, you know, from metabolic group to GL2N is because the dual group of this guy is symplicated. Okay.
