This morning we'll have two lectures this morning. And our first lecture is Yao Yao, who's Georgia Pregg, but we're just talking about her future plans. And she's going to talk about small-scale formations in the incompressible porous media equation. Thank you, Alex, for the introduction. And first, I'd like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's my great pleasure to give a talk in this workshop. This workshop and also that this will be my last talk representing Georgia Tech. Starting from August, I'll be joining the National University of Singapore. So today I will talk about the small-scale formations in the incompressible porous media equation, which is a joint work with Sasha Kiselev. So let me start with the introduction of what is the incompressible porous medium equation. So let's say that we have some dense. Let's say that we have some density of incompressible fluid represented by ρ, and the fluid is living in the porous media, and the velocity field of fluid is represented by U. So the first equation just says that the density is transported by the velocity field, and the velocity field is incompressible. So here the spatial domain could be, we are only considering the two-dimensional case here, and the spatial domain could be R2, could be Spatial domain could be R2, could be the torus, or it could be the strip where it has an upper and lower boundary, but it is periodic in the X direction. So the special thing about the fluid in the porous media is that, so for Euler's equation, we know that the particle velocities satisfy the Newton's law, right? So the acceleration is proportional to the force. However, in porce media, instead of the Newton's law, Instead of the Newton's law, the velocity actually satisfies the Darcy's law, which says that the velocity field itself is directly proportional to the force. And here, the force is that on the one hand, the fluid is driven by the gravity. But on the other hand, that there is this character here, which is the negative gradient of the pressure, just to keep it to be incompressible. So this format here is a little bit implicit. Here is a little bit implicit, but one can explicitly write down the pressure using the Le Ray projection. And after a quick computation, one can get that the velocity field can be explicitly linked to the density in the following way, that we first take the inverse Laplacian of the density, and then take the red curve, and then finally, it is the partial derivative in the x1 in the horizontal direction. X1 in the horizontal direction. So, just to give you an intuitive idea of what the Biosavar law looks like. So, if we have this part of the fluid has density bigger than zero, this is negative density, and then the outside is zero, then if we only have this part of the velocity, then it means that this heavy part wants to go down and the lighter part wants to go up. However, that in order to keep the velocity to be incompressible, To be incompressible, after this correction, so they actually the velocity field looks something like that. And in particular, that if we are only having the density is just a single delta function right here, then the velocity fields that it generates looks like the following. So the streamline looks like that. Okay, so this is what the equation looks like. And so you may notice that, well, this equation has a format that is kind of similar to the 2D Euler or the STG in the sense that, so there is some kind of scalar that is transported by an incompressible velocity field. So in the following table, let me just briefly compare the three equations side by side. So for, and these are the views of our law of 2D Euler and SQG. And SQG. And compared to the IPM equation, we can see that, well, they sort of have the similar format, except that there is this extra partial X1 here. And if we count the degree of the derivatives, or which can be also reflected on the Fourier side, we notice that, well, so the SQG equation and the IPM equation has these two Fourier symbols of degree zero. Fourier symbols of degree zero, while the 2D Euler has the Fourier symbol degree minus one, right? So it means that for the SQG and IPM, variables of our law have roughly the same type of singularity, which are both one degree more singular than the 2D Euler equation. However, if we compare these two Fourier symbols, they are not the same, right? Even though they have the same degree. They have the same degree. So, for example, one significant difference is that the SQG equations Fourier symbol is an odd function of K, but IPM, this thing here, is an even function of K, right? So, this subtle difference actually will cause some different results in the well-postedness literature that I will introduce later. So, regarding the local well-posedness or the global well-postness of these three equations, so Equations. So, all of these three equations are known to be locally well posed in the sub-left space as long as the index x is higher than a certain amount. And regarding the question of whether they are globally well posed, for 2D Euler, it's well known that for nice enough initial data, it will stay globally regular. And we know that, well, this is a big question, big open question for the S2G equation. And actually, this is also unknown. Actually, this is also unknown for the incompressible force medium equation as well. And the difficulty is roughly the same. So regarding the literature on the well-posedness of the incompressible force medium equation, so Corridobac, Gancero, and Aurive have derived the local well-posedness in HS, and they have also derived various blow-up criteria. So some of them are more standard. Some of them are more standard in terms of the L infinity norm of gradient rho. And there are also some other blow-up criteria that they derive that is more have a more geometric flavor. So in terms of like how oscillatory the level sets are, and also in terms of the Reeds transform of rho. And so Friedlander, Ganzedo Sun, and Vico have studied the idea. Have studied the IPM equation, but not with the same Biosavar law, but with the more singular Biosavar law here. So if beta is equal to zero, this is exactly the Bielsavar law for the IPM. So in their paper, they consider a more singular Biosavar law, and they have proved that, well, this equation is actually imposed as soon as beta is bigger than zero. So notice that this is a sharp contrast with the SQG equation because for SQG, Because for SQG, we know that, well, if we tweak the power of the inverse Laplacian, then so there is still the local well-posedness, even if the Biosabar law is slightly more singular than SQG. However, this is no longer true for the IPM, and the difference of this is actually caused by the oddness versus the evenness of its Fourier symbol. However, they show that. However, they show that for the patch solution, it's actually globally sorry, it's actually locally well posed for a certain range of beta bigger than zero. And by the way, the patch solution for the IPM is exactly the Muscat equation that is also well studied. So, and later there are some work that is investigating the behavior near the steady states. So, for the IPM, any So, for the IPM, any stratified steady state, which is a function that is like only depending on X2, one can easily check that this is a stationary solution. And so, for example, in particular, this steady state, negative X2, was lighter fluid on top and heavier on the bottom. So, Al Guindi proves that this stratified steady stage is asymptotically stable in HS for. In Hs for sufficiently large S. And here, the steady state lives in the whole R2, and the perturbation can live either in R2 or be periodic perturbations. And so later, Castro, Cordoba, and Liers studied the problem that is set up in the bounded strip where it has upper and lower boundaries, but it is periodic in the horizontal direction. And so this. And so they consider again the same steady state minus X2 with lighter liquid on top and heavier one on the bottom. And they prove that so for the smooth initial data that is a small perturbation to this steady state, if the perturbation is living in sufficiently high subliff space, that is H10 or above, then so it remains globally regular. So these are the So, these are the literatures on the well-posedness of the IPM. So, however, that for a general smooth initial data, whether it remains regular for all time is still an open question. So there has been numerical simulations done by Kordobach, and Sedo, and Olrivi. The numerical simulation suggests that it seems like the gradient of the Like the gradient of the density could be growing as t goes to infinity. However, they have checked the solution against their blow-up criteria, and they noticed that there is no evidence for finite time blow-up. So in this work, in the joint work with Sasha, so we are not able to solve the global wealthlessness versus the finite time blow-up question. That is too hard for us. But rather than that, our goal is. But rather than that, our goal is that, assuming that there is a global in-time solution, so we want to rigorously prove that there is indeed small-scale formation as time goes to infinity. So we want to prove the growth of the gradient row as time goes to infinity. So in the recent years, there has been a lot of activities on small-scale formations in various active scalar equations. Various active scalar equations. So, let me first start with the brief review on these results, and then I will talk about its connection with our IPM result. So for 2D Euler and SQG, so in particular for 2D Euler, the infinite growth of the gradient of vorticity dated back to Judovich. And so later, this has been upgraded to Lee. Upgraded by to linear growth by an adverse villi in an annulus. And so Bahorian and Shiman make the observation that, well, there is this special steady state where the velocity field has a hyperbolic flow structure. So in the torus. So the steady state itself is discontinuous. So this is the torus. And then one split the torus into four equal parts and puts the positive one and negative one mortis. Positive one and negative one morticity, so that it generates a velocity field that looks like this. And if we are zooming in the velocity fields near the origin, so at x1, so the velocity field looks like the dominating term is of the order x1, log x1, plus a small correction, which means that if we are tracking how fast is this point approaching the origin, then the particle trajectory is approaching the origin. Is approaching the origin double exponentially. Of course, this example itself does not mean small-scale formation because in this example, the gradient omega is already infinite to begin with. However, motivated by this example, so there are some following works that aim to find smooth solutions to approximate this steady state so that they still have. So, that they still have this hyperbolic flow structure. So, Denisov has proved the superlinear growth of the gradient of the vorticity for all time and exponential growth for arbitrarily long time. And later, Kisilev and Schwarak considered the problem set up in the disk, and then they proved that there exists smooth initial data that leads to double exponential growth of the grid. Exponential growth of the gradient vorticity for all time. So, so far in the Taurus, the best result for smooth for sufficiently regular initial data is by Zlatos, where he obtains exponential growth of gradient omega in the torus. So, these are the growth results for the 2D Euler. And for the SQG equation, even though intuitively the Beelsavar law looks more singular. The Bill Savar law looks more singular, but actually, it's a more challenging question to obtain the growth result. So, recently, Kisilev and Hill proved that there can be exponential growth for the gradient row, assuming that the solution remains regular for all times, where their proof is also based on constructing a smooth solution that have this hyperbolic. That have this hyperbolic flow structure. So, these are the previous literature on the small-scale formations for 2D Euler and SQG. However, when we try to apply these strategies to the incompressible coarse medium equation, we immediately encounter the following difficulties. So, the hyperbolic flow scenario could not be adapted here for various reasons. The first reason is that the symmetry The first reason is that the symmetry is not right for the IPM. So the hyperbolic flow scenario is based on the fact that if the vorticity or the scalar being transported has this odd-odd symmetry right here, then this symmetry is preserved for all time. However, for the IPM, due to the structure of the BUSBR law, the odd-odd symmetry is actually not a conserved quantity for all time. Not a conserved quantity for all time, but instead it's the odd, um, it's the odd in x2, but even in x1 symmetry that will be preserved for all time. So this is one of the reasons that why we cannot adapt the previous argument here. A more serious reason is that the hyperbolic flow scenario is based on the fact that we already have a steady state where the trajectories are approaching. Where the trajectories are approaching each other double exponentially, and then we start to tweak around that. However, unfortunately for the IPM, in R2, the only steady state for IPM with a finite kinetic energy is just the boring horizontal stratified state where the velocity field is always equal to zero everywhere. So, in the torus, well, there are more. So, for example, there is this So, for example, there is this horizontal stratified state with zero velocity, but there can also be this vertical stratified state where there is a non-zero velocity. But nevertheless, we cannot expect anything with the hyperbolic flow scenario where the trajectories are approaching each other exponentially. So, that is the more fundamental difficulty here. So, instead of trying to find a steady To find a steady state and then construct the solutions that have trajectories approaching each other. So we take a completely different strategy that is more of a variational flavor. So let me first talk about our result in R2, and then I will discuss in more details about the ideas of the proof. So we first consider the case where Consider the case where the solution lives in the whole space R2. And so we proved that for any initial condition that is compactly supported, that is odd in X2, and it is non-negative in the upper half plane, then for any such initial data, we prove that, well, as long as the solution remains smooth for all the time, its H S norm for any S bigger than zero has to S bigger than zero has to satisfy that if you take this negative power here and then you integrate it for all the time, then the integral is a finite number. Okay, so what does this mean? Well, if we combine this with the simple facts that this one over t is the, if you are integrating one over t from one to infinity, it's infinite, right? And then it means that, well, so if this integral is finite. So, if this integral is finite, then this integrand has to be much smaller than 1 over t for a sequence of t goes to infinity. So it means that the Lim soup of this quantity here is equal to zero, which means the H S norm is growing with certain polynomial rate depending on S, right? And this holds for any S that is. Holds for any S that is bigger than zero, which means that we are indeed getting the growth for the sharp range of the index X, because when S is equal to zero, this is exactly the L2 norm, which is invariant in time, right? And then so it means that as long as the index of the Sovalef norm is bigger than zero, well, there has to be infinite in time. Has to be infinite in time growth. So this is the result. And so now let me briefly mention the sketch of the proof. So the setup of the initial data is just as I described in the last page. It's odd in X2, and then it's non-negative in the upper half plane. And notice that this odd symmetry is preserved for all time, which can be easily checked by the Biosabar law. So, the main tool of the proof is a very simple monothonicity of the potential energy, which is actually not our invention. So, it has been observed before that. So, this is the potential energy of the fluid. And so notice that by the oddness of the solution for all time, it means that as long as we are having a smooth solution, we will have that, well, the potential energy. Will have that well, the potential energy will be always non-negative in the upper half plane, and therefore it has to be non-negative for all the time, right? So, this is one thing. And the other thing is that, well, the potential energy is actually monotonally decreasing in time. Well, physically, it makes sense because the incompressible force media equation is driven by the gravity, right? So it makes sense for it to decrease. And to rigorously check. And to rigorously check that, so a quick computation gives that. Sorry, there's no periodic here. We're in R2. So rho is odd in X2. So the derivative is just rho times the vertical velocity here. And using the explicit Biosavar law and plug it into this U2, one can explicitly get that, well, the derivative of the potential energy in time is equal to negative. Is equal to negative of this thing here, so which means that the potential energy is always dropping in time. So let's name this quantity to be delta of t, which we are going to be using a lot in our proof. So notice that, well, so we know that e is decreasing in time and it is always non-negative, which means that this delta of t has to be integrable in time, right? So it integrates to a finite. It integrates to a finite number. And now we take a closer look at this quantity delta of t. Clearly, that this is the non-negative quantity because it's the square of a certain h minus one norm, right? And this guy can actually can only be equal to zero when the density rho is a perfect horizontally stratified solution. So this is very easily can be checked. So, but we want. So, but we want to get a more quantitative estimate out of that. So, namely, that we wanted to say that, well, if at some time if delta is tiny, then it has to mean that the density row, well, it doesn't have to be exactly horizontally stratified. We know that is impossible, but we wanted to show that, well, it has to be almost horizontally stratified. And if we think about it, well, the The flow is incompressible, which means the distribution of rho remains the same as it's initially. So, if it's almost horizontally stratified, it has to be stretched very long in the X1 direction, which means that it has to have very rapid change in the vertical direction. So as a result, we should expect that any HS norm for S bigger than zero should be huge, right? So, the key thing of our proof is just such Of our proof is just such a quantitative lemma relating the delta of t and the hs norm of rho. The proof of the lemma is a simple Fourier argument that so we wanted to show that the hs norm is bigger than or equal to delta to this negative power. Okay, so the idea of the proof is to look at the free side. So we So we know that well, the square of the rho hatch has its integral being conserved because the L2 norm of rho is itself conserved. And the rho hatch also remain uniformly bounded in time. So if at some time we know that this delta of t somehow becomes very tiny, then by representing delta on the freer side, it means that, well, this weight here. That well, this weight here means a huge most of the part of the row has to be concentrated in the part where this weight is very small, and that weight very small, it means that it has to be concentrated very close to the sigma 2 axis. And as a result, the Hs norm, which has the weight to carry a positive power of 2s, it has no choice, but it has to be huge. But it has to be huge. Okay, so it's a very simple free argument. And then, so this gives us this lemma right here. And then once we have it, plug it into the facts that this delta is actually integrable from time zero to time infinity, immediately finished the proof. So that's a proof for R2. And so we also have a similar result for the Taurus, although the Although it requires a different idea. So let me first present the final result, which is of a similar format. So if we are having the solution that is odd in X2 and even in X1, and we also have to pin down the value here at zero. zero. So then, for such initial data, if the solution remains smooth for all time, then this integral here is finite, which translated to that for any HS norm with S bigger than one half, it has to go to infinity as time goes to infinity with a certain polynomial rate. So notice that the growth results not only holds for the torus, but it also Holds for the torus, but it also holds for the strip for free because for the solution with such symmetry, so the velocity on the top and bottom boundary is immediately equal to zero, which means that solution is on the torus. It actually also solves the equation on the strip as well. So that is the statement of the theorem. And so the reason that we cannot just adapt the previous proof is that the simple Is that the similar part is still that the potential energy is decreasing in time, its derivative is still equal to minus delta. However, the proof in R2 is based on the idea that, well, so if delta is tiny, then the solution is very close to a horizontal stratified state, and therefore there has to be rapid change in the X2 direction. But this is actually not true in the But this is actually not true in the torus because we can have something that is really close to a stratified state. However, it doesn't necessarily have rapid change in X2. But what we do have is that if we impose the symmetry and impose that rho is equal to zero on this x2 axis, then for anything that is very similar, very close to a close to a stratified state, it has to have rapid change in X1 direction. So and then this is done by again a careful look on the Fourier side. And so we again relate this delta with a certain HS norm on the partial X1 of rho. And so once we have this lemma, And so once we have this lemma, we plug it into the facts that delta has a finite integral, and that's finished the proof. Okay, so these are the infinite in-time growth results in R2 and in the torus. So next, I'd like to talk about a slightly different topic, that is the stability versus the instability for the horizontal stratified state. So one can easily So, one can easily check. Alex, you have a question? Yeah, can I ask me? So, there are similarities between what you said earlier between the SQG and this equation. But the analogous theorems that you are presenting, they're not known for the SQG, right? So the theorem growth in time for the norms or low time is not known for the SQG, is it? There is a quite recent result by KS11. Recent result by Kisilep and Hu that is done for the SQG. So right here. So their idea is that it's also based on the hyperbolic flow structure. That so they consider the solution to be smooth, but very similar to this. Of course, it means that one has to like smooth. Of course, it means that one has to like smooth it out in these places. But they have constructed a smooth initial data such that the gradient is growing exponentially in time. So I see Sasha is here. He can correct me if I'm saying something wrong. Everything is perfect. Okay, yeah, so yeah, so the exponential growth is available for SQG. However, we don't, the strategy doesn't work for IPM because the BS of our law have different structures. So that's why we have to do another approach instead. Okay, thanks a lot for the question. So previously, I have been discussing the infinite in-time growth result. Result. And so, next, let me move on to the stability versus instability of the stratified states. So, one can easily check that for any horizontal stratified state, it corresponds to a zero velocity field, and therefore it is apparently stationary. And a natural question is that, well, is such thing stable or not? And so, usually the first natural step is to consider a step is to consider a small perturbation and to linearize it around that steady state. So if we consider let eta to denote the difference between the solution and the stationary solution, then so eta satisfies this equation right here with u given by related to eta in this way. And so this is the fully nonlinear equation. Fully nonlinear equation, and if we're linearizing it, then so the linearized equation looks like that. So here, G is the profile of the stationary solution. And then we are having this, so this coefficient multiplied by this bunch of things here. And notice that this part is a negative operator of eta, so which means that if g prime is always negative, then Always negative, then we are expecting that the linearized equation to be stable, right? But as long as G prime is positive somewhere, we are expecting, well, at least intuitively, it should be unstable. So physically, it makes sense because it basically what it means is that if the steady state always have lighter fluid on top of the heavier one, then it's linearly stable. But as long as the steady state is less than less, As long as the steady state satisfies that near some point, we are having heavier fluid on top of lighter one, it is unstable. Okay, so this is the linearized equation. And then from the linear stability to the nonlinear stability, so for this particular steady state, which is which looks like that, so which it does have lighter fluid on top of the heavier one. So L Gindi. So El Guindi proved the asymptotic stability for the nonlinear equation. So he proved that, well, as long as the perturbation is small enough that lives in H20 and above, then so this steady state is non-linearly stable, which actually it automatically implies. Automatically implies the global regularity. And then Castro, Cordoba, and Lear proved this for the same steady state, but this time it's no longer living in R2. It's living in the strip that is periodic in the X1 direction. Okay, so these are the previous stability results for the stratified state. And so our goal is that So, our goal is that we want to work on the nonlinear instability. And actually, we want to establish an infinite in time nonlinear instability for stratified state in both the torus and the strip. And I will explain what do we mean by this infinite in time nonlinear instability. Okay, so let me first present the results in the torus. So notice that in the torus, we can never have a study. We can never have a steady state that is always monotone, right? Well, because it's periodic in the X2. So, intuitively, we are expecting that, well, any steady state should be unstable because we can always find some point where the heavier fluid is on top of the lighter one. And we prove that, well, this is indeed the case. So, as long as we are assuming this odd in X2 structure, so for any horizontal stratified state that is odd in X2. That is odd in X2, we prove that it is nonlinearly instable in the following sense. So for any index K, which no matter how high is the solvof space and no matter how close is the initial is the error, we can always construct an initial data row zero such that it is so close to the state. That it is so close to the steady state that their HK norm has difference less than epsilon, such that the solution with the initial data rho zero is satisfies. Well, again, it's assuming it remains smooth for all time, which we don't know whether it's the case. Such that the solution satisfy that, well, so for any of their difference in H1 norm or above, the difference is going to infinity as time. To infinity as time goes to infinity. So, this is what we mean by: well, not only that this is non-linearly unstable, but the difference is actually growing to infinity as time goes to infinity. Okay, so usually the common strategy of proving the nonlinear instability is to first get the linear instability and then upgrade it into a nonlinear one, right? So, this is the To a nonlinear one, right? So, this is the common strategy. However, it has the drawback that once the solution enters the fully nonlinear regime, it's hard to say what will happen next. So instead of using this common approach, so we want to do another way that we will be trying to get the nonlinear instability as a result of our infinite in-time growth result. So, that is the plan. So, that is the plan. However, when we try to do it, we realize that, well, we actually cannot apply our previous proof to the initial data close to such stratified state, because previously for the proof in the torus, we require the solution to have the symmetry and the value is pinned down to zero on the x2 axis. But such kind of thing is not going to be close to rho s in high sub-left. To ρ in highest of left spaces. So, we are not going to use that construction, but instead we find another construction to prove the infinite in-time growth result, which is that we are going to construct the perturbation by perturbing the stratified state with a smooth incompressible flow. So, the idea is as follows: For any stratified state in the torus that is odd in X2, That is odd in X2. We know that, well, due to the fact that it's periodic in X2, there has to be a point where the heavier density is on top of the light locally, right? So which means that locally we must be able to find a point where the G prime is bigger than zero. And so let's say this is the point, and let's zoom it in where the heavier density is on top of the lighter one. So it means that if So, it means that if we are using a smooth flow to perturb it locally, then we can show that, well, so by rotating it a little bit using this smooth flow, then we are going to have another density where the sobo-left difference, no matter how high is k, this can be made arbitrarily small and the potential energy will be strictly smaller. Be strictly smaller than the potential energy of Rho S. Well, this is because Rho S used to have this heavier part on top of lighter, so by tweaking it a little bit, we are slightly decreasing the potential energy. Okay, so once this strict inequality is true, it means that, well, rho s is going to stay there forever, but rho zero, the solution row with initial data row zero, it will have its potential energy to be dropping in time. To be dropping in time, which means that, well, this gap between the potential energy of rho T and rho S will be forever there, and the gap will only be, will only increase, but not decrease. And so this ensures that rho T will never be getting too close to rho S for any T. So and then we use the geometric arguments to say that, well, for the velocity field remains. For the velocity field remains incompressible for all time, and we know that the topology of the level set can change. So it means that the level set of the dynamical solution rho t can never be getting very close to horizontal lines. So this is because by the topological constraint, if it gets very close to horizontal lines, then the only choice is it has to get very close to rho s. But we know that, well, this can't be the case. Know that well, this can't be the case because their potential energy will always have a certain depth. So, once the level set can't be too close to horizontal lines, there is a simple geometric argument that gives that, well, the integral of this partial derivative will always be bigger than a certain constant. And then combining it with the fact that this delta of t is integrable in time, we get the infinite in time growth for For any s bigger than zero here, which translates to, in terms of rho itself, it translates to growth for any H1 norm or above. So that is the argument for the infinite in time nonlinear instability result. And so, well, that is not so surprising, right? Because for any steady states on the Steady states on the torus, there is always a point where the heavier fluid is on top of the lighter one. So, of course, it should be non-linearly instable. However, our next result says the following. So let's consider a strip, okay? And let's consider any stratified state in the strip, including the nonlinear stable one. So for example, this innocent steady state, negative X2, where the lighter fluid is on top of the heavier one. On top of the heavier one. So recall that Cordoba, Ganceto, and Lear has already showed that for this steady state, it is nonlinearly stable when the perturbation is living in H10 or above. So we prove that, well, indeed, that, well, this certain regularity is necessary in the sense that sense that so for any steady states in the strip including this minus x2 um so and uh as long as the perturbation is living in a less regular space that is below h2 then we can find a perturbation that is sufficiently small in this sobo f norm such that the solution satisfies that it is non-linearly unstable in stable in any h in any h1 in any stable f space above h1 okay so by combining the our non-linear instability results with their non-linear stability result um it means that um there has to be a certain threshold of the subweb space that is splitting the instability versus the stability we are not sure where exactly the threshold is but we know that it is Threshold is, but we know that it is somewhere between H2 and H10. Right, um, so that is the statement. Um, and so when we try to prove such result, the difficulty is that, well, again, we cannot just apply the idea for the Taurus case, because that is by tweaking the initial data such that it has a lower potential energy. Potential energy. But if our stratified solution satisfies this G prime is less than or equal to zero everywhere, then no matter how much we tweak it, then the potential energy will only increase instead of decrease. So the new idea for this proof is that, well, instead of tweaking it with the flow, we just simply add a little bubble here to create a closed level set in the initial condition. In the initial condition. So, notice that by forcing it to form a loop, it means that it's the C1 norm of the initial data is changing by order one. So it means that the H2 minus epsilon norm of the perturbation can be made small, but it's not possible to make the H2 or any higher soblet norm to be small. So, this is why we have this constraint in the that we are only having. The that we are only having non-linear instability in these low sobo F spaces. So, what can go wrong if the level set forms a loop? Well, so because the evolution doesn't change the topology of the level set, loop will remain closed during the evolution. And then, so it means that the density can never get too close to a stratified state. And again, that we have a geometric argument to show that. A geometric argument to show that the integral of this quantity has to be bounded below, and which means that again there will be infinite in-time growth of any H1 norm or above. So these are all our results for the IPM, and all of these are based on the monotonicity of the potential energy. So, in the end, I just want to briefly mention an ongoing work that shows that. Going work that shows that, well, our strategy is actually more versatile than that. So this time we are looking at the 2D Bussinesk equation, which is viscous, which means that the U equation is having viscosity. However, we consider it with no thermal diffusivity. So the rho equation doesn't have anything on the right-hand side. So the density of rho is just transported by U, but the U equation has the viscosity. So for So, for this equation, it's well known, starting from the work by Ho and Li, that there is global well-posedness in this space for S that is bigger than a certain value. They first do it for S equal to 3, and then gradually this exponent has been knocked down in the future works. And so at the end, it was knocked down to any S bigger than one. And not only the solution is known to be globally well posed, so regarding the bound of the H1 norm of rho, it's also known that it cannot grow too fast. So do you first prove that the H1 norm of rho at most have double exponential growth? And then later this was upgraded by Coca-Vita and WAN to be exponential growth only. But notice that this is just an upper bound estimate. Upper bound estimate, and the question is: well, can this actually be achieved, or are there any examples of the H1 norm growing to infinity as t goes to infinity? So together with Sasha and my former student, Jamie Park, we show that we construct an example showing that, well, such growth can row, the H1 norm of row can indeed grow to infinity. So namely, that there exists. So, namely, that there exists smooth data such that the global in-time smooth solution satisfies that the H1 norm is having this growth, which means it grows at least like t to the 1,6 as time goes to infinity. So the proof has a similar flavor as the previous case, which is done by tracking the evolution of the potential energy. However, unlike the IPM equation where the potential energy IPM equation where the potential energy is always monotone in time. This is not the case for the 2D Business Nesque. So we have to use a more delicate argument to consider the second derivative of the potential energy and then to control the error caused by the diffusion. But at the end, we do have infinite time in growth, infinite in-time growth results in that equation as well. So that's all I want to talk about. And thank you for your attention. Thank you for your attention. Okay, let's go.
