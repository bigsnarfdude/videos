I propose this particular talk to kind of address some of the aspects of pore-scale modeling that other speakers sort of alluded to, but did not touch base a lot. We use these mesoscale models, Lattice-Boltzmann models, for estimating quite a lot of interesting transport properties out of porous media. In this particular Porous media. In this particular effort, I'm going to only take a very small, focused part of the study, which is inertial flow parameters is still single phase, but kind of show the workflow of how to do these statistical estimations of certain properties as well as apply machine learning on these kinds of methods. So, all the work, like I mentioned, this is done with a PhD. PhD student at that time, Sultan Anbar. She's now working at QRI. The project was funded by Shell for looking at the near-Valboar high-rate producers. And all the simulations were performed at LSU's HPC. Outline of the talk is I'm going to talk about why inertial flow is important and what kind of porous medium I'm really looking at. So this is like the gravel pack completions. This is like the gravel pack completions. So, the approximation of gravel packs using some sort of packs of different grain size distributions is a good approximation for gravel pack. We'll start with that. We have shown it how it works and can be used in other publications. So, with that, that would be my first starting point. And I'll go trying to describe the macro scale relationship, especially. Relationship, especially with these losses related to the pressure losses related to the inertial flows. Then I'll give you one slide overview of Lattice-Boltzmann method and then get into the other issues that we're talking about with statistical learning, path network models, in and maybe one slide on it, and then wrap it up with conclusions and leave some references for you all. So the non-Darcy flows are what we typically call inert. Darcy flows or what we typically call inertial flows in pore scale, what happens in that is it's applicable whenever the Reynolds number is fairly small. And that particular relationship is written as, if I were to draw, take it as a pressure drop across macroscopic length scales, it will be related to the fluid viscosity multiplied with superficial velocity. Superficial velocity across the porous medium divided by its permeability, right? So, sort of have this driving potential to the flux divided by the resistant type of a relationship that we find typical to a constitutive relationships. And it is an empirical relationship. There is no first principles derivation for it. Even if you, for some simple geometries, try to apply a method of volume averaging, you can probably derive. Averaging, you can probably derive an interpretation for permeability tensor. That's Professor Wittaker's work and things like that. What happens when you start increasing the velocities? Despite the fact that you are in the laminar range, this is not turbulent flow, but what happens when you are at in the within the pore scale, within the pore scale, what you will see is you will see a quadratic contributions. Are quadratic contributions on the pressure loss. So, as the flow rate keeps increasing, the pressure, the amount of pressure you have to apply to maintain that flow rate will keep growing. And this particular relationship, actually, it's not. Oh my God, I just read this. Oh, what am I? Okay. Wrong button. Sorry. So, this relationship, quadratic relationships will show you that as soon as you are in this. Will show you that as soon as you are in this, these are Reynolds numbers that's a particle diameter in the range of five to ten and all, it starts going up. And this is at high rate injectors like that you would be seeing in carbon sequestration. Those things will be pumping at a very high rate. Or when you're talking about offshore high-rate producers, these things are highly prolific oil and gas producers that have production rates of even Have production rates of even more than 10,000 barrels or 20,000 barrels per day. So, their Reynolds number that we are talking about is nowhere close to where the Darcy flow regime will actually be valid. So, near the vicinity of the valvo, more than likely, you are actually adding a lot of pressure losses like that, which is, and as your Technological number keeping work, the inertial contributions far outweigh any of these viscous contributions from the data. From the that are modeled by the Darcy's law. So it is extremely important to know what this quadratic term and how much it is. And in the previous discussion, there was a comment then can we retrieve these kind of Forshammer terms? It is a Forshammer term. And this relationship was proposed in like 1905 or so. So it's not like we are coming with this is like a century-old stuff. So quick overview, one slide overview. Quick overview, one slide overview of Lattice-Boltzmann, and because we are dealing with something simpler, which is single-phase, but of course, the flow regime is a little bit challenging because of the inertial flow contributions. This is a three-dimensional Q19 model. So what it means is that in this lattice, I am not considering these corner points. So otherwise, it would have 27 lattice points, including the rest state at zero and eight corner points. So what we have done is remove those eight corner points out of the 27. Is remove those eight corner points out of the 27 cubic locations. So we got 19 Q19 model. There are two main steps of a typical lattice bolt method, streaming and collision. Streaming part is straightforward. That purely depends upon the directions on the lattice that you're solving for. So because we have 19 directions, so we'll have F would be a 19-dimensional space for me. For me. And the way to look at this complicated structure would be just to unroll it. You know, just unroll it along the lattice direction, and you can view this thing as a bar chart. That's a simpler way to explain to what's happening. It will tell you how the, this is the particle density distribution function along that particular direction. So let's say if I could read it stack 10, that's the highest particle distribution function along that particular direction. Distribution function along that particular direction. That's the interpretation. And these are the directions that we have chosen. So those are written there. There will be a collision step. This is the part that evolve your particle distribution function from one step to another step through collision. Again, pretty old idea came from Bhatnaga Grosskruk many, many decades ago. And since then, it has been changed multiple ways. Has been changed multiple ways by changing the single relaxation time to multiple relaxation time in each different directions that you want to do it. And I would interpret that as more of a numerical knob. When we are getting into these complicated geometries, we can try out. There's been a lot of work in the last two, three decades on this one. So I'm not going to harp a lot about it. Beautiful thing, how do we recover the quantities of interest? If you take the zero order moment of these distribution functions, you should. Moment of these distribution functions, you should retrieve density. If you take the first moment, you should get the row times u. And if you take the second moment, you'll get the kinetic energies, things like that. So, this is a very beautiful way of, you know, by taking the moment hierarchies and try to retrieve the macroscopic quantities of interest. So, can't take any credit. This is already from a book by Suka Penthorn written on for geoscientists and engineers. There are more. Geoscientists and engineers, there are more Lattice Boltzmann books that have been predating that, and so I'm not getting into that, but this was very useful for us. One slide summary of that, how that thing works for us in realistic geometry. I rely on a lot of my colleagues that do poor scale imaging, segmentations, the kind of experiments. I'm not an experimentalist, but I try to work a lot with experimentals. A lot of respect for them. I would not Respect for them. I would not be able to do all this. So they take an X-ray CT scan of a sandstone and it's a realistic sandstone because it comes from Castlegate. And what they do is they take this grayscale image. They have some thin sections, SEM images also. They apply their image segmentation algorithm to provide me this kind of an image. Not just 2D, but I get the whole 3D voxel volume of it. One of the reasons why we use Lattice Bolt. One of the reasons why we use Lattice Boltzmann so heavily is because I can directly run this simulation without getting into the meshing and other issues. Because, like our first keynote speaker, Tur, applying boundary conditions on these complicated geometries using this bounce back is a very trivial, it's not that complicated compared to mesh generation. So, we will do that. And I'm just showing you the one result that shows you where the intercept happens and where the slope that determines the That determines the Forscheimer parameters and the Darcy, what we call a single-phase permeability for this particular rock. The numbers we obtained, both of them were very close to the experimentally observed. So this work was published in Transport in Poros Media in 2012. So continuing with that, basically establishing the case that we can do realistic geometries quite a lot, but trying to do machine learning on realistic geometry is very, very challenging. Machine learning on realistic geometry is very, very challenging. Like the speakers on Tuesday actually established that. So, how do we try to get these Darcy parameters? Instead of doing the pressure relationships, you can look at it, the coefficient multiplying, looking at the pressure loss to the flow rate relationship is one over permeability. So you look at one over apparent permeability. Apparent permeability, especially in the inertial flow range, it has two contributions. One would be for the first terms coming from the single phase, and then the slope part that is related to the velocity. So if I were to plot inverse apparent permeability versus flow rate, or let's say rho u over mu, this does not have the units of Reynolds number, but we call it pseudo-Reynolds number. Then the slope will give me beta. Then the slope will give me beta, and my intercept will give me the inverse of the single phase permeability. And that's what we were intercept gives me inverse, will give me the single phase permeability. And this will give me the beta factor. And you can see, so when somebody is asking, you know, at what time, what Reynolds number, particle Reynolds number, this is changing, you'll see Reynolds number is around one. As you go to like two, three. As you go to like two, three, you know, you start seeing the deviation from the single-phase permeability. And that's what we call inertial flow regime. Okay. Because we wanted to do statistical estimations, lots of simulations, we wanted to, we started with the gravel packs. Gravel packs were approximated using these spheres with the certain grain size distribution that we found from literature are a good approximation of the appropriate packs. Approximation of the prop end packs in the completions. Okay. Once we created these kinds of prop end packs, we created lots and lots of these geometries. And Sultan created around 300 such Lattice Boltzmann simulations. And we tried to optimize the mesh resolutions, the parameters. So instead of the simulations taking like twice the amount of time, if you could change from MRT to SRT, instead of going for a billion grid. Or a billion grid point calculation, if you could do it with, let's say, 400 cubed simulations, that type of a parametric study we did a priori before launching all 300 simulations. Okay. So then once we got all different types of simulations done, even before we get into that, it is we wanted to kind of look at what is the geometrical properties of our prop and pack and how much of Of our prop and pack, and how much of the space can that cover? So, we started looking at a variety of petrophysical quantities out of this porous medium. And a couple of them would be like, okay, so we have mean particle diameter, we've got porosity, permeability, beta factor, specific surface area, and quantities like that we try to model, we will have, of course, you know, totalosity is one of them. So, think of them. So, think of them. Porosity is sort of like a volume measure of the void space, right? This is the ratio of the void volume to the total matrix plus void volume. Permeability is sort of measuring the resistance. So it has a good measure of the number of pore, somehow measures a good, like what are the restrictive pore throats. And specific surface areas, again, another area measure of this porous media. There are many, you know, so you could you could actually. So, you could actually get into geometry of porous media, and then you'll find these Minkowski functionals that actually describe it. We're not getting into the details of all that, but the two quantities of transport that are permeability and non-darcy, and I've thrown one more, which would be the linear measure. What is totosity? Totosity is basically looking at the linear measure of this path that is taken by the fluid parcel as it crosses. And there comes the interpretation. There comes the interpretation. I'm looking at hydrodynamic tortuosities. There are, when we measure totosity from different types of experiments, some of them are actually electrical resistance. And so the distinction between what is the totosity is huge. And it will become pretty apparent, especially for the inertial flows. The hydrodynamic totosity that you are looking at is not the same thing as your electrical totalities. So when people try to fit these correlations, People try to fit these correlations, even if from measured quantities, you will see trying to predict an inertial parameter from something that does not measure our tortosity very well, you'll have a problem. Okay, so this is just like sort of building, you know, what kind of relationships. If you see, you know, the line along the diagonals, they'd say that they're very highly related. You could drop one of those parameters. So, let's say specific surface area is highly related. Like, say, a specific surface area is highly related to one of the parameters, like mean particle diameter. So, we should not try to use both of them simultaneously in building those correlations. If you do that, one of the parameters is not independent of the other, right? Okay. This doesn't say much, but I'll tell you: this is the current state of the art where people try to fit the statistical correlations out of all these measurements and at least the ones that I have looked at. I'm not going to criticize all. ones that I have looked at. I'm not going to criticize oil and gas folks as much as, because it happens in the groundwater hydrologies, poros media, even chemical engineering. So we basically take a quantity like that log, we will have a power law relationships like permeability, porosities, totosities, throw everything under the kitchen sink will be in there, right? And this is just to show you judiciously we hid the names, but if you if you dig deep in our references, you will find where those correlation numbers are coming. Find where those correlation numbers are coming from, you can actually predict for Scheimer parameters from very large to this, and this is on a large scale. This is the coefficient that comes out. So we are all over the place. And this is just a tiny bit. This is just the tip of the iceberg problem. This is the magnitude. What we are not showing you is how they dependent, how they depend on different. Depend on different quantities. In fact, let's look at that. So, if I were to build a beta parameter purely using the porosity and permeability, I will see a dependence of a type that there will be a constant. You are trying to predict, keep that in mind. This is one over meter and permeability is one over meter squared. If you have an exponent of the half, you get some sort of dimension. You get some sort of dimensionality, dimensional relationship that is correct. Porosity is dimensionless. So you get something good. But when you look at their fit summary, very nice coefficient, goodness of fit R squares right there, adjusted R squares pretty good. If we look at all the statistical quantities with their parameter estimates, this looks nice. So this could be a very useful beta factor core. Beta factor correlation, right? Let's look at another one. This time we put tortosity as well as specific surface area. Folks have done that. This is coming from a published literature actually. As you do that, look at the R squared, still 99, beautiful. But do you see what happened? In the first correlation, if you Correlation: if you increase the permeability, beta should have gone down. It was inversely proportional. If you didn't pay attention, that was in the denominator. And then, if I just threw a few more terms over there, now it is directly proportional. So, of course, your porosity is still in a denominator, but you have specific surface area, totalosity, all those things are coming up over there. And you start looking at these whether the coefficient. Whether the coefficient that multiplies the permeability is it statistically significant or not. And then all of a sudden, look at it, it may not actually be statistically significant having K in that particular one. So you have completely changed the interpretability or how we try to understand the physics of this non-Darcy parameter or Forsheimer parameter as dependent upon other quantities. On other quantities of interest, like porosities, permeability. So, this is this is, we have to be very careful how we are retrieving these quantities. Okay, so that's first message I wanted to carry. Second thing I want to tell you is, is if I were to look at these beta factors from different types of correlations, you should also look at their leverage plots, right? So, you're looking at the residuals, you're looking at the leverage of beta with respect to phi, beta with respect to. Beta with respect to phi, beta with respect to k. And if I were to look at for the beta with tau at SSA, you would see that this has much less error. So the ranges is minus 0.04 to that. If I were to look at, this was higher, right? Problem is not just that. The problem is you have chosen the You have chosen the parameters that lead to what we call a collinearity problem. So, if you have the exogenous variables that you are trying to fit this regression into, also influencing others, it's the on the leverage plots, you will start seeing them passing to one point, SSA. So, once you identify that, you know this kind of a correlation is actually a bad way to. Correlation is actually a bad way to be estimating for Schemer parameters out of the quantities of that you have measured. So then we went further. Actually, it's mostly Supan's works. She came up with structure equation models. This is used heavily by statisticians, and I learned from her. What she did is she showed that she's going to create two exogenous variables, which is the mean particle diameters and the porosity, and she's going to create And she's going to create this graph. That graph will basically tell quantities of interest like permeability, beta factor, specific area, and totosity. And she created the dependence using these factors. It's basically a generalized linear result-back equation solver. And when you carry that out, another interesting thing, you have error terms, right? You have error in tortosity, error in specific surface area beta and all. If you find Your beta and all. If you find the errors being correlated, that's a very good indicator that these quantities are highly correlated. Should not have made one as a dependent function of the other, independent variable. So we created these standardized residual covariances. All absolute values of standardized residuals were less than the suggested criteria of two. So we came up with a good criteria. And for all the correlations we developed out of that, which is again power law-based, we were able to get almost all. To get almost all quantities except totosity to match well, and then I'll give you a physics-based intuition of why that is such a difficult quantity to match. We've got beta, permeability, specific surface area, all in the range of 99 and all. And that's trivial. Like folks say, oh, that's sphere packs. But even getting that, you know, on 300 simulations analysis, it's a good thing. Okay. Then we tried learning from that and then started looking at if. And then started looking at if artificial neural nets will help us any better. By doing that, like R-squares to begin with for permeability, beta factors, specificators were very high. You can increase them further to the third four decimal place. But the good part that come out of it, it is even with the machine learning, we weren't able to pull the R-squares or predictive capability of tortuosity. Of tortuosity much further. And this is where we started getting into why is that such a difficult quantity to predict? Is we started drawing these streamlines, and I'm just giving you a snapshot of it instead of showing you the kind of videos you have already seen. This thing, because I've mentioned it, what is tortosity? Totosity is the ratio of this average path length these particles take over this macroscopic length scale of the pressure drop that we are talking about. Pressure drop that we are talking about. This is a highly sensitive quantity compared to as we open and close various pore spaces with slight perturbation in the porous media. So that was very difficult quantity to kind of chase with slightest perturbation in the porous media geometric properties. So with that, let me, interest of time, stop at this particular point with a few conclusions here. A few conclusions here. We have been able to measure both porosity, the permeability, and beta factors for propant pack using basic fluid dynamics principles using a technique like Leiden-Boltzmann. Statistical machine learning proper tools were applied to Lattice-Boltzmann. We had to have 300 simulations to even make some sense. And again, proper statisticians would probably say that that's not a very large data set to begin with to make these kinds of models. But what we found there. But what we found there, some interesting things, was we were able to create a path model for the petrophysical parameters. We showed there was a strong correlation between permeability and non-Darcy. So do not try to fit one with another, but try to keep them independent of each other or try to go back to the gravel pack geometric properties like particle diameters or grain size distributions like that. That if beta depends on d and the distribution of porosity, let's make it a function of that, not the function of k, because there are Not the function of k because their errors are correlated. With path analysis, the indirect effects can be included, which could not be modeled with the linear regressions due to the correlinearity problem. We could also get the missing data estimated using these path models. So those are interesting work done by Dr. Ranbar. So I kind of put her PhD dissertation on the top. And this was the work where we pulled out all those beta factor correlations. This is a master's thesis. Factor correlations. This is a master's thesis work. And you guys can see how those correlations have been published in the literature that don't help. And this is some of the Lattice Boltzmann work done in my group, just to kind of show that we have gone through some physical properties like compactions, sand migrations, hydraulic fractures, prop end packs, canonical problems, which was published in AICHEJ, looking at smooth and rough sphere packs. And this was the first. And this was the first one which I was talking about: Castlegate and image-based modeling. So let me stop here, take some questions. And questions from Zoom questions from the room? Thanks. Really interesting. I had two questions. One is just probably trivial, but you mentioned you contrasted those two types of Leidas Boltzmann, one with 19 and the other one with 27 neighbor. Right, right. But I'm forgetting this, but I guess one of them you can show that goes to. One of them you can show that goes to Navier Stokes, or both of them in the limit you two symmetries. Both of them you can prove that they go to Navier Stokes. Okay, excellent. One has more three pairs. So it may have some studious. But I guess, right, if you don't have enough, then it doesn't go through now. You're still desktop. Right, right, right, right. You have to have certain meaningful number of directions, which are three walls. Right, right, right. The symmetries, yeah. Then I had a question regarding the A question regarding the betas that you end up measuring. Of course, the inverse of it is a length scale. And I'm wondering, is that still kind of on the order of the pore size? Is there a relationship, an additional relationship with some kind of pore size distribution that you can use to correlate with? That's a question. No, no, no, this is a very good question, Charles. So the answer, it is an inverse of a length scale, the way it has been presented. I wish I had a couple of those. Okay. So the way we are looking at it is it sort of mimics the, you know, sort of these separation bubbles, recirculation zones. These separation bubbles, recirculation zones that develop right after the poor throat. So there's sort of like a relationship between the poor throat to the grain and then how the flow is basically going from poor throat and how long the grain is. So we do see some length scales over there. It's probably very similar to any kind of geometry where we have these recirculation bubbles forming. So my analogy. So, my analogy for yours would be a backward-facing step where there's a step height and the length of the recirculation zone. So, that length of the recirculation bubble is a good estimate of what that length of beta should be. But we have not proven any to that, to that extent. And in porous media, because you're going to have a sequence of these poor throats following the first one, there is a way to disturb that recirculation line, right? So, I think the tortuosity can influence, you know. Totosity can influence, you know, what is the how, how on a statistical measure, what's the distance between two poor throats? So I think that that could show up over there too. So excellent question. I haven't really thought much deeper into that. Yeah. Sure, sure, sure. One more minute. So just as a comment, I guess there's kind of renewed interest also from the aerodynamics community on these sorts of things because On these sorts of things, because they've shown that, because now you can build these low porosity but still somewhat sturdy materials that are sort of porous, non-isotropic. So it has to be non-isotropic for passive flow control. So you can place these things on a surface. And so there's now interest in non-isotropic. So I was wondering, are you aware of work similar to what you presented here, but for non-anisotropic porous media with essentially inertial effects? Media with essentially inertial effects in non-isotropic metal forms, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I have read papers. Uh, so um, that's actually an excellent uh comment because when we did the work that the transport broach media, we did publish the anisotropic uh permeability tensor. So it's not just the KI I'm showing you, and it had like close to a Darcy, that's that's an isotope, it was a tensor. That's an isotope, it was a tensor, so we did the full tensor calculations for k and beta. Uh, so the framework is generalizable to everything, but again, under restrictive assumptions of that, it is along the principal directions of the flow. Things were aligned along the principal direction. So we can actually assume if you go to pure mathematicians, they would show that certain tensors should be of different orders and beta would be. And beta would be third order or something like that. And then it would make interpretation pretty complicated. But if you keep them as second-order tensors like permeability tensors, so you have the directional dependence of all these coefficients in our workflow. Yeah, so that's there. But I have not done any of these kinds of metal foam type of simulations within my group, but I'll be happy to kind of follow up on if there is interest in collaboration over there. There is interest in collaboration over there. Okay, so if there is no further questions, interest of time, I'll conclude my talk over here and then move on to the next one.
