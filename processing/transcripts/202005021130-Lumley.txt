In brackets. I was very excited to come to Banff this year, and well, that didn't get to happen, so I'm just pretending we're there, regardless. I'm going to talk about the distribution of values of L functions within the critical strip, but taken over function fields. So, the way that we're going to introduce the talk is by starting with what goes on in the number field situation, like what's the history and some small motivation. Some small motivation for why we study this problem. And then I'll explain my results and what I did. So, this is work from my PhD thesis. And yeah, so we'll just go forward. So, we're going to fix some notation. In this case, a little d is always going to mean a fundamental discriminant. So, there are some sets that I'm going to define in the future here, which I won't write fundamental discriminant, but you always remember. Write fundamental discriminant, but you always remember that that's what we're counting. So d is fundamental discriminant. The chi d is going to be the associated real primitive character to the modulus absolute value d. And our focus for the talk is going to be discussing distribution of values of L functions for sigma, which is going to be fixed between one half and strictly bigger than one half and going all the way up to less equal one. And we let the 1 and we let the fundamental or the d range over fundamental discriminants up to some bound x. Okay, so that's the notation. So we'll start with the sigma equals 1 because this is a sort of easier thing to understand and it has a lot more information about it than the other case. So one motivation for understanding the distribution of values is to really be able to grasp is to really be able to grasp what's the actual extreme value behavior for L1 chi d. And of course, we focus specifically on sigma equals one because it has this nice association to class numbers and things like that, but I'm not going to talk about that application today. So in 1928, under the assumption of GRH, Littlewood was able to prove that L1 Prove that L1 chi d is bounded between two functions. So we have a double log of the absolute value of the discriminant in the upper bound, and two coefficients make an appearance. We get 2 times e to the gamma. And these are very important, especially the 2. This is why I've put this on the inside of the parentheses. And for the lower bound, you get essentially the same idea, but instead you're going to have 1 over log log, the discriminant, ask value of the discriminant. Value of the discriminant. And we get the e to the gamma appearing and a zeta 2, which is natural, just coming from your Euler product. And again, you'll have this 1 over 2, like a 2 appearing on here. So then later, he also showed that, again, assuming GRH, there exists infinitely many D such that L1 chi D is greater than or equal to O1 times the same thing. A one times the same thing here, this e to the gamma log log of the discriminant here. So this is considered an omega result, and there's some question about whether or not the coefficient 2 is the correct coefficient for our upper bound, or this coefficient 1 is the correct coefficient for the upper bound. And we have the same idea for the other end, where it's proven that there exists infinitely many d such that l1 chi d is less equal to 1. d is less equal to 1 plus zeta 2 over e to the gamma log log d. So again, this factor of 2 is missing in these bounds. And in 1949, Chala removed the assumption of GRH on these omega results. So we know the omega results unconditionally, but these upper bounds of little wood still require GRH. And the question that people have been focusing on with respect to this now is like, actually, which of these bounds are correct? Which one? Are correct, which one should we expect as being the true extreme behavior of L1 chi d? And the conjecture is that, in fact, it's the omega results that are right, so that this upper bound should have a coefficient of one instead of a coefficient of two appearing here. So what kind of progress can we make towards this? Well, Granville and Sandra Rajan approached this using some probabilistic methods. They decided to study. Methods, they decided to study this function phi x of tau, which counts the number of fundamental discriminants, which will give a L function L1 chi d whose size is greater than e to the gamma tau. And then you divide out by the total number of fundamental discriminants less than or equal to x. So what did they show? They showed that uniformly in the region that this phi x of tau has some x. that this phi x of tau has some exponential, well, sorry, doubly exponential decay. And the region that they were able to prove depends totally on whether or not you're willing to assume the GRH or not. Okay, so you notice though two things about both of these regions is that they have a log log x, so that's describing the bound that we expect to have, this log log absolute value d. But importantly, there is no two. Importantly, there is no two in front of it. And so, this is quite a bit of evidence to suggest that really the omega results are the correct ones, that we don't expect to have many L functions which appear with an upper bound larger than one times e to the gamma log log d. And you'll notice the difference between the GRH bound and the non-GRH bound is not. The non-GRH bound is not so massive. I mean, there's a factor of two on this triple log, and then there's this other annoying quadruple log that shows up. But in any case, in either situation, if you have the GRH or you don't, the range of uniformity is falling just short of actually proving the conjecture that the omega results are the correct description for the extreme values of our L-functions on the one line. So that's sort of sad, and nobody, as far as I know, has been able to actually prove the conjecture, but it is a lot of positive evidence towards that. Okay, so this is the story on the one line. So of course, if you can do something on the edge of the critical strip, you should start asking yourself, well, what can we say inside? How much of these ideas port directly over? And for this part, I'm going to describe things in terms of zigzag. Describe things in terms of zeta because there was a little bit more information in terms of extreme bounds. So if we fix our sigma between one half and one, then this is a result of Titchmarsh that the Riemann hypothesis says for any t greater than or equal to three, that log of zeta sigma plus i t is less than less than log t to the power of two times one minus sigma. And you're dividing up by some log of t. So walk up t. Now, on the other hand, in the 70s, Montgomery had showed that if you take big t super large and you let look at the maximum over this interval, big t to 2t, that log of absolute value of zeta sigma plus i t should be greater than or equal to some constant times log t to the power of 1 minus sigma divided out by this log log t into sigma. So in this situation, the discrepancy between the remote The discrepancy between the Riemann hypothesis bound and the unconditional bound that we can, like unconditional omega bound that we can get, is much bigger. So on the one line, we just had a discrepancy in a factor of two. But here, where we're taking sigma strictly away from one, the discrepancy shows up in the exponent. So there's a two on this exponent, and there's no two on this exponent. And yeah, of course, there's a discrepancy in the log-love guy, but we won't focus on that. Love love guy, but we won't focus on that. So it's of a lot more interest to understand actually which of these two bounds is correct because they're so far apart from each other. So as you may guess, the conjecture is that the omega result, so this guy is the one that we expect to be true. And there's been a lot of work trying to prove that that's actually the case. So most notably, oh, before I give the results. I give the results on that. I'm going to just discuss what the general situation is. So we define, just like in Granville and Sandra Rogan's case, we had this phi x tau. So now we're going to take instead phi zeta t, which is dependent now on sigma and tau. And it's just measuring the number of t in this interval here, such that log of zeta sigma t is going to be greater than tau. So it's the same idea. So it's the same idea, and the idea or the approach to solving these kinds of questions is again relating this to some probabilistic tool set that we have. So of course in the 40s, if we were able to take, or if we were taking sigma equal to half, Selberg proved that if lambda is a real number which is fixed, then we could say that for this specific choice of tau and sigma equaling one-half are the Our phi zeta t has a normal distribution, right? So it looks like this, it's Gaussian, and this is like a celebrated result that people try to generalize to many other L-functions with some degrees of success in different regions or areas. Then in 2006, I described for you Granville and Saldurjan's result where we take sigma equals one. Where we take sigma equals one, although the formulation here looks a bit different, it's because when you take things on the one line, you don't need to be applying a log, so it looks a bit funny. But those are the extreme cases. And when we go for in the mid-range, you might want to understand actually, you know, can we even say anything about this distribution, the tail of the distribution here, the sigma zeta t? And so in the 30s, Boron Yesen proved that in fact this thing. Proved that in fact this thing does have some limiting distribution. So as t goes to infinity, it should approach some function f, sigma of tau. And in the late 80s, Montgomery and Alisgo said, okay, not only do we know that it has a limiting distribution, but we can say something about this f, that it should be bounded between two exponential decay functions where you have constants b1 and b2. The constants b1 and b2, both of them are positive. So the upper bound looks like this: you have a minus b2 tau to the one over one minus sigma, and you multiply by log tau to the sigma over one minus sigma. So I'm pointing out these coefficients because they're important for what's going to come up next. And the lower bound has the exact same shape, it's just that the coefficient is different. Okay, so we already know what we expect the limiting distribution to look like. Like. And in 2011, Lamzuri was able to actually prove that this zeta sigma t in some large uniform range for tau, which is here, we'll notice there's a constant. And again, we have this power 1 minus sigma on the range that our uniformity holds. We can prove that this thing is not only bounded between two functions of the shape that. Sorry, Montgomery and Odlisko suggested, but it actually equals this. And this a1 of sigma is some coefficient, which depends on the method of the proof. But it is a constant as soon as you fix your sigma, so that's nice. And they get the shape that you expect: tau to the one over one minus sigma times log tau to this sigma over one minus sigma plus this big old term r. This big old term R, which I've written in detail here, but the only important thing about this R is that it's giving you the limitation on the range of uniformity. Okay, so what does this say? Just like in the case on the one line, the range of uniformity that we're able to achieve gives us something which looks like the omega result. So you have in the exponent a one times one minus sigma. There's no two here. And so what it's telling us is that Here. And so, what it's telling us is that if you have some values t, little t, which give you that log of sigma plus i t is larger than this, it happens incredibly rarely. And just like in the case with the one line, this range of uniformity falls just shy of actually proving a conjecture that the omega results are the correct ones. Okay, so that's sort of the story with respect to. Story with respect to sigma being between one half and one. And in the same paper, Lenzuri also considered what happens if you look at L functions which are associated to some quadratic characters. So they define, he defines this new proportion, but it's the same idea. You have you're counting the fundamental discriminants d less equal to x, and you want to And you want to consider only L functions where the log of the absolute value will give you something larger than tau. And of course, we just divide out by our whole set of fundamental discriminants. And he's able to prove in a slightly wider range of uniformity here by a power of trip, no, sorry, quadruple log log log, quadruple log x, that this phi x of quadratic. Phi x of quadratic characters has the description for the tail of the distribution that we expect, that it looks like this exponential minus some constant. And again, this is depending on the method of the proof, times the correct power of tau, the correct power of log of tau, and some error term here. Okay, so the improvement on the range of uniformity is something very interesting. Is something very interesting, but unfortunately doesn't carry through into my own work. But this is because we use different methods to discuss what was going on. But anyway, that's sort of the state of the art for the number field case. And now I should say, what did I do? Because I've only given you a list of somebody else's results. So I should say, what was my work? And in order to do that, then I have this classic slide that you have. Classic slide that you have to have if you're doing a function field talk called the dictionary. So I'll just remind everybody that in the setting of the integers, when we discuss the primes and things like this, we're really looking at positive integers. This is what we're interested in. And in our case, where we take the ring of interest is now going to be a polynomial ring over some finite field, FQ, where Q is congruent to 1 mod 4, and of course. To 1 mod 4, and of course, there's some prime power. Then the thing that corresponds to a positive integer in this case is the monic polynomials. And the primes are corresponding then to monic irreducible polynomials. And in both settings, we have some notion of norm or size of the integer. So I wrote in the integer set that the absolute value of n is equal to the size of z1 nz, which is kind of a weird. Z1 nz, which is kind of a weird way to write it. But we do this because then it kind of gives you an idea of why you consider the absolute value of f the way that we do inside of function fields. It turns out that for any non-zero polynomial, then the size of the norm of f is given as the size of a mod fa, where fa is just your ideal generated by f. And this is pretty easily seen to be just q to the degree of f. Okay, so that's where this notion of the divide. Okay, so that's where this notion of the deform, the norm, comes in. And in our case, we should, of course, study or define what the L functions are, since that's what we want to talk about. So the Riemann zeta function over integers is, of course, this guy. And I just wrote sort of the absolute value of n here, which is redundant. But we put it there because we want to see nicely the comparison with what's going on in the function field situation. So here you're summing over all. So here you're summing over all your monic polynomials instead of your positive integers, and you take the norm like this. But you can see from the definition of the norm up here that this is really just some geometric series, and so we already understand how to evaluate that, and it gives us something like this, which is a function which is actually quite boring to study. And so we don't really care about what's going on here so much. I mean, there are things to say, but it's not that fun. It's not that fun. Then you have a Dirchley-L function over the integers, has a classic thing. So, again, here, chi d is your quadratic character associated to some fundamental discriminant. And we just, instead of one in our coefficients here, we put chi d of n. So, what's the scenario over in function fields case? Well, I haven't defined what this is, but it's going to be the But it's going to be the analog to having some quadratic character to a fundamental discriminant, and the coefficients are, you know, just chi df of this. Now, again, just like in the case of zeta, we have some nice identity for our L functions. The LSCHID here is not actually a series in this situation because the way that our orthogonality relation plays out over function fields, this thing becomes zero after zero after the degree of f is strictly bigger or maybe no greater than or equal to the degree of the polynomial which is defining our quadratic character. Okay, so it's actually a polynomial, not a series, which means that we have a bit more flexibility in how we can play around with this L function in the space. So was there anything else I wanted to say? To say, no, I think that's good. So the focus at the beginning of this talk was about looking at the extreme values of L-functions on the one-line, and so that's where we first look, is that if you take f to be some monic polynomial which has a fixed degree n, and chi is a non-trivial character inside of a mod f a cross, then for any complex. Then for any complex number s with the real part being equal to 1, we can say that ls chi in absolute value is bounded between 2 times e gamma log qn, where this is really the same thing as like log log the discriminant in the other case, because remembering that the norm of our polynomial is just q to its degree. So this is really exactly the size we expect. And the lower bound The lower bound has the same behavior. Again, you get the zeta 2 over 2 times e to the gamma. Now, one small thing that's sort of nice about function fields is that the Riemann hypothesis is true. So this first part here is completely unconditional. We don't need any unproven results to give this answer. Now, on the other hand, we had these discrepancies popping up in the number field case, so we should look and see what do the omega results. So, we should look and see what the omega results give us in function fields. And again, we can play some game and find irreducible polynomials, in this case, q1 and q2, which have degree n, such that L1 chi q1 is greater than or equal to a1 times e to the gamma, the log qn, plus some error terms. And we have the upper bound on L1 chi q2, which is again. L1 chiq2, which is again removing this factor of one-half that is appearing in the other results. So we see the same discrepancy appearing, and so you must try to think, well, what should the correct answer be? And unfortunately, I don't know. And so I can only give you a conjecture, which is now here where we explain actually what does the quadratic character I mentioned describe. Mentioned describe. So we consider what's called the hyper elliptic ensemble here, which is just a collection of monic polynomials which have a fixed degree little n here. And we insist that d is going to be square free. Okay, so these guys actually correspond with the fundamental discriminants in the number field case. And we have this conjecture that the omega results that I just described on the previous slide are actually going to be previous slide are actually going to be giving us the the maximum value for our L1 chi D. So we don't we expect the omega results are the correct bounds and similarly for the minimum. So just like in the number field case. So far it's it's kind of a little bit boring like all right we're just getting the same information that we already had but there's a twist which comes in when we try to actually get evidence for the conjecture. So the approach The approach for proving these kinds of distribution results is that you, instead of studying directly your L1 chi d here, you build some random Euler product out of independent variables which are defined on your primes or your monic irreducible polynomials. And then you compare the distribution of how L Of how L1 chi d behaves to how this random Euler product behaves. And once you have that kind of information, there are a few theorems you plug together, you can get this result that if n is large, so this is the degree of our polynomials that we're interested in, then uniformly for tau up to log qn, and again the coefficient here is on one, minus the same or very similar expression to what n. Expression to what and Granville and Sandra Rajan give for their L1 chi D result in the number field situation. We can say that the probability that D appears in our fundamental discriminant list and the size of L1 chi d is greater than E gamma tau decays doubly exponentially. So it has the sort of general shape that we expect of our shape that we expect of our distribution function, or sorry, tail of our distribution function. But there's some sort of major difference here. While we get the q to the tau, so the double exponential, and dividing out by tau, this piece here, c2, is not a constant anymore. So in the case of Granville and Sandurajan, they found a constant in front of this term, and in our case, it's not. It depends on tau. It's not, it depends on tau. Now, this looks somewhat messy because there's a lot of notation going on, like what is this kappa and everything, but it's just an artifact from the proof. So, in order to study, get results like this, you just do some saddle point analysis on log of the expectation of your random model, which I didn't define, but it looks like this to the power of r. And the saddle point. And the saddle point that we get associated to this thing is actually the kappa. So the decay actually has the, yeah, the tail of the distribution has some kind of wiggling action, which depends on tau itself and how big kappa is. This notation here, though, is just meaning the fractional part. So we have some limitation on how much wiggling we can get. It doesn't On how much wiggling we can get, it doesn't get to just go randomly forever or take any value, it's trapped between zero and one. And there, because we're taking this q to this power, we can see that it satisfies a nice property, which is that it's multiplicatively periodic or satisfying this particular condition here. Okay, so this is something that's unique to function fields. There have been many distribution results that have been studied, and this kind of wiggling And this kind of wiggling situation, which appears in your tail of the distribution, never pops up. And so the question might be: so, what does this C2 look like? And in order to describe that, we just sort of recall what Granville and Sounder-Rogan's formula will look like. It has the same shape, but the C2 that they give in their theorem is looking like 0.440. It converges to something that's very long. Converges to something that's very long. And it is a constant, it doesn't change. So I just put some graphs up where I take the first valid q for my function field, so 5 and 9, and we looked at sort of what's the range of these values. So two things that are sort of interesting is that the maximum value that this thing achieves is strictly smaller in both cases, constant which you get in the number field situation. And nice, the other. And nice, the other nice thing is that it has this very smooth behavior, which is kind of cool. And I did more calculations for more q, but as q gets larger, you can see that the maximum value is sort of decreasing, and this behavior persists so that the larger you take q, it looks like the wiggling action, because also I think the range starts to narrow quite a bit, is shrinking. So as q goes to infinity, we can see that the wiggling. Goes to infinity, we can see that the wiggling action is getting less and less. Okay, so that's the situation on the one line. The next thing that you want to think about is what's going on strictly between one half and one. So we have again some proposition which is discussing the behavior of our L functions. So you get some upper bound, which normally you say is conditional on GRH, but we have. Say is conditional on GRH, but we have GRH here, so it's an unconditional situation, which has the same shape as what we saw in the number field case. You have a 2 times 1 minus sigma appearing in the exponent of our bound. And the omega results that we get, I guess I have to hurry, I'm running out of time, do the same thing, that we have this discrepancy showing up where This discrepancy showing up where the power on the omega result is going to be 1 minus sigma instead of 2 times 1 minus sigma. So, you know, same story as what's going on in the number field case, nothing too shocking. But again, we conjecture that these omega results are correct, are the correct bound and not the upper bound that we can get just from applying PRH. And once again, we find Once again, we find this sort of odd behavior appearing in our distribution theorem. So the range of uniformity is again what we want to see showing up. The power has a 1 minus sigma. So here I just remind you that n is the same thing as log of the absolute value of d. And so what the way to read this information is that the probability that we have some That the probability that we have some L function which is greater than tau up to this constant times n to the power of one minus sigma is vanishingly small. It again has the same shape for powers on the tau and the log, just like you saw in the number field case, but we also find this weird behavior where the coefficient is dependent on tau. And so it's no longer a constant. Once you fix Once you fix your sigma and your Q, it actually has some wiggling action as well. And it has the same nice property that the other one has, which is that it is multiplicatively periodic with multiplicator q to the sigma now. So I'll just finish really quickly with one last picture of how things behave as you vary your sigma. I only picked one Q, but the A has the same shape. The A has the same shape as what it did on the one line, and it seems to have the same kind of behavior, but like it's going to be smaller than what the number field situation gives you. And as you approach sigma equals one, you can see that this thing is growing quite a lot because the size, the maximum size is now in like 25,000. But this actually makes sense because. This actually makes sense because of the shape of the tail of the distribution on the one line. You should expect that this coefficient is huge because we want our tail to have a doubly exponential decay on the one line. And so we need that to somehow compensate in what's going on. But anyway, that's where I'll stop. So thank you for listening. And if you have any questions, maybe I took too much time. So we can. So we can just thanks, Alyssa. Yeah. Are there any questions? Can I ask a quick question? Yes. Why do you need Q congrego one mod four? Do you need like roots of unity? Oh no, so this is just for quadratic reciprocity. You can just flip all the time when you're converted to 114. So yeah, all the results should. Yeah, yeah, all the results should hold in the other case, but you know, like I haven't done the proof, so I can't say for sure. But the ideas are there, but you just have to do some more finicky stuff. Yeah, I guess the quadratic character behaves a bit different and reciprocity is a bit different or something, but should probably all still work. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, thanks. No worries. Are there any other questions? Are there any other questions? Can I ask a question? Yep. In the theorem from 2018, you have a secondary term. It's like a minus two log base Q, whatever. Do you need to have the two in front of that? Actually, that's a good question. Oh, no. So I think, oh boy, that's a good question because I actually have GRH here. And this is the non-GRH bound for Granville and Santa Roger. For Granville and Sandrogen. So maybe I was being a bit overcautious. I have to think about that because I can't quite remember exactly the theorem in the paper, but I should look at it because, yeah, we have GRH. I should be able to remove this too. Okay, thanks. Yeah, sorry about that. Here, I guess I can do it. Okay, let's thank the speaker. So we have lunch now.
