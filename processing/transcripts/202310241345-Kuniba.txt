So, the subject of my talk is slightly away from the mainstream of the workshop. I'm sorry about that, but it's still related to the quantum integrality in three-dimensional systems. So, I hope you can enjoy it as an informal talk. So, this is based on the joint work with Lei Yuno Wei and the Yuji Tekashi. So, this is the outline of my talk. So, the first, I explain what a tetrahedron and 3D reflection equation. Hadron and 3D reflection equations. And then I show the new solution. And the third part is a derivation from quantum class algebra. And the fourth part is a kind of bug as on the duality. And last part is a kind of. So the reference actually appeared just this morning. So there are two papers from us. So the second paper, tetrahedron equation and the quantum clusterity blasting. So these three are so-called square pieces. So, this treat is the so-called square pivot, and I talked about this at the conference at BIMSA in the summer of this year. So, today I'm going to focus on this, the first paper, the four quantity of things, like this. So, my talk is based on this first paper. So, what's the tetrahedron and 3D diffraction equations? So, they are the 3D analog of the Yambach star and the diffraction equations. So, the tetrahedron equations originally proposed by some. Equations originally proposed by Sacha Zamorskov in 1980 has this point. So, this R is an operator acting on the tensor cube of certain vector space B, which can be higher dimensional or infinite dimension. And the indices specify the tensor component on which it acts non-trivial. So, this is the equality as a linear operator acting on this tensor product. So, the 3D reflection equations. So, the 3D reflection equations proposed by Isaif and Puris in 1997 has this one. So, here, in addition to R, you also have so-called reflection operator K, which acts on the four spaces, denser products of four spaces of this structure. And there are in total nine spaces of this structure, and this is a quality as a linear variable. So, they look quite horrible, but in fact, they have very good. In fact, they have very good algebraic as well as geometric backgrounds. So let me explain about the algebraic backgrounds. So they are the compatibility condition of the quantized young box star equation and quantized deflection equations, by which I mean the usual young box star and the deflection equation up to conjugation. So everybody probably knows the diagram for the young box star equation, which is a black part of this view. And also everyone knows. And also, everyone knows the reflection equation, which consists of the black part of this figure. So, usually, you impose a stoic equality, but now we relax it in the conjugation equivalence. So, that brings us a certain conjugation operator R and K, which is going to act on this process of the original parts variable. So now, R and K raise a lot of structures. And k raise a lot of structure constants of this some new algebra. So they have to satisfy certain compatibility conditions and are introducing one more algorithm. So here you have four R configurations, a lot of triangles, but you can debus successively, triangle can be debus successfully until you reach this configuration in this one. So R456 debus is this triangle. 5-6 reverses this triangle like this by shifting this up. On the other hand, you can do the similar transformation starting from reversing this triangle 1, 2, 4, like this. And you reach the same result. So the Trahadron equation means that this root and this root must coincide. That's the sort of algebraic background. For 3D fraction equations, things are similar. So I'm sorry about this. So, I'm sorry, this figure is too small, but it really doesn't matter so much. So, here you have three reflecting arrows: this one, this one, and this one. And this reflection point, 137, should be debuffed. So, in the end, so it's going like this. So, it should arrive at 731. But in the meantime, But in the meantime, you have to, at some point, you have to reverse a triangle, and at a certain point, you have to reverse all the reflection. So it comes with a lot of composition of R and K. But anyway, so you can do it in one way or the other way. So remember that if you have three things and you have to reverse the order totally, then there are two ways to do that. That's a famous fact connected to the unboxing equation. So here it's a similar. So you have three different components. Similar. So you have three reflection points, and then you have to reverse the order of these three reflection points. But it is accompanied by a lot of reversible triangles, which correspond to R operation, or a lot of reversal of that reflection points, which correspond to this K. So the three reflection equations mean that the isotop mass coins are. So that's the sort of algebraic simple origin of these equations. These equations. So, here is a bit of history. So, as for the Tetra-Helon equation, several interesting solutions are known by those authors, starting from Sasha Damotshkov himself, where he only gave a conjecture, but which was very barbarous conjecture proved by Baxter and so on. And on the other hand, of 3D reflection equations, it's much more complicated and as of today, only a few solutions. As of today, only a few solutions are constructed by Yonehman, Opado and myself. So, there are quantum group theoretical approaches based on quantized bodied links by Kapranova-Poibodsky and PBW basis of the Niripotent sub-algebra of UQ, which is due to segue sergeant. So, they are kind of systematic approaches and they are both specific for type A, but it is known that they are equivalent beyond the type A. Equivalent beyond the typeway and have been developed extensively with many applications. So, if I've published a monograph about that last year, so if you are interested, yeah, please have a look. Anyway, so in those approaches, the diagrams in the previous pages emerge as wiring diagrams for the reduced expressions of the longest element of the wire groups, A, 3, and C. So, the aim of this talk is to develop another approach by Sund and Yagi, proposed last year, where these diagrams are complemented by quivers that facilitate the efficient operation of quantum cluster algebra. So, we focus on the FOC launcher of quivers, device a new realization of quantum y variables using qy algebras, and obtain a new solution. That's outline. That's outline. And now I show you the result. So here is a new solution: R and K expressed in this manner. So here, the main part is so-called psi function, which is a quantum dynamic, which is infinite products. The key property of this quantum dynamism is this very simple recursion relation. Recursion relation and the famous penta one identity, which is part for any q-square commuting variables you have to tell. And these p i's and ui's are the canonical variables satisfying canonical transform, a canonical commutation relation like this. Where this two is somewhat exceptional, but so the stories about the K is related to type C, which is not simply length. So somehow this So somehow these canonical variables are kind of appropriately normalized canonical variables, depending on the choice of the algebra system and so on. It's uniform for tetrahedral anyway. And what about the other parts? So this low operation is just the transposition of the canonical variance. And finally, this parameter h is related to Q by this parameterization. Parameterization. So h by is a kind of Planck constant, and lambdas are our parameters, three parameters, and lambda ij means a difference of lambda i and lambda j. So our claim is they satisfy the tetrahedron and 3D diffraction equations containing parameters lambda i's. So now let me move on to the derivation of this solutions from the quantum plus article. From the quantum cluster algebra. So the basic objects in the quantum cluster algebra is a seed, which is a pair of data P and Y. So for type A case for simplicity, B is a skew symmetric matrix. And in our case, we will only encounter matrix elements whose value B i j is plus minus one or plus minus one half, what's zero. And this skew symmetric matrix is called the exchange matrix, and it's conveniently visualized as a quiva with vertices and arrows. And the arrows are drawn by this rule. So if Bij is one, you draw an arrow from i to j. And if b i j is one half, you draw a dotted L like this. So giving the d is equivalent to giving the queen. Another ingredient of the data is the quantum y variables. So there are n of them, where n is the number of the vertices containing the power. So they are q commutative, and this q commutativity factor is specified by this exchange matrix, like this. So this is the basic object. And let F be the non-commutative refraction field. Be the non-commutative refraction field generated by y. So plainly, it's just a field, but yi is a true commutative, not a commutative. So the most characteristic operation in quantum cluster theory is the mutation. So given a seat PY, you can generate another seed by operation called μk, which is mutation in the direction K or at the point K, where K is taken. Or at a point k, where k is taken from any vertex of the queue. And the rule, the primes are given by this formula. So that's it, which is a bit complicated, but that's it. And there is a simple combinatorial rule to visualize this rule in terms of viva, but I'm not going to explain it. More importantly, the fact, the more important is the following fact. So I said that. So, I said that Q commutativity of Y variable is specified by this exchange matrix P. So, this operation preserves that relation. So, Y prime variables, again, Q commutes among themselves with structure constants given by B primes, like this. In other words, this mutation is the isomorphism of the quantum torus. That's the point. Now, mutation μK on Y is decomposed into monomial part and dialogue part or automobile part in two ways so that the following diagram becomes computable. So, as I said, given the element in Fy, you can produce another element by mu k like this. So, if you only look at y degrees of freedom, but this claim is still. But this claim states that you can reach the result by this route. So, in two steps, essentially. So, first you just replace yi by yi prime. And then first you apply monomial part, which is defined by this formula. So, there's no summation substruction. You just multiply the monomials according to this. So, by the way, this simple plus is defined by this. is defined by this so this is just monomial but you replace y prime by y so this is a math defined by this and then it is followed by the dialogue part which is adjoint by this dialogue factor so it's defined by this so this is just adjoint epsilon by dialogue but epsilon can be either plus or viral and the claim says that the result of mu k is independent The result of k is independent of the choice of plus and mines. So, the composition of these two steps I denote by mu k star, it's a map in this direction, is called class star transformation. This is going to be a very important building block of our construction. So, class star transformation consists of a monomial path and a joint path, quantum diagrams. So, here is an example. Let's consider the simplest web. Pressed quibba consisting of two points is one narrow like this. So this quiba means that we have a two by two exchange matrix which is anti-symmetric, skew symmetric of this form, and two y variables satisfy this skew commutation relations. And if you apply μ2 by using just this definition, so annotes get reburst. And why variables get changed in this manner? But what I've explained here is it can be reproduced into steps by applying monomial part first and then applying the adjoint by quantum dialogue like this. For example, in the plus choice of the sign, the monomial part changes this one into this, and then applying adjoint by quantum toroidism and using a simple Ricaian relation, you reach a desired output like this. Reach a desired output like this. And here it's a simple. Now, let me introduce the wiring diagrams and FG privacy. So in this figure, the left figure is the wire diagram. It's just three arrows in general position intersecting at three generic points: one, two, and three. And folk content of queer as a And Focke concept of quiver is a kind of dual of the wiring diagram. Namely, you place the vertex of the quiver in the domain of the wiring diagram, like this one, two, three, four, five. And you connect them by a simple announce so that the diagram is filled with the triangles, oriented triangles, like this. So that's the FEG equals. So here is another example of the wiring diagram. Example of the wiring diagram and FGP bulbs. So again, the rule is similar. So the FEGP bars are kind of dual and not filled by oriented triangles. The point is, so FGP mutation and mutations and a braid move. So these two wiring diagrams, later diagrams, are connected by the family well-known braid moves. were non-braid moves. So if you move this allo like Jumbach status, you reach this wire diagrams. But this operation corresponds to the mutation at the point four in the FG quibbles. So somehow FG quibbers are designed in such a way that the blade moves of the wireless entire rooms and the mutation of the quibbers are confounded. So that's a good thing about So that's a good thing about FGP. Now, remember that I said that flash algebras carries y variables. In this case, y variables attached to the nodes of the quibbles, which is a draft diagram. So there are five of them. And as I said, cluster transformation acts in this direction from y primes to y's. And in this case, first the monomial part acts like this, the monomial change. And then I take the adjoint by quantum. And then I take the adjoint quantum diagram and get this. So, this is a cluster transformation in this setting. So, the above transformation of R of the y diagonal satisfy the tilt-hedon. So, let me explain why it is so by diagons. So, again, I'm sorry, this is a bit small, but anyway, so I forgot to say that this construction related to the type A2 efficiency inverse and wire entire. To FVG inverse and wiring diagrams. So essentially, what we do is to embed A2 structure in A3. So now we consider the wiring diagram consisting of four wires. So they are transformed successfully by the braid moves, which I denote by Rijk, like this. And each of these wire anti-fluidizes associated with FG quibbles, which are shown. With the FG reverse, which are shown in black, and they are also compatibly transformed by the mutation μ, μR, like this. So, you can, starting from this figure, you can go like this and to reach this point. And also, you can go from here to take this route to here. So, that means the figure shows that this RIJK satisfied the fetor head on. So, this is a kind of same story that I Kind of same story that I explained in the beginning of my talk. So, this is not so surprising. So, this is follows from the structure of the feature itself. But our upcoming muon theorem is the further step we built. So, this all is just a transformation of the wiring diagram. Now, I move on to the original part of our work. So, that's the embedding between QY arguments. Into QIRGs. So remember that we have wiring diagrams in debt and FGPAS and BRAC, which are connected by braid moves or mutation before. And they are associated with quantum Y variables whose Q computativity is specified exchange matrix, which you can know from by looking at this FG preps. For example, there is There is arrow pointing from one to two. That means this commutation functions. Like this. So this is a kind of quantum for us. But now this Q commutativity becomes automatic if the following parameterization in the following parameterization using Q binal. So I introduce canonical variables P I and U I satisfying this Satisfying this canonical computation relation. So then the exponentials become the generator of the Q-wire algebra with the Q-commuting relation like this. So I use notation that I explained when I show them the field. So the H-band Q is related like this, and lambda or tappas, they are just parameters. And now I parameterize these y variables in this model. Y variables in this model, and also y prime variables in this manner. So there are combinatorial ways to explain this, how to set this parameterization, but I omit it. But anyway, the claim is if I identify y variables on y prime variance as a special combination of the genetic for qy algebras, then this cluster algebra q computativity becomes. Grass algebra Q computability becomes automatic. In other words, we have an embedding of the quantum torus into the Q-wire articles. Now, what's the use of this embedding? So, in this Q-wire algebra parameterization, not only the diloidism part, but also the monomial parts of the cluster transformation, which I do here again, is realized also in an adjoint. Is realized also on an adjoint like this. Here is an example of the calculation of some special generator of the QI argues. So I apply the adjoint P123 to this generator of the QI argues. Then it goes like this, where these underlying parts are treated by so-called BCH flowing, quite simple. And you see that. And you see that adjoint action of the QR generator induces some monomial product of other QR generators, like here. So as I said, that cluster transformation in general consists of the adjoint path and also a diagram adjoint path and also the monomial path. But now the monomial path has But now the monomial part has is expressed as an adjoint. So the cluster transformation μ for star becomes totally an adjoint in this manner. So originally it had this form, but now this monomial part is expressed as an adjoint P. So in total it's adjoint something and this something is R123. It's like this. And if I substitute the QY algebra parameterization, it becomes this one. And this is not It becomes this one. And this is nothing but the solution I showed you in the beginning. So, this is the kind of origin of the solution. But it certainly requires further more work to prove this, the following several. So, as I said, that transfer blade moves, blade moves satisfy the tetrahedron negation. That's a very simple combinatorial observation, but there is some extra work to prove the next. Work to prove the next cell, so which is the one of our main cell. So, this operator R123 satisfy the tetrahedron equation involving spectral parameters. So, that's the kind of first part of our main result. Now, let's move on to the diffraction case. So, now we treat the so-called type C2 case, but the stories are kind of parallel. The stories are kind of parallel, so my expression will be kind of more brief. So, here is an example of the Shi2 Fg Weebar and associated wiring diagrams. So, you have two wires, lead wires, reflected at point two and four. So, this is a reflecting wall. So, if you only look at this lead arrows, you recognize that it's nothing but the conventional diagram for the reflecting. Nothing but the conventional diagram for the reflection equations, which is well known into the quantum integral systems. But now you can associate the Fg privas in the shown manner, where now these Fg pivots are so-called weighted. So there are so-called weight two nodes, and the exchange matrix, which I denote by symbol P, is no longer skew symmetric, but only skew symmetric. So there are some technical details, but which I Details, but which I omitted. But anyway, what you do is kind of parameter. So these two wiring diagrams are connected by the as an interchange of the reflection point. But now what the difference is you cannot connect them by the single mutation. So you need three mutations, mu2, mu5, and mu2. 2, μ 5 and μ. So starting from this Fg quiva, you apply μ and then quiba changes in this manner, and μ 5 and μ, and so on to reach this point. So in terms of wiring darts, it's just a single kind of flip, but in terms of cluster algebras, you need three steps. Remember that we have associated quantum wire variance to the nodes of the viva, which is from one to six. So you have six, quantum. So you have six quantum Y variables, and they are times associated with this figure and this figure. And they are connected by the cluster transformations mu2 star, mu5 star, and mu2 star. Now, the transformation K of the Y M diagrams induce the following cluster transformation. So it's a composition of the three elementary cluster transformations, mu two star, mu five star, and mu two star. star mu5 star mu2 star and which can be assembled in this manner so still it consists of the two parts monomial part and adjoint dihydrism part now let me explain how this k storial transformation k satisfied has to satisfy the 3d diffraction equations so again very So, again, very sorry for the small diagrams. But anyway, what you do is to embed C2 structure into C3. So now you have three deflecting wires coming from the left and reflected at the points three, six, and nine. And what do you do is to try to reverse the order of the reflection total. So this figure proceeds like this. So you go down and then come back. Down and then come back to the top. And then you see that the deflection point is totally fast. In the intermediate step, a certain stage, you just make the blade move of tight wave, which corresponds to the R operation or single mutation in the sense of efficient quick. But at certain points, you have to reverse the order of the diffraction, which is achieved. Which is achieved by this transformation K, and which corresponds to the triple-trop mutation in terms of FGBA, like this. Anyway, there are two ways to achieve the total reverse of the deflection points. So the one way is shown here, left-hand side, and the other way is shown here, right-hand side. Anyway, so pictorially they coincide. So that means the corresponding transformation K and R satisfy the 3D E frequency. Are satisfied the 3D reduction equations. So, this is not again so marvelous. So, it's just a simple consequence of the graphical construction and kind of value of things. But in order to get the solution to the 3D reflection equations, we need some extra. So, remember that the cluster transformation now consists of the three elementary cluster transformations: mu2 star, mu5 star, and mu2. Stamu five style mu2. So the monomial path transforms lifetimes into this form, and then followed by the adjoint action of the quantum diagonalism in this one. And the result is like this. So it's a bit messy. So lambda 0, lambda 1, lambda 2 are kind of non-commutative rational kind of polynomials. And the result is a rational function. Function of the rational combination of these two commuting objects. But we can simplify, kind of describe it as a totally adjoint by introducing again QIL algebra for embedding into it. So remember that in the CTL basic case, we had this situation and we had she. And we had six y variables and their primes connected by this operation. But now I introduce canonical variables or their exponential obeying a Q wire computation relations and parameterize this y's and y primes in this manner. Again, there is a graphical rule how to find this image, but I omitted. Anyway, so you can directly check that this white plane. check that this y primes y y specifies a satisfies a specified q commutativity of this y's or y primes this q commutativity can be specified by looking at these reversals now using this embedding the cluster transformation okay becomes totally an adjoint like this so the essential part is to express a monomial part also as a root That also has a symposium. So that becomes possible by embedding things into QI articles. And this is a result. And this combination is nothing but the solution that I showed in the first part of my talk. So with a bit of more work, you can prove that the KMR here satisfy the 3D diffraction equation. The 3D diffraction education involving spectroparameters like this. So, yeah, at this point, kind of my main part of my talk is over, and the rest is kind of remark. Oops, what's this? Yeah. So this is kind of remark. So the tetrahedron equality has two argument. Equality as q r. So still we have the solution in within the cubile articles, so we can consider the certain specific representation of the cube wide articles. The most natural representation is infinite-dimensional one, defined in this manner. So because what we do is to realize this q-computativity, the natural way is to let exponential p shift the index in the index and exponential u. And the exponential u counts the number of modes like this. So, this is just simply one of the most natural infinite-dimensional representation. It's quite easy to compute the matrix element in this representation, like this. So, in this notation, I mean that ijk is three incoming states and ABC are three outgoing states. So, the matrix element of the R operator. So, the matrix element of the R operator has got six indexes, three incoming and three outgoing. And the result of the calculation is just simple expression like this, where these are electronic derotas and the cap paths are related, cut by the exponential names that I showed you. Yeah, cut plus and named suggest related points. And that's just related by this. And this is Q factorial, but it's natural or it's standard to understand that this Q factorial is diverging when P minus case is negative. So that means R is finite, well defined everywhere for arbitrary value of six indices ranging over integers. Actually, Actually, so due to that divergence of the denominator, so ABCIJK is kind of finite support. Now, we have already proved the tetrahedron equation, so it's now tetrahedron equality, and it's interesting to observe what happens if we substitute this matrix element into the tetrahedron equality in the matrix representation like this. So remember that tetrahedron equation both sides act on the six copies of P, representation space. So there are six outgoing states or components and six incoming states. So they are labeled by A1 through A6 and G1 to C6. And there are intermediate ones, which is a summation over V1 to B6, the summation over Z, but actually it becomes But z, but actually, it becomes a finite sum due to the support property that I mentioned. So, this looks horrible, but if there are two chronic adeltas and support property, so actually both sides becomes well-defined or arbitrary maybe outer instance. And after several steps of simplification, we found that this is result to a certain duality. So, this is distributed into the duality of Q series. Into the duality of Q series under interchange of R and S of this point. So S, T, R are linear combination of this incoming, outgoing, outer indices, Ai's and Gi's, whose concrete form I commit. But anyway, if you observe, inspect these two both sides, two sides, you see that it's interchanged by this interchange of R and S. Interchange of R and S. So somehow this tetrahedron equality is a kind of duality, and which reminds us of certain things, similar things in the Young-Bach equation. So in certain models of 2D quantum integral system, one can associate the supersymmetric Gaussian refuse part channel functions, or in more general sense, indices, reproduce the duality of these objects, reproduce. The duality of these objects reproduced the unbox are equality. So, somehow similar things happen here, which is interesting. Now, so this is one particular representation, but similar duality is present also in the modular double symmetry. We have the matrix elements in both non-compact quantum tiles, a so-called fadif quantum tiles. So-called fadif quantum time origin defined in this manner where the integration avoids a origin from above or something like that. Where this B is essentially the square root of the front constant H1 like this. So duality in that case emerges as an integral identity of integrals, which is also reproduced by an analog classical Heine transform. So somehow this So, somehow, this tetrahedron equality was really diffraction equality, serves as a kind of generator of this classical Heine transformation or Q series duality. That's some interesting consequence. So, future problems. So, this I already mentioned, the possible connections with security in the 3D spacey metric service. And there are some other. And there are some other cases where you can understand the existence of solution using the 3D consistency notation. So it's interesting to observe what's happening, what's the situation in this object, in this new solution, as a future program. And here, my talk was based on the FVG web for and as I mentioned in the beginning, my talk at the BIM servers about the square web and there, but another And there, but another very interesting piece, which is known as butterfly group. So it will be very interesting to do similar work with a butterfly group, which is now kind of on the road. The other thing is to find applications to applications, especially the reduction to the two-dimensional system and what happens if Q is root of VLD, where everything should become the finite-dimensional things. Become the finite-dimensional things. What happens if you send Q to zero, where many things can become computer terms? That will be an interesting future problem. Anyway, the most interesting conclusion of my talk is. Thank you. This is the end.
