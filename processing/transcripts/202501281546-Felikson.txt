this meeting and it's a great pleasure to be here to and it's really a great honor to to be able to give us all here. Now before starting to speak about mathematics I wanted to express my support and my solidarity with two countries, so these Israel and Ukraine, two countries who fight for their existence directly. Find for their existence currently. And now I can get to my topic. So it is three dollars. It is something very personal for me and something we did with Pilot to Mark Info. I mean, when we were still master students, our friends made fun of us that we are meeting COVID to draw three dots. So my talk will be. Look will be in three parts. So, first part will be from that time, groups generated by the rotations. Then, much later, we noticed that these groups are useful to model mutation of queries in the Rank sphere. And finally, there will be some small observations about hyperbolic geometry related to Markov number. But what I need to say is that there will be no big results, that will be just No big results, that will be just a set of pictures. So, yeah, time was working for us, but we're not getting clever, so only this part contains some results for you. So, some differences, just pictures. Okay, so let me start. Group generated by three-pi rotation. So, I have a hyperbolic plane, I can rotate it about the center by the angle of pi, and then By the angle of pi, and then I can take three of these points and do the same about these three points. And I can generate a group with these three rotations. And then I can ask when this group is discrete and how parametrized the group. That question is actually answered in Bird on Geometry of Discrete Groups. To answer the question when the group is discrete, you need The group is discrete, you need to look at the composition of the three rotations. And depending on what it is, you can say, so it is either an elliptical evaluate rotation about some point, or parabolic or hyperbolic. And if it is elliptic, so it rise less than two, then there is one point measured by this composition and this little triangle is income. Okay, so the group is discrete if and only. Okay, so the group is discrete if and only if this rotation is pi over n, and in that case this bit of triangle is a fundamental domain, otherwise the group is not discrete and it's not so. When the group is the element is hyperbolic, in that case there are two points preserved by the composition, so white is red and yellow, and the group is still discrete, but The group is still discrete, but the fundamental domain this time is not compact anymore, so infinite covolium. So it's also not that interesting. And we will be demonstrating on the case when the group is parabolic, the element is parabolic, so there is just one point on the boundary preserved by the composition of these rotations, and then this is ideal prior to the Ideal prior is the fundamental domain of the group. So let's look at this fundamental domain. We have actually seen it many times uses today. So when I take this working space, I get a sphere with three orbifold points and one cast. And if I will take um a double carbon, I will uh I will have a um a torus with with one punch. So the same parts we are looking all the time here. Are looking all the time here. And one can still ask how to parametrize the surfaces. And of course, we want to parametrize them up to isometry of hyperbolic space. So we don't care how this triangle is embedded into hyperbolic plane. So we can uh assume that this x, y, z is actually uh zero, infinity plus. So the stand put this triangle as a standard. Rendle as a standard, and after that, there are not much freedom. So, then the question is: really, like I fix two points on two sides, P1 and P2, and then the question is where to place P3 so that the composition will be parabolic. The composition of the three rotations. It is not difficult to check that this composition is parabolic only, so there is one and only one point on this line, such that the composition. On this line, such that the composition of these three rotations is parabolic, and we can actually find this point geometrically. In particular, if I will put this plane P1, P2, into a perhaps line like this, vertically, it is sort of clear that the third point should lie on some equidistant curve because the product of rotations in P1 and P2, we just Rotations in P1 and P2, which is some hyperbolic translation along this line, and it does not really know where these two points on this big distance sit here or there. So you can translate along this equidistant line, which would mean like you sit on some equidistant line. And if I will embed it back into the picture, so this is the line P1, P2, and this is the equidistant line, which is tangent to the Tangent to the other side of the triangle because I want an equist line which exactly intersects at one point. So what does it mean? It is tangent. It means that when you look at a distant line, if you draw a perpendicular from some point, it will hit the distant line perpendicular, which means that time. Perpendicular, which means that I am also hitting perpendicular here, and it is actually a common perpendicular of this blue line, P1, P2, and this line YZ. So it is a common perpendicular of these two lines. Which means, so this is the way to construct the pollet P3. So I draw the line P1, P2, and draw a common unique common. Draw a common a unique common perpendicular, but this is not all what we can say. Because if I draw now all three of them, so all of these three things, they are common perpendiculars to the corresponding pairs of lines, in particular their altitudes in these blue triangles. And they do intersect at some point. Okay, so in hyperbolic geometry, not always three. Always uh uh three uh uh for for some triangles uh this point may be well at the boundary or maybe it's uh even uh this common these perpendiculars can um and never meet each other and then they have a common perpendicular line. But it's not a problem in the sense that if I redraw the so the whole story in the clay model, then both these pictures and the intermediate one went The intermediate one line at this point is the boundary will be retold in the following way. So you to be perpendicular to this line xy and pass through one is the same as to look. So you look at the tangent lines at x and y, to the the tangent to the circle and take their intersection and you need to connect with y. So this is the perpendicular to x to y. So this is the perpendicular to xy. Now you draw the script uh perpendicular, so you get one point. Uh so uh even i when they don't meet uh and do something like this, there is still a point outside of the model where they meet. So what we got so far, we got that the points of this green triangle, big green triangle, correspond to triangle corresponds to triples P1, P2, P3 this parabolic this parabolic product. And it is this correspondence is very easy to reconstruct. In one side we just drop a perpendicular and uh get uh the point of intersection and the in the other po uh uh direction you just connect and become structured. Just connect and become structures in this point. Now this is the tech Muller space of these groups and one can ask which of them really give different groups and which of them give the same. Okay, so we can look at a very natural move. So if you have a group generated by T1, tau1, tau, tau2, and tau3. Tau one, tau, tau two, and tau three. Once you can replace one of them by conjugating it with a different uh with another one. What does it mean? It means that instead of rotation with respect to this point, you rotate with respect to that point. And obviously, you get exactly the same goal, you have different set of generations. So one can in theory, instead of doing this, one could do a little bit differently. One could change T2 by conjugating T3. But I will call these two things the same because they coincide up to isometry of the whole hyperpoly space. So I don't want to say that they differ. So I said that there is just one way. That there is just one way to use to change in direction three, so conjugating one or conjugate in two, whatever you want, which means that we are getting a tree. So starting from some generals, we can transform it in direction one, two, and three, and so on. You are getting the same tree as we have seen in many talks today. Now, in which sense it is. Now, in which sense is before that, let me just notice that when I look at this picture, triangles inside this small triangle in the thread area, they are acute triangle triangles, with equitangles. And at the boundary, they are right-angled, and everything else is obtuse-angled. So, if I take a point somewhere. I take a point somewhere here, uh with uptuse angles. Then I can so uptuse angles that you draw the line, very uptuse. Then I apply my move by conjugating this point with respect to that. So I get something like this. The two distances are the same, and one is shorter. So if I started with up to So, if I started with up two strands, I can make my triple smaller. So, which means that if I apply these moves many times, since my group is discrete, I cannot make it smaller and smaller um uh unlimitedly at at some point I will arrive to to the to this red area of equity book turns. Area of equitable triangles. So I conclude that this area of red this red area is the model space. So now I see you are completely bored with all this geometry, so let me finally connect to Markov numbers. So what I was not really doing, so let me draw my triangle and compare with what I get after this. After this move, and I can write cosine law in blue triangle and cosine law and red triangle, and then when I adopt them, this cancels. And what I get, this sum equation, which already can remind you something. Namely, if I make this change of coordinates, and if I assume that they satisfied this equation, then after the change of coordinates, they After the change of coordinates, they will be again satisfying this equation. So, what we really were doing was a model from Markov numbers. It is the Markov triple 333 is just the symmetric one, like when you take all the points in the centers. And it is not difficult to check that every other triple in Every other triple in uh in that uh triangle will satisfy the same equation. So what what we just did is we parametrized um these points we parametrized the Markov terra by a point on on on this picture or so with minimal solutions for uh this Solutions for this equation by pointing the small parameters. But Markov numbers correspond to. So if you take integral solutions, you get rotations which are a finite border or because you have the whole. If you start from the point in the center one, which gives one one three three three, which gives three three three, then after Then, after applying Vietamus, you will get some points in this green area, each of them the distances, so hyperbolic, two hyperbolic signs, so distances will be marked numbers. So, distances. So, this is the end of the first story. We have to publish it because we didn't find any way to use this. We didn't find any way to use this, like a drastic picture, not missing us. So, we since we did not know how to continue that, we started to do something different. But, sort of many years later, when we were doing Western algebra, we realized that the same picture can be used for modeling mutation of quivers of RAN3. So, a quiver for NIV basically. A quiver for me will be an oriented graph with today just with three vertices, and I don't allow loops, and I only want one arrow each direction, but my arrows are with weights. And unlike normal people, I allow any real weights in there. So I'm not restricted to integer numbers. Now, P rule Z direction means the same as minus. Direction means the same as minus B in the other direction. And now I have the motation rule, which is very similar to what we were told yesterday, except that I have collected two steps in one. So what is my role? When you want to motate at this vertex, you need to change the direction of this torus P and Q. So we change the direction. And for the other vert uh one, you just replace it with P. it with PQ minus R arrows. Notice that I made this quiver using this rule I can make this quiver like a ridge if I don't care whether this is zero or negative. And then I draw a ridge quiver here and recompute our line using this formula. This formula is very nice in the sense that it immediately suggests that it is That it immediately suggests that it is similar to Mark numbers, and also it is similar to reflections to the formula of reflection. So, this is just a small example for B3. Normally, one uses some diagrams, but one can symmetrize and just do this rule instead. And I will also need two definitions. So, the equivalent is called motational. A quiver is called mutationally acyclic if one can mutate it to some quiver containing no oriented cycle. No oriented cycle is positive or zero entrance. And if whatever you do to your privilege, you always have an oriented cycle, then it's called mutation in the cycle. Now, where you said mutation. means you can mutate it so that there are no aretal cycles so you can basically motate it to this or to something where all arrows are looking from left to right so and amutation itself means whatever you do it's there is always excitement now Now, when it is mutationally cyclic, it was shown by Baroj Gezelvinsky for finite type and by spiral and Tromas in general that one can model the situations by using the group generated by reflections. Moreover, so I'm speaking now about RAND 3, but this part of the story holds the many. This part of the story holds a manual. You can have a big quiver. If it is like if you start with acyclic seed, then you can do the following. So you can find, you can take some space. So in this case, I draw a hyperbolic picture, but in general, it might be Euclidean or spherical. You can find some space where Some space where each of your vertices is represented by some hyperplane, and the distances between your hyperplanes are obtained from the number of arrows by this formula. Uh okay, if the number of arrows is small, like one, uh there is uh it's impossible to make this distance, but then it it represents the angle between those two. And the angle between those between those hump points. And if you set homocyclic representative like this one, you will get some equitable domain like this one. So here it is a sort of a triangle domain, but without the purpose. Now, what do you do? You want to motivate the fiber and at the same time change the generators of your group. Generators of your group that change the set of the upper planes. And what you do when you want to motivate in direction I, so say in direction of this yellow, you will need to reflect all hyperplanes which are trails of your arrows. For example, here, when I motorate in the direction of this yellow hyperplane, I want to reflect the trails of arrows coming to here. So this is the first thing. To here, so this is the third thing to the trio. I reflect this and I preserve everything else. And the miracle is that after the mutation, the distances will still correspond exactly by the same formula to the number of arrows in your quiver. So you start to mutate your quiver and do this change to the hupper planes, and the distances between the hupper planes are always the same as the numbers on the On the field, or on the errors. That was a model for mutational acyclic case, and it was quite useful, but there was no model for mutationally cyclic one. And it turns out that for this, you can do exactly the same, but using the group generated by pi rotations, rotation by pi with respect to three points. And what you And what you really do, you do the same. So now the distances between these points correspond to weights on the arrows, when the quiver is minimal in the motation class, so the numbers on the arrows are minimal positive. You have an equitangle triangle, and then you start to apply this by rotations, uh change the generators like we did. The generators like we did, and the distances still correspond to what they were before motivation. So this model sort of was something useful, unlike everything else in my talk, because using these two models we were able to classify all so first rank three quivers of finite mutation. Three quivers of finite mutation type, so producing finitely many different quivers with non-intensive weights, and then using that more generally in any run. So this work was usual, but again, not for Markov numbers making. Now let me connect a little bit more to Markov numbers. So given around three quer, one can ask, is it mutation a large cyclic? And the question was answered by Mr. Bruce Lichile. They say compute Markov constant. So P squared, P squared plus R squared minus P R from this quiver. And this Markov constant is mutation invariant, so you mutate the quiver and the constant is always the same. And this constant do know Constant do know whether your previous notation is cyclic or notation acyclic. What we noticed is that this constant actually knows a little bit more about your query, namely if it is the query's mutation acid, this constant exactly knows which space you use for your reflection presentation. Yeah, my slides are already on my web page, so you don't need to. Yeah. Okay. Uh uh so uh if the mutation uh a a cyclic, you you just uh this one tells you whether it is uh whether the reflection group acts on the sphere nuclei plane or hyperbolic plane, and whether it is mutation cyclic, the same uh constant tells you whether this product of that three. Product of that three. So now you present represent pi three pi rotations, and you have this product of the three rotations, and the group exactly tells you whether this product is hyperbolic, parabolic, or addictive. And so, okay, some observations, I don't know, but they want me to use because of for anything, but I still have it. So I probably have about five minutes of. So far, in all my stories, I was sitting on this model where you measure the distance between the points. So I can link this to the torus and still measure the lengths of closed geodesics. In this story, this is the equation and the Equation and the Markov numbers correspond to the number of errors in the mutation class of this river, and also the lambda lenses of closed geodesics, so proportional cosines of this closed geodesics. Now, for the rest of the talk, I will switch to the story where you measure the lambda lenses of arcs, the curves from afar. Parks with the curves from the cast to itself on the same torus, so three times longer this equation. And now, Markov numbers are cluster variables in the case of cluster algebra and lengths of the R's. So I have a number of pictures we which we uh have seen today and yesterday in in in some way, but maybe I I don't need to go in details. Need to go in detail, so I have this question. Basically, I have this correspondence to lambda lenses. And what I want to do is basically to retell several very known properties in terms of geometry. So I don't know, probably everyone can do that, but let me still show you a couple of pictures. Namely, Every arc on Mark of Toros leads to something on hyperbolic plane, so something coming from infinity to POVQ. So by Q is the Markov number, and POVQ is Markov fraction following voice. And given an arc on the torso, one can uniquely construct the triangulation in which gamma is the. Triangulation in which gamma is the Longen R. So we get this, immediately get the central relation of unit misconjectures of given a Markov number only one of r from infinity to pure q max to a simple r. So this we have today several times. But now notice that if q over q is a mark of fraction, then the arc Then the arc of POVQ passes through one of these centers. So symmetry points, image of the initial three points. And because this was the case in the initial triple, and then we preserved that every time when we did the smooth or the change of generators. Now, if I have two different mark of Uh mark of uh numbers with the same denominator, my mark of uh fractions with the same denominator. Notice that uh the horosphere sit in these points, they are of the same size, which means that the center will sit on the same height because it is on the same distance from the horizon at infinity and to this small horror square, which means that we just have another. That we just have another formulation: that for any given height, there should be only one point of symmetry between when you move from zero to one half. I mean, I am just retelling the same thing, but I sort of like this picture with different point points on different, yeah. Yeah. Uh uh uh pretty useless, but okay. And finally I want to reformulate a couple of uh statements from uh Karet Schiffler, namely connecting to continuous fractions. Namely, continued so what they say, they say continuous fraction to for P over Q is palindromic. What does it mean for us? It means that it comes. Does it mean for us? It means that it comes from somewhere to somewhere. There is a center between obviously crossing pattern is the same on both sides because the symmetry with respect to this point preserves both ferritis relation and fourth cycles and swaps is infinity with this point of P over Q. So then the statement that this continued fraction only contains Continued fraction only contains ones and twos. Suppose it contains three, so like it would cross at least three triangles like this. We can move this point to infinity. Something crossing three triangles like this. But also we had this curve from Pure VQ, Kerman, and by symmetry we have a similar curve after example. After exactly three triangles. So if I cross three triangles, I will be forced to cross either this or that. So if I have a non-crossing, non-self-crossing curve, I definitely need to be my job ones and tools. And the last one, so the last result is that if you have You have given a Markov number, it is a sum of two squares for some integers. And when you take the fraction of these two squares, it is exactly the half of the spelling drone, like this. So what does it mean for us? So given a Markov number, a Markov number is an uns is some l uh Markov uh fraction com uh coming to some P over Q. Coming to some POVQ. And there was a center, and through every center on this picture, there is a unique arc of the Faraday graph coming through the center. Let's consider this unique arc. If I take this arc and map it to zero infinity and then look at where this pyramid cube goes, it is not difficult to compute. oh, it is not difficult to compute it, it it goes exactly to S over V where S and V are the denominators of the endpoints of this R. And finally, if I look at the continued fraction for this S over V, so this continued fraction, what does it cross? Obviously it crosses exactly the same things as here because I just applied isometry. Applied isometry. So what does it cross here? It is listed exactly in the second half of this polynomial. So we get that dismissing. This is more or less all I had, except that, I mean, it's very frustrating to give a quote without results. So let me give you one result which is a little bit related, but not very directly. So when we are on Markov tours, what do we have? We have all arts have been. We have all arcs have integer lambda lengths, and there is a triangulation where all arcs are of vertically length one. Is it the case on all surfaces? So if all arcs are integer, is it true that there is a triangulation with all arcs of length one? This question is normally formulated in terms of freeze freezes. So a freeze on the surface is a map from art to positive. From parts to positive integer real numbers satisfied all polymer relations and ones from the boundary. So, satisfied polymer relations is a combinatorial way to say that we have a map from hyperbolic surface. So it's equivalent. And a phrase is called unitary if there exists a triangulation where all parts are mapped to one, one can ask. To one. One can ask whether for every surface all freezes are unitary and conveyed and Cochster answered yes for a disk. Then it turned out much later that for punctured disk the answer is no. Then wonder. Then Ganavan Schifler said yes for all of us because it is interconnected and anagari. And Anna Garcia, we looked at a pair of paths also, yes. But then, together with Spiral, we looked again at this case and at the snow and understood that the snow is not very serious. The snow comes from having a punch, and in a punch, you have some horosphere. If you rescale this horosphere, it turns out that you still have. You have you are able to find to get all ones. And then we started to look at more general surfaces and for surfaces having a boundary, we were able to get the positive answer, modular rescaling of the horospheres in the parameters. And if you have no boundaries situated. No boundary, the situation looks m a little bit more difficult. So we are only able to do the case when there is a triangulation where all lenses are pairs co-prime, then also the positive ones. But in general, we don't know what to do here. Now, one can easily derive from here that all freezes on one bunch of tours are almost unitary, so I did this. This is a completely different. I did this, this is a complete detailed proof. But on the other hand, we don't need to do this because on function drawers you can just apply this process of making everything shorter and shorter like this and to just arrive to see that the only possib possibility is one-on-one. And this is the thank you. Questions? There are, maybe we can save them for a five-minute break. We'll be back at 4.30. Thank you, Arnie.
