So we had some discussion with Nicole at at breakfast, and maybe other people have talked about this too. It would be nice to see whether you can have a transition between whether string theory can smoothly move a field theory axion to a string axion and vice versa. Whether this is possible at all. And our impression in the discovery, our feeling at breakfast with Nicole, was probably not, you know, different things. But if so, then you should. But if so, then you should be able, in the field theory context, very generously at real scale, to say what is the distinct feature which makes one thing and other thing and it can't be connected. And I don't have such criteria at the moment. Because you don't, below the scale at which the radial mode moves, you just don't know whether it's going to be a field or string axial. So I think can we continuously connect a field to A field theory to a string axiom, like continuously in the sense of modular space or string theory. Maybe even not modular space, maybe that's too much to ask, off-shell moduli space, you know, going, if you wish, over some barrier, but continuously in the sense of cohortism. So one thing is the same series as the other. Then take a series with a string axion, attach a label to the degree of freedom to the axion, and move it somehow continuously to a model where the same degree of freedom is the string axion. As a string axial. Okay, maybe there's too much to ask, but if and maybe this is not true, not possible, but then we could identify the issue that prohibits it. I have a simple question here. Where is it? What's the good nomenclature? So many people name these things differently. P-form axion, stringy axion, closed string axion, exponential axions. The other field theory axions. Well, it's kind of silly because field theory is everything. It's kind of silly because field theory is everything, and everything is a field theory axiom, right? It's model building open string axiom, but that excludes. I mean, why would they call something a model an open string axiom, which is just, you know, standard scalar field? What about PQ axiom? PQ axiom. She's axiom, yeah. For the first one, for the first one. Also, the open screen axiom as the most interesting thing to do. Make sense because nothing's pretty much fine. Exactly, yeah. Well, heterobotic, but it's heterobic. Well, right, you're right, you're right. Even in heterobotic models, I realize a metric-based axion. It's silly to call it an open three axion, because I know the strings there. But we could say a U1 axiom and a P formaxia, there's not a global U1. I mean, I feel like the fundamental distinction is that the field theory, open stream, whatever axions have the U1 PQ symmetry, whereas the extra-dimensional stream closed stream ones. Yeah, but don't they have the isn't the PQ symmetry the shift of this axion? Isn't that maybe higher form at zero or axiom? I want to say complex a phase axis. A phase axiom, a complex phase axiom for but it seems to me somehow that English-wise it's not so synchronized, but I'm not a native speaker, I cannot find it. But that's the clear thing, though. One is a phase, in terms of as a phrase, it's as good as anything. Okay, okay, but let's talk. Okay, I just wanted to raise this issue. I've tuned a lot of PQ action and phase action both sound good. Face action both sound good, it extends the list name. Maybe we can agree on something. Here, I would personally think that T From Action is the right thing, personally. Because this is, you know, I mean, that's I have a preference. Here I don't prefer T from the main difference, at least from the cosmologic point of view, that would be the main kind of difference between the two things. I could assume symmetry restoration also depending on the scale. There is the possibility of having symmetry restoration, whereas for a design to stand for a closed string action, that would never be available no matter what the scale of the place. I think it's a very dalec and very precise point. But what how can you translate this in an A? If you symmetry restorable axion, yeah, but the point is from the phase axion, it's clear enough because the phase you only get with a radium. That's true. When you have a radium mode, the potential is finite you can have. I didn't want to distract too much from science. I just thought it was. Okay, good, good, good, good. So now comes, okay. So now comes okay, let's be a little more serious again. So um if one could convince oneself, which I maybe think favorably of, that option one can always be viewed as fine-tuned or somehow contrived, then I would like to, that this is maybe at our traitors clear, that the discovery of a TCT or other axiom, just the discovery of this axion, is actually evidence of string theory in the 10-piece colour. Can you quickly flash the options again? Because now I'll be lost to try and go. The options were very field-theoretic fundamental. I mean, phase and P4. I just say, okay, phase, as far as I know, I don't know that yet, but after more research, phase is always somehow contrived or modeled or whatever. So if we see an option at all, it evidence for string theory. In the same way, maybe slightly weaker, that we would have. Maybe slightly weaker, that we would have argued the discovery of Suzy LHC as the LHC would have been evidence for strange theory. Okay, that's that's maybe I'll trace. Do you have a comment on this? Yeah, so do you really need the minimum structure of this, or you can do it in any extent theory where you put some? Oh, I just meant in a higher dimensional regime. I mean, if you I don't mind if you do directly from 11 or you go first to six, I meant the p-frol axio needs higher dimensions. So then, conversely, the observation of post-inflationary relics, you know, hexion mini costs would be an argument against the string inflation in the GM. Well, it would not be a. It would be a missed opportunity in the same way that Nazi enthusiast sees a missed opportunity. But it's not excluded because things you yeah, I know what you mean, but it's not, but it kind of emphasizes the It kind of emphasizes the importance of looking for that. Yeah, yeah, I completely agree. I agree. I think this point is, of course, known to all of the experts, but maybe not known beyond our windows so much that really this is something hopefully, I mean, we'll actually see that. I will actually weaken my claim at the moment. But you could naively think, okay, we have this beautiful idea, the different functions, they couple the right way to gauge theories. That's a hint of strings here. Although, on the mini-clusters thing, I was just hearing in one of the breaks. Mini clusters thing. I was just hearing in one of the breakout sessions that there's other ways to form mini clusters, even from closed string axions, for example. I mean, maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, but they might have a different mass function. They may still be distinguishable from the classic post-stationary thing. But it gives us a lot of things. Like I was curious about this. If you start very close to a hilltop or something, then you can get these overdose space. Well, those things prop mini clusters proper. Things proper many lists proper, which have a particular spectrum and so on. If I can interrupt, Dottie, can you give us a taxonomy of Axion monks? I have struggled with this because I've heard mini clusters, mini halos, asteroids, favorite. Is there an agreed upon like these? I don't think that's the only one. So I would say mini clusters and the things that come from come from strip from strip cosmic stream decay. Cosmic screen decay and have a very particular spectrum and very particular set of concentrations and so on. Then there are things called mini halos, which you can have in any kind of model, which are just like extra clumpy stuff. But they're a virionized object, so they have like random phases and so on inside. And then there's coherent objects, like axiomatic stars, which are different again, and they live inside halos. So mini clusters, very specific thing. Anything else that's sort of like that, but not that specific thing. Like that, but not that specific thing. Mini halo or ultra-compact mini halo. Coherent object, that's your star. Thank you. I will attempt to use the correct language in that one. Okay. Okay, so as you've already noticed, I personally prefer a lot option two, the Pform axion, but there are But there are, of course, known problems and challenges also in this context. So it is non-trivial to realize the preferred value of F much smaller than M plan. And so why F to B much smaller than M plan? So my main argument for this, I think most people agree, is that we don't want to produce too much dark metal. I will quantify this. At the moment, I just let me accept that this is something desirable and let's see what could. And see what can be done about this. And the standard approach, of course, is to go to a large volume. This has been the big insight of Joe Condon's work directly about the same time as the more skeptical paper of Sushek and the Witten. And so how does it work? If you simply have basically a Plumb squared being the volume by complication logic, very general, then you have alpha s being a Then you have alpha s being one over the cycle of which the brain housing QCT lives. And this is something order one order order order 20, so let me take order one for now. And so hence, because locally there is no other scale, f is m stringed. And so we automatically get this crucial relation. It's just, you know, right in your face in a two-line derivation. And the idea is you have a big colour VR, you have a small size. The idea is: you have a big collaborator, you have a small cycle. This is something not available in having much context. This was a new insight of this paper. So then we have this very rough estimate, and we need a large volume to have a small F. One can make this more explicit in concrete settings in type 2B, even more concrete in the LBS. I will not be. My time will not allow it. Now, of course, the question is: how bad. How badly do we really want this? Obviously, we can live with large f-axions. And the other question is: how unique is the solution that this is one of those theoretical volume? Can we have other solutions of this problem? And so, one thing that comes to mind and has been discussed is warping. But this is technically not easy to realize. So, I'm not aware, I mean, I didn't look too carefully at this paper. I didn't look too carefully at these papers, but I have the feeling that this is very challenging. And maybe this is another challenge for somebody who wants to, a real challenge, to show that small F for a P-form axion can really be realized to walk in. And I personally feel that, yeah. I don't know of any good approaches, to be very honest. Maybe having a cycle of which you actually deep in a way. Cycle which you actually lift deep in a warped throat. But that, first of all, it somewhat defeats the purpose because if you have the volume and throat and then cycle in the throat, then you already separate the volume from the throat. I mean, warping can enhance this effect, but somehow you are using the old idea of converging. In addition, I don't know that we have good warped throats, sufficiently interesting model-building, suitable cycles, bottom-up throats. This has been discussed as an idea, but nobody has geometry special. But nobody has geometries, I think. Do we know how to mark on one side with one another? Yeah, that's just my point. I mean, the fact that it's warped, the fact that it's warping will decrease F, I think, is always by dimensional analysis. But we don't have a geometry with a warped throat, with a four-cycle in the throat, and you don't need just a four-cycle, you need enough structure there to have a persecutive brain, standard model, et cetera. It seems to be challenging. If you want to do this, it will be better to use two cycles. It would be better to use two cycles. Those are more easily localized than the throat. All cycles, I don't see how you get a whole full cycle throat. Well, it could be other throats. I mean, who fuses a cannon trustworthy is the only thing. I mean, you remember, there has been this set of papers. I only remember Angelo Wangel, but there are other papers, other people on these papers, trying to build Alstandoch models for the singularity and then argue that they are somehow a cone which warps down and the second. Which warps down, and the second one is singularity, and the cone is very different from T11, or T11 cone. And this effort has somehow died down. Do those ever have an exponential working? The ones that were ABS? I have never been convinced that these oranga staff since have exponential working. But when I talked to them, they always said, Oh, sure, it will be no problem. So I'm not convinced. That may be my ignorance. I mean, this. Can I say something? I think this paper that you are showing here is not I think they don't do working. What do they do instead? So this is in the context of epiductic strings and what they do is in some region of modular space the fighter is smaller than what you would expect and you can get filter reactions with lower. Okay, sorry then I'm not easier to be but I can't say it's cool. Well I I know I mean in heterotic I mean so once you have a heterotic M-series then of course the non-services embedding then of course you have one E8 here, one E8 here, the geometry between the two changes in a non-trivial way. And I would call them all scrolling. That has been suggested I think in this Richard Written paper as well. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm not sure how much they. I think what they do is different. Maybe even different. Huge difference. Maybe even different warping. Let me replace this by warping and other. Okay, so you see my question is modeling. Maybe this is secretly the same thing, but not in a strand theory context, but in a theory of a large extra dimension. If you have a standard model rate on which the axion is localized, then it's natural that the decay constant of that axion is bounded by the higher dimensional planet. So if that thing is much smaller than the four dimensional, then I'll cut it. Absolutely. Yes. I agree. I agree. But we would call this still voping in the border. Yeah, it's good. Okay. So let's now focus on this large volume option. So in the KKLT context, sorry, I will not show you KKLT. I mean, most people don't know what KLTH is. So this appears kind of hopeless because Because tau is only logarithmically large. On the other hand, as we know from the work of the Cornell group, and we have heard talks, of course, here on this very interesting work by Jako mainly reported on this, I think. Um large volume can appear due to uh just a large number of cycles, so this this the cycle is large, even all the T's can be small. Large, even all the T's can be small. So, there are certainly options to pursue this in the KQT context. There's an obvious option, maybe more obvious in the LBS context where the volume is exponentially large just by the stabilization mechanism. It's basically exponentially large in one over GS. But we all know that there is a big issue of perturbative stabilization of the axion carrying cycle in these contexts. So this is just nothing new. I just remind you of stuff that yes we discussed. I just remind you of stuff that has to be discussed at length during the conference. Okay, so maybe let me skip this. I wanted to remind you that what the complexity is that you have to go through if you want to really implement it in the large volume scenario, for example. There you have, of course, a large volume which will in the end be responsible for small f. In the end, be responsible for small f. You have to have a small cycle as part of the stabilization mechanism of the large volume scenario, and you have a medium-sized cycle which is to be loop stabilized, which is the one carrying the axion. And this loop stabilization is something which is hard to quantitatively control. Basically, people write down formulae based on roughly what the potential generated by loops could be. Let me not go to this quite too much. Let me directly go to the questions. So it appears to me, based on what I just said, that beyond the initial very positive claim about the genericity of stringing axions, we immediately get what I would say entangled and modeled dependent details. And of course, it looks very nice, and no criticism at all. I mean, what Andrea has just reported, and what Jakob reported, and what Liam's group is doing, what you have done, to just study the options. But of course, Options, but of course, in the end, we all know it will become very dirty once we ask what the actual stabilization mechanism of the cycle is. So the question is, is this unavoidable? Can we make diasm generic claims? And also, maybe I'm the negative here, maybe this is not a curse, but maybe it's a positive feature of Him freedom in the sense that you actually learn about the high-dimensional origin of some of the model by discovering the axiom. Because, I mean, it's a so if, unless we are making. It's a so, if unless we are missing other options, that's a highly non-trivial insight, right? Imagine we see axion, convince ourselves that this is axion, it's p-form axion. Then we have a cycle carrying the model in a perturbative stabilization regime at high energy somewhere. That's also very impressive. Okay. But this has been discussed a lot, so I do not insist that we discuss it again, but maybe somebody has final words, comments on this story. Comments on this story. Okay, good. Then I'll take it that I summarize this roughly correctly. Okay, so let me add now some more cosmology details. Again, following this work of Michel World Bosch Motivus, which I cited at the beginning. So a key cosmological bound is, of course, that you don't want to exceed the dark matter density by the oscillating coherent oscillation. The oscillating, coherently oscillating axiom. And this, in a very well-known formula, I mean, I oversimplified here slightly, looks like that. So we have basically if we have theta i, the initial value of the absolute order one, and f tech over twelve, then we roughly get the right amount of dark matter. And then if you can you're allowed to exceed the scale of f by a lot, but then Buy a lot, but then the price that you have to fine-tune the initial value of zeta, and so now you have to argue between your desire to be optimistic in your conscience whether you can say, okay, that's still a nice axiom model, because this is, say, 10 to the minus 3 or something. Yes. That's the formula for the QCD oxygen, more or less. Not the one for like a generic light key form oxygen. I mean, then the powers were different, and there was the mass of QCC. That's a QCD oxygen, yes. Let's use the option, yes. I'm focusing on the upside. You're right. Oh, oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're right, of course, yeah. Okay, then this agriculture, sorry, sorry for the typos. It should be f to some of the power that. It should be f to some of the power that's rated to be seven over six. I don't remember. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think the formula is. I mean, this is F t is incorrect, I think. If you assume it's all the dark? Yes, I assume it's all the dark metronome. You assume a different power of F enters if you are using a fraction dark matter. And then the dimension comes from. We'll come to that. We'll come to that. Yes, yes, yes, yes. So I'm assuming now it's all the dark metron. Then I have this very strong bound on H. Very strong bound on h. And then I also use now that we combine these things to derive a kind of skeptic problematic conclusion. Then f is 1 over square root of volume, as I just argued. And then I take this here and invert it, because I don't want to exceed theta better abundance. So I say, okay, theta has to be smaller than 10 to the 12 over F. I can allow large F, but at the price of small theta. At the price of a small theater. And then, all together, taken together, this tells me that no matter what I do, independently of the tuning, hi has to be smaller than 10 to the 9, roughly G. I cannot exceed that. And it becomes worse if the volume becomes large. Now I decouple, I already decoupled the volume of the axion. So independently of whatever F is. This this is a strong constraint. I mean, nothing wrong with it. I mean, nothing wrong with it. We can have, and this is not even a very low-scale inflation. This is, I would call, moderate-scale or medium-scale inflation. But from a stringy fundamentalist perspective, it's a high price to pay, because I'm not aware of any good models which easily give you low-scale inflation. Because naturally, you know, the high-tuning problem of flat potential becomes worse and worse the lower you scale. So now there's a positive thing to add to this. Positive thing to add to this. Yes, which is if we detect the axion and then we go and measure the isocurvature, which if isocurvature is saturating the bound for a Planck, we can go measure isocurvature by measuring, you know, improving measure of voltage B-modes, blood-scale structure, and then you detect the QCDX here. If you measure its mass, you know, brain tells us it's 10 to the 12 GeV, and I detect actual curvature. I know what its inflation is. And the proof of it is it's much smaller scale than the It's much smaller scale than the 10 to the scale ratio. 10 to the scale ratio, you H plus the 10 to the 40 G Z, you improve it by the fact that you, that would be very impressive. That would be natural. Totally agree. Totally agree. All the negative things, of course, can be turned into positive things by actually seeing the bounding effect. This must be very stupid, but I'm still confused. I thought, I mean, I agree with Nicole that 10 to the 5 better be something other than 10 to the plus 5, right? Than 10 to the plus 5, right? But with 10 to the minus 5, do you really get the 10 to the 9? Does it look like it to me? I think it works. I checked this formula just before. Let me say, okay. So I thought you would actually know this formula better by heart than me. He substitutes F is one of our squared volume only with the numbers. And then that gets to be the five fourths. Five twenty-fourths. And then the powers of GeV come out differently. Come out differently. You're saying is F sim one over squared volume that there's a there's some power there's an inflank that needs to curvature depends on the initial angle it's just that the minimalized curvature because it depends on how much of the dots. No, for can dark matter. If you have a light scalar field or an inflation, then you make it a standard. This woman is a standard. But if you're not the dark matter, then the amplitude in the CMP is surprised. I apologize. The amplitude is perturbation in the CMP. The amount of curvature is proportional to the amount of dark matter that's the other thing. I'm saying you predict the amount of stuff that you make because isogrammatic perturbations are going to tell you how much stuff there is. I'm pretty convinced there's this formula that is right onto paper. In the sense of setting the minimum bound for theta. Yeah. Right. Theta. Yeah. Right, but for the but if you're in the regime where h is less than f, then that is subdominant to the contribution from theta, unless theta is very small. So there's an extra bit that Arthur should have written, which is true. Theta is quite close expectation of H, but if H is 10 to the 9 G, theta actually is exactly, this is written just minus 5. That's the other one? And it should be a less blank, but there's. It's a dimension 1 on both sides. There's no implants there. It's all dimension 1. Yeah. It's functional. It's just the only type of here. Here's a fuller. But then the other round is story? It doesn't, I don't know, maybe I did it wrong, but if I substitute for the F one over square volume with no M planes or anything, just as written, and you put the other stuff together, you get it 10 to the 7 GeV from the 712th power. GeV from the 712th power of 10 to the 12th, and then you get, it's like a minus 5 or a plus 5, but 7 plus and minus 5 does not give you 9. 10 to the 12, this being 10 to the 12, this being 10 to the 12, 10, this gives you 10 to the 10, right? I mean, 10 to the 9, but there was a volume of volume there. No, no, it's perfectly nine. But okay, I mean, this is what you're going to do, yeah. You're trying to get what the number why the number is, right? If you put an F1, I guess what Neil's trying to say is that in the F formula, there has to be some masculine on the right hand side. Sorry, where do we want Fascinating? This is the mention of the next slide. The F formula should be unplanned over scale. Oh, this is overpoly. Yeah, okay, sorry, sorry, yeah. Okay, sorry, sorry. Yeah, and now I understand the point. So here, it's inconsistent because everybody is unique here, VI is getting. Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. This is F of M plan. Yeah, and then there's a 712, so 10 to 18, and that's something. No, this is no. This is sorry, this is for sorry, now you're making me look too bad. There's a minus here, everything else is correct. Except that's here. Yes. Basically, the mask is M. But basically the mask here is M plum to the five twelfth times ten to the twelve GV to the seven twelve and that you have to put together and this gives ten to the five. Exactly. The five twelve. That's the power of M plant. Yes, okay, okay, okay. This is a simple class discussion. Yes, I agree. So here and here and here should be on plan. But this is somehow okay, so so a half trivial, but I think important result of which we wrote in this paper is to argue that this is kinda kind of unavoidable. That this is kind of unavoidable. It's a strong constraint. All right. Okay. So now comes. Wait a second. So in our context, combining this statement with the general expectation that h squared really in the large volume scenario cannot be higher than the typical scale to stabilize. Then the typical scales which stabilize your geometry, which is just a sub-leading germ cognitive leading F-germ potential, you get this very strong constraint on the volume. And so we are, if you accept the LBS, we are deeply in the LBS. It's not some kind of marginal thing, which is interesting. So we said we couldn't avoid this. So let me. I wanted to have an aside on Doug. Okay. So this is, okay, so far minimal conclusion. If you accept this line of thinking, you have to be This line of thinking, you have to deep into autonomy. Just to comment, couldn't this also be just consistent with one of the random points that we usually take at large H1 alarm, which also has a large volume? But is it necessarily LVS? Yes, I agree, but you have to, I think, so I didn't do, I didn't play this game with your setting, you know, like KKIT stabilization of many cycles. That wasn't just KKIT stabilization. Sorry? I meant just like random points, assuming. I meant just like random points, assuming, you know. No, no, but okay, okay, okay. If you do random points, you of course get achieved this in other ways. I don't know, actually. Yes. I mean, the comparison here is with the moduli potential. You need first a Kila moduli potential in order to actually compare the inflation scale with the barrier. That's what you are doing, the stabilization barrier. That's your argument there. So if you just pick a point in Kila moduli space, it doesn't give you this argument because you need to specify a moduli state. Yes, I agree. I agree. Yes, I agree. You have to. For KKT, you have to reduce this argument here. On one of our volume squared. Yeah, but it's but it's not quite, because one of the volume squared is true. But then you also have an extra suppression from W being small. So you need to do a little more work. So actually there's a mini exercise which you could do to just repeat this trivial dimensional analysis and estimate for a situation where you have, say, hundred, two cycles stabilized with a four cycle stabilized I think you T and then you go through this argument. But I That you go through this argument. But I okay, and probably you can meet that, but probably meet a fairly extreme situation with really many cycles. Can I ask one thing? Maybe I haven't understood. Can you stabilize at least the cycle where the QCD action is with KKLT? I thought it was a significant thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, of course not. Of course not. So actually, yes, that's a very good point, in fact. So because Good point, in fact. So, because what these guys, Amelian and Andreas, and Jako, are doing, they have a calabiologist, many four cycles. And naturally, if you don't do anything, there are many instantons and all the four cycles can stabilize somewhere. But this is not a good setting for an arc-city arcstrom. So now you have to distinguish to to single out at least one or maybe several bigger cycles which are stabilized differently. Stabilize differently. If you don't, if you use KKLT, if you don't use LDS, okay, this is well-studied, this is many papers written. But how else would you do that, concretely? I personally think the idea would be either prime or loop correction, something. But then you have to redo this whole sc actually, I will throw my comment. You are right, and I cannot suggest a simple correction. What everybody is proposing is that the scaling is in addition to the volume scaling. addition to the volume scaling at H11 scaling. It's F to be smaller than the Twiddle volume estimate, which is, of course, I mean, volume is correct. But there can be powers of H11. If H1's 100, a couple powers of H11, and you're suddenly you're in business, even if you're doing perturbative stabilization. I'm not saying it cannot be done, I'm just saying you have to think carefully about the perturbative stabilization and just to see what means of this argument. Of course, integration has to be always on stabilization. I think all of the models that we were proposing have the property that if the QCD axion is all of the dark matter, then you're not told by. Is all of the dark matter, and then you're not tilted is the curvature. And those are at, you know, chosen points. Now, we didn't arrange that perturbative stabilization occurs at those points, but it could. And the points, if you are at such a point, then the scales won't count. That's a great scale. And I'm looking, look, the volume, the volume at the tip of the trend-camera curve is larger than this, 3x11 larger than this. So that means everywhere in the regime of perturbative control, the volume satisfies this as large one's H1, 1 larger than this. Yeah, sorry, that's the point I was trying. Sorry, that's the point of strength. So, sorry, say it again. So, if you have how many, what's H11? 30. 30. And then you have 30. You have H130, or you have lots of cycles. Everywhere where you have a lot of controls. Every cycle is controlled. But this is not a model of stabilization. You have a model of simple multiple controls. If you could stabilize that anywhere in that category, via any method, you would just have to space. But I would and if you wanted to be at a smaller volume, you would have to be in the non-GMS. Of course, you can play many games. I wanted, I mean, in my mind, I now was trying to play the game of the Swiss papers of the Finnell group with TKT started stabilization. So many, many small cycles stabilized non-perturbatively, then the overall volume still being large. But that's not sufficient, as he pointed out great. As he pointed it out, great. We need some cycles to be even larger. Coupled from number W effects. Right, right. And what I'm saying is just that the. But then it's a numeric code that could come out, right? And you need to speak about the stabilization. Well, there's sort of three things on the table, right? There's a KKLT point, which, like you say, has problems. There's typical stretched scalar cone, which at margin of H11, this comes out automatically. And then there's LDS stabilization, which is actually dynamical. I think the point was just that the H11 scaling is actually. Was just that the H11 scaling is actually sufficient to reach this. Okay, okay, good. Let me go on. Okay, let me say that we have also worked on, I mean that this in this deep LBS regime, sorry, in this deep LBS regime, there's an issue of dark relation which I think we have solved partially and very nicely in our paper, and which is based on the fact that Of the fact that the decay width of the large cycle modulus actually to the Higgs is actually very high because the decay width is actually governed by the natural Higgs mass. And Higgs mass is small because of high tumor. But underlying is a high natural sushi mass which governs the decay. And so dark radiation in this context is actually not as much of a problem as you would have thought. But I do not want to check on this. The analysis. I want to make an aside on inflation. Namely, I already said that, that accepted that you need a very large volume, you unavoidably get a very low inflation scale. And this requires a very flat potential. And at the time of writing our paper, it appeared to us that the only candidate is blow-up inflation, originally called Hill model inflation, in this paper. So you add. So, you add in this LDS-type picture yet another cycle, which is an infoton cycle. If you move it away from its regime where it's not perturbably stabilized, you reach a flat regime out of large values. And so this becomes essentially flat as the volume becomes large. And provided, in our opinion, at the time, a very nice picture completing this axion, a low-scale inflation perspective. Perspective. And then we realized that loop corrections actually unavoidably spoil all this. Not completely. There's a model emerging of it which we call loop lower calculation, which basically says that you go up here and this regime loop corrections are dominant. And so the potential does not go flat, but it just goes a little bit further up. Which is not bad. It just means that you have to move further out to get a slow roll. So in itself, So, in itself, this is a very nice model of inflation, but it has different phenocharacteristics, and it doesn't have the low inflation scale that the original global inflation has. So, I perceive this as a tension. And I talked about this to Mikhail, and he said, oh, no problem, we should not be so negative. We will just fine-tune theta initial and have something else be dark matter. Unfortunately, I don't know because Nikhil is online. It would be nice to have him online, but probably not. Be nice to have him online, but probably not right. But now, and we are in the middle of an email argument about this, now I'm unhappy because I make something else dark matter. And I fine-tune the amount of Clichita axion, dark matter, to be below that for isochosha perturbations. And all of that, only because I was not clever enough to manage a low-scale inflation model, a specific low-scale inflation model. So to me, that doesn't look nice. I mean, the world could be like that. I mean, the world could be like that, but I do not want to be on this reheating surface, which is huge, in an atypical regime, without having at least in the back of my mind an entropic reason. So somehow I think there's a challenge here. I'm not sure whether I managed to, it's a fairly complex challenge because many constraints coming to both sides, but I think the cosmology is a non-trivial part of this axiom story. And maybe it's not going to be satisfactory to say, oh, Satisfactory to say, oh, the axion is easily explained in string theory if you have no clue how you date this in a setting with a good inflation model and not overclose to the universe and not fine-tuning for no good reason. Alright, so let me what our what's our time here? Let me say, okay, so that's a question. So is a very low scale inflation apparently required for risk? Inflation apparently requires for risk 500 to a serious generic problem. Okay, I just said that I think it is, and maybe one should try to solve it. There are possibilities of potentially low-scale models. We had some papers a long time ago with what we call flux-brain insulation. More recently, there's been a paper reviving by Kayla, Hernando, and other people. I have no judgment yet because it's. I have no judgment yet whether this will work, but maybe that is a challenge to rethink the question of whether we can have in string theory natural low-specific models for the purpose of not destroying our QCDR cell. Can I make a comment? This is Matt Regis over Zoom. It seems like you're assuming that the only viable thing is to have low-scale inflation. Viable thing is to have low-scale inflation because of isocurvature. But it could be that there's a different dynamical mechanism that solves the isocurvature problem. Like, for example, if the decay constant is changing in time after inflation, then the constraint is not necessarily what you... Thank you. Thank you. Very good point. I agree with you. I I just didn't think of it. I haven't didn't have time to think enough. Yes. Yes. If you want to do something like that, uh that that's I think that's the way out. That's I think that's the way of wondering when when should we change in time? For inflation, after inflation, I think. After inflation rate. Right? After inflation rate. Yeah, so if, say, the overall volume of modulus is evolving after inflation, then the decay constant of wait times could be different from the decay constant during inflation, and that could change the ISO provisions. I think there's a better. I think this is a valid comment. Maybe there are more ways out to. I say, okay, very good. So this is okay. We already discussed the challenge of maybe related to this how we get a transverse affirmative stabilization. There have been various templates. Let me not. I think my time is running out. So another question which I think should be discussed is: you know, according to the recent contextual statistical work with type 2B, in this context, the actual solution to the strong CP problem can be easily spoiled. I mean, part of these papers on the Part of these papers on the statistical assions is that you're not automatically getting the answer, right? Some models have them, some models don't have them. What do you mean have high quality? Yes, high quality. Well, all the models with H11 bigger than 15 or so have high quality. Similar round, huh? Yeah. Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, so the study is overall H11, and you're driven in a particular regime. But I agree that part of the point is that a lot of people have said, like, in string theory, like, you automatically solve the quality problem. You automatically solve the quality problem because corrections come from instant tons. But I think one of the points was that it's not automatic. You actually have to check in specific examples whether the corrections are big enough to spoil it or not. But then it turns out that they're not. 10 is badly written. But what I was going to say is that if you just take a model with many C4 axions, not all of them have a good quality. Maybe surprisingly to me at least. Maybe surprisingly to me at least. For eight or one large concentration of water and fifty. Well, no, no, it's actually extraordinary. Sorry, sorry, sorry, no. I I disagree with that. Because you impose perturbative control on all the small cycles, which is unclear whether this is how physics chooses to stabilize or modularize. You're restricting yourself to the stretch scalar code, which is an ad hoc assumption, which is maybe good for. Which is an ad hoc assumption, which is maybe good for the purpose of statistical analysis, but it's clear that you can move into regimes where this will not be true. Yeah, for me, it's n bigger than what how strong it is. Because I think as soon as you have an end order standardization or you're going in a pot, you know, in the inner pot, as it's not fuzzy, it's sort of oh yeah, you're not saying that the sufficiency of twenty is unclear, you're saying the necessity. Yeah, yeah, no agree. Saying the necessity. Yeah, I agree with that, for sure. I mean, even that, there were plenty of models that had good quality. Yeah, I think the 20 is a response to that can be easily spoiled. And I would say above 20, unless you're outside the stretch camera cone, then they're not. This doesn't account for IRN standards or stage codes. I actually didn't want, sorry, I apologize. I didn't want to go. I mean, my time is running out. I have 10 more minutes. This point has been made. More minutes. At this point, it has been made, has been discussed a lot. I mean, I think all the issues are on the table. I only wanted to bring the issue on the table. So, I wanted to say something more about heterotic axions, about possibly F serie axions which we have not discussed, about GGKT and type A language scripts. I wanted to say something about concretely about going beyond XGD axion. Especially about the interesting topic of fuzzy axions, but I'm simply running out of time. We had the very nice talk by Rick by Nicole. Let me not go here. Let me just simply skip fuzzy axions for the moment, also, that's very interesting. Yeah, there used to be a tension between the fuzziness and the dark matter abundance covered in this paper Covered in this paper by Mikhail and Alexander. This has been, this paper has been, this has now changed used analysis, right? And this has changed because you don't insist anymore this being all of dark matter. The risk work. That's basically the new point, right, Mikoyl? Yeah, yeah, I mean, also, you can also be taking off the G. Tension is that if the mass is above the 10 to the 90 G and 10 to the minus 19 evolves With a minus 19 E volt scale, to get not too much damage, you must find human theta. Right. That tension is not resolved. You have to live with the entropy constraint on the data. And at the moment, you're discussing these Hazy Axions in a, as we have seen, mainly situations when they are not all of dark matter. Yeah, because there are other constraints that are mostly already constrained that matter. I think it's important. Okay, if I apart from the queue of the axion, Apart from the QCD axion, for which we could argue there's experimental evidence, string axions are just one of the many light-hidden sectors, right, which string theory has and which you can look for. And so I think it's justified if one looks at those, one should actually look more broadly and include dark photons, very much as one includes additional axions. And we could claim them to be an actual prediction of string theory, and again have a success story if they are discovered, if you understood what they will be. Or what they will be. Observability is, of course, a different issue without photons and for axions, but it's not possible to observe them. One way is kinetic mixing. And this, in spite of being apparently a very old and well-studied subject, there are many basic questions still open. So let me emphasize one question which we uncovered in a paper not too long ago, namely, even parametrically, if you have a red-color yellow and you have two. If you have a right colour Biograph and you have two these three brain sectors, you have kinetic mixing between them. It's parametrically not clear what in a SUSE situation this high-suspicity mixing would be. Namely, if you do an AF calculation, which we did, you find a suppressed kinetic mixing, a suppressed price volume, so it's small, but not financially suppressed. But this power-like volume suppression clashes with what you expect from 4G SUSY by volume quantity and shift symmetry. In other words, it's unclear how it's getting a decoupled. Observation and decoupled could require, could satisfy the constraints of luminosity and shift symmetry, and nevertheless have the correct behavior and threshold. That's, I think, an open problem. We have talked to many people, we have not been able to solve it so far. Okay, last five minutes. I claim that all of this has a big, big drawback, which, I mean, not every conference can discuss as an issue, but which is there in a series and Issue, but it which is there in a series and is getting the result. Because we are, of course, talking here about an aspect of think field, which assumes that all we do will in the end be embedded in a consistent framework with cosmological constant small and zoozy breaking implemented at high scales. So now what do I have to say here? We know that Zuji breaking uplifting can affect the technology of a given quantification strongly, even worse some otherwise attractive quantifications. Some otherwise attractive commodifications may have no uplift. So, during the last decade, there has been this has put heterotic and type to A models somewhat on the sidelines. People have focused on type to B because everybody, not everybody, sorry, me and maybe some other naive people have been convinced that KKLD and LBS will always work or generically work. And due to recent developments, one has One has a right to have doubt about this. Let me emphasize what I think: one important point is: if you blew in the throat in the calibia, it actually forced into a regime when the throat is slightly larger than the calabiao, giving you a very strange geometry. In this very strange geometry, you have excessive coping and you have large regions of the space becoming singular. This is, to me, a significant loss of control. To me, a significant loss of control, at least in the standard or symbols ADLT models, which may be possible to avoid this, but has not been demonstrated. Certainly is a significant complication. In the LEDS, similar issues potentially arise due to alpha prime corrections. And all of this, so th th this can be again can be solved having a large D three deadpool, but you know but the known geometries allow for this large deadpool, only marginal. For this large debt for only marginal. So you really don't have convincing models. And this is becoming much worse if you take seriously the details of how the antibrain sits in the bottom of the sterotrus road. And then maybe some of you, maybe many of you remember that there is a decay process where this UD3 puffs up into NS5 which can slide over the sphere and decay to ZUZ. And if you look at the other prime corrections to this, Alpha prime corrections to this. It turns out that the requirement on the size of the stroke is even worse. So you get an even worse constraint on what geometries you have to use. So there's clearly no time now in the last four minutes to review this. But these decision issues persist and are very serious, in my opinion. And so even admitting optimistically that some form of KDLT LBS can be saved, I would claim we don't know at the moment which one and at which statistical cost. And at which statistical cost. Thus, all expectations based on something we call a natural axiom, based on searches purely in the geometry, may be overthrown. And let me give you, so to illustrate my point, I want to give you only one example. Let's say that obviously highly fine cube F-curve uplift using construction modular can be realized. So you just look for a random point in the landscape where the SUSI braking may. The SUSY breaking, whereas you have a minimum in spite of the F-germ condition not being realized. Such points exist has been, let me mention here's a recent paper by Krippendorf and Schachtman and Lanza and Nestval. And this, of course, is much more likely to be realized if you have very many common social moduli. This may be the opposite regime of having very many Helen moduli that we at the moment study. So it could be that So, it could be that there will be a strong bias to deliver in a direction where we will not see many C4 axion because we need calabulaus with a maximum number of influxion moduli and not many kilomoduli. And this is just a story which I made up, you know, thinking about this in five minutes, but clearly there are many analogous strong bias stories which can be invented, and so uh we should be cautious to say that we understand this just because we have a good statistical view of some particular site. View of some particular site story. Okay. This is something probably I would expect. Yeah, Alexander will contradict me or. No, no, no, no. Okay. I agree. I mean, I just wanted to add another even more heretical comment. Yes, please to this. I mean, like, so when you just connect this, when you take this case where you say, but say we are lucky, there is some landscape surviving in the end. At landscape surviving in the end, or is it a vacuum with whatever statistic? Say there is some. Yeah, I'm sure that. Still believing that there is some. Let's say that's there. And then we have all the what we discussed before about the axons, I mean like the entropic pressures for the Lyman angle and so on. So there is a story that within that axiver, you can concoct a future situation where you may be able to really refute that from these, like where the this alignment angle would be sequential, would mean. This alignment angle would need to be super informed, you could be subtracted below the. Because the aspects are small? No, because dark matter may not be an aspect alignment. Could still be something else. We don't know that. You might have a situation where dark matter is something else, still some kind of other particle. But some super radiance observation tells you that is an ion. Yes, yes. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. And if that happens, then you may actually need this action to be even less than the photon. I mean, there's no reasoning. So the atomic reasoning has. So, the entropic reasoning has failed. If you put that together with the landscape, you may, the possible failure of entropic reasoning that we don't know yet, but that kind of surpassed, you may want to think about a non-entropic way of arguing about smaller CCs or better population accountability. Is that the paper with the market? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so very good. So, I should have mentioned it. I apologize just to say that. No, for me, it's a way to challenge. I mean, we are explaining the CC, even if we have a landscape still using the entropy Weinberg argument. We may want to have a better population mechanism. Have a better population mechanism that would actually push us towards more CC without really clearance. I happen to have worked on one, but there may be others. I mean, we should really, I mean, we should not give the stacks up with Brothers Institute about the answer. Let me just rephrase what you said. I mean, I think it's a very good point. We could take, I gave before an argument that we need this local inflation to avoid this crazy situation where we have something else being not matter and the action being fine-tuned. Doesn't matter and the axial being fine-tuned to be a small fraction for no good reason. So, what you're saying is we create the opposite point of view. We could imagine that this situation is experimentally discovered. In other words, we discover dark matter. We know there's a lot of dark matter. And we have also an axion, but that axion is fine-tuned by initial angle fine-tuning to be much, much less than this dark matter. This is a crazy situation which is against statistical reasoning. Reasoning. So we are living quite manifestly, not in some unknown measure environment, but manifestly in an unlikely place on the reading surface. Even worse, maybe you have at that same time you have seen a future tensor model. So you know inflation, the size case. In this case, we know that we are completely not understanding this entropic system, which would be an interesting conclusion. I would say we have to think about non-Butso-Polshinski types of reasoning, about explaining small CC, so different problems. Is more CC, so different population mechanism in the visitor landscape that I still choose to leave. I have promised not to go over time for the purpose of lunch and skiing. I let you read my second conclusion. All of this has been said before. As we have now seen, there are many questions, few answers, lots to do. I would like to thank the organizers, I and David, and Naomi, and Michela, who is unfortunately not here. Thank you so much. Thanks for doing this very talk. And let's go at lunch. EPICAPENTY TOP, I'm going to be like. It was Mary who had the idea for this meeting, who prepared the proposal that was successful, and then who organized everything. You can tell she organized everything, but the backstory is she also thought and made it happen. So, thank you. Thank you to all of you for making this such a cool and interesting project.  I just re-watched it until like a full stop and I realized I remember. He's got all these things on the table. Yeah, just we have a scale of movie patch, I'm excited about having a bunch of the stuff that a lot of people may have in channels. My just get the colour. So, we could raise a push, I'll say that.
