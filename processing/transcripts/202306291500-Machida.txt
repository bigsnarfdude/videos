And thank you for inviting me. And yeah, so I belong to this university in Hamamatsu three months ago, and I still have a researcher position there, but I just moved to Kinda University. Anyway, let's do this. Okay, so anyway, these universities are located in. These universities are located in Japan. And today, I'm going to talk about inverse problems of such a problem. I'm going to show you some equation soon, but we take data on the boundary and we try to reconstruct a coefficient in the PDE. And in particular, I'm going to talk about non-linear rate of approximation. And so my talk will not be any deep learning or machine learning, but I would like to a little bit talk about my opinion. So I have seen many researches and In many cases, I think the best way is to some combination of deep learning and a conventional method. So that's why I'm trying to develop a conventional method. And my talk is not related to data-driven, but actually, I have just started some data-driven research, although I just Although I just started this and I'm not going to talk about this, but there's a disease called HIE. So when a baby comes out from a mother, the oxygen level in the brain gets low. And that is a natural and necessary step. But of course, the oxygen level is low for a long period. Go for a long period, then the brain gets damaged. And then this Kagawa University is another university in Japan, but in that university, medical doctors use near-infrared light and they do measurement for young baby, neonatal babies. Babies and they measure brain and try to get oxygen levels and they try to understand about this disease, HIE. And however, they don't know how to do it, how to trade data. And I'm trying to help them. And they have just sent me the data. A lot of the data, and I'm trying to develop some model. But again, I've just started this. So today I'm going to talk about some conventional numerical method. So let's begin. So this is the equation which I'd like to consider today. It's the time independent diffusion equation. Diffusion equation. Actually, light in biological tissue is governed by this equation. So I did this small experiment by myself a few years ago, or maybe 10 years ago, at home. But it's very different from X-ray. If you use near-infrared light, light is scattered many times inside the body. In inside the body, and it propagates like this, not straight at all. And then if we look at the equation, we have a distribution coefficient. Mu A is the absorption coefficient. And in particular, I want to look at mu A, the absorption coefficient, because if we reconstruct mu A, then we can get the oxygen herdal. And we have such Robin type boundary condition. And sorry, so we don't need this initial condition because the equation is time independent. And what happens if we try to reconstruct Î¼A? The inverse problem is severely ill-posed, and moreover, it's non-linear. And so, such an imaging is called optical tomography. And actually, there are a lot of researchers already. And this was done more like 20 years ago. This was done at UPenn in the US, and they could detect women's breast cancer using light. And this is another research. People can also study brain function using light. If some part of the brain works, then the blood volume of that area increases. And since the light is observed in hemoglobin in blood using near-infrared light, we can study brain function. We can study brain function. So then they could see, they found that different regions of the brain work depending on what the patient or what this person does. Okay, so since light is useful, I want to develop I want to develop a nice method to reconstruct a coefficient in the diffusion equation. And typically, there are two strategies. One is, I call it direct methods, and the other one is iterative schemes. And for this direct method, there's no cost function, but it's a part of this. a part of it scheme and we do partation and we try to reconstruct a coefficient and iterative schemes of course we have a cost function and we try to find the global minimum however in the case of optical optical tomography the cost function is very complicated uh has a very complicated shape and uh Complicated shape and it has many local minima. So if we just naively use iterated schemes, we can easily trapped by a local minimum. So today I want to look at this direct method. And I don't deny iterative schemes. What I wanted to say is that if we just naively use iterative schemes, Just naively use iterative schemes from some textbooks. It doesn't work, but some hill climbing algorithms are needed. And actually, there are a lot of those techniques. So if we develop iterative schemes, we can also use iterative schemes. But for example, for experimentalists, it's a bit complicated. Uh, it's a bit complicated, or uh, maybe it's time-consuming. So, I today I would like to rather look at this direct method. So, the most basic one in direct methods is called the Born approximation. It's one typical way to solve. Of a linear inverse problem. And what we need to do is, I want to use this simple equation. And we compare u and u naught. In u0, u0 is the solution to the equation which the perturbation is zero. And we look at And we look at this difference. And this difference can be written like this. Eta is the coefficient and k1 is some operator. And we linearize the non-linear inverse problem. And if we use the problem approximation, what we need to solve is this equation. We know the left-hand side from experiments or measurements. Side from experiments or measurements, and we try to reconstruct this eta. And then there's another one, it's called Ritoff, Ritov approximation. It's similar but a bit different. On the left-hand side, we have log. So there are similar approximations, but if we when we want When we construct coefficients, actually, it is known that Ritov works better. Well, I think this figure is more convincing than my explanation, but I did this reconstruction. We prepared some books and inside the Some books, and inside the box, we place the Riemann slice. I try to reconstruct that Riemann slice. At first, I used the border approximation, and I couldn't see anything. Then I used the retrofaximation, then I got my Riemann slice. So both are linear first-order approximation, but there's this difference. And actually, This difference. And actually, I mentioned this breast cancer and brain function research. Both of them use the rate of approximation. So rate of is more practical. So in particular, I want to develop this rate of approximation. So I will go to So, I will cut the retort approximation. And this approximation has been known for many years, at least in the optical tomography community, it has been known for 30 years. And I'm sure that ritual approximation was invented more than 30 years, but at least 30 years. And the approximation works, but the drawback is that we have to linearize the But we have to linearize the problem, linearize the original nonlinear problem. So today I want to include nonlinear terms. Okay, so to explain how to include nonlinear terms in the Rito series, I need to begin the Born series because the Born series is easier. Easier. Okay, so let's again look at this equation. And although it is possible to reconstruct the diffusion equation, but for simplicity, I look at this order term and I set my diffusing coefficient one and I want to reconstruct this eta. Construct this data from boundary measurements. And this is what I do. This is the original diffusion equation. And I consider another diffusion equation. The solution is u0. And here there's no eta. Eta is zero everywhere. And then I do this subtraction. And then I got. And then I got this equation. Here, eta, there's no eta on the left-hand side, but in the south term, there's eta. And then if we introduce such Green's function, we can find this identity, u equals u zero minus k squared. Minus k squared, and this integral, and Green's function eta, and u is here. So it's, I didn't solve anything, although it says u equals, but because there's u here. So this is just an identity. But by using this identity, we can construct a series. We plug We plug this whole right-hand side in this U. And then on the right-hand side, there are double integrals and this U appears again. And then I substitute the right-hand side to that U again. And I keep doing that. And then I can construct such a series. And for example, K1 is such. So k1 is such an integral. And anyway, I can express this difference, u0 minus u, as a series of u eta. And this is called the boron series. And this is a recursive structure. This is the boron series. This is the Borel series. U1 can be computed if we know U0. U2 can be computed from U1, and so on. And this is what people call the Borent approximation. Usually, people just take the first order term. And so u equals this. u equals this is the the problem approximation and uh uh since uh u and the relation between u and eta becomes linear so we have a linear inverse problem okay so uh today i want to look at nonlinear terms so to uh to consider nonlinear terms i uh I again write down my Borel series and phi is this difference u0 minus u and then although I don't know we don't know this operator's kappa one kappa two and the song at this moment but I write another series here phi equals phi is given by semi-series of Phi is given by some series of eta. Here, eta is given by a series of pi. And this is called the inverse Born series. And such a structure appears a long time ago. If we if these operators k and coupler are just constant of real numbers, for example, if we can For example, if we can look at this textbook published in 1957, suppose we have such a series, then from this series, we can construct another series, x equals this. X is given by a series of y and big a1, a2, a3 are given like this. But here, Here, k's and couples are operators. And moreover, I want to know the general term, not just a few initial terms. So this is the Born series, this is the inverse Born series, and I want to find Kappa 1, Kappa 2, Kappa 3, and so on. Pathway and so on. And I substitute this phi in these files on the right-hand side. And then I find that kappa one times K1 should be the identity. Or if we've got the second term, second order term, Kappa 2, K1, K1 plus Kappa1, K2 should be zero, and so on. And so on from these relations, we can find kappa two, kappa three like this. And in general, kappa j is given by this using, so since m runs from one to j minus one, kappa j is given by kappa one through kappa j minus one. But one through kappa G minus one. So this is how we can get kappa J. And I want to talk about the regularization. So once we get Kappa one, then recursively we can get Kappa two, Kappa three, and so on. So of course, Of course, I'm trying to solve a severe Europol's problem, and I need regularization. And Kappa 1 should be some regularized operator. So, for example, if we use matrices, we can use SPD or truncated SPD for It's V D for this Kappa 1. And anyway, so Kappa 1 is not the inverse of K1, but some are regularized through the inverse. And anyway, once we get Kappa 1, we can get Kappa 2, Kappa 3 in a recursive way. And such inverse boron series. Bollen series for those for such an inverse Bollen series. There are these papers, and I have one paper also with Shotland, who is at Yale right now. And however, so these papers are nice papers, but as I explained in the introduction. The introduction, Broadway series is easy to handle mathematically, but in practice, retoffs is more practical. So this is why I want to develop inverse retoff series today. Okay, so for the inverse retoff series, there are not so many papers. I could find these two papers. One is published in 2000. One is published in 2000. They did the inversion of the Ritov series, but they didn't get a general term. Soon later, I will introduce a recursive algorithm, but they didn't have a recursive algorithm. And in this paper, their inverse root of series is different from what I call the inverse root of series. And the series was formal, and the actual calculation was not feasible. So I want to construct the inverse result series. Again, Again, I want to start with this diffusion equation. And just like the inverse bond series, I prepare another diffusion equation with u0. And here again, here there's no eta. This is the original equation, and there's this eta. And I want to reconstruct this eta. Okay, so since I'm interested in Ritoff, this is what I want to look at. Not just u0 minus u, but I look at log u0 minus log u. And I want to call this difference psi. And the psi is this log. And for this u, For this U, I use the Bohr series. And U0, this is U1 is the first term of the Bohr series. And I can express this U using the Bollen series. And then I will end up with such a series. And this is called the rate of series. This is not a new thing. This is A new thing. This is just the introduction of the Ritoff series. And we can say that in the Ritoff series, we have series in this exponential function. And using terms in the Born series, we can express terms in the Ritop series. is psi one is given by minus u one over u zero psi two is given by this and so on and for the later purpose for the numerical calculation I need to know the general term if we look at that series on the previous slide I can find that psi j is given by this Is given by this. This u's are terms in the Brown series. So using the novels from the Brown series, I can get this psi j in the Ritoff series. Okay, then I want to introduce this operator JJ. This operator j sub j, when this operator acts on this eta, it is psi j, like j is termed in the root of series. And in general, j sub j is given by this. This and k check is given by this integral. It's a bit complicated, but this is something we can compute. And then just like we did for the inverse Bohr series, I want to obtain the inverse ritual series. I write I write my Ritoff series, and then this is the inverse Ritov series. At this moment, we don't know about calligraphic J1, J2, J3, and so on. And to find those operators, I plug this side, this expression on the right-hand side, into this. Into this size on the right-hand side. And then we find such relations. Calligraphic J1, J1, eta should be eta. So these two should be the identity or if we look at the second order time, we have this version or the third order time. The third order time terms are satisfied terms satisfy such a variation and so on. And then in general, again, if I look at those series carefully, I notice that this calligraphic J1, sorry, JJ is given by this. Given by this in a recursive manner, this m runs from one to j minus one. Okay, then that means I'm ready to use the inverse vertical series. And before doing numerical calculation, I looked at some mathematical structure and and I got such an error estimate. Suppose I took capital N terms in the inverse Rittel series, and then the question is how that approximation is close to the true eta. I got these two terms, and for example. And for example, here we have one minus a category of J1 J1. So depending on how regularized the pseudonym was of J1, this term can be small or sometimes it's not so small. But if we organize nicely, this term should be. This term should be small. And to prove this inequality, we can use such an identity. And if we notice this, the proof is not so difficult. Also, I looked at the stability and I found that there's this such an reached stability. Repeat stability. So it should work. Okay, so now finally, I want to do some numerical calculation. This J1 plus is the regular pseudonyms. And this is the This is the matrix, and this corresponds to calculator x J1. And then in general, we have such a vector. Sorry, yeah, such a vector. And this vector, jj is given by this. We have a recursive structure. This m runs from Structure, this m runs from one through j minus one. And this eta is a vector and the jth term in the inverse root of series. And this can be computed by this function. And if we add eta one through eta n capital n, then that will give And that will give an approximation of this eta. So, this is how I construct my eta. And I can borrow the idea from this paper that discussed the numerical calculation of the inverse Bohr series. And it's a bit more complicated, but we can use the same idea. Same idea. We prepare a forward function for the forward operator and another function or subroutine for the inverse function. And then the first order term is we can use truncated SVD, for example. For example, and the first order term can be computed on this function or subroutine, j1 psi. And the second order term is computed by from using this function, j2 psi psi. And this j2 is given by j1. So by using this first order function, Function, we can compute this second-order function and we get the second-order term. And if we look at the third-order term, J3 is given by J1 and J2. So in this recursive manner, we can compute the first over term, second order term, third order overall term, and so on. And then we can compute starting from this psi. Psi is obtained from measurements. Psi is the data. And by this algorithm, I get eta j. And if I add eta one through eta one through eta sum. For example, if we take the five terms, that means I considered up to the fifth order term. And anyway, if we add eta one through eta sum, eta zero or eta n, then that is the approximation of eta. Okay, before finishing, I want to show you some numerical results. I look at this two-dimensional problem. Suppose this light blue area, eta is zero. And that means the absorption coefficient is a constant. And in this dark. And in this dark blue area, again, it's constant, but eta is non-zero. So, and we eliminate this object or biological tissue by light. Of course, it's a numerical coefficient, but we illuminate light and then. And then we observe the outgoing light at this point. And using that data, I try to reconstruct the eta inside this dark blue region. And at first, I set eta and the constant value of this. The constant value of this drug circle is 0.2. And the question is, if we can reconstruct this 0.2 and the size of this disk, this is the result. R is this radial direction and this blue is the Is the true eta. And since I realize my operator, it is not possible to reconstruct this block true shape. But this red, it's not very clear, but this red is the projection. So if everything goes well, this red curve. This red curve is something I can reconstruct. And this purple is the first of the term. This is something people call it the root of approximation. And certainly this is different, but if we include second order term, it's already very close to the red curve. And what happens if eta is one, eta is one, eta is the value of eta inside this dark disk. This purple first order term is very different from this red curve. And if I keep adding nonlinear terms, second, third, fourth, fifth. For speed. If I go to the fifth, it's very close to the red curve. And eta A is two, eta is five. When eta is five, the inverse result series doesn't converge and Doesn't converge and the result is not good. So atom must be small in some sense. And I also add noise. And if there's noise, I have to regalize more. And it is not easy to reconstruct this blue shape. But this is the first order. This red is the projection. Is the projection. And so, if I keep adding nonlinear terms, I get better results. Okay, so let me finish my talk. Today, I look at the rate of approximation, which has been known for many years in obstacle tomography community. And today I could include nonlinear terms. Include non-linear terms. Okay, thank you. Please, comments, questions. Thank you very much for the very interesting talk. I had a question on regularization. Yeah. So I didn't understand if you should. If you should like regularize when inverting just the first term, so that calligraphic J1 or if it's something you should do in principle for every term. So even when you invert J2 or just the first order term. Okay, so with that. So then I get calculated J1. And then after that, I can recursively compute calculus J2, J3, and so on. So regardless needed. Uh, regardless in this need, it's just for the first order term. And so, to compute like calligraphic J2, you don't need to invert any J non-calligraphic J, let's say. Okay, yeah, so once I get Cargo J1, J2 is just like this. So, there's no inversion. And so, you can use the error estimate that you were showing. So, you can use the error estimate that you were showing in the beginning, in a sense. So, in the beginning, I don't know in the slide, I don't remember 20 something. Yeah, yeah, this one. Okay. So, the effect of regularization appears only this term. And on the right-hand side, in a sense, it says that the more iteration, the more terms you consider, actually, the more you collect some. I see. Very interesting. Thank you. Sorry, I'm completely new to this series. I missed how you do the, you know, you've got this double series, right? When you expand the log. How do you do the grouping? I missed that. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So when I say order, I'm talking about the order of eta. So For example, this u1 is given by an interval, and inside of that integral, there's one eta. I didn't write the second number, but the next term is u2. U2 is given by a double integral, and inside of the double integral, there are two etas. Okay, like in the Born series, basically. Yes, yes. Okay. And from here, I get my. I get my Taiwan when I collect first order terms, terms which contain only one ADA. Then I got this. Next, I collect terms which contain two etas. Then my side two is this. And do you have like an intuitive reason why taking the log of u over u zero is better than taking Is better than taking u minus u zero? So, no, okay, so there's some discussion, but uh maybe it's because they're both positive and so taking a ratio is more natural than taking a difference for this problem. Yeah, but um so I think the reason is a kind of complicated thing, and for example, in this And for example, in this paper, he used renormalization group and he discussed that Ritov is more stable than boron. But yeah, actually, I want to know some simple explanation why Ritof is beta, but right now I don't know the answer. Thank you.
