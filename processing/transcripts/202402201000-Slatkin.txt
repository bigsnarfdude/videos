Welcome to the first in the series of Reflections on History of Modeling and Theory, which Sally and I, John Wakely, are putting together with the assistance of Kaylee Charlabaugh at UBC. This is for the new Society for Modeling and Theory in Population Biology, or SMTPB. The aims of this society The aims of this society are to provide a forum for discussing theoretical issues and results, to strengthen the connection of practitioners to journals in the field, to build this community through meetings, workshops, and online events like this one, and to foster the careers of modelers and theoreticians in population biology. For more about SMTPB and future events, please visit the website smtpb.org. SMTPB.org. Sally and I are delighted to welcome Monty Slatkin to the series of informal conversations with leading figures like Monty who have helped shape our field and who can reflect on the changes in modeling over their careers. Monty is a professor emeritus, Department of Integrative Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also affiliated with the Center for Theoretical The Center for Theoretical and Evolutionary Genetic Genomics at Berkeley. Monty did his undergraduate work at MIT, then earned a PhD in applied mathematics at Harvard University. Following a one-year postdoc with Dick Lewinton at the University of Chicago, Monty became an assistant, then was promoted to associate professor in the Department of Theoretical Biology at Chicago. Theoretical biology at Chicago. In 1977, he moved to the University of Washington Department of Zoology, where he was promoted to professor, full professor. And from 1985, Monty, until today, Monty has been at Berkeley, first in the Department of Zoology and then in the Department of Integrative Biology when that department was formed. Monty has earned a number of awards and honors. A number of awards and honors, including in the year 2000, a Sewell Wright Award from the American Society of Naturalists. In 2016, the Kimura Award from the Moto Kimura Foundation for the Promotion of Evolutionary Biology. And in 2014, Monty was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In terms of publications, according to Web of Science search that I did yesterday, Search that I did yesterday. Monty has 254 papers, which have been cited 52,000 times in total, and an H index of 83. That is, if you like citation numbers. Now, even if you don't know about this biographical information about Monty, you know Monty's work, I am sure. Monty's work has shaped population and evolutionary genetics and genomics and has influenced how all of us. Has influenced how all of us think about things, including, in particular, subdivided populations with migration, linkage disequilibrium, ages of alleles and their estimation from sequence data, microsatellite mutation processes and forensic match probabilities, evolution of polygenic characters, including complex diseases, and now more recently, ancient DNA and allele frequencies through time. Frequencies through time. These are just some highlights in the interest of time. I'll stop there. Monty, thank you so much for being with us here today. You're welcome. Sally and I have a bunch of questions we would like to ask. Sally, do you want to start? Sure. Monty, when was your first inkling that math had something to contribute in biology? When did you realize it was a tool that could be used? That could be used? Oh, when I was a graduate student, I was asked to be a teaching assistant in a course called Mathematical Modeling, taught by George Career, my advisor, and Bill Bossart. And many of the examples were biological examples, and Bossert especially was very clear on the role of mathematical modeling in biology. And so I got to know him. And so I got to know him as a result of that course. And I got to know several students from the biology department, graduate students, including Ross Keister, who was very a good naturalist, who was also interested in applying mathematical models in biology. And this was, I discovered this was a time when mathematical modelers, particularly Mathematical modelers, particularly Robert MacArthur, Richard Levins, and Richard Lewenton, were transforming the field by making people aware of the importance and utility of models. So there was a lot of action and activity in the field at the time. Yes, yes. And when I started to become interested in biology, several people, especially Several people, especially E.O. Wilson and Ernst Meyer, urged me to consider more biological problems. And they helped me by inviting me to participate in seminars. Wilson made me a TA in a course he was teaching. And they just generally encouraged me who knew no biology at all. George Carrier, I believe, was much more of a I believe he was much more of a physical scientist than a biologist. Is that right? Yes, he knew no biology. He was really a specialist in fluid mechanics and aerodynamics. But he encouraged me when I told him about these problems. I mean, I saw a great opportunity for theoreticians. And he agreed with me and he said, go for it, and supported me on his grants from the Office of Naval Research. Of Naval Research. So, those are people who very early in your career were inspirational to you. Were there others later on that you can think of and had a guiding influence on your work? Yes, particularly Richard Lewenton and John Maynard Smith, whom I got to know when I moved as a postdoc to the University of Chicago. I mean, they're, of course, extraordinary people and Extraordinary people and were great fun, too. And I also Richard Levins at the University of Chicago, who was immensely creative, a great inspiration. Then later in my career, when I moved to the University of Washington, Joe Felsenstein was particularly influential. Had you had exposure to phylogenetics before that, meeting Joe and talking? Before that, meeting Joe and talking with him? No, I didn't even know what phylogenetics was until I got to know Joe. And coalescent in other things like that and bootstrapping through those conversations? Well, when I moved to University of Washington and got to know Joe, there wasn't coalescent theory. It was pre-coalescent. But because of Joe, we were primed to understand a tree-based view of genetics. Of genetics. And both of us quickly adopted that view and did quite a bit of research in the area. That might actually relate to this next question, which is, do you have a favorite memory of an aha moment, something where that was confusing that all of a sudden became clear through mathematics or modeling? Well. I mean, certainly one was when I understood with the help of John Gillespie how the coalescent really worked and why it mattered. And what was the role of John Gillespie and the role of math there? Well, we were talking, it was in the early days of looking at gene genealogy. Gene genealogies of mitochondria. And if you take a population genetics view of mitochondrial frequencies, you don't appreciate that each mitochondrial tree is one realization of a stochastic process. You tend to average over them because you think of allele frequencies. But Gillespie explained to me, No, you don't do that. And that led to the paper with. And that led to the paper with Dick Hudson on changing eologies and growing populations, where people were, I think before that, very confused about it. I know I was. Dick wasn't. But I knew Alan Wilson and was sitting in on his lab group, and I knew they all were. The paper you're referring to with Dick Hudson is the one about linkage disequilibrium. Is that? About linkage disequilibrium? Is that? No, it's. Is it the star phylogeny one? It's the star phylogeny paper, because a growing population creates a star phylogeny. You have a unimodal distribution of differences between mitochondria, and that's what we're seeing. I come back to that paper often during the COVID pandemic. That's exactly what. The COVID pandemic, that's exactly what we see in the epidemiological phylogenies of the virus, of course, because of that growing population, as you wrote. Right. And it was Joe Felsenstein who called it a star phylogeny, by the way. I took the term from him. So for students, where am I? I have a script and I have to stick to it. Here we go. I actually would like to hear more. I actually would like to hear more about that paper that I brought up. If you're willing, Monty, to talk about linkage disequilibrium and growing and stable populations. I found that to be a really, for me, a kind of aha paper about things. Was that something that was also that way for you? Not really. And I was curious about it. And again, I had Wilson's mitochondrial data. Data to analyze. Did you and Gillespie publish a paper together, or was this just from your understanding of the coalescent that came from John? Just from conversations with John. It was later that I put it together with the mitochondrial data that I realized what was going on. Monty, for students entering into the field, I think even entering into the field, I think even already it can be helpful to know that it wasn't until graduate students school that you came to merge your biology and your math interests. And I think a lot of times it can be intimidating for students to try and be both an expert in biology and an expert in math. Do you have any advice about how to approach theory in biology and in population biology and the insights it provides? Well, for both. Well, for I mean, for mathematicians who want to move into biology, they have to learn enough biology to have their own, to be able to choose their problems and to be able to understand the relevance of theory to biological problems. Because that's the hardest thing to do. I mean, anybody can write down equations and call it biological theory, but to make it relative. But to make it relevant, you have to understand what the biological questions are. For biologists who want to learn more mathematics, who realize its importance, they really have to take the trouble to do it right, to understand the basics of mathematics, otherwise they'll always be intimidated by it. Yeah, I think that humility, really, that you're talking about being aware that you actually have to do the work of learning the other field, but then on the other hand, comes the pleasure of making the connections that you must have found when you that the that learning of biology must have been a gradual process for you, but must have been fun too. But it must have been fun too. Oh, yes. And I was helped a lot by people who found money to send me into the field. I mean, I'm a terrible field naturalist, but I went collecting lizards in the Dominican Republic. I visited people, the Barrow-Colorado Island in Panama. I went to East Africa to study baboon behavior. And I learned an enormous amount, including how very difficult. Amount, including how very difficult it is to get reliable data in the field. Those are great experiences. Was that as a grad student or? It was as a graduate student. Ernest Williams, who was the curator of Herbs at Harvard, encouraged theoreticians, even though he understood absolutely nothing about theory. And he encouraged me. And he encouraged me and Bob Trivers, Joel Cohen, and several others, and found money to send me off to assist Ross Keister in the Dominican Republic. And I only caught one lizard by stepping on it. But I learned, but I spent a lot of time learning about tropical biology there. Right. Was it learning about the biology most? About the biology, mostly, or were you also learning how biologists tend to think about problems? I learned how biologists think about problems. I mean, Ross Kiester is very creative and very good at connecting biology to mathematics, even though he wasn't trained as a mathematician himself. That often seems like the key bit, which is to translate an intuitional approach to a question into something one can analyze. Something one can analyze and have a real result that is meaningful for a biologist. Yes, and Stuart Altman at the University of Chicago and Gene Altman, who took me to East Africa, were similar. They understood the importance of theory and the uses of mathematics, even though they were real-field biologists themselves. I think that's a good segue to the next question, which is. The next question, which is: How do you think the perception of modelers and theoreticians in population biology has changed since you started in this field? Oh, I think it's changed enormously because of the accumulation of data. I mean, when I was starting, theoretical population genetics was completely abstract, almost completely abstract. All people had were data from the field called ecological. From the field called ecological genetics, looking at the frequencies of banding patterns on snails and patterns in butterflies. And there were, of course, many problems with those data. But Dick Lewonton and Hubby had published the first Alizyne paper in 1966, and people suddenly had things they could really analyze, data sets they could really analyze. That led to Kimura and Ewans and Kimura and Ewans, and the giants in the field developing theory that was motivated all by these observations. I think later, you know, it was Alkyme data accumulated and then sequence data accumulated and now we're drowning in data. I think people recognize that theory is essential, that getting data is no problem at all. It seems to me the At least it seems to me the kind of data has it's not exactly the kind of data that has changed, but the volume, like you said, of data. And so, those early works, a lot of the tools that we use now are similar to the work, the tools that were developed early on to analyze data, like the Alazigne data. And yet now we have data sets where you push a button on a cluster and it runs for weeks or days at least. And there's still theories. And there's still theory there, but it seems to me it's a little bit different what theoreticians have to do. Well, certainly the theory that is used for analyzing genomic data isn't really population genetics theory. It's applied statistics. The kind of what I think, I mean, I don't know if I'd call it old-fashioned theory or single allele. Single allele theory, but there is a branch of theory that hasn't changed much where people try to understand the evolution of different phenotypes by asking what happens to mutations that affect those phenotypes at one or two or at least a few loci. And that theory hasn't changed very much, but it's fairly far removed from the kind of genomic data that. From the kind of genomic data that are available. That's certainly true. I feel sympathy for grad students trying to enter into theory these days because there's just so much to learn. It's bioinformatics and genomic sequencing and all of the statistical approaches, as well as population genetics. Do you feel like that, has it always felt a little overwhelming? Do you think that's true? Little overwhelming? Do you think that's changed? I think that's changed now because you have to know so much to do anything, at least with genomic data. Any advice about how to not be overwhelmed? I mean, you have to learn the basic tools well because otherwise you'll keep stumbling over them. But I think you also have to know enough biology not to just. To know enough biology not to just become not to just drown in the details of statistical methods. Many people in biology now or in population genetics now never think about the organism. They only think about other theoretical papers. Do you have an example where thinking about the work? Example where thinking about the organism actually changed how you approached a model? Or the insights that you got from a model? Well, I've always tried to ask what kind of data can a theory be applied to? I mean, and often that's gained by talking to people who have the data or have the biological. Have the biological questions they would like answers to. Keeping that close connection. Yeah, keeping that close connection because it's easy to come off the rails and just start worrying about the theory for its own sake. And especially as a mathematician, that's much more fun than having to keep being drawn back to know. To keep being drawn back to know what is the question here, right? Are there examples that have moved or inspired you where there's something that is extremely mathematical, but which you found that you could take and use in an applied setting when the mathematicians had not thought of it? No, no, no, I've never done very sophisticated mathematics. Sophisticated mathematics. I've worked with some very good mathematicians, but I have known when I've needed help from people who are really good, like Steve Evans at the University of California. Although I wouldn't be surprised if many, it seems like a lot of branches of probability theory and math have come from Come from core population genetics questions, different birth death processes and things. Yeah. Oh, yes. No, people, I mean, I think there are many areas in mathematics which have grown out of population biology, but not from work I've specifically done. There can be a tendency in biology and in our field in general to split population and evolutionary genetics from fairly Genetics from fairly closely related fields, especially ecology and systematics. How do you think that has influenced the development of theory in our field? Well, it used to be that people thought there were different time scales of change in different fields. So there was talk about ecological time, and then in phylogenetics and system. Phylogenetics and systematics, people talked about deep evolutionary time. And I think now people recognize those distinctions are not always useful. And especially in phylogenetics, people are coming to appreciate the details, the importance of the details of the speciation process and later admixture. And there isn't a clear separation of time scales, at least. At least the way they used to be. And I don't work in ecology, but I understand from ecologists that they are, they feel that often evolutionary changes can directly affect ecological interactions in the short term. Yeah, those are both points well taken. I think, especially the first one about phylogenetics coming to incorporate population genetics in a Population genetics in a big way. Ecological theory maybe is still a little bit farther from population genetics than it might be. I would personally like to see more work in that direction. And the time scales are different in a way, because evolutionary issues. No, I just don't know what's going on in ecology enough to have an opinion. Some of these selection coefficients and changes we're seeing in COVID are remarkable, doubling times of days. And so then you really, for allele frequencies, and so then you're really, the ecological and the evolutionary timeframes are right smacked on top of one another. But yes, it seems like the feel has changed recently a lot thinking about evolutionary rescue and the dynamics of population size. But that's something that you also worked on, the kind of The kind of eco-evolutionary dynamics earlier on in your career as well, if I recall? I did some, but I. Yeah, there was, no, I worked on ecological character displacement and a few things, a few things like that, but I really think that was extracting selection processes from ecological interactions. There wasn't much feedback on the ecological side. Feedback on the ecological side. Right. There could have been, I suppose. There could have been. That's interesting. Like, what do you think prevented it? Was the field just not at the stage where it was ready to incorporate more complexity that way? I think so. I mean, ecological data are very hard to get. I mean, there are, you know, when, you know, often you're only able to find species that live. Species that live in the same large geographic area, you don't really know how they interact within that area very well because that's just hard to find out. I mean, often the kind of information you would like as a theoretician just isn't there. Right, right. So do you think it was more a matter of trying to make manageable the data that we had and could analyze that led to more of let's just think about the allele frequencies and separate. The allele frequencies and separate out the ecology more than you. I mean, you answer the questions you can answer. Right. Right. And those have changed. And those have changed. So, Monty, when reading over your past papers, they were often so prescient that you were working really before this explosion of data, and yet they came to be so important in understanding that data and current. Current data analyses rely on a lot of what you did. What helped you see what problems to work on, or what would likely pan out and become important? How did you know? How did you choose your projects? I worked on a lot of different things. I'm curious about a lot of different things. A few things panned out and a lot of things didn't pan out. Right, and we don't see those. Right, we don't see those. Yeah, we do. I mean, there are many papers I've written that have disappeared without a trace. And that's fine. At the time, I thought the papers that have, I think, have been cited the most are papers often that I didn't think were very important at the time. Were you surprised by the ones that have become important? Yes. Yes, I mean, I wrote a paper, I think, in 1995. I think in 1995 on an FST-like statistic for microsatellites, called it RST. And I almost didn't publish that because I didn't think it was worth it. But then David Goldstein was publishing a paper that was similar. I mean, it had some of the same logic, but it was doing something different. And I thought, well, if he's going to publish his paper, I might as well publish mine. And then it became a yeah, then it's it's widely cited. And other papers, you know, I wrote one with Bruce Rinella on frequencies of disease-associated alleles, Mendelian diseases. And I was really proud of that paper because I thought there were things you could learn from data that are widely available. And I don't think anybody's that. That's life. Monty, if I could offer an observation, you've always seemed to me to be someone who really keeps up on the literature and not only that, talks with people who are doing current experiments and so understands what's going on currently. Is that part of what Sally asked about? I think it is. I mean, I do try to read the literature some, but I learn a lot more from talking. Some, but I learned a lot more from talking to people individually, and I've learned a lot from having good students and postdocs around. I've always felt I've learned more from them than they ever did from me. I know exactly what you mean. Yes, me too. Well, Monty, thank you so much for being with us here today. This has been a lot of fun, and it is the first installment. And it is the first installment of this series and its reflections on the history of modeling and theory, and associated with the Society for Modeling and Theory in Population Biology. And thank you. You're welcome. It was my pleasure. Thank you, Monty. Bye. Bye-bye.
