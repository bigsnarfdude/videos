The first time meet at at a banff workshop. Also, the first time I've been at a conference where I got caught at the crossfire of a snowball fighter. Are you sure it's crossfire and not? That's also an open question. So in case you're wondering what Renfell Campus is, it's a small university campus in Newfoundland on the west coast of City Pauls. Land on the west coast of the city court, Cornerbrook, which is there. And it's a very exciting week at Parenthal Campus. Anybody know why? Last week of August. Apart from that. There was this much snow. I'm not sure. It's actually a photo of the campus. It is officially 2024 Research Week. So I'm missing Research Week on the grounds of being somewhere to do research, which means I can't watch the three-minute thesis competition or other such activities. Okay, so this talk is about distance regular graphs arising from group actions. So we run into the perennial problem of which object we call G. Object we call G. So in this talk, G will denote a group and graphs will be denoted by gamma. Okay, and so let's suppose we've got a graph gamma and we use the usual notation for the distance between two vertices. And what I'm going to do is pick one of those vertices V and I'm going to split the rest of the graph up into layers according to Layers according to how far they are away from sort of root vertex v. And so we'll call these layers gamma 1, gamma 2, etc. And then, so if you're in layer gamma i of V, what you can do is pick a vertex in here, and its neighbors will either be somewhere in this layer, In this layer, somewhere in the previous layer, or somewhere in the next layer. And, well, in any graph, you can pick a V, make this partition, pick a vertex in that layer, and count how many neighbors there are of each three types. I've denoted these by CI to denote the number in the previous layer, AI, the number of neighbors in the same layer, BI, the number of neighbors in the next layer. And but I haven't specified these with a dependency on V or W. That's because, in a distance regular graph, these parameters depend only on which layer you're in, and not which vertex you started at, and not which vertex you picked in that layer. Okay, so and there's two particularly important subcases. So, one is if you have to If you have a distance regular graph where the diameter is 2, this is the same thing as a strongly regular graph. There's also a case that comes from group actions. If you take a graph and look at its automorphism group, and suppose that you pick a pair of vertices at a particular distance, pick another pair of vertices at the same distance. If there is always some symmetry or automorphism of the graph, which is. Symmetry or automorphism of the graph which takes the first pair onto the second pair. That's something called a distance transitive graph. And distance transitive implies distance regular. Okay, so what we can do with these parameters is we can put them into an array called the intersection array of the graph. There's two stars because we can't have any neighbors before the first layer or after the last layer. The last layer. So those two are undefined. And there's some obvious criteria. So A0 is always 0 because there are no neighbors in layer 0. So all the vertices, oh sorry, all the edges coming out of V go to the next layer, so you end up with a K regular graph. There's only one predecessor from the first layer and so on. From the first layer, and so on. And importantly, the columns all have to add up to the vertex degree or the valency of the graph. So, in that sense, the middle row is kind of redundant, so we can just abbreviate it in this form just by showing the last row and then the third row and then the first row concatenated to this save space. And in the diameter 2 case, well, In the diameter 2 case, where we have what are known as strongly regular graphs, typically you don't give the intersection array, you give the four parameters n, k, lambda, and mu, n being the number of vertices, k being the valency or the degree of a vertex, and then lambda and mu. Well, lambda is the number of common neighbors of a pair of adjacent vertices. So that basically means A1, the number of neighbors in the vertex. Of neighbors in the vertex in the first layer. And is the number of common neighbors of a pair of non-adjacent vertices. So that's like the number of predecessors of a vertex in layer 2, which is the last layer for a strong regular graph. So a lot of information about these graphs is contained in this intersection array. So for instance, you can completely determine the spectrum of the graph of the adjacency matrix from the intersection array. The adjacency matrix from the intersection around a lot of reasons why people are interested in these. So, here's a nice, easy example. So, the cube is a distance regular graph of diameter 3. So, here I've drawn the layers in columns. And say, if you pick a vertex in layer 2, say here, any vertex has two neighbours in the previous layer, no neighbours in the same layer, and one neighbour in the sum. In the subsequent letter. So, this is why you go to parameters 2, 0, 1, and column. So, why should you care about distance regular graphs? Well, a very good reason is because they often look pretty. So, here's a collection of some distance regular graphs of valence 3, some of which have already cropped up this week. This week, some of which I'm not sure have. And so I've been interested in distance regular graphs for a while. And as a result of a project I did where I had been calculating some invariants of distance regular graphs on the computer, I found myself in possession of a bit of a library of computer files of distance regular graphs, but it seemed that my Of distance regular graphs that it seems that might be useful to the rest to other people as well. So I acquired this domain name distanceregular.org and with the help of some undergraduate students from Grenfell over the past few years there's currently about 500 graphs available to download. Each graph has a page with some basic information about it, a picture, if you have About it, picture if you happen to have one, external links to other web pages with information, but most importantly, there are computer files where you can download the adjacency matrix in different formats. I use the GAP computer system and the great package, so that's how most of them were constructed. So, there's, particularly for some of the larger ones, there's GAP files where you can construct. GATT files where you can construct a graph resource model and group. So here's a typical, completely non-random example of a page on the site. So you lose interest in the talk but want to go clicking around on this site. That's okay, I guess. Okay, so so what are these open questions? Are these open questions? And what do group actions have to do with this? So, a lot of the examples of the known examples of distance regular graphs arise from group actions. Like all of the ones on, like the pretty ones on that slide, can all be constructed from a group in some way. Okay, so let's suppose we have a group acting on a set which I'll call omega. It's going to become the vertex set of a graph. Okay, let's suppose. Okay, let's suppose this action is a transitive action, so there's only one orbit on the vertices. Okay, so then, or on the point. So if you look at what the group does to the bordered pairs of elements of this set omega, this will also split into orbits, which we call orbitals. So this is the orbits of pairs. Now, the action is transitive, so there's only one orbit on the set only. So, there's only one orbit on the set omega, but there can be multiple orbits on pairs. There has to be at least two because you can never map a pair of the form xx to a pair of the form xy. But so there's at least two of these, possibly a lot more, and this is what we call the rank of the group action, one of the many multitude of uses of the word rank that exist in the world. That exists in the world. But we can think of these orbitals. Each orbital is essentially a directed graph with vertex at omega, and where you put an arc from one point to another if that pair lies in a particular orbital. And then so the collection of all the orbital diagraphs forms a partition of the sort of complete. Of the sort of complete digraph on the set omega with the loop on each vertex. And so this collection is what's known as a Surian coherent configuration, which is also a term that has cropped up earlier this week. There's different ways of defining it, but this is one way. So here's a simple example. If you take the symmetric group on n elements and then look what it does. And then look what it does to the two-element subsets. Okay, so this is a transitive action, because if you take a two-element subset and another two-element subset, you can always find some permutation of one up to n which will map onto the other. But if we look at pairs of subsets, they split apart into three cases. So pairs where you have pairs AB, first of all, where you just have the same subset twice. Or you could have pairs which intersect and pairs which don't intersect. And there's no way you can map an intersecting pair to a non-intersecting pair. But if you have two intersecting pairs, then you can map the first pair to the second pair. Likewise, if you take two non-intersecting pairs, you could map the first pair to the second pair. So you get an example here of an action of rank three. Three. And the graphs you get are somewhat familiar. So in the first case, all you get is a graph with a loop on each vertex. So we'll ignore those. But the other two, they form a complementary pair of graphs. The Johnson graph JN2, where the vertices of all the two subsets of one at N adjacent if they intersect. And its complement, the Mesa graph, where you have to put your Graph where you have the two elements, vertices, the two element sets adjacent if they are disjoint. And this corresponds to the two cases here. And so K52 is the Peterson graph. This is one of the ways of getting that. So whenever you have a transitive group action, you obtain this sort of collection of directed graphs in this way. So, if you are trying to construct graphs that have this particular group acting on them, what has to happen is if you have any vertex transitive graph, so any graph with a vertex transitive automorphism group, any transitive subgroup of its automorphism group, then the edge set of this graph has to be formed by a union. Formed by a union of orbitals or pairs of orbitals of this group. So if you're trying to construct vertex transitive graphs with particular properties, you can obtain them by gluing together the orbital digraphs. And in particular, if you want the graph to be a distance regular or strongly regular graph arising from Regular graph arising from this group action. The great package by Len Seutscher for the GAP system actually has functions in it which do this in a fairly efficient way. So you feed it a group action and ask, okay, what distance regular graphs are there that have this group acting transitively on its vertices? And particularly if the rank is small, you have a small number of orbitals. Small, you have a small number of orbitals, so you have a small number of possible ways of combining them, and so the computer can run through these fairly quickly. And another thing you have in the GAP computer algebra system is libraries of permutation groups. So in particular, there are libraries of primitive permutation groups on up to around 4,000 points. Work is underway to extend this, but. This. So primitive basically just means that the group does not preserve any equivalence relations other than the two that you have to have, like the equality relation and the universal relation, which you can't avoid having. There are no other equivalence relations preserved by the group we call it primitive. So, for instance, if your group is acting on the vertex set of a graph and the graph is bipartite, then Uh then the two bipartite halves form equivalence classes which are preserved by the uh the group action, so that would be something that's imprimitive. And so, well we have this library and we have this method for searching for distance regular graphs from a group. So, if you're looking for a project to give your undergraduate summer research students, this seems like something that's fairly tractable. So, I had So I had three very good summer students in 2020 through 2022. And basically, what I had been working on was developing code and systematically working through the group libraries searching for the distance regular and strongly regular graphs arising from groups in this library. And each time they found one, like, okay, let's see if we can identify it. Let's see if we can identify it. And so, what's the strategy for doing this? Well, you have, you basically go through the library, all the endpoints, find for each group the possible parameter sets. You might get some isomorphic copies, or you might get some where the group is a full automorphism group. But we throw away those because we know we'll find them later. Them later. The group is an affine-type group, which I'll explain what that means in a little while. You get a sort of vast array of graphs which are often hard to discern from each other. For other types, so there's this Onand Scop theorem which classifies the primitive groups into different uh structures. Most of the others are that arise in this library are the almost simple type, where the group is slightly bigger than a finite simple group. Slightly bigger than a finite simple group. Provided the rank's not too big, we can basically solve them. And we find graphs that fall into known families, or we find graphs that are exceptional but are already well known. Occasionally, you run into some surprises. So, for instance, there's a strongly regular graph on one hundred and twenty vertices, which comes from some unusual action of the symmetric groups in seven. Of the symmetric groups in seven. This does appear sort of in tables in the book on strongly regular graphs by Braun van Walden, but they don't give any details of it. But its parameters are the same as one that's known. And there is, so I took this problem to Belgium, which is what you do when you come across a finite geometry problem that you're stuck on. And so we think we can see a way of constructing this. Can see a way of constructing this graph from some geometry. There's this even more mysterious one on 136 vertices. So there's this action of the projective special linear group arising from 2 by 2 matrices over F17. It has the same parameters as a known graph. We thought we were the first people to notice this, but then we found that some. Notice this, but then we found that some others in Croatia had spotted it about a year earlier. And this graph is still something of a mystery, although it may somebody has claimed to me that it may actually be switching equivalent to the known one. We also found one on 775 vertices that comes from a projective group in three dimensions. In three dimensions. Again, this appears in a table with no details. I did somehow find it in a 30-year-old paper of Farajev. So this is known to exist and it's believed to be some kind of an exception. Okay, so when you go through this search process, there's places where you get stuck. So there's, for instance, Where you get stuck. So, there's, for instance, this rank 12 action of PSL217. Each PSL2Q has an action of this type, but the rank grows as the size of the field grows. So, eventually the computer gets stuck. So, there's a few situations like that. So, it would be nice to be able to say, in these particular cases, the computer search isn't going to work, but we have a theorem that tells us that we can do that. But we have a theorem that tells us what happens, and so some of these open questions would be things that could help us out like that. Okay, so if you take PGL2Q, you take the 2x2 matrices, the invertible 2x2 matrices over field of order Q and then quotient by the subgroup of diagonal matrices, or subgroup of scalar matrices. Scalar matrices, this naturally acts on the one-dimensional subspaces, which is the same as the points of the projective line. And these actions are what are called two-homogeneous, which means that you take a set of size two of them. The group acts transitively on the two-element subsets of a projected line. So these groups have an induced action. These groups have an induced action on unordered pairs of points, which is transitive. So it's q plus 1 choose 2 of those. And you naturally see these Johnson graphs arising in this way, but you might potentially see other things as well. And because the ranks of these groups grow with Q, the computer runs out of steam after a while. But you observe, it goes. It goes far enough for you to observe a pattern. And the pattern seems to be that there's, for small q, there's a couple of exceptions, particularly on 7 2's 2, which is 28 vertices, you get a nice spiral graph called the Coxeter graph. This seems to be the only exception that arises from this action other than the Johnson-Perfaser graph. So, the conjecture, or the open question, is. Conjecture, or the open question is: is this the only grows, do you get the Johnson Knaser graph and nothing else apart from a few small exceptional cases? And so with my former postdoc, Dan Horton, who's now in Croatia, we looked at the PGL case where the group is slightly bigger and you have a bit more to play with. We could show that. We could show that the only diameter two graphs which can arise are the Johnson plator graphs. So, this is kind of a partial solution. You'd also have to rule out that larger diameters are not possible. And also, this only deals with PGL and not PSL. So, this is the first open question. Now Now, so that was PSL and PGL on Q1 choose two points. They also have actions on Q choose two points. And so the geometry here is less obvious, or at least it's less obvious to me. I think if you're Belgian or Italian, it's more obvious apparently. So there's no sort of nice infinite family that arises. Infinite family that arises from this action that you always get. So here the pattern is that a few small exceptions show up when Q is small, including this mystery rank 12 graph from PSL217. But the pattern is that other than that, you shouldn't find anything. So here the open question is. So, here the open question is: is this the largest exception? So, if you take PSL or PGL2Q for Q greater than 17, there should be no distance regular or strongly regular graphs arising from those actions other than just putting all the orbitals together and getting a complete graph. So, this is open question number two. The third open question is a slightly different type of question and it comes from these permutation groups of affine type, which I said I'd come back to. So, what's a group of affine type? So, basically, when you have a group of matrices, Matrices, so or a subgroup of the general linear group on some vector space, you can form these affine transformations. So TAB takes X to basically AX plus B. So for any, so as well as the linear transformation you get from the matrix A, you also get the translation. You also get the translations as well. So you don't just get the image of X under a linear transformation, you shift it by some element of the vector space B. So we can view this as a permutation group on the vector space. So it's acting on the vector space V, and the stabilizer of any element is. Element is this matrix group H. So the stabilizer of zero is just when you're translating by zeros, you've only got the linear transformation. But it's a transitive action, so you can replace zero with any other vector. And if you want a finite group of affine type, it turns out, well, obviously, the size of the vector space is a prime power. The vector space is a prime power. And there are vast numbers of finite affine groups. Even if we just restrict to ones with primitive actions, there are huge numbers of groups that have a prime power degree of this type. The fact that you have these translations, this gives you a subgroup isomorphic to the additive. Group isomorphic to the additive group of the vector space. And this is an elementary abelian p group. It's actually the additive group of vector space over a field of prime power order. So if you're looking for a graph with a group like this acting on it, it has to be a Cayley graph of this elementary abelian p group, z p to the f. This is a case where everything you get is a paper graph. So we look at this by sort of degree of the group, the number of vertices of the graph. The way to do it is looking at the dimension of the space over this prime field. So if you have a one-dimensional space over the prime field, so the vector space is. The prime field. So the vector space is just the field. Here we're looking for a circulant graph. We're looking for a Cayley graph on a cyclic group. And the distance regular circulant graphs were classified about 20 years ago by Miklovich and Potochnik. And appropriately for banff, the only graphs you get apart from complete graphs are Paley graphs. Looking for a distance from the graph. Looking for a distance regular or strongly regular circular graph of prime order. So then, so for one dimension, we know exactly what to do. For two dimensions, then, well, it turns out the dimension of the vector space is an upper bound on the diameter of the graph you can obtain. So for m equals 2, we're just looking for strong. We're just looking for strongly regular KD graphs on this elementary abelian group of dimension two. And here, there's a whole bunch of different objects which arise, which all tie together sort of neatly. There's an equivalence between the strong regular K graphs, partial difference sets in the group, subsets of lines in the affine plane on the vector space. affine plane on the vector space and odd and subsets of the complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares that you can construct naturally from the field of order p. So there's a lot of things tied together here and a good place for an explanation of these connections is the master's thesis of Natalie Mollen who is one of Chris Godsall's students. We'll talk about that. Cloud source students. The tricky part is identifying which of these groups are primitive, but at least we have a place where to look. So the open question here is what happens for dimension three? Dimension four looks way too hard, and you get way too many examples coming out to make much sense of any kind of a pattern. But for dimension three, it does look kind of tractable. Tractable because there are only a few things that showed up. So, one thing is the Hamming graph, the three-dimensional Hamming graph, which should be P, which is kind of a natural Payley graph on the elementary abelian P group. You get the Paley graph of order P cubed, when P is 1 mod 4. You get some other graphs with the Paley parameters. Parameters. So same parameters as a paleograph, but not necessarily self-complementary and not necessarily as easy to explain. You also get things like some complete multipartite graphs, but if you're looking for things with primitive automorphism groups, it seems that you should only find these, like the Hamming graphs and things with Paley parameters. So I've run out of time, so I won't tell you the last questions, and I will stop here. But I think we just have
