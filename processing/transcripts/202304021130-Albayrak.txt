So we are back. I know we didn't really go very far with that one, but Sita Al-Bayrak will be talking to us today about quantitative estimates on the size of an intersection of other states. So go ahead and take it away. Thank you for the invitation and thanks for organizing this conference. It's been really nice. It's my first time in Belf. Yeah, so today I'm going to focus. Um, yeah, so today I'm going to talk about quantitative estimates on the size of an intersection of sparse sets. Um, and I will define what a sparse set is. So, here is the outline. Well, in the introduction, I will first introduce finite automata and tell you what an automatic set is. Because here, when I said intersection of sparse sets, there are sparse automatic sets actually. And then I will move to what's called Covin's theorem. I'm going to talk about sparse atomic sets, say the main result, and then I will finish with a conjecture. So in the introduction, as motivation, let's start with the conjecture of Arbus. So here it says for n greater than or equal to 9, 2 to the n is not the sum of distinct fibers of 3. So basically, So basically, yeah, up to the power of 9, maybe there are some numbers where you can write 2 to the k as a sum of powers of 3. And basically, so what this is saying is, if you look at this expansion, if you look at this expansion, right, so it's saying that the set of powers of two and so on the right-hand side, you can think of this. Hand side, you can think of this as ternary expansions that omit two because it's always one or zero, right? Um, so because the conjecture is saying that, well, this is not going to happen always after nine or after eight, the conjecture is actually saying that these two sets have finite intersection. And so, this conjecture was mentioned in a paper called. Was mentioned in a paper called Some Unconventional Problems in Number Theory. Basically, he mentioned there are some problems in number theory that are easy to pose but very hard to solve. And so, as he says, as far as I can see, there's no method at our disposal to attack this conjecture. We didn't solve the conjecture, but I will get back to the conjecture at the end. So, now, what is What is automatic about this? Again, I will define it, but we will see that the set of powers of two is a two-automatic set, and the second set consisting of numbers whose ternary expansion is omit two is a three-automatic set. Again, I don't define these things, but I'm just introducing a head. Another conjecture, again, for motivation. Katava's conjecture is saying that the only solution in dimensional numbers Solution in the natural numbers of this equation x to the a minus y to the b equals one. We are looking at solutions here in natural numbers and also we want a b to be greater than one and xy to be greater than zero. So we're not looking at the trivial ones. Is x is equal to three and a is equal to two, so it's like you know, two, sorry, three squared is two cubed plus one. Q cubed plus one. And this is the only solution in the natural numbers. So this conjecture was actually proved. I won't go into that. But if you look at this, what we see is this set, if you look at the set consisting of two to the n plus ones, right, if you move the y to the other side, we're going to see that that's actually a sparse two automatic set. And the powers of three is a sparse three automatic set. And what this conjecture is saying. What this conjecture is saying or theorem is saying that the intersection is finite. Okay, so I mentioned automatic sets and sparse automatic sets. So let's see what automatic is. To see this, I'm going to first define what an automata is. So this is a formal definition, and I hope you don't get dazzled by it. So I'll go through it quickly. So deterministic pointite automaton DFA. Deterministic finite automaton DFA for short is a pipe tuple. So here we have Q is a non-empty finite set of states. These are going to be vertices. I'm going to show you this looks like a graph at the end. Sigma is a finite input alphabet. So you can think of this as what we were looking at, you know, like all base k extensions or tenery extensions. So in base k, you have digits only up to k minus one. So that's what sigma will look like. Is one so that's what sigma will look like, and then I said, well, the states will be vertices, so this function is telling you as you read the digits what to do and where to go among the vertices. And you need a place to start from, so q0 is the initial state, and then a subset of q is going to be the set of accepting states. Small note here that this function. Small note here that this function is only defined over reading letters and we're going to be feeding words. But you can easily extend this to sigma star, and sigma star means, you know, sigma is the alphabet and sigma star is the set of all finite words over this alphabet. Okay, so maybe that was too abstract, so I kept the definition and let's look at this tonight. I'll use the cursor. So here, So here, you know, so these are the states, finance to the states. There are three states, so that's Q. Sigma is zero, it consists of zero and one. So delta is basically these arrows. You know, it tells you where to go. Q0 is the initial state. The accepting states are the ones that are double circled. So here Q1 is the only accepting state. So, well, the examples. So, well, the example says, okay, this DFA accepts the words of the form 1000. Zero start is just to say, maybe I'll read here. You know, so it's like one zero to the end, so it could be one zero, one, zero, zero. And the convention you adopt is you're going to read from right to left. So for example, if you're reading one zero zero, right, you start from q0. You start from Q0, you read zero, you're still in Q0. You read one more zero, you're still in Q0. Once you read one, you end up in Q1, and that's an accepting state. So this word is accepted. And if you read anything else after that, well, the word is not of that form anymore, and hence it will be rejected because you're going to move here. Once you move here, you're stuck there. There is no way to come back. To come back, okay. So, that was an uh, that was an automaton, uh, and that's how we define a k-automatic set. So, k for us is greater than or equal to two. And we are looking at a subset of n. You can think of the powers of two if you want. Uh, that's going to be my example, anyways. So, what you do is you look at the elements of S and you look at their Of S, and you look at their base k expansions, right? And then those are words over sigma k. And if you can find an automaton accepting precisely the elements of S in base k expansions, then you coalesce a k-automatic set. So here is the same automaton. Now we are looking at it as a, you know, to have a conclusion about a set, but well, one zero star is precisely telling you the power. Precisely telling you the powers of two, right? Um, in like binary expansion. So, this is an automaton accepting the set of powers of two. So, now in the first slide, I said set of powers of two is a two-automatic set. So, now we know this part, right? So it is a two-automatic set, according to this definition. Okay, so I want to quickly go over this correspondence. Quickly go over this correspondence. You know, if you have a natural number, you have the base k expansion. So you could find the word with all the words. And then if you have a word over sigma k, then you can go back to have a natural number. So this is like there's a there's a unique one for each side, and this is a one-to-one correspondence. I put here some examples, but I guess everybody knows binary extensions and uniques. So now Debasis. So now the results I'm going to mention will be in multi-dimensions. So how can we extend this notion to subsets of entity? So in this case, we're not going to have one natural number. We're going to have a detruple of natural numbers. Maybe I'll use the cursor again. Right, so each of these are natural numbers. Numbers and technically, well, if you fix the k you can write each of them in base k so in this case as well there exists words of the same length with the property that each wi is a base k expression of excuse me an i and obviously they may not have the same length uh what we do is if they don't have the same length uh we just add leading zeros here to We just add leading zeros here to make each coordinate have the same length in terms of the words. And so here, well, this is six, but we just look at it as 0020 so that the length is the same in each coordinate. And now we can define what being a chaotomatic set means if the set is a subset of n to the d and not just natural numbers. And the definition is really the same. Is really the same, you can find a finite automaton, right? This time, the input alpha vector will be sigma k to the d because they're d coordinates that accepts precisely these works corresponding to the d tuples of natural numbers in s okay, so now I don't know if you remember the conjectures, but in the conjectures, you know, there's a two-automatic stat, three automatic. There's a two-automatic set, three automatic set, two and three are multiplicatively independent. So, here I'm gonna mention problems theorem. So, we have k and l both greater than or equal to two. They're natural numbers and they're multiplicatively independent. That means if you're looking at k today equals l to the b, there are no non-trivial integer solutions. So, this theorem says that if you take a subset of n that is subset of n that is both k-authmatic and l-authmatic then s has to be eventually periodic as a set and what do we mean eventually periodic for a set is that there is some fixed positive integer such that for sufficiently large n if n is in s then n plus c is also in s so that's what we mean by eventually for s so this theorem was extended to multi-dimensions that To multi-dimensions, that's a whole common seminal theorem. It's a finite set event. Yeah, I think so. It is a finite set. Yeah, I mean, I guess sufficiently large and is the way backwardsly cube, I guess. Okay, so I don't know. In terms of looking at the other properties we talk about, the finite set would work. That's why I said yes. I don't know. I guess you can choose C to B. I mean, you can say for sufficiently light. And because there's no sufficiently light, and yes, this guy could stick to any. Back to stick to any time, yeah. This is just for the eventually part. So maybe like n in s implies n plus c is an s won't hold on the time. There's no n if s is minus there's no no bit n. Yeah, this is okay. Yeah, I don't know. I'm confused. I then really and it's not that large. I'm just saying sufficiently large. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, okay, maybe it won't be eventually periodic, but if it's if it's finite, then you don't really need to like work on it that much. work on it that much it's only a finite finite set and it will it can be both k and l automatic and it will be finite anyways um so seminal theorem is just uh stating a similar thing this time uh the set is a subset of antibodies and it's saying if it's both k and l automatic k and l are multiplicatively independent again then the set will be automatic with respect to all integer bases and what i All integer bases, and what I mean is, well, then it's going to be like SOMADI for all s greater or equal to one. So what our result is, is kind of Cabum Semeno theorem for sparse automatic sets, because these are only for automatic sets. So what is sparse? To define that, we have this kind of accounting function. kind of a counting function pi sx. We can define this for subset of n to the d, but if you take d equals one, it also works for subsets of n. So what we are doing is if you think about it as a subset of n, you're just counting the number of elements in s up to x. And in multi-dimensions, you just check because it's the detupal, you check the sum you want. You want the detuple such that the sum of the coordinates will be less than or equal to x. And for k-dynamic sets, we have a dichotomy. Okay, so this wouldn't work if the set is just a subset of n to the d. It's important that this dichotomy is for k-dominic sets. And it says that either this counting function This counting function is polylogarithmically bounded, or it grows at least as a fractional power of x here. And basically, what we call a set sparse is if you're in the in case one, that's called a sparse kerodermic set. And if you think about the set of powers of two, you'll see that it is. You'll see that it is holier-meekly bounded at the growth. So it's a sparse two-automatic set. Okay. Here, maybe, I guess I have left five minutes. So here is just where sparse texts arise in other contexts. Maybe I'll skip that because these are in different areas, anyways. But the point is, they do arise as well. The point is, they do arise elsewhere. It's not like, oh, I'm the only one who's working. Yeah, so these are well known and then they're studied, but also in different contexts, they're working on something else. And then, oh, well, we can describe this. Oh, this set is sparse, kind of. Really like just emerges somewhere. Okay, so sparse sets are nice because there is a There is a description of them. So, a spar set is a finite union of sets of this form. And here, so the Vi's and Wi's are words. And this star means, again, the W1 is getting repeated a number of times. We don't know, but it's finite. And yeah, Vi's might be empty, but Wi's are not empty. And then this stands for taking the base k expansion. Taking the base k expansion. So, there's gonna, this is the form, and there's gonna be only finitely many of these, and then that describes the sparse k-odomatic set already. Here is a factor. Well, if you do the base k expansion, you get a nice description as when you look at it as a in natural numbers as well. So, this would only work for a subset of n, but this description. But this description is, it can also be in multi-dimensions. So, anyway, so this is nice, right? So, powers of k. I mentioned this because it helps you prove things. So, our theorem is saying that K and L are multiplicatively independent again. If X is a sparse k-levelic subset of N to the V, Of n to the V and Y is a sparse electromagnetic subset of N to the V, then X intersection Y is finite. So obviously, I mean, here we are not like, it wouldn't ruin anything if one of the sets is finite, but that's not what we're considering. And so to prove this, we proved a quantitative version where we actually give a bound and that shows that the size of the intersection is finite. Of the intersection is finite, and so that's why I give the formal definition of an automaton because you know, so you have these five tuples, and this time the language will be over sigma k to the d because we are in d dimensions. So these are the languages. I guess I didn't say what the language is, but so. So, what we do is: well, X is the corresponding set to the language L that's accepted by the first autonom, and then Y is the one corresponding to the second one. And so we have this bound. Let me talk about where these factors come from. So, this part, the first part, comes from counting how many sets are in this unit. Sets are in this union because we said you take a sparse set, it's a finite union of sets of this form. I call these sets of this form simple sparse sets. So, a sparse set is a finite union of simple sparse sets. So, how many sets are in that finite union? It's kind of like this first part. And then, for the second part, this is where I want you to remember this. I will write it again. Basically, right, so if you write that for both x and y, right, you get something like this. So you can make this equation for the intersection where xi will be powers of k and y i will be powers of l, right? And then for the intersection, you're interested in this. And to solve this, sorry, I'm going to go back. Back to solve that, we use S-unit theory. So, there's the S-unit theorem. We need a quantitative version, so we use this one, which gives a nice bound. There are a lot of bounds found for this, but this is kind of, I think, one of the good ones. The other ones have exponentials in it. So, we use this theorem to get a bound on the non-digital. Get a bound on the non-degenerate solutions to an equation like this. I say like this, not exactly this. And that's where the second factor comes from. You can see like it's the same eight. And the other ones are a bit different. So, because I didn't have time, I'm going through this a bit fast. What I want to say is go back to Circle, back to Adlish. Circle back to Abush. So let's define the density of a subset of n as the limit where you take the limit over n. The numerator is the counting function of s divided by n if it exists. So in example, the sparse subsets of n have zero density. And what we did is, you know, X was sparse the automatic and Y was sparse Lodomatic. So our continuum. L-automatic. So, our conjecture is that now, if y is a set that has zero density, still all automatic, the intersection would still be finite. So you're kind of loosening the condition here a little bit. And if you go back to Ardus's conjecture, the powers of two sparse two automatic, right? And the set consisting of numbers whose ternary expansions omit two, it's three automatic with zero density. Pre-oromatic with zero density. So, if you think about it, Abyss's conjecture is a special case of this conjecture. Yeah, thank you.
