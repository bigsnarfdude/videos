Questions. Thank you, Alice. Hello. Good afternoon, at least in Spain. I want to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. We have been friends for many years, and it's an honor to be the speaker of the last session. I will try to. I will try to convey some of the things I have been doing recently. The talk will deal with diffusion, which is a subject I have been doing for several decades. And in particular, the practical thing I do today is the fractional diffusion in the case of what is called the SP Labor. And I will explain the contents of several papers that I did recently. That they did recently on this p lablation in the evolution that generates flow and it's between p larger than two, p less than two, and the solutions with growing data. So let's begin. So diffusion is Is a way of describing how continuous media, say, populations spread to occupy available space, and models come from different applications, fluids, chemicals, bacteria, animal populations. So, there is no difficulty in the physics to justify the use of diffusion. The question for mathematicians is to try to model if. To model efficiently the diffusion process that we find in nature. And this question has received, as people in this audience know, two different answers in recent history, means in the last century. One of them is modeling random walk and more generally, Brownian motion and stochastic processes. And this is the way particles diffuse, and there is a whole body of diffusion processes. Of diffusion processes in probability. And this was the most natural approach to a certain sense, but curiously, mathematics has its ways. And the second approach that was pioneered, the connection between the second approach and the first was pioneered in particular by Kol Muhorov, is that diffusion mathematics can be represented faithfully in many instances by the heat equation, in other instances by the In other instances, by the family of equations that were derived from the heat equation. In understanding this double way has been the source of much effort. And as you could see in some of the talks, the work continues today. We will think here about the basic approximation by using a PD approach. A PD approach, and we want to know how much of it is linear or how much of it is essentially non-linear. For many decades, linear models were used, but we have seen in the workshop that non-linearity is very prevalent today. On the other hand, the stationary states of diffusion belong to elliptic equations, and they are really a main subject in the PDE theory, and they are related to many applications. To many applications and in theory, to the calculus of variations. And again, this was seen in these lectures in the past days. And then the Laplacian is really the main differential operator that we use. But recently, the fractional Laplacian became a close family worth studying, as you have been seeing even this afternoon. And how strong is the theory? This is what we want to understand. Uh, understand, and this is part of what we are doing. A number of people a detailed text explaining my work in view of the basic theory of non-linear and non-local diffusion was written several years ago. And I put it here for you to just see if you are interested in the particulars of the non-linear diffusions that are not of non-local type. Of non-local type. And what I will do is try to go to the fractional diffusion. I just remember that fractional diffusion became important in the applications because it was a way of replacing the difficulty of the Laplacians to represent long-range interactions. And when people in probability discovered that long-range interactions were important, the anomalous diffusion with levy Or levy profiles was discovered, and then there was a time to translate that to mathematics. And the operator in mathematics has a symbol corresponding to this anomalous diffusion. And the simplest of all the symbols is the minus operation to the S, which is the fractional applian. And if you go to parabolic, the simplest equation is the fractional heat equation. And this progress in PDEs was slow for a time. Was slow for a time. But then, around 2006-07, Professor Caffarelli got involved. I was in touch with him. And I read when I was in Texas this particular beautiful work, which is the thesis of Luis Silvestre with Caffarelli. And there are different formulas for the rational appliances that have been used here. So I will not go into that, just remember that this is a singular interact. Singular interal operator that has to be carefully defined, and you use in the linear cases Fourier transform, or you can use the Levy-Process approximation, taking random walks. And there are other ways of doing it that considering doing the alpha harmonic extension a la caffarelle silvestre or the Caffarelli Silvestre, or the semi-group formula that is very typical in the semi-group people. So, once this introduction has been done, I will try to go to the main subject of this talk, which is the evolution spillerplation. The idea to begin with is that the non-local energy functional of Walliardo type is very well known and And it's in the origin of the definition of WSP spaces, the fractional spaces called Sobolev for Slobodeski-Rayardo. And then you define the norm, and immediately after, you discover that you can define the sub-differential because this is a convex functional for p larger than one, an S between zero and one. And the operator that you find as Euler Lagrange is this one. You can see this reference. And what I was trying to do. And what I was trying to do is, in my first paper on this subject that was published last year, doing the properties of the evolution in the whole space with initial data U naught. And it's not difficult to prove that this operator generates a semi-group in all LQ spaces, so this is not the problem. And in fact, it is a continuous strong solution, a semi-group with continuous strong. semi-group with continuous strong solutions. This is part of the properties that gets from being a p-laplacian. And we did some calculus in bounded domains, but this is a different theory. What I want to prove here is the result that says that there is a cell similar solution that will be used to represent the asymptotic behavior. And this is a similar solution in the typical barrel. In the typical Baron Blatt style, it has a profile, has a dependence on T, and has a dependence on the mass. The two similarity exponents are defined by dimensional considerations, and the profile is the only thing that is important to prove. So, how do you prove that there is a solution of a certain equation that allows you to get a soliton for this problem? Well, first of all, let's say that you can. Well, first of all, let me show you the graphics of the profiles once they were getting numerically. These numerical calculations were done by Felix del Tesso. And this is the different profiles that you see when you change the value of S. In all of these cases, even if you have a P laplation with P larger than one, the long-range intervention The long-range interaction makes the solution have tails, but they are not like Gaussians. If you take a logarithm, this is like a power, because in logarithmic scale, it looks linear. And then once you get the profile, you can get the syntotics in the typical style of the Bar and Black book. That the solution that begins with initial data with Initial data with finite mass will converge to the solitone. And how do you do that? Well, since I don't have time and this is the last talk, let me just tell you the main items. One of them is the scaling transformations because this equation has powers around. The second thing is proving that solutions in L1 are really in L infinity for all positive times. This is called the smoothing effect. Times. This is called the smoothing effect. The third item is conservation of mass that can be proved. Fourth is compactness due to the energy estimates that are typically associated to evolution semigroup of diffusion type. And then you have to prove that the solutions are strictly positive. This is a very technical, important technical thing that is related to the non-degeneracy of... Non-degeneracy of the integrals that appear. And finally, you get the Lyapunov function that I will try to describe to you. But all of these things that are relatively well known need something in order to avoid the solution to disappear either down or up. And we need barrier from above and from below. In fact, due to mass conservation, only the barrier from above is enough. From above is enough. So the barriers are functions that are constructed explicitly using the form that we are predicting for the solution. So there will be a bump in the middle and they will have the power that we have calculated by numerical analysis. It will take a lot of time to calculate it, but it works. Once you get this, you discover that this is a theorem in the space. This is a theorem in the spirit of the theorems of possession similarity and asymptotics. And in nonlinear diffusion, there is no representation theorem, so the Gaussian cannot be used as a way of proving asymptotic behavior. And there is all of these nonlinear methods developed after the work of Barenblatt that we have been trying to push for in the last years. Much of the work that has been done was difficult. That has been done and was difficult concerns the case P less than two that I didn't talk here, the fast diffusion case. In the local case, in the classical case, it there was lots of work that I did with Carrillo, with Blanchette, with Dolbeau, Montfort, etc. In the non-linear fractional diffusion, constructing the solitons took me some time in 2011 with Caffarelli, in 2014 by myself in a paper. Myself in a paper published in the Journal of the European Mathematical Society. So they are not trivial things. Let me jump on that and let me tell you now what is the fast range of the P-Laplacian equation. In fact, the fast or super diffusive case looks like an extension of the P larger than 2, and the papers begin by constructing a flow. In the gradient flow, in the same way. But the problem is when you face the asymptotic analysis, and it discovered that there is a critical number to n over n plus s, below which things are too difficult, too different from the barren blood ideology that we represented in the p-lage of the two. So the theories will be. So the theories we will prove in the second paper is for PC less than P less than 2. And the P case equals 2 will be included. This is a paper that has been published recently. And you see that the theorem looks the same. In fact, it is something that we look for, that the theorem will be the same. The only difference is what is the F. Difference is what is the f and how do you calculate the behavior of the f. And there is a good point in the theorem that if you go below the critical exponent, then you get no fundamental solution. This is something that usually happens in many evolution problems, in many elliptical problems when you go past criticality. So the comments is that PC is precisely the exponent where the self similar rate Exponent where the self similar rates alpha and beta diverge. So it has to fail the representation when you go out of this p-range. And there is no problem with the mass. The mass can be rescaled. The case of the explicit behavior of the fundamental profile, F is known in the pillarplace and case for S equals 1, but there was no way of finding nothing explicit for S less. Founding nothing explicit for s less than one. And then we discovered a new critical exponent in this good range that looks very strange. There are some strange exponents also in the Sering, Joseph Lungering, etc. theory for non-linear literature programs. This is the one that I found, and let me tell you what happens. Well, at the beginning, the theorem says that there is a similar behavior, that if you are below P1, which is the intermediate exponent, you look like classical fast diffusion. If you are on top of P1, you look like the typical tail of the non-linear fractional diffusion. So there are two things. One of them is local. two things one of them is local one of them is classical when you they agree you get p1 and of course for for p1 you get the logarithm uh correction of the decay and uh there are of course as i say two types of decay the fast diffusion decay we and the typical fractional diffusion decay and if you look at the graph the The blue line here corresponds to m plus sp, which is the fractional, and the sp over 2 minus p corresponds to the classical pilaplation. And they just agree here, and you will use one of them to get your tails. The analysis of the tails produced by the fundamental solution. By the fundamental solutions is important in all applications where you can use more complicated models. So, because Professor Dolvo said today, all the kinds of analysis of convergence of estimates depend very much on the way the tests behave. So, this is a contribution of this paper. And then, the asymptotic behavior works in the case P between C, P C and two. C P C A 2. And you get how do you get this convergence in the asymptotic behavior? Many people know that it is important to rescale the equation to get away from the decay corresponding to cell similarity and define a new function v that will be renormalized. So you change the u into v and you change the x into y and you get. The x into y, and you get a certain elliptic evolution equation that has an extra term. But this equation has a priori estimates that make it be bounded. So in the end, you will eliminate the derivative with respect to t and get an elliptic equation that you have to solve. And this is the point that you have to do to get the solution, the fundamental solution. The fundamental solution. In order to justify the derivative of T corresponding to tau of V goes to zero, you use the typical entropy estimates. And this is the equation that you have to prove. Then from that equation, you get your barriers. And this is the typical behavior of the fast diffusion equations. These are numerics that produce this. numerics that produce this. We have calculated the P1 in order to be sure that this works. So once you get into fast diffusion, you remember that the separation of variables is another trick of trying to get solutions for the evolution equation from the solutions for the elliptic equation. But if you do separation of variables, the elliptic equation will have singular solutions. have singular solutions and these singular solutions are very very interesting because they are called the whole u infinity a very singular solution so i will i devoted in the paper lots of space to study very singular solutions that have this profile and they are the limits as the mass tends to infinity of the rest of the solutions when you are in the good range and then we get the global hard type estimates which is something Hardna-type estimates, which is something that several of my friends in these talks have been talking about. This works in this equation, it takes very refined results, and in particular the use of the very singular solutions. And in the case where P is less than PC, things, very strange things happen. In particular, there is extension in finite time because this separate variable singular solution variable singular solution changes the order of t minus t. It's capital T minus T, so extinguishes in finite time. And the next thing I wanted to say is that third paper, I studied the question of rowing solutions of the fractional pillarplation equation in the fast efficient range. This is something that will appear in the linear analysis. And it's curious because in order to get because in order to get solutions for data that grow, you need local estimates. And for the pila placian, the simplest local estimates called in the literature Herrero Pierre do not work very well. In fact, they work for the fast diffusion porous medium. So I had to work to try to see if in the local case you can get weighted glow. You can get weighted global integral estimates that depend only on the weights, but they are not really local in the sense of multiplying by a function of compact support. You multiply the function, ut the solution, by a certain test function that has to be positive and decay carefully between two allowed exponents. If you do that, then you manipulate the intervals of the iteration by parallel. Of the integration by parts, and you get the typical estimate of relatively local type that says that a certain power of the weighted mass will be controlled in both directions, but what happened before. And this constant depends on the weight, and the weight has to be in the class that we have specified before. So why do you use this? Why do you use this? In fact, if you do this, you can prove that the optimal rate of growth for solutions with growing data is mu, where mu is sp over p minus one. And this is something that in the fast diffusion is false in the classical fast diffusion, because every locally interable initial data is acceptable. Is acceptable. I prove by construction of explicit and similar solutions that you cannot go away from this limitation. In the case of the local PNME and local PLE, there is no growth condition. In our case, there is a certain condition that is exactly the growth exponent S P over P minus one. And then once you get the theory that covers Once you get a theory that covers low ranges of p, you can prove the extinction in finite time when p is less than pc. This is a whole theory that has to be read. I have no time for that. And what I will do is stop here because this is the last talk. I thank you for your attention. Muchas gracias. Greetings to beautiful Oaxaca. My son was there a week ago and he liked it very much. He liked it very much, and um, thank you all to everybody. Thank you very much, Monuis, for this very useful talk. We have some minutes for questions. Any remark? I have a question. I have a question. Beluis, at some point you said that you could prove a kind, I mean, you have a description of the Barenberg profiles. Is there a case, I don't remember, where they are explicit or they are always non-explicit? Because it's in the SP Laplation, there are no explicit cases that I have found. Ah, okay. Okay, so the Ah, okay. Okay, so the task is really, really hard. Yeah, I mean, it happens in many of these local problems, but you can get the precise tails. The tails are very precise, and depending on the new strange exponent P1, you can get tails with a precise constant and tails with not precise constant. Yes, this is. So it looks a bit. So it looks a variation. It has many similarities to what you have been doing with Simonov and Diana, but it has many differences. Yeah, there is a whole, I mean, it seems like what happens in the subcritical range in the classical piraplash, right? That you can have other tails or something like that. It's really nice. Or something like that. It's really nice.
