Also, I wanted to apologize for not being there. I have lingering symptoms from some nasty viral infection, and hopefully, it won't be a problem today. I'm still coughing, but so far, so good. I wanted to talk to you today about a model for phase separation. I'm gonna definitely have time to introduce the model and. Introduce the model and discuss it a bit. And I can briefly discuss what we've been able to do analytically with it, which will probably be the most interesting for this audience. So hopefully I'll get to that. Yes. If anybody has questions, also feel free to stop me in the middle. It's fine. Let's see. Oops. Yeah. So this is joint work with my former PhD student, Abdulaziz Al-Sinaf. PhD student Abdulaziz Al-Sanafi. He's now at the University of Kuwait. And then the analytical work has been done with Nancy Rodriguez in Colorado. Java Yodesh, who's now joined us here at TU Delft, and Nicola Zamponi. So I'm going to be talking about what the, well, just mathematical background. Probably I will go through this quickly because we've been seeing several variations of these things. And then I'll introduce the micro. And then I'll introduce the microscopic model that we came up with and talk about the simulations there and then the derivation of the macroscopic model. And if I have time, I'll talk a little bit about the work that's been done analytically to analyze this model. Just in terms of where I come from, I actually work mostly with interacting particle models. So I look at collective dynamics for organisms, usually. Dynamics for organisms. Usually, for my case, it's been fish and humans, although I've also done some other fun things. But what I'm interested in is basically models that reflect some sort of macroscopically observable phenomenon. And these kinds of things are often observed empirically. Sometimes they can be experimentally studied. And that's generally what I do. And that's generally what I do: is look at things that, well, I'm interested in looking at things that are close to the physical reality. And as we all know, when we're thinking about collective dynamics in the context of kinetic theory, there's three different regions, three different regimes we can look at. We can think about them microscopically as individual interacting particles. We can think about the mesoscopic regime or the kinetic regime, where we're thinking about still capturing the complexity of the interactions among them. The complexity of the interactions among the particles, but zooming out a little bit. And then we can think about the macroscopic regime where we're thinking about looking at things essentially from far away. And what I'm going to be discussing today also has to do with phase transitions. So phase transitions are observed in a lot of different models for collective dynamics, as well as many physical models. And basically, the idea is that the macroscopic behavior depends. Is that the macroscopic behavior depends on the parameter values, and you get some change between a certain kind of collective dynamics and a different kind of collective dynamics. So here we can think about agents which are just uniformly spread out and they're moving around and basically ignoring each other on the left here. And on the right, we can think about an agent density evolving in such a way that agents have one type climate. Way that agents of one type clumped together and agents of a different type clumped together, and they really form separate phases. And you can sort of think of this as solid, liquid, and gas phases from physics. And in terms of these phase transitions, things like order parameters, energies, Hamiltonians can be defined in order to help track the phase transition, in order to help tell when you're seeing one dynamic or a different dynamic. Seeing one dynamic or a different dynamic. So that'll also play in later in my talk. In the context of kinetic models, these kinds of phase transitions come up quite a bit, which we've already seen this week. There was a lovely talk yesterday about this. And I think I'll skip that. What I'm interested in, or at least what started me on this project, was thinking about actually gangs, gang diagnostic. Gangs, gang dynamics. So I worked at UCLA in the crime modeling group, and they were interested in what role graffiti plays in sort of the way that territories might develop for gangs. Although this model also can be used for other things. So you could also think of it as sort of as any kind of chemo-repellent model, basically. But here when I frame the Where when I frame the model, I'm going to be talking about agents in a gang. So I'll talk about gang members and I'll talk about tags put down. You can see those here on the wall. A gang tag is basically something saying, this gang claims this space. And here you can see different gangs have crossed out other gangs' tags. So this would be an area with disputed territory where there's different gangs fighting for control of the space. Of the space, and you see this a lot in cities with active gangs. I developed a with Abdul al-Sanafi, I developed a lattice model for territorial development, and that's what I'm going to be focusing on today. So, in this lattice model, we put down particles, we think about them as red or blue particles, and initially, these particles are uniformly distributed over a toroid. Distributed over a torus. So we're thinking about periodic boundary conditions. And agents have some probability of putting down a marking on the lattice site where they currently are. So in this case, my red agent did put down a mark. So it gets a sort of reddish tint at the site. And then agents are forced to move. So agents can move up, down, left, or right to one of those neighboring lattice sites. In this model, the total number of agents. Model, the total number of agents in each gang is conserved. So we have red agents walking around and blue agents walking around. None disappear, none change sides. And then we also have this graffiti and the graffiti, the graffiti is put down and it decays away. And yes. And then we base our assumption really on the we base our model on the assumption. We base our model on the assumption that the gangs claim territory by actually tagging, so by this tagging procedure. And each gang essentially preferentially avoids areas marked by the other gang. So here we have gang members. We don't limit the number of gang members on an individual site. So there can be as many as there want to be. There's no sort of exclusion there. In this case, we have three neighboring sites that are blue. That are blue, and what the red agents try to do is preferentially avoid going to those three blue sites. So they'll go in a direction away from the blue. And the blue agents similarly don't want to go onto the don't want to go onto the places marked with the red. So these blue agents will try to avoid this spot. So maybe they'll go up, maybe they'll go right, maybe they'll go down, but they're much less likely to go left. To go left. In some situations, for example, if a blue agent is surrounded by red, then it'll essentially have to be forced onto a spot with a red tag, but it's not going to be happy about it. These gang members, these agents do not interact directly. So the only sort of interaction that happens is between them and the tag, the graffiti field. So they're only interacting through the graffiti. So, they're only interacting through the graffiti field. They essentially are ignoring each other. And we call the density of agents for gang A, row A, and the density of agents for gang row B, for gang B, we call row B. So we have the density of agents at site X, Y, and at time t. And it's denoted this way. And this is the density of gang B. And this is the density of gang B agents. We also have a density of gang A and gang B graffiti. And so that we call C A and X B. Oops. And then we can think about the probability of an agent moving from one site to the neighboring site. So let's focus on Gang A agents. Gang A agents. Gang A agents want to move from site X1Y1 to site X2Y2. The probability of moving from site X1Y1 to site X2Y2 is given by this expression on the right-hand side. So e to the negative beta CB divided by the partition function. So here what we're doing is we're looking at the gang tag of the opposite gang. Of the opposite gang. And if there's more of it, then the agent is less likely to move in that direction. And this beta amplifies that, right? So if you have a larger beta, then it makes it less likely that an agent will move onto a site with the kind of graffiti it doesn't like. According to the interacting particle model, the evolution of the agent. The evolution evolution of the agent density then should be expressed in this way. So the density at time t plus delta t is whatever it used to be plus the agents that have gone onto the site from a neighboring site. So the neighboring sites are called x tilde y tilde. And then minus the agents that have left. So the agents have gone to their neighboring sites, x tilde, y tilde. And actually, all of the agents have. And actually, all of the agents have moved, right? Because the sum of this sum is actually one. But it's better to express it this way when we're looking at the derivation. There's also the evolution of the graffiti density. When we evolve the graffiti density, we have the agents putting down. So the blue is the agent, right? So gang A agents put down graffiti at some rate, gamma. Down graffiti at some rate gamma, and then the graffiti decays at some rate lambda. And we then do numerical simulations, which allow us to look at what happens over time. And we have different parameters. We have the number of agents. Then we have also the lattice size. We have this ratio gamma over lambda, which essentially, remember, gamma is the rate at which graffiti gets put down. Is the rate at which graffiti gets put down, and lambda is the rate at which graffiti decays, and then we also have this graffiti avoidance parameter, and this graffiti avoidance parameter, this beta, is the one that we're going to focus on when we think about our phase transition. So when we're looking at simulations of gang dynamics, if we have a relatively small beta, so something like one times 10 to the negative sixth, then if we start with a uniformly distributed agent density and graffiti, Agent density and graffiti density, and then we evolve it forward in time, we stay roughly uniformly distributed. So here's the agent density staying uniformly distributed. The graffiti density, when we did this, we looked at who had more graffiti. So it's red if there's more red graffiti at a site. It's blue if there's more blue graffiti at a site. And it's green if there's the same amount of graffiti. So this is at the So, this is at the first time step, and you can see that over time it doesn't really split up. So, here's what we consider to be a well-mixed phase. When we see the well-mixed phase, then we have the, we sort of just, this is what it would be if we had uniform density. And what we're looking at here is a cross-section of the agent density over time. And we can see that. Over time, and we can see that it basically stays around uniformly distributed. And the cross-section for the graffiti density, so just looking at one of the rows of the lattice, also is relatively uniformly distributed. We can see that early in the simulation, after one time step, it's at about 0.5 and it eventually evens out to roughly close to one. That depends on your gamma and lambda parameters. But we But we also see a segregated phase. So, if beta increases, then we can start seeing this sort of phase separation between a red phase and a blue phase. And that coarsens over time. And eventually, you'll get something looking like a blue droplet in a red sea or a red droplet in a blue sea. So, we get this sort of classical coarsening. And if we look at the cross-section, so what we're doing is we're basically Section. So, what we're doing is we're basically choosing. Sorry, I think I've got this. Well, we've got the we're looking at a cross section just at a particular given, I think, y value. And when we look at this over time for the agent density, we see that we really get these spots where you have essentially only blue agents and only red agents. And only red agents. Okay. And these areas get larger. So we can actually see the coarsening. And we've defined an order parameter, which essentially is looking at the, which allows us to look at the different phases and the phase transition. And so we look at how many more, well, the difference between the gang A and the gang B densities. Densities at a given site and at its neighboring site. We multiply those two things together and then have a scaling factor. And essentially, what we should get is something which is close to one if we have full segregation and something which is close to zero if we have a well-mixed phase. And we can see that as beta changes, we get sometimes something in between for intermediate values of beta. But as beta gets bigger and bigger, we get something close to one over time. We get something close to one over time. So, this is over the course of the simulation. So, since we get something that essentially evens out, then we can just think about the ultimate final value for this energy. And we can plot that. And when we plot the final energy versus beta, then we can see this kind of classical phase transition plot. And we've plotted it for different lattice sizes. For different lattice sizes and for different number of agents, and what we see is that as the mass here, I think the mass is doubling, actually, our critical beta halves. And we were interested in seeing what happens if we can identify where that parameter happens. So, we actually derived a macroscopic model from the microscopic. And we did this in the way that you'd expect. So we subtract this term from the graffiti density. We can just subtract this term and divide by delta t, and we get basically a difference equation that we can then derive this set of macroscopic equations for. So the graffiti density is quite clear how it would be derived. In terms of the agent density, then we can Agent density, then we can take that equation that we had before for how the agents evolve. And we can again subtract to this term and then divide by delta t. But now we have this problem where the number of agents at this red point depends on the number of agents at the orange points. And the number of agents at the orange points depend on the number of agents at the yellow points. So, um, and So, and it happens in this way. So, when we're thinking about the number of agents moving to the red point from the orange points, we need to also take into account the yellow points, essentially. So, we managed to get rid of that using the discrete Laplacian, and that essentially brings all the influences back to the orange points, and then brings those orange points back to the red points. And we can derive this set of macroscopic equations. Microscopic equations. What we see here is really that this balance between a diffusion term and here we have a cross-diffusion term. So we have essentially the gang A agents preferentially avoiding areas with high gang B graffiti. And that beta weighs the avoidance between those two things. And And we can also think about three gangs. If we do the same thing for three gangs, we can similarly see a phase transition happening there. And we see that if we look carefully at it, we actually see that we have not a first-order phase transition, but actually a continuous phase transition. So it's smoother. So, it's smoother than we initially had thought when we had just two gangs. And we can do a similar derivation of macroscopic equations for multiple gangs. So, here we have the graffiti density for the jth gang is evolving the same way we had for two gangs. And the agent density for the jth gang is evolving in the same way, but now instead of the gradient for just the graffiti. Of the gradient for just the graffiti density of one other gang, we have the gradient of the sum of the graffiti densities for all of the gangs. And I'm looking at my time. We did a linear stability analysis for this, just a classical one. And we can actually deduce where the solution becomes unstable, where the uniform solution becomes unstable. Becomes unstable, and we got this. So, if beta is greater than one over two, times the ratio between the rate at which the graffiti is put down divided by the rate at which the graffiti is decayed times that uniform density, what it would be if we just spread all the agents out uniformly. If beta is greater than that, then we see that the uniform solution becomes unstable. Becomes unstable. And this is the way in which it becomes unstable. So it becomes unstable. Essentially, all of the wave numbers become unstable. And when we plot that critical beta from the stability analysis on top of the critical beta that we got from the numerical results. Results, both for the two-gang model and the three-gang model, we can see that if we plot that critical beta against the mass per gang, then it pretty much exactly matches between the stability analysis, the prediction from the stability analysis and what we see numerically. And so now we have a way to explain what that critical data is. We've also looked at the Looked at this system. Well, yes, this system and thought about this with Nancy Rodriguez and Java Yoldish and Nicola Zamponi. We looked at the cross-diffusive system and we thought about the case where we had equilibriation to do some sort of, well, we had some sort of. Some sort of fast dynamic with the graffiti density. And then we could essentially replace this CB with a rho B and this CA with a rho A. And then we end up with something close to, we end up with some sort of cross-diffusive system where we have regular diffusion balancing with cross-diffusion. Unfortunately, this is a really degenerate structure still. Degenerate structure still, but we were able to find two energy functionals for the system and get a weak stability result and identify equilibrium solutions and also get some results about long-term behavior of solutions in the case where row A times rho B was less than one. So we have some analytical results there, but it's complicated by the But it's complicated by the extremely degenerate structure of the system that we have here. I am, I think, beyond the time that was recommended, so I want to stop here and open the floor to questions if there are any. Thank you, Alicia. Thanks. Okay, questions, comments? Hello, Alicia. Hello. Hello. Yeah, my name is Hanye Ji. So I have a question about your model. So are we assuming that the gang members is kind of like conserved in time? Like you're not going to, like, if they're young kids on the street, they're not really going to be affected by the To be affected by the graffitis on the wall, or like, are we assuming that those agents are not really going to increase in amount, let's say, in time? Thanks for the question. So, with the model that I've presented here, we have a conservation of the number of agents. So, we're not assuming that any agents are created or destroyed. So, we're thinking about So, we're thinking about the case where, really, I guess a time scale where we don't have any new gang members inducted, and we don't have any also any older gang members being removed. So, we're not thinking about things like people going to jail or people being recruited. Yeah, if we wanted to add that, that could also be interesting, but we haven't looked at that yet. We have time for more questions. I have a question, Alicia. Well, sure. Analytically, can you look at the bifurcation from constant steady state in the sense of just looking for steady states? So, yeah, so that's what the farthest we've gotten is really doing this linear stability. Gotten is really doing this linear stability analysis and the results that we got there. Yeah, this gives you the this coins it should coincide with your pneumatics on the point in which they depart from zero, no? Yeah, yeah. So essentially around here, when our beta gets big enough, then we get this when our beta gets big enough, then we get an unstable eigenvalue. An unstable eigenvalue, and it destabilizes the uniform solution. And that's what we're seeing right here. That's what gives us this critical beta. Yeah, I think it should be possible to look at it analytically on the continuum model by looking at the steady states. And that's just looking for bifuncations from the constants. We can chat aside. We can chat aside. Yeah, I'd love to chat. We had tried to play with it a bit, and what we found was that we really could only find the, at least with the work that I've done with Nancy and Hava and Nicola, we were able to find only the uniform steady state. We weren't able to find other ones. But there should be some way to find those steady state solutions where we have essentially two different. Essentially, two different, um, yeah, there's the segregated states. We should be able to find them, I think. But I concerning the segregated states, uh, one thing that you should look at models in math biology that they have used for chemotaxis, but on the lattice, and they derive them from the lattice. And then, normally, they get also additional corrections to the diffusion term when they do. Diffusion term when they do that. I can send you a couple of papers on that. They do exactly the same procedure as you are doing here, and what they get is a non-linear diffusion instead. And then with non-linear diffusion, it's easier to get those sharp interfaces because at that point, I mean, you're going to have very, you know, kind of exponentials with a very high slope, but not sadly sharp interfaces here. But in the other one, you may expect it. But in the other one, you may expect it. So, yeah, I think there are a couple of things that you could do in those directions. I'll send you preferences later. Okay, yeah, I'd really appreciate that. Thank you. More questions? So, is there any question on the people online? It doesn't seem so. No, I don't think so. So, thank you, Alicia. Thank you very much for the invitation. Thank you very much for the invitation. I'm sorry, I couldn't make it.
