Great. So thank you again for the invitation. It's been a great conference so far. Hopefully I can keep up the trend. So I'm going to be talking about a lot of the same objects that Roxandra was talking about on Tuesday. So these essentially these Hitchin pairs, where we're not necessarily taking a particular vector bundle to twist by, but we're looking at various different choices. Various different choices. So, this talk we're going to have X be a compact complex manifold. And we're going to fix a vector bundle V on X as well as a Gaudichan metric G. So, this is just a metric that satisfies Satisfies del del bar of the Hitchhiker of the Hermitian form of g to the power of one minus the dimension of the manifold. So our complex dimension of x is n. So this is zero. Essentially, this is just like the best choice in a given conformal class. Best choice in a given conformal class of a metric, but it's really not going to matter too much, so you can just sort of forget that it exists. So I'm going to say that V pair is, so it's a pair E phi, where E is a holomorphic vector bundle. And phi is a bundle map going from E to E tensored with V. So these are the same as the Hitchin pairs that Rixandra was talking about. I'm just using slightly different notation because at several points it's going to be important to remember which V I'm talking about because there might be a few of them at some points. And we're going to say that. Uh and we're going to say that uh phi is a V Higgs field on E. So if we've already fixed an E, we're gonna say that I is the Higgs field. And oops, sorry, I missed something. The extra condition that we have here is that we're gonna ask that. Is that we're going to ask that the wedge of phi with itself is going to be zero. So this is just, so this is like an integrability condition that we're going to need for most of our examples. All right. So some of the important examples of these are, so we have pigs bundles. So, this is where we've taken our vector bundle V to be the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the manifold. And so, if x is Kayler, then we're going to get a non-abelian Hodge correspondence. So, on one side, we're going to have V pair. V pairs, which are stable and with the first and second shearing classes of the vector bundle E vanishing. And on the other side, we're going to have irreducible representations of the fundamental group of X. So this is So this is Ju Choose Simpson from 91 and also Verlette in 92. Another example is going to be Cohig's bundles. So this is where we're taking our vector bundle to be the holomorphic tangent bundle. Bundle to be the holomorphic tangent bundle. So these have some appearances in generalized geometry, but the main thing that I like these for is this nice correspondence with holomorphic Poisson structures. So on one side, you have trace-free Tohiggs bundles. Of rank two with these bundles are E pi, and on the other side, we're going to have holomorphic Poisson structures on the projective. The projectivized bundle of E with such that the fibers are coisotropic. So this essentially just means that the Poisson structure is doing something interesting in the fiber direction. It's not just automatically zero. So this is due to polish to. To Polishuk 97, and also Steve talked about these in his PhD thesis. And the last example that I'm going to bring up is Waffa-Witten bundles. So, this is the case where V is the canonical bundle. I'm told these are interesting for physics reasons. I do not understand the physics reasons, so I'm going to give you a deformation theory reason. So if x has dimension two, then the obstruction class for For deformations of vector bundles of vector bundle E. These live in H2 of the trace-free endomorphisms of E. This space is naturally isomorphic to the sections of the endomorphisms twisted by the canonical bundle. And this is where buffa-witten bundles live. And so if we have some set of invariants for our vector bundle where we're guaranteed not to get any waffle-witten bundles, this means that we're going to get smoothness for a moduli space for free, which is always nice. Which you know, it's always nice when you don't have to check smoothness. So, so before I move on, are there any questions about this? All right, so next thing I'm going to do is start talking about a particular family of surfaces where we can do some of these computations in a nice way. So, the things that I'm going to be talking about are non-Kaler elliptic surfaces. Elliptic surfaces. And most of the things that I'm going to say are going to work for general non-Kaler elliptic surfaces, but the statements are much more annoying to write down. So we're just going to stick with the ones that are principal bundles for today. So the way that we construct one of these surfaces, so we're going to get, so we have the data of Of a compact Freeman surface, they're going to call B and some positive degree line bundle on B. We're going to set the degree to be D. And we're going to also take a complex number tau with norm at least one. And then from this data, we're going to construct a surface by taking. So, first we take theta star is just going to be the C star frame bundle of theta. Theta. And we're going to get an elliptic surface. Let me call the projection on the surface pi. And the total space is just going to be this frame bundle quotiented by the action of the cyclic group generated by tau with the natural map to be. So, one of the reasons we like working with these surfaces is they have a very nice spectral theory. Have a very nice spectral theory, and you don't really have to deal with any singular fibers. And so, a lot of the work really comes down to just understanding how data on the total space relates to data on the base. So, just for the future, I'm going to call the structure group. Group just T and so this is isomorphic to just star mod tau Yeah, sorry, that's That's perfect to C star mod owes So as a So, as an example of this, so if we look at line bundles, so we can very easily describe the Picard group of X if we quotient out by the line bundles that are pullbacks from line bundles on the base. These maps are exactly parametrized by maps from By maps from our base Riemann surface into the structure group P. And so you have this nice one-to-one correspondence up to twisting by a pullback bundle between graphs of these functions and line bundles. Sorry, do you have a question? No, okay, sorry. And this is sort of the motivation for when we go up to the rank two. For when we go up to the rank two case. So in rank two, two. So we want to study a vector bundle. The restriction of a vector bundle E to the fibers of our bundle map pi. So if we restrict to so if we restrict to a fiber Yep, thank you. Let me just reattach this. So if we look Uh yeah, so if we look at the restriction of E to the fiber at some point B, this is going to be a degree zero rank two bundle on the elliptic curve P. And of course, by ATIA, we know exactly what these bundles look like. So by ATIA, it looks like one of It looks like one of the following. So either we have that it's a direct sum of two degree zero line bundles. So lambda one and lambda two are degree zero. The other option is that we have a twist of the Atia bundle A, which is just the unique non-development A, which is just the unique non-slit extension of the trivial line bundle with itself. E and A, the Atiya bundle. Or the last option is that we could have a direct sum of two line bundles whose degrees sum to zero. So like So, like L plus L times lambda inverse, where lambda is a degree zero, and L is degree k for some positive k. And by looking at which class your bundle falls into as you vary across all of the fibers. Across all of the fibers, this is going to give us a nice invariant of our vector bundle. So we're going to construct this divisor, which I'm going to call SE, in the relative Jacobian of the elliptic surface, which in this The elliptic surface, which in this case is just the Cartesian product of B with the degree zero line bundles on T. And the way we take this, construct this divisor is by looking at the intersection with something of the form little b cross pick zero of t. Pick zero of t and so if we're in type case one we're going to get just uh the each we're going to get each of the two points so if e restricted to i inverse b of type one we're going to get the degree zero twist if we're in type two If we're in type two, and we're going to get the whole vertical component when it's type three. And so if you look at this over all of these fibers, you end up getting this divisor, which looks basically like Basically, like a double cover of your base B. I'm going to say, like, this is the base, and this is the structure group. And so you get this like double cover together with a few vertical bars. And you can read off a lot of data about your vector bundle from knowing what this curve looks like. We're going to call S of E. S of E is the spectral curve curve of E. So, the big question is about how you get this divisor. So the spectral curve is always going to have the form C plus the sum of some B i's with pixer of t where c is C is some double cover of B. So this might have ramification, it might have singularities, but it always has degree two over B. One thing that we can sort of read off from this is so if we have a vector bundle E. E, we're going to say that it's an irreducible bundle if for any subsheaf which is non-zero E, the rank of your subsheaf is equal to the rank of the vector bundle. So essentially, these are the bundles that have no interesting subsheaves. Which particularly means that if you're interested in stable objects, these ones are the ones where you don't have to check anything because it's very difficult for the degree of a subsheaf to be too big if the subsheaf doesn't exist. And we have this nice result. Result by Blinzanescu and Moranu, which tells us that the bundle E is irreducible if and only if this double cover piece of the spectral curve. Double cover piece of the spectral curve is reduced and irreducible. So, you know, you don't have to worry about like, can you find these subsheaves? All you have to do is look at the spectral curve and say, does it have more than one component in the sort of horizontal piece? Is that component reduced? Is that component reduced? And so on the other side, when we have a bundle that isn't irreducible, so one that's reducible, so if E is reducible, so we get two line bundles that I'm going to call K1 and K2. These are the maximal destabilizing bundles. Are the maximal destabilizing bundles? And so these have you can naturally get E written as an extension starting from either of the ki's to E into Ki inverse. Ki inverse times the determinant of E twisted by some ideal z, Iz, zero, where z is some finite subspace. And these are called the maximal destabilizing bundles because you can always pull out two bundles. Please pull out two bundles which are going to have the highest degree amongst those where this is possible. I will note that they're not necessarily different. So you will have a lot of bundles where the K1 is just equal to the K2. And so you have the same one just with higher multiplicity. So, are there any questions about this before I move on? All right. All right, so this gives us all the information that we need to go back and start talking about V pairs again. Okay, so now theorem this is due to myself and Rixandra. Cassandra. So let X be a non-Kalar elliptic surface. We're going to take V to be the pullback of any bundle on B. So W is a vector bundle on B. Vector bundle on B. And we're going to take E to be a reducible rank two bundle. Okay, so in this situation, we have three cases. Or sorry, actually, before I do this, so I'm going to set this vector space. This vector space HW to be the space of sections of on B of the push forward of this line bundle K1 tensored K2 tensored with the inverse of the determinant of E all twisted by W. So, the three cases for reducible bundles are the following. So, the first case is where K1 is not equal to K2. So, in this case, so then the set of trace-free Higgs fields On E, let's say, so the V Higgs fields on E. So this set is isomorphic to HW. Notably, you don't need to check the phi wedge phi equals zero condition here because you get it for free. And that's really nice because this is usually one of the harder parts of making sure that you have something. So the second case is when Case is when E is equal to some line bundle tensored with a pullback bundle F, where lambda is in pick zero, or sorry, the Picard group of B. So in this case, so the V Higgs fields on E. On E are exactly the pullbacks of W Higgs fields on Figgs fields on F W Higgs fields on F. And so in this case, you don't have to be able to do that. So, in this case, you don't need to deal with the surface at all. You can just pretend you're on a curve, do it there, and you'll get the same answer. And then the last case, so this is if we're not in one of the other two cases, all we can say is that the set of trace-free endomorphisms of E twisted by V Sorry. Let's just say the dimension of this space is at least equal to the dimension of HW. And so in this case, we can't say quite as much, but we still have a lower bound on what we expect to get. Sorry, I should also note that here, in this case, we get that. We get that the Higgs field is stable if and only if E is stable. So, this is what we get in the reducible case. And from these, you can. And from these, it's not too hard to check that if you are in a situation where you expect to have any sort of V pairs and you're looking at invariants that allow reducible bundles, you should expect to find some because most of the time you can get a lower bound on the ones that are there. So this is very different from the irreducible. This is very different from the irreducible case. So, the second half of this result. So, again, we're going to let X a non-Kalar elliptic surface. And this time I'm going to take V to just be the pullback of a line. V to just be the pullback of a line bundle. So L is in the card group B. And we're going to take E to be rank two, and this time irreducible. So if E admits a Emits a non-zero trace-free Higgs field the Higgs field then the degree of the line bundle L must be positive and we have to have that have to have that the spectral curve of E is an atomic. Sorry. So after you normalize this spectral curve so after you normalize you're going to get an HIL cover of B so this means that if you look at your spectral curve it can't have any You know, if you look at your spectral curve, it can't have any vertical components, it can't have any ramification. The only thing you could possibly have is singularities, and other than that, it just looks like an etal cover. This is a very restrictive condition in general. All right, so are there any questions about these before I move on? Yeah. Yeah. So basically, if you look, so this is this just comes from like the way that we found the isomorphism with that set, because it it sort of it lives in the space of endomorphisms in such a way that you basically get things that look like just the trace-free diagonal. Like just the trace-free diagonal matrices locally. And so, because the phi-wedge phi basically comes down to checking the commutator and they're all diagonal, then you know that they commute with themselves. Yeah. All right. So, all right, so now that we've seen some of the general results. Seen some of the general results, let's go back to our interesting cases and talk about some applications. So if we go back to Baffa-Witten. So here, remember, V is the canonical bundle. And for one of these non-Kalar elliptic surfaces, the canonical bundle is just the pullback of the canonical bundle on your base curve. On your base curve. And so we're exactly in the situation that we wanted to be in for these results. So first we get that, so if X admits stable trace-free B pairs, then the genus. Then the genus of B is at least two. So basically, you don't expect to get Waffa-Witten bundles unless the base curve that you're living over has Higgs bundles. And as a corollary of these previous two results, we get that so if so M is a So M is a moduli space of rank two she, rank two vector bundles, bundles on X. And no E in the moduli space admits kx6 fields. Then, in fact, M does not admit reducible bundles. Basically, the way that you see this is: you start with the moduli space, you find some reducible bundle in it, and then using this result, you And then, using this result, you can construct an example that has the same invariance as the one that you started with, is stable, and has a non-zero Higgs field. And so, this is basically telling you that if you don't want to have to worry about stability for your moduli space, your only option is to look at cases where you only have irreducible bundles. Yes, sorry, what? Oh, yeah, sorry. I mean, you don't have to worry about that either. And I'll just quickly mention that there's a nice numerical criterion due to Vinzanescu, which tells you when you can expect to find these moduli spaces that don't admit reducible bundles. And so it's Bundles. And so it's not a terrible ask to want this. You have to be a little bit careful about how you pick your elliptic surface, but it's definitely feasible to find examples where this happens. Sorry. Sorry. This was supposed to be with the genus, the base at least two. Yeah. If the genus is zero or one, then the moduli spaces are always smooth. The moduli spaces are always smooth just because you have no stable trace-free Higgs pairs at all. All right, so now we're going to move on to the case of co Higgs bundles. So here, remember the vector bundle that we're twisting by is the Bundle that we're twisting by is the holomorphic tangent bundle. And this again is a pullback bundle. It's the pullback of this bundle that I'm going to call AB. And AB is just the unique non-trivial extension of the trivial line bundle with the anti-canonical bundle. So, this is a non-trivial extension, but So, again, we're in the situation where we have a pullback bundle, and so we can use our results from before. So, first, so if X admits a A stable trace-free V pair which is non-zero, then the genus of the base is equal to zero. And in this case, this means that X is a Hofser. Is a Hop surface. So again, this lines up pretty nicely with what we expect from curves, because on curves, the only place where you expect to get Cohig's bundles is on P1, and for everything else, they vanish. So, one nice thing that we can say in this case is that Is that so so? If E so yeah, so if rank two vector bundle E on X admits a non-zero trace for you. Ex Higgs field, then E is reducible. So there's no stability condition here. This works for everything. And one consequence of this is that so if If so, if you have E rank two on X and the projective bundle of E admits a non-trivial Poisson structure, holomorphic Poisson structure, then the bundle E is reducible. The bundle E is reducible. All right, so I'm going to finish up by talking about the one case where we have a very complete picture of what's happening. And so this is cohig bundles on HOF surfaces. So cohigs on HOF. So first of all, So, first of all, if you remember in the result classifying the reducible bundles, we had two nice cases and then one case where we didn't really know what was happening. So in the hop surface case, a lot of the computations are much simpler. And so we can sort of compute that third case away just with brute force. And so we can classify. And of course, this is with the caveat that it's up to understanding stable vector bundles on Hop surfaces, which is not particularly easy. But there is a good description of this due to Ram Hurtabeez and also to Sandra. To Rexandra And last thing I'm going to say is that so so if we look at so a hop surface Hop surface and we're going to take M ohiggs to zero to be the moduli space. Of trace-free HIG bundles. Oh, yeah, sorry, cohigs. Thank you. Cohigs bundles with rank two and second churn class zero. Class zero, then we have a very nice description of this moduli space as a quasi-projective variety. So m ohiggs to zero is isomorphic to the card group of X crossed with P1, crossed with the disjoint union of Union of A3 and this affine variety C X Y Z W mod X times four Y Z minus W squared minus one and so And so here I'll point out that so this component corresponds to things that look like the pullback of OB plus OB. So these are the TX Higgs fields on the trivial bundle. And then this component corresponds to things that look like pullbacks. The things that look like pullbacks of OB plus O minus one of B. This is up to twisting by a line bundle. All right, so I think this is everything I have to tell you for today. So thank you for your attention. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? So actually, I have ah, so steve, say child. Eric, sorry, can you explain me, please, again, the last isomorphism? From the modulus space of co-exma. Yeah. So like, like, like, where you're getting all the. It's just that I'm having troubles reading. So the components. Yeah. So you have. Yeah, so you have so so you have the Picard group of X crossed with P1 yeah and that is and then you have the two components are A3 and the four-dimensional affine hypersurface given by X times 4YZ minus W squared all minus one. Okay, and that corresponds to so that if I understand correctly so the last one are all the possible Are all the possible core field where the underlying bundle is trivial, right? Or uh, so the so yes, where the vector bundle is okay, okay, okay, okay. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, um, but what's the condition that you're imposing, basically, exactly of a maker, yeah. So you can. Yeah, so you can, yes, so you can, I don't remember exactly which entries are which, but yeah, you can like write down the two by two matrix. It's in our paper, but I cannot remember it off the top of my head. That relation and meanness of the exact yes, so yeah, this is this is the stability condition, yeah, okay.
