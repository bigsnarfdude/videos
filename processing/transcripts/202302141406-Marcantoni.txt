And it deals with the irreversibility mitigation under non-Macovian thermalizing dynamics, which may be a little bit obscure for the moment, but I hope that by the end of the talk it will be clear what I mean by this. So essentially, my plan for this talk is... Can you start recording? Or is it recording? Oh, now it is. I'm sorry. Can it start? I think recording is. I'm going to have to start again. Yeah, for starting in you Marco and yeah, so as I was saying basically my talk is divided into three main parts. So at the beginning I will try to define a stochastic variable which is the stochastic algebra reproduction in open quantum systems and then I will discuss a little bit which kind of dynamics I'm going Which kind of dynamics I'm going to consider, and in which sense they can be considered non-Markovian. And in the end, I will discuss this password, this irreversibility mitigation that I can anticipate is the existence of time intervals where both the average and the variance of these stochastic variables are decreasing in time. So let me proceed. Let me proceed. Okay, so I will be very quick on the physical motivation. Our work is at the intersection of very two broad and active research areas that are the thermodynamics of quantum systems out of equilibrium, where people are interested both in very fundamental questions, as we have seen in the first talk by Philippe Strasberg, and also more applicative questions. And of course, I mean. And of course, I mean, non-Markovian dynamics, I mean, I don't have to justify to this audience why this is an interesting topic, I would say. Of course, I mean, these are very broad research areas. Our question is very specific, and I'm trying to clarify in the following what our work is about. Okay, let me start by setting the stage. So I'm considering the usual framework of open quantum systems, so finite dimensional Hilbert space. The quantum evolution for me is given by a one-parameter family of completely positive and trace-person maps. And in order to define the stochastic entropy production, I have to introduce a pair of observables, this OE of Lin. This OFLIN and a forward and a backward to measurement protocol, which may seem a little bit complicated, but I'm trying to explain everything quite clearly, I hope. So let's start with the forward protocol. We start essentially by any density matrix rho zero, then we measure the first observable. Uh measure the first observable OIN, uh projecting uh the state into one of the possible uh eigen projectors of this uh observable. And then we evolve according to our maps lambda t and then at time t we measure the second observable of in. And in doing this, what we are really interested in is the joint probability of the Joint probability of the different pairs of outcomes in the two measurements, which are easily computed in this way. So you have the initial probability for the first outcome, and then you have the probability of the second outcome conditioned on the first outcome. This is not enough because we need also a backward protocol. So we want to compare this joint probability to another. To another joint probability in a sort of reversed path. And in order to define this reverse path for completely positive and transparent math, which are intrinsically irreversible, so this is not a trivial question. And we basically follow the suggestion by Crookes in this PRA 2008. 2008. And so we introduced this anti-unitary time reversal operator. We assume that our dynamics as a fixed point that is full rank. So for instance, a thermal state works fine for us. This is actually what we have in mind, mostly. And then one can define these dual maps, lambda t dot d, that are also completely positive and trace-preserving because they are written. They are written in this browse form with the cross operators that are related to the original cross operator by this relation that may seem a bit strange, but so you see that if the dynamics is unital, this pi is the identity, so this is just the adjoint cross operator conjugated with time reversal. In the general case, you have this also this relation with the with the fixed point. With the fixed point, which is included in order to have a fixed point for the reverse protocol, which is the time reverse of the original fixed point. So maybe it's a bit complicated, but this is the notion of dual maps that we're using for the reverse protocol. And again, we do this two-measurement protocol where now we measure of first, actually, the time. First, actually, the time-reverse version of in. So, all these quantities with the tilde are the time-reverse partners of the original quantities, apart from this lambda tilde, which is a bit more involved. Yes, and basically, you exactly the same thing. So, you have first initial state, which is the final state in the previous path, and then you measure, then you have all. And then you measure, then you evolve according to your map, and then you measure again. And again, you can define this joint probability of the pair of outcomes. And we are interested in comparing the two, of course. So for a generic dynamics, one can define this finally this stochastic entropy production, which is a stochastic variable associated to any pair of outcomes, and is defined in this way. And it is defined in this way, so as the logarithm of the ratio of these two probabilities, which can be rewritten as some, say, border term, so just depending on the initial and final outcome, plus this ratio of conditional probabilities, which is the most interesting part and also the most difficult one to treat. So, in general, there's Uh in general, there's I mean, it's very difficult to understand uh what kind of object is uh this one. Uh well formally, okay, one can say that formally uh the probability distribution of this stochastic variable is this one. So you have a bunch of delta peaks weighted with this probability PF. What can I say? So uh one would like to simplify this ratio in order to have a more clear and more clear and uh physically uh intelligible expression for uh for this delta sigma and in order to do this one has to specify something about the dynamics so in particular so uh for unital dynamics one can easily find that this ratio is always one so the only term remaining is this difference of logarithms which can be interpreted as a say stochastic part Say, stochastic partner of the former. But we will see this later. So for general dynamics, we don't really know what to do. So we try to specify something. So something more general than unidal dynamics. Oh, maybe not everybody knows that unidal dynamics is a dynamics that preserves the identity operator. Or if you prefer, I mean, the identity operator for us maybe. The operator for us may be seen also as an infinite temperature deep state in this finite-dimensional setting. And we want to do something a bit more general. And for this, we follow this paper by Manzan et al. in PRE 2015. And we explored the spectral decomposition of this fixed point pi and we associate twenty We associate to any eigenvalue pi i what they call the non-equilibrium potential, which is minus the logarithm of pi i. And on top of this, so given this definition, we make some assumptions on the cross operators or dynamics, which may look a little bit complicated, at this script as it is written here, but essentially this means that That any cross operators is mimocally associated to a single value of this variable delta phi. So you can write these press operators in terms of the operators, transition operators pi l pi j and then in this in each one of these press operators will appear only pairs pi. appear only pairs pi i, pi j that are associated to the same value of delta alphi. That's basically the name. So and if you suspect that this is quite a restrictive condition, actually if you consider the Davis dynamics obtained according to the weak coupling limit of a n-level system coupled to thermal pressure bottom. Thermal present variant bosons, actually, this property is satisfied, so it's not quite prescriptive, I would say. And also, we need some assumption on the observables, and in particular, we need the observables, both the initial and the final one, to commute with the with the fixed point of the dynamic. So we are measuring in a very specific basis. But with these assumptions, one can simplify a lot. One can simplify a lot the expression for the entropy production. And in particular, one can. So, as I said, there is this first term, which is the only one appearing for unital dynamics, which is related to the logarithm of this ratio of probabilities. But then the very complicated part just boils down to this delta phi. So, it's something very simple. And so, if you want something even simple, If you want something even simpler, you can specify the fixed point to be the deep state. And if this is the case, this delta phi is nothing else than beta delta E, the difference in energies. And okay, one can reshuffle a little bit this relation and write it in terms of what one would call a fluctuation relation. So the ratio of these two probabilities exponentially weighted with respect to this. Weighted with respect to this quantity, which is, I would say, thermodynamically intelligible. And using this very simple expression, also one can have a very simple expression for the average of the stochastic entropy production, which can be written in terms of these three quantum relative entropies that also can be easily interpreted. Easily interpreted. So, the first term is the entropy, relative entropy between the final state before the measurement and the final state after the measurement. Which means this is the contribution to irreversibility, which is just given by the invasiveness of the second measurement. And these other two are somehow the standard contribution that you would expect. So, here. That you would expect. So you have the difference between the relative entropy of the initial state with respect to the fixed point minus the relative entropy of the final state with respect to the fixed point. And then of course these term is always positive because of the monotonicity of the relative entropy under completely positive and trace perceptive. Because you can rewrite this pi as lambda t and lambda pi. I guess this is quite simple. Okay, so now that we understood what's the main object we want to study, so the stochastic entropy production, let's see how non-marketity plays a role in all these things. And so in doing so, we assume that, well, to be brief, I'm using the divisibility notions. Divisibility notions that already Hanker Tribas presented today. So I assume that one can write this map lambda t as some propagator with S ating or lambda s for any t and s such that t greater than s greater than zero. And this is always possible if the map lambda t is invertible in the mathematical sense. And one can distinguish different degrees of non-mathematicity as we Different degrees of non-matronity as we assume today. So, I'm following this nomenclature by Krushiski Maniskarplov 2014. So, one can say the dynamics is CPD visible or Markovian if all these propagators for any pair of times are CP maps, while the dynamics is CPD visible but not CPD visible, again if this intermediate propagator is positive but not completely positive, while if for some pair of times A pair of times medias is not even positive, which is a possibility. There's nothing too strange about this. Dynamics is not even p-divisible, and it is called in this paper essentially no harvolum. And again, if lambda t is invertible, one can conveniently define a time-dependent generator in this way, and I'm gonna specify the dynamics and. To specify the dynamics and considering just specifying this time-dependent generator. So, for those of you who are familiar with the standard Limbladd master equation that is used to describe thermalization of a qubit, okay this is just the very same master equation where the where the decay rates have have been promoted to be time dependent. Being promoted to be time-dependent. And of course, beta here is the inverse temperature, and we have this gamma-beta, the time-dependent decay rate. This kind of dynamics is, I mean, one can show this, it is completely positive if and only if this quantity, this big gamma, is positive, and this big gamma essentially is the integral from zero to t. Is the integral from 0 to T of this time-dependent decay rate. While it is P visible and CPD visible, so in this particular model, the two notions are actually going to be because it's very simple. If and only if the gamma bit of t is positive at any time. So, of course, I mean we will assume this for the physical consistency. The physical consistency of our model, but then we will play with the sine of gamma in order to have different regimes of homogeneity. And these dynamics, of course, since it is completely positive, admits a Krauss representation. And actually, the explicit expression is not very important, it's just to show you that it satisfies assumption one. So the assumption that we made on the So the assumption that we made on the cross operators that we used to simplify the expression of the stochastic end of reproduction is valid in this case. One can check this. So let's start talking about this irreversibility mitigation. Yes. As I said, at the beginning, the objective is to construct an example where both the average and the variance of the delta sigma are the Of the delta sigma are decreasing by this. So the cartoon picture is that for a perfectly reversible dynamics, the stochastic entropy reduction has a delta in zero distribution, some amount. So the stochastic entropy reduction is zero for any realization of the protocol. While in general, what you expect for something which is irreversible, like in this case, is that Like in this case, is that the average of the distribution increases in time, and of course, the distribution will broaden. And what we are asking here is, of course, we are looking for something where the average is decreasing, which is, I mean, results of this kind were also known in the literature, actually. It's not very new, I would say. But then we also ask for this. Ask for this further condition, which means we also would like to have some distribution that shrinks such that the average entropy production just not decreases so such that the stochastic entropy production just not decreases in average, but also such that it is more peaked around the average. In order to have something that resembles something coming back to the reversibility condition. Back to the reversibility condition. So I have to be fast, I guess, and I just say that for the average, one can easily show that the sign of this is just controlled by this parameter gamma dot t. So whenever this is not the divisible, you have that the derivative of average delta sigma is negative. While the derivative of the variance is a bit more. Of the variance is a bit more complicated, but actually, you're lucky, and this is proportional to the derivative of the average times this factor. And we want to show that, I mean, that there is some condition such that this factor is positive. So that they both have the same sign, and both, since we asked for this delta sigma to be negative, they will be both negative. And okay, not giving you details, I will just use some rational approximation. Use some rational approximation of the logarithm to have some bounds on this. And after some algebra, we see that this function z t i t minus 2 is greater or equal than this expression. And if we show that this is greater or equal than zero, then it's done. And this can be done because the denominator is always greater or equal than zero, and the numerator is a second order. Second-order algebraic equation in the variable e to the minus 2 gamma. So one can study this a little bit. And one has a condition unbound on the great gamma, so on the integral of small gamma, such that sufficient condition such that we have this phenomenology that we call the reversibility mitigation. And one can compare, so one can take the infinite term. So, one can take the infinite temperature limit, so the bit equals zero limit of this, but just because we wanted to compare it to our previous work where we discussed all channels that are digital dynamics where we could control better this bound. So, I mean, we lose a little bit, but still, our aim was just to show an example of this phenomenology. So, okay, I'm done, and the take. And the take-home message is that if the dynamics is essentially non-Mark Poe, which means it can be not be divisible for a qubit for the moment, one can construct examples where both the average and the variance of delta sigma are transiently decreasing. And of course, the aim would be to both generalize this to higher dimension to see whether how this Whether how this phenomenon scales with the dimension. I mean, I would expect that it becomes less and less likely, but at the same time, in higher dimension, you have many more parameters you can play with. So I don't really see a way to state that this is the case, or that this is becoming unlikely with the dimension of the event space. And then, of course, the important And then, of course, the important part would be to find concrete models of the environment where you can deduce hopefully rigorously this kind of reduced dynamics that has these properties. So, if you want to check it out on the archive, that's it. Thanks a lot, Stefano. That was great. Thanks a lot, Stefan. Oh, that was beautifully timed, and we do have time for a few questions at the right. If you consider situations where you have big visibility, but not CD visibility, and for example, I was thinking about the eternal non-Macovian channels, a very particular case of other channels, so essentially CD visibility for any possible but you always have PD visibility, you wouldn't see anything. So the important thing is. Anything. So the important thing is really PD visibility here. Indeed, we had in the work, in the previous work on public channels, we had some, well, more general for some aspects dynamics in the sense that we could play and find a regime where we had PD visibility, we had yes, PD visibility but not C P D visibility and in fact we couldn't see any sorry. And so what really matters is p divisibility. Because of these properties, so essentially, if you look at the average in terms of these relative entropies, since it has been proved that actually the monotonicity properties of relative entropies is true for any positive map, not just complete positive, I think that's what you need. So you need to break three positivity. Positivity. Can you use this as a metric for, let's say, again, in control, rather interested in going from some state that is pure to another state that is as close as pure as possible? But if in this sense, you want the idea of that is what your evolution will be fully reversible. Yes, yes, yes, that's true. So the students can use these metrics to say, well, can I design in such a way that my reversibility can be used? That my reverse is maximum. Nothing like that. Purely high reversion. Yes, purely. Yeah, okay. I see the question. I can get as close to that as possible because I'll ask you this. Yeah, so the reversible case for us exactly is purely unitary evolution and also we should ask that the final measurement does not disturb the final state. So you have this further condition on the second measure. So basically you should project into the Should project into the basis where the function state is diagonal. So we have these two conditions. And then you are suggesting that maybe one can use this as a, let's say, maybe I didn't think about this, but are there any questions online? Anyone has a question? Just unmute yourself and speak up. Philip? Yeah, mine is more like a comment. I think I appreciate your hard work to find environmental models for that. Because I just want to raise awareness that what you call a sand reduction, this definition, would be only valid in very specific circumstances. Valid in very specific circumstances. So, you mean this one or the one before? Well, the ones you had in all the talk, right? Well, but this is just a simplified express uh this, of course, is not always valid. I mean the one you started from, basically. This one. Uh yes. Okay. I mean this this only holds under very specific circumstances. So I just want to raise awareness of that. And what would you would And what w you would use it instead? Well I mean an introduction should be kind of, you know, as a real physical meaning as describing a change in the summary rather than entropy. That connection you still have to make there. So if I understand do I understand correctly that you would you wouldn't consider this as a meaningful definition unless it can be reduced through this? Useful piece or not even that is necessarily meaningful at least not without further input from what you are considering. And in particular, I mean I think you specify only dynamical math, but it is known that completely different physical settings can generate the same dynamical map. And they have actually completely different end production. Completely different and production social equipment because you have very different settings. That's why. But then you have to know, in that case, you have to know something about the environment, because otherwise you can distinguish the two things if you only have access to the dynamical map. I don't see how you can do this. So you're saying you cannot define it from the first place, in the first place. Place in the first place. This is what you're saying. So if I only give you a dynamical map, there's no way to define it if you don't know where it comes from. And I mean, well, there's one test which you can easily see where things go wrong, because you can show that introduction is always positive for any initial state, right? Yes. But we all know that there are always examples. You can always find second goal back where they can examine. So you start by definition with a positive and time asymmetric. With a positive and time-asymmetric quantity. And that's something you want to actually get out and not put in by starting with these relative entropy constructions as well. But we don't trust maybe a detail. But you don't have to have initial correlations, five. You need to have initial correlations. No, no, not even them. So the point is when you start with this log-forward-backward ratio, which is an important identity installed thermodynamics, but this was proven only under. But this was proven only under specific circumstances. This is not a general, always valid expression of n production. And if you start from this, it is by definition a non-negative time asymmetric quantity, right? Because by definition, relative entity is positive, but it's a nitric convection, but that's actually what you something you want to derive from an underlying picture. And there are systems which And there are systems which do not satisfy the production done in this simple form. Yeah, but as I see this, to me, this just means that we miss some information from the environment that we cannot retrieve from this definition, which is completely fine to me. Yeah, yeah, for discusses. The bell has run. I feel there's a great, there's going to be a great discussion on the coffee break, but we should probably move on. Let's thank Stefano again. We move on. Let's thank Stefano again for coming.
