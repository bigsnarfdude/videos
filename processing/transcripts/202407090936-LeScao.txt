What I did during region I completed recently. Um so this was done at the Martin Proposed System Lab uh with uh Stefan Medicus here and uh Junadap. So I look at the leaf shape and the inclination. So when we look at leaves in general we see tremendous diversity. So you have leaves that can be simple or compounded. Sometimes you have a main vein in the middle. We also have loops or simple. We also have uh loops or oscillation. And if you look at the donation pattern, so a bit closer to the the topic of uh of this conference, uh we see uh diversity of networks. So you can have parallel networks, tree-like ramified networks, all loot networks. So I want to make sense of this diversity, and in order to do this, I'm going to look at the development mechanism and track if I can find some parameters to build the minimum model based on what I know. Based on what I know about leaf development. So, if you look at the development, leaves develop from apical structure of the leaves that are called meristems, so that's basically just cell division hotspots. What is important is that the formation is controlled by a conserved genetic control, so it gives you an inkling that maybe there is a common underlying mechanism. Mechanism. So if we look at the evolution of leaves, we see a transition from marginal growth. So you have growth that is more focused on the edge of the leaf with a ramified network that is not good towards a more tissuous growth. So growth can take place anywhere in the leaf and is associated with more complex groups. Is associated with more complex root patterns. So, this is a transition that has been seen several times in evolution in parallel, more than four times. So, it's another cue that there is a common mechanism between. So, we're going to make a first hypothesis that the group can be focused at the border. This was taken from a paper from Kevin Boss. Paper from Kevin Boss, who's here. So this corresponds to an artificial trait and this to a more modern one. So if you look at the leave formation, there is a sinistering pathway where you have some morphogenes. So morphogen induces cellular response. So in patria you have oxin, which induces cell diffusion. And you have another factor, a cuck, which you Another factor, a cuck, which represses, and those two are negatively inviting each other, so that's a local interaction. And we also know that for this oxymorphogen, it induced the expression of its own career, along which the oxygen flux would then self-organize around the flux, along which a vein differentiates. So, because of this, I suppose that I can use veins as a This, I suppose that I can use veins as a marker of growth. Marker of what? Of growth. I can say that where you have veins, you had a produce zone of growth. So that's the second ingredient I use. So here I'm going to build a model where, because the growth is marginal, I can consider that relief is just the same of propagating interfaces that propagate in function of local growth. In function of local ropes. So I'm going to first try a very naive model where I impose the group so it goes in a single direction. And I'm going to look at the evolution of a system of vascular networks of events. Then I'm going to try to add an ingredient where the growth depends on the position events. And then I'm going to check my data that growth indeed happened at the very very of the leaf or At the periphery of the leaf for some true districts. So, the concept of the model is that the leaf can be taken as a folded 2D object. In previous numerical model of leaf growth, it was considered as a two-dimensional continuous surface. And because here I look at growth on the margin, I consider that it's a one-dimensional propagation interface. So this strategy of parameter addition has been used in several other systems. Used in several other systems. For example, we can note crystal growth, tripwire, or erosion patterns. So we reduce the propagation of the front to the motion of its interface. So this motion depends on the growth function that we impose for a model and is normal, that is, it's perpendicular to the front. Perpendicular to the front. That's a big hypothesis. Here, S is the covinear coordinates of the fronts, and both the co-function and the normal vector are defined locally. So it's local in regions that gives you an emergency. Excuse me, you said you will impose GS or you will try to find GS for a service? Yes, so in the first model I just impose it. Model, I just impose it, and another one I make it dependent on the position of it. So I start from a discrete conference where some of the points have a particular identity, there is with normal roof. So that they would proof is focused on the edge. Then I say for the propagation of my network that if the vein is too far away from its neighbor at a condition. Far away from its neighbor at a critical distance, then it divides symmetrically from its axis, and I put it at one-third of the distance between its neighbor vein. So I suppose that vein spacing is modular and amplification are symmetrical. This corresponds to several biological assumptions. First, that growth is marginal, so on the edge. That my amplification is symmetrical, and that event spacing is regular. So this corresponds to Tasting is regular. So, this corresponds to more ancestral traits. So, to go back to your question, here I just wanted to have a growth that was more important in one direction, kind of like a laminar growth. So, I imposed the sinusoidal function centered on a scope period. So, that's my growth function. So, every time the position of a point depends on the position. It depends on the position at the previous time interval and the growth function. So when I do that, I start from my very flat first front, and at first it has something that is a bit like a bell curve, and then it stabilizes into a finger front. Um so here you see that that the the final shape at this point doesn't change, so you always translate by the same instance. Always translate by the same distance. We see that that's what we call a stationary shape. We see that if you go on the last interface and you trace all the parents of your vein, you always have the same vein in the middle. So that's kind of like a leaf middle vein. And then you see that you have arching of the single derives. They're too big like what you can find in some loops. So this stationary shape doesn't depend on the initial rollfound shape. So it's a robust way to obtain a certain shape even though you can have some noise on the object you have at the beginning. So I wanted to validate the fact that I had a stationary shape. So to do that, to obtain the final profile, I just need to integrate the slope over the profile. The slope or the profile, and I link the slope to the normal vector, which is the output of my room function, and the translation, which is always the same for a station machine. When I do that, even if I vary the growth on the edge with my growth function, I always find something that is a bit finger-like, but it is more or less flat. Then we go back to what we call the middle vein. So we see that in reality, in most firms, that corresponds more to our hypothesis. We have something that is very regular. So you go left, right, left, right, left, right. We rotate deviating several times in the same direction like I have in my model. So I wanted a bit to explore why it was different than what I observed in reality. So to do that, I built a So to do that I build an iterative function. So this just describes how centered we are. So I take the position on the x-axis of our center and every time we derive in function of the position and the x-axis of the parent vein. So I obtain this kind of graph. So here we have two curves. So here a first curve for verification to the left and To the left and to the right, sorry, and another one for perfection to the left. So, this is a dynamical system in which I have two fixed points in which the system doesn't change, so for which you always find yourself on the same level. So, this is quite uh irregular because the scope is superior to one, so that means that um if you want to go from one configuration to the next, you just need to um project yourself to the diagonal. Project yourself to the diagonal and you always go on the edges so you always have a lane that is not in the middle and kind of crushes. So we can describe a bit more the shape. So the tail of the function corresponds to horizontal bifurcation. Phytix points to bifurcation at the same position and Position and here in the middle, bifurcation in the center. So, because I put the vein at one-third of the distance to its previous vein, I know that this distance corresponds to this subject. So, I wanted to describe how unstable my central wave is, so how I did it from this regular Netflix F wide thing. Uh so to do that, I need to know what is the I need to know what is the typical translation distance before which I divide. So in my model, the initial distance is four-thirds of the critical distance lambda. And just before I divide, I know that it's two times this distance, because that was the rule I implemented in my model. So this means that the front extends at a rate that is one half. One half that gives me my rule. Okay, at this typical front expansion, I divide. And this front expansion locally is just the curvature of my front. So if I go from the first point to another point, I know that I will divide when uh when I integrate this and it's equal to uh my uh my expansion rate. My expansion rate. Then I have uh two parameters, so that corresponds to a shift either to the left or to the right when I uh bifurcate. So I then plot the position on the x-axis in function of the initial position. So I find something that uh fits quite well my simulation. Important information is that every time, even though Is that every time, even though I change a bit micro function, I will always have a stoke that is appealed to one, so something that is unstable, and so a primary vein that is unstable that which rotates several times in one direction onto the other. So, the conclusion is that I have something unstable. What I also know is that the ratio between the The final distance and the initial distance is 1.5, so that means that the small shift from the center will always be amplified by 1.5. So I find also the stationary shape. I'm not showing it here, but I find these results when I change the number of ends, or I modify slightly my growth function, so I also have something that goes always in the same direction. So it's unstable. I wanted to add some kind of stability, and I did what every biologist offices do when they want to add some stability, is that I added some package. So here in this new model that we corresponds to a new growth function, the growth of the front is dependent on the position of the vines. The position of events. So this translates to a group function which corresponds to the sum of Gaussian centered on the position of the veins. So there are two new parameters. The initial one was the typical distance between the veins, the critical distance at which I divide, and the spread of my motion. So I have a ratio that corresponds to the ratio between. I have a new parameter that corresponds to the ratio between the typical distance between the vein, uh that you can find here, and the spread of migration. So at first I put it to one, and then I tune it comparatively to go higher or lower. And I find this kind of shape, so it's it's fan shape, a bit like this. And I see that uh I have something that is smooth when this parameter uh is more than one, uh so that when the the distance between the vein The distance between the veins is small to the spread of the Glotion, so that means that I don't have much feedback actually, and it's kind of always the same growth everywhere. On the contrary, when this parameter is bigger, I have some kind of oscillation on the front and on the position of the veins. I also have some blocks. I have some logs because I have some kind of I have some kind of edge effect. So here the group is normal, so if you are on the edge, you have less neighbors than other veins. So if you take the normal vector, which depends on the Russian center and the position of veins, the function is lower. So you find yourself pushed by a 90-degree angle that gives you some. Then, to explain the oscillations, if you take a look at the angle, you can To explain the oscillations, if you take the center of the group chain at the initial position and they're kind of far away, if you take the number vector, you converge. So at the next time step, they find themselves a bit farther away. Sorry, they find themselves a bit closer. So if I take the sum and the normal vector, then I diverge. So I keep converging and diverging, and that gives me a distance between my van that is quite stable. Then, if we saw earlier, we also had dependent on parameters something that was either smooth or with oscillations. So, if you just take the sum of the Gaussian, if my parameter is small, then I have something that is very smooth. And if it's high, then I have something that is a bit more marked with more feedback between the main position and the front move. I can also tune my broken so I have more. I can also tune my growth so I have more basal growth everywhere. I will always find the same shape, this is fun-like. But if I look, of course, here if I tune the basal growth, I have a group that is more important. If I stop it at the same maximum propagation, I have a different step of the fan chip. So we find it kinda looks like a different Different Jicobilova leaves. So, this was taken from two different trees. And you can say that all the shapes correspond to the same shape, but with kind of different steps of this final shape. So, I wanted to retrieve a primary vein because here I did not have this object that I looked at before. So I added the factor, which I call the weights on my primary on the vein that is the closest to the center. The new parameter which corresponds to the ratio of the weights of the central vein divided by the basal weight for all the other veins. And then when the vein will divide, I will give it to the most vertical vein. So I always have a proof that is more important on what I. Proof that is more important on one axis. If I do that, I see this kind of shapes, so it's a bit codex. And at first glance, I have a central vein that looks a bit more regular. Thirty-seconds, okay. So you can you can replace uh uh have uh some kind of different shape. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. You can describe the reality of this thing, and you see something that is more important if you have more feedback. Then you can say that this object corresponds to what you can see in this. I don't know how bulky relevant it is, but I like to see that at least it behaves. You can amuse yourself painfully to look. Painfully to look at growth of ferns in the lab to see if the growth is marginal or not. And when you do that, you don't see new vein division because it happens very fast. But you can see that with expansion, you have growth that is a bit at the margin. The general message here is that, in fact, the growth depends on the curvature and related. And related to our conference, I don't have root system, but here my roof is on the margin, so it's one-dimensional. And in other leaves, where roof is more diffuse, so a bit more two-dimensional, you can find reticulated patterns, also groups. And that's it. This is not in the model, but I'm just curious because the lambda sets like the in the end it's it will set the growth speed, I guess. But like, so and this was kind of like there's like an attractive there's like a like um um more than like an attractive attractive uh attribute inhibitor uh type of thing that you struggle at the beginning, right? Of thing that you struggle in the beginning, right? Yes. So, do you think if you would modulate the diffusion, then you can change the font, the code speed? So, I think it's a different kind of broke zone. So, there was been really well studied. So, there was a model of Adam Brignon's who wasn't previous, who based himself on This kind of thing to show transition from simple to composed GIF and to look at separation at large. But this number in your model is in our. It's like the critical distance on which a vein divides. It's kind of like describe just the fact that the distance between my veins is regular. But also I think some people are working on a diffusion model. The diffusion model of the Smorfogen, but it's usually more on the pitchation of the GIF at the moment. So it's when it's at another time scale. So you don't link to it to remotely. Yeah, I don't link to it. Those parameters are not really quantitative, but they just correspond to hypothesis across the glass. In your first leaf, like when you get a Like when you get a kind of sapmatilla finger shape of leaf. Do you actually have physical boundaries for your channel or not? No, I just but I I do not have physical boundaries but I set the groove on the edge to zero. I do not have any physical boundaries on my two sides but I did set the groove on the edge to zero. But if you I didn't do the simulation for it. Yeah, it's just that. Estimation for it? Yeah, it's just that I was worried that you would pose the shape by the size of the channel or something. Yeah. But if you wanted to tune the graph at the edge where it's not set, then you would find something that is more than flat. Yeah, that's... So if I continue the yellow or the orange shape, it would go out of your channel. Yeah, you had something that comes here. So you are imposing the fact that it cannot. The fact that it cannot grow on the edge. Yeah. Okay, but only at the bottom. Yes. But I think if I want to see what happens if I have this, I need to, in a way, to grow on the edge. So I have something that like this. Well, you can do that by making. By uh making uh one department I go to the path to the okay I have two quick questions. No, the first one is quick, maybe the second one now. So the first one is that in your bot in the same size. Um so um the veins are like any points of my discrete fronts and so they propagate exactly in the same way. So they propagate exactly in the same way they are the same size. Okay, and the second one is the growth function sorry, a function of the flow in the vessel. So the motion in the vessel. Or I don't know. So I don't have flow motion, but so I don't again in if we then put that support you know about change. I put that supplement theorem bunching and so he imposed a group that was more important in one direction. So it's the supplement TLR instability. So you put a viscous fluid into a more viscous fluid, a Herd racial cell. And then he had some goals here. So the group was more important in one direction. And then when he did that, he had the Yes, yes, yes, but I don't want to steal the time then. We can discuss it in yeah, I think we should postpone. We have another ten minutes at the end before we get to the next one. Sorry, sorry. I mean we can still just
