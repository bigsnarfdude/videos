Computer science. And this sort of sits around this argument that came about in the 80s from Paul Holland. He was the lead statistician for this sort of testing agency. And, you know, again, I'll leave it up to you whether or not this is politically motivated or not. But these tests were receiving a lot of bad press due to, you know, racial bias. And around this time, he came out with this paper, more or less arguing the reason why these tests can be. Reason why these tests can be bought is because, well, we're raising the cause. And his argument for this, I'm calling it Holland's argument, more or less goes like this: Premise one, all causes are manipulable. So that's a commitment to interventionism, more or less. Premise two, race is not manipulable, therefore race isn't a cause. Simple enough. And so that more or less is Honda's argument. And this has sort of spurred this huge literature, and I'll kind of give a brief conception. And I'll kind of give a brief conceptual taxonomy. So you could fall in one of these four camps here. You can say race is not a cause on non-manipulable grounds, so that's more or less Holland's view. You can say race is a cause on manipulable grounds. Pearl takes this position. He doesn't really say how this is the case, but he claims it. Which is the case with lots of things, Pearl says. But neither here or there. Race is a cause in some non-manipulable ways, so you're committed to race being a cause, but Admitted to race being the cause, but through a non-interventionist route, perhaps. And then, lastly, race is not a cause on non-manipulable grounds, but maybe aspects of race are, or proxies for race. So maybe we can't intervene on race, but maybe we can intervene on something very correlated with race, like neighborhood. You know, it's like these studies where, you know, they give people stipends in these areas, they move to another location, and we want to predict whether or not it had an effect on educational attainment. There are privacy as hurts. They're in privacy as race, you know, or signals for race. So, those are more or less the four views in that camp. And also, a lot of this hinges on manipulability. Now, of course, Holland did not say what he meant by manipulable, but as far as I can tell, there's at least three senses of which people are talking about this. The first one is all called like pragmatic intervention. So, this is something that's a cause more or less remanipable if it's aligned with more or less pragmatic. Align with more or less pragmatic constraints, whether or not those be normative. You know, so like I can't force pregnant ladies to smoke to see whether or not, you know, there's birth defects, and that's not a real intervention. I can't do it. Also, you know, one of my mentors, Paul Rosenbaum, he thinks things like, oh, enhancing public education. That's not a real manipulation. It's vague. I don't know what that means. So he's. Know what that means, so he so he thinks something that couldn't be realized due to real actual political constraints-that's not a manipulation. So, that's the strictest sense of manipulation. The next one, I'll say, yeah, so I'll kind of more or less talking about that here. Physically possible, it's just something that's consistent with physical laws of nature. I don't know anything about physics, but I imagine things like this like going faster than the speed of light. I don't know. I don't know if that contradicts modern physics, but basically, it needs to be consistent with physical laws. Consistent with physical laws and the most permissible, this is like Woodward's view, what Pearl is talking about, is like what I was saying, theoretically possible. And of course, you know, they don't really say what they mean by this, but what I can imagine they mean more or less is something that doesn't violate designation of an individual. So for instance, here's an example of something that we're involved. Like, would I have been a basketball player? Would I have played basketball at Alabama State had I had different biological parents? That doesn't make any sense. Presumably, if you think. Make any sense. Presumably, if you think, I'll forget my father's name. So I'm going to put him around. But my mother's Sylvia. Tari, if you think I had Sylvia Talbert and Russell Wrong, that was his name. If I had different parents, that wouldn't even be me, different biological parents. Now, again, you might debate with me on whether or not those things are really designated, but the point is, that's what more or less would be going. You know, regardless of if you designate whether or not the. Regardless, if you designate whether or not those things are designated. Okay, but this also involves, when I say the U.S. race debate. So it involves a lot of philosophy of race. If you're not familiar with the philosophy of race, I'll give you a quick little primer here on the philosophy of race. So the philosophy of race is centered around mostly this question. What is the nature and reality of race given the current and ordinary way American English speakers use the word race to classify people? And so let me clarify here. So the nature and essence of race is what we're Nature. Essence of race is what we mean by race when we're classifying people. Most, though, not all, assume there's a singular or dominant meaning of race among English speakers. So Haslinger says this is in her book. And the focus here is the current race talk. And we're focused on American race talk. And there's more or less a few views. I'm going to kind of briefly go through them. So I know people assume social constructivism, but believe it or not, philosophy or race, that is, it's lots of different perspectives. That is, there's lots of different perspectives on what race is. So, the nature: so, one, you believe that race is essentially a biological entity and contingently unreal. So, this is like Oppia, Blum, Glasgow argued this. Race is essentially a biological entity and contingently real. And within there, there's different perspectives one will take about that. So, one, race is a biosocial entity. So, Catherine Kindig at Michigan State argues this. Lucius Outlaw. Argues this, Lucius Outlaw argues this, Yosef Washington argues this. Race is biological, not asocial, and real. So Quayshawn Spencer, yeah. Quick question. Not necessary. So like they mean like in all, like, like in all worlds or whatever. Like, so a lot of these people are talking like it's a necessary property of something. So for instance, the accidental property is something. So for instance, an accidental property is something like Priuses or silver. You know, that's not a part of the concept of a Prius. Nothing contingent. Yeah, that's contingent. Yeah, it's an accidental feature of the thing. Yes, so yeah, so the Kway Sean, one of my advisors, he argues that race is a biological thing. Okay, moving on. Again, there's lots of views in this. So again, even amongst the social constructivists, you have different views of this. So race is essentially a not biological entity. Essentially, a not biological entity and contingently real. So, you could be of the Haslinger-Mills Roots camp that thinks it's a political entity in real. You could be like Chik Jeffers that thinks that race is a cultural entity in real. Or you could be like Glasgow. This is called basic realism. So, stuff under a tree or stuff over there. Like, that's a real category. That's a basic kind, according to him. So, it's neither biological nor social. Nor social, yet real. Stuff under a tree. Like, I just threw my pocket change for myself under a tree. So he thinks that's one category there. Of course, you could be Talbert. What do you have? You know, here, Talbert at all, but Talbert switched before. I just be agnostic about this whole business. I'm agnostic about the essence of race, so who knows? You know, I don't even think it's relevant, but that's not the talk of the day. I'm skeptical of any metaphysics, but whatever. Whatever. And then there remains this open question: if you want to get a good paper that's impactful in my area, you publish something on race as not biological and contentionally unreal. There's no views on that yet. So you grad students get the work. You grad students can get the work. You have a novel view on the philosophy of race right there, ready to go. Now, again, now to understand this debate, again, I got to give you a little philosophy. I know this room, people don't know nothing about philosophy. Give me a little philosophy of language. Philosophy, but a little philosophy of language. So, a lot of this has been around to understand the debate is, you know, within the parameters of philosophy. So, the limits of my language means the limit of my world. I don't know if people have any read any loot with Dickenstein, but you know, an interesting fellow to say the least. And so, when we're talking about meaning here and essences, those things are at least in the race literature. They're kind of using those things interchangeably. So, they're kind of taking this view from Kwan. So they're kind of taking his view from Kwine here, where meaning is what essence becomes when it's divorced from the object and wedded to the word. So the translation here means that the essence of race is just the meaning of race. So that's what people are talking about in this literature. So what's the meaning of a name? So again, this is a background in philosophy of language. So there are proper names. So Barack Obama, that's a proper name. And there's common names, like president. And this is. And this is a study that was done by David Chalmers, just kind of surveying people's views and philosophy about these things. So, apparently, three out of four, three out of four philosophers of language adopt truth conditional meanings for names. And now, more on this. So, meanings of names or official content is contribution to truth conditional propositions in which it occurs. In other words, the thing you use to figure out whether or not a sentence. Whether or not a sentence is true. And so the contribution can be superficial properties. So competent users of a name typically use to fix a referent. So this is sort of like what's called a descriptivist view of language. More Haslinger here. So the contribution can also be, this is sort of a Haslangrian perspective on this, a referentialist view. And I'll give some examples of what I mean by this. And I'll give some examples of what I mean by this. Abstract philosophy. So, example one. So, what does Sasha mean? Well, if you're a descriptivist, the secondborn child of Barack and Michelle LeBron, that's what that means. If you're a referentialist, it's just that. Just the thing in the world that that points to. The thing it refers to. I'm not going to go into Tarski here, but it's the thing out there for which satisfies those conditions. Satisfies those conditions. Now, if you read this, it is a great book. I don't know if you read it, but Becoming by Michelle Obama, I would encourage anybody to read that book, if there is good read. She talks in that book actually about having a miscarriage. And so let's just kind of evaluate this. So yeah, so which was right. So it depends on which view gets the true values of the relevant proposition. For example, according to Becoming, Melina could have been the secondborn child of Barack and Michelle Obama. Sasha. Michelle Obama. Sasha is the second born child of Barack and Michelle Obama, and Melina could have been the second born child of Michelle or Barack Obama. Logically implies that Molina could have been Sasha. But is Molina could have been Sasha true? So descriptivism sort of as a theory gets that wrong or seeing something wrong about that. Well, if you're in favor of descriptivism, I'm going to show you, I've seen me in favor of referendum. You, I've seen me favor referentialism on the basis of this. We're going to show why that might not work either. So, I don't know anything about you know, astronomy and physics or astronomy here, but you know, in the 19th century, I'm going to attempt to say this guy's name with my accent, but he proposed the existence of Vulcan and he was using trying to explain perturbations in Mercury. Two minutes, okay, let's move it here quickly then. Yeah, so basically, he says. Basically, he successfully predicted Neptune by observing Uranus's orbit. He used a similar method for predicting Mercury, assuming he used a similar method for Mercury, predicting Vulcan. So descriptivism here is a circular planet closer to Mercury. Referentialism is nothing, basically. Because Vulcan doesn't exist. Well, the problem there is like Charles Darwin, I don't know if you know anything about his work, but you know, he had this idea with Jim Yole, which is like the unit of heredity. Heredity, that picks out nothing too. So Vulcan and Gemini's, you know, refer to the same thing. Is that true? So no. So in that case, referential basically has a problem for things that fail to refer. Glasgow, the debate on race, basically picks out three things that we could be talking about. Or simply four things. One, should the normative questions, should we eliminate or conserve racial discourse or racial thinking? Or racial thinking. There's the ontological question I mentioned earlier: is race real? There's a conceptual question: what are we talking about when we talk about race? And then there's the methodological question. How should we answer the conceptual question? Like, should it be through armtrail or philosophizing? Should we be through empirical stuff? And of course, I add more to this in some forthcoming papers that will be out in 2024. There's also these epistemic questions. Before. It's also these epistemic questions that Lily was talking about earlier. Can we have scientific knowledge at race? What properties or micro variables can constitute race for it to be a well-defined macro variable in scientific research? You might have these epistemic questions you're interested in. Do we need knowledge of race itself or do we need knowledge of racialized groups for scientific knowledges or algorithm person? Can we just have, how do we have scientific knowledge of racialization? I mean, these epistemic questions, you might be. These epistemic questions you might be interested in. And this is a little chart on sort of the taxonomy I was talking about earlier. And I'll wrap up here since I'm not going to get to this thesis. I'll tell you what my argument is. You can read your paper online and see how I argue it. Basically, I argue you can't know whether or not race is a cause because it's confounded by a whole bunch of stuff. The reason why race is confounded, I mostly complain about positivity violations. Positivity is really problematic in a world where this exists, the paracial wealth gap. I've been. Wealth gap. I'm in this group right here. My net wealth is 141,000. Y'all, white folks out here is a half a million. And so in a world where there's no overlap between these two distributions, that's very problematic for estimating causal effects. And this is even worse. I got to finish the punchline here, so y'all got to be patient. And so this is even worse when you take a social constructivist view of race, because the definition of social constructivist. Because the definition of social constructivism, according to Maslanger, is that hierarchical positioning of ethnic groups in the brief society, political formation, the process of racialization. So basically, like groups not overlapping. That's what makes a race, a racialized group. And a racialized group is a race, according to Hasling. The more you have racialization, the more you have racialized groups. It's not like racialization has stopped. It's still happening. The more you have that, you have positivity, the less you have caused. The less you have causal inference. Okay? Straight up. So, and now this is a problem because inability to make causal inferences means you don't have knowledge of racialization. Okay. Yeah, sure. Okay. So our last presentation, I think we just saw one of us. Can you hear us? Wait, yeah, if you could go ahead and share your screen. Okay. You can hear and see the others. We can hear you. We now see your slides. Great. Okay. Let me just do this. Okay. I'm just saying thank you very much for a lot.
