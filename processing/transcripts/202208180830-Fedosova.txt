Jenya is joining us from the University of Freiburg and she did her PhD at the University of Bonn under the supervision of Vanna Müller. And she also worked briefly with me as a postdoc in Sweden. So, Senia, welcome. Thank you so much for that. And thank you so much for the introduction and. The introduction, and it's a pleasure for me to give a talk, and also good morning, everyone. The plan for today's talk, first I wanted to talk very shortly about the scattering of gravitons appearing in the string theory, then how some PDE which are appearing, which are Are which you might have seen even if you're not doing the string theory. Then, for such partial differential equations that appear, we are trying to calculate the Fourier coefficients explicitly, and for that, we are using self-written Python program. Then, afterwards, we figure out that the solutions that we were able to find, we cannot prove their atomicity without some. Their atomorphicity without some identities appearing from the number theory. And finally, we are also having some issues finding exact solutions in the case of certain parameters not in the good range. And we hope that we can use differential theory to study why this phenomenon occurs. So, string theory. So, string theory, some Python calculations, number theory, Romanusian identities, and differential Palois theory. And but what we really start with is with the setup, we are in the upper half plane representation of the in the of the representation of the hyperbolic plane, the set of the The isometry preserve of orientation preserving isometries are exactly the PSO2R matrices which are acting on H by the Meris transformation and out of this P SL2 there's a very famous and a very nice discrete subgroup which is referred to as a modular group that Two as a modular group. That's a group of two by two matrices with the determinant equals to one, whose of two by two matrices with the integer coefficients whose determinant is equal to one. We additionally give one more definition. We say that a function which is mapping from the hydrobolic plane to complex numbers is said to be automorphic if it is invariant under the action of PS. The action of PSL to z. In particular, automorphicity implies that the function f is invariant under the shift in the x direction by 1, because the matrix element 1101 belongs to PSL2Z. And that's probably everything that you really need to know about PSL2Z in order to. About PSL2Z in order to understand the scope. So we are using the physical notation for the Laplace operator on the hyperbolic plane. So what do I mean by physical? I mean that it is going to be negatively. It is a negative Laplace operator. So it is a very complicated. It is very complicated to study the spectral properties of the plastic operator on a modular surface, but if we are in the hyperbolic upper half plane, then we can immediately come up with, at least formally, with some eigenfunctions for this Laplace operator. If we simply substitute y to the power of s, if we try to apply the Laplace operator to y to the power of s, then The power of s, then we will see that this is going to be a formal eigenfunction of our Laplace operator with eigenvalue s times s minus one. So, however, this solution lacks automorphicity. It is invariant under the shift in the x direction, but it is not invariant with respect to. With respect to anything else. So, and for that reason, we could try to symmetrize this y to the power of s over the whole modular group in order to obtain at least formal eigenfunction of the Laplace operator, which is according to the automorphic. So, that's just y to the power. That's just y to the power of s, and the summation is performed over the group. A modular stabilizer of the casp, this thing is just for the Eisenstein series to converge. But so in general, it's just metaphorometers applied to construct this so-called Eisenstein series. So these Eisenstein series do not belong to the L2 space, and that's going to be one of the problems. One of the problems, but in general, we have a modular group, we have definition automorphicity, and we have defined now the Eisenstein series. Okay, good. Now we are going to some new functions appearing in the string theory. So, what people are, when people are studying type 2b string theory in the 10 dimensions, they are sometimes They are sometimes studying the so-called scattering of gravitons. And here I have drawn an image of approximately in which setup the problem that I am to describe, the functions that I am to describe appear. So this weird drawing on the slide is supposed to represent the Feynman diagram. The Feynman diagram of two gravitons, which instead of the points, became S1 closed strings. So on the left-hand side, we have two gravitons, and as the time progress, they bump into each other, then something happens, something happens, something happens. And in the end, we have two gravitons flying happily away from each other. Away from each other. So, this diagram is sometimes referred to as for graviton, for because we have two gravitons on the entrance, two gravitons on the exit, for graviton two loop or scattering. And the scattering of the gravitons is described by automorphic functions, and that and some example of this. That and some examples of the function we have already seen are on the first slide. That is Eisenstein series with the parameter s equals five half and s equals three half. Since I'm not hearing any comments, remarks or complaints, shall I continue or my internet connection is broken? Your internet, yeah, it's it's great. Yeah, it's great. Okay, okay, fantastic. Please, anyone, if you have questions, feel free to ask, including everyone who's joining us via Zoom. Okay. Ah, no, now I can see you. I'm sorry. I'm just feel weird talking to a monitor. So, yeah, so the scattering of Yeah, so the scattering of graviton is described weirdly enough by automo functions. The correct phrasing would be that the low energy expansion in the scattering amplitude of gravitons are described by the generalized Eisenstein series. But what does that mean for us as mathematicians? It means that solutions of our Of our such partial differential equations, they appear in the scattering of gravitons. So, what is happening here? Here we have our Laplace operator and we have subtracted some spectral parameter R. We have applied this second-order partial differential operator to F, which is going to be a function that we are going to search. And this equation is inhomogeneous. On the right-hand side, we have On the right-hand side, we are having a product of the Eisenstein series as well. So, and we have this equation, partial differential equation, depends on three parameters. The first parameter is R appearing in the left-hand side over here, and two others below are here. So, usually physicists have special rules for which Have special rules for which they can have some special rules on this set of parameters at the very moment for us. What is important for us is that R should be bigger than zero. So the goal is, oh yeah, and this function f, there's sometimes called generalized Eisenstein. Generalized Eisenstein series. I'm not so sure that I'm extremely happy with this notation, but we will stick to it until the end of this talk. And just in case, you might be immediately inclined to apply the resolvent to the right-hand side of the equation to find the solution, to find f explicitly. Explicitly, but you cannot do this very rigorously because the right-hand side does not belong to the domain of the definition of the resolvent. So physicists started studying this generalized Eisenstein series by exactly the same procedure. They were applying the resolvent to the right-hand side and then did something, but. did something but we are we are going to be trying to we are going to be not trying to do this we are trying to be slightly more rigorous so um what have we done with kim we have or figured out that we have figured out that we can find the fully expansion in for certain values of the parameters ah no before before i talk about that i wanted to talk first about the fully expansion for the eisenstein series and which functions are appearing in And which functions are appearing in there. So, this is some very known facts from the number theory: that the Eisenstein series, we first recall that this is an SL to Z invariant function. That implies in particular that it is invariant under the action of 1,101. That means it is invariant under the shift in the X direction, and thus we can find its Fourier expansion in X. After we find this Fourier expansion, The after we find this Fourier expansion, the coefficients are going to be functions in y. And so let me describe you how these functions depend on functions in y. So the first zeroth coefficient is a product of y to the power of s and y to the power of 1 minus s. Sorry, a sum of y to the power of s and 1 to the power minus s with some Riemann zeta function and gamma function decoration standing in front of. Declaration standing in front of the y to the power of one minus s. So the non-zero Fourier coefficient as a function of y, it is essentially a square root of y multiplied by the modified Bessel function of the second type with the coefficient which depends on the Riemann zeta function, gamma function, and the divisor function. Device a function. So the modified vessel functions of the second type. If I'm pretty sure that people sitting in the room are way more experts than me, but just in case, if we have somebody who has maybe not seen modified Bessel functions, they're usually appearing in the physics in the if you're doing some calculations which are invariant under the rotor. Under the rotation. And so, in fact, if you want to hear the shape of a cylindrical drum, then what you're going to hear is going to be the eigenvalue, is zeros of the modified vessel functions. So, once we have seen the full year expansion of the Eisenstein series, let us enjoy full-year expansion of the In joyful year expansion of the generalized Einstein series. And so the theorem that Kum and I have proven is that for sufficiently small values of these parameters and sufficiently small in this context means something that r is small than 15 and alpha is better and small than 30. Additionally, we require that alpha better Additionally, we require that alpha beta belong to half integers. That's a demand sometimes appearing in string theory. So we've decided to restrict ourselves to this situation. The second condition is funnier. The second condition is stating that the parity of r plus alpha plus beta belongs to 2z. And for such sufficiently For such sufficiently small values of parameters, we consider a function, a generalized Eisenstein series. We consider generalized Eisenstein series, but true we thought we are just considering some function which satisfies this partial differential equation. And we assume that this is periodic in the X variables so that we can find the Fourier series. So then the claim is that. Then the claim is that this sum, the F is expressed with the Fourier series and where each of the small coefficients has this crazy look, which is comprised of some homogeneous solution and a particular solution. A particular solution of a certain partial differential equation. So, how does it look like the small f with hat and one and n2 is going to be equal a sum of modified Bessel function of the second type, modified Bessel function of the first type, and some rational function times the product of ki and kj with the index of i and j is going to be equal to zero and one. zero and one these polynomials depend uh on our uh and one and two uh sorry this is not lambda this should be r and alpha and uh beta so uh related related results uh the first uh known or full solution for the generalized eisenstein series has been given in twenty fifteen In 2015, by Green, Miller, and Van Hoof for a very special value of parameter alpha equals beta equals three-half and r equals three. Then in a 2019 team has found with the help of the spectral decomposition the solution for more or less arbitrary alpha, beta, and R with one of the essential steps, where one of the essential steps was getting rid of the. Of steps was getting rid of this non-integrability of the product of the Eisenstein series. Then in one year called Chester Green, Silvo Puffer Bank and when they have found solutions for some very small values of alpha, beta, and r. As far as I remember, alpha and beta was less than equal to 7 of 7.5, and r was the bigger. And their r was the biggest r was five or seven, and they didn't find the full Fourier expansion, they only found the zeroth mode of this Fourier expansion. So the solutions that were found in Jester, Green, Silver, Puffo, among them is some kind of solutions which explicitly appear in this graviton scattering. And I will be calling these solutions to be physical. Be calling these solutions to be physically relevant solutions until the end of the talk. It doesn't mean that other solutions are physically irrelevant, it's just that I do not know if they are or not. So also, interestingly enough, similar type of the problems appear not only if you're working with the string theory, but if, for example, you are studying automorphic functions which are twisted by non-unitary representations of the fundamental. Non-unitary representations of the fundamental group. Together with Julie and Anaka Paul this year, we have been studying a four-year expansion of such twisted automorphic functions. And we have ended up that if in the case when the twist that we were observing in this situation, this twist of the fundamental group was non-unitary, then we ended up with a solved. We ended up with solving partial some ordinary differential equation which would suffice to describe a solution of this type 4 arbitrary S. This is not exactly the generalized Eisenstein series, but pretty close. So, how do we find a solution? Solutions actually, rather easy. We first find the full Fourier expansion and instead of PDE for our generalized Enzerstein series, we write ordinary differential equation for each component. Then we arrive at some second-order ordinary differential equations. Second order ordinary differential equation depending on parameter n1, n2, r, alpha, and beta. And the homogeneous part is going to be the modified Bessel equation, and the inhomogeneous part is going to be the product of a modified Bessel function. So we know that solution is comprised of an homogeneous Of a homogeneous ordinance over homogeneous solution, which is going to be, which is written here. And some partial, and there is also some partial solution, which we assume is exactly of this form. It is rational functions tense, the product of the modified vessel functions. And this guess was. This guess was not exactly out of blue. One reason for the guess why the solution would be of this form would be that if you try to find a solution for this ordinary differential equation with the help of the variation of the coefficients, then you will be in a problem of integrating something, something, something. Something, something, something modified abesse functions. So it is known from the Louis-Will theorem that an integral of an elementary function can be either very complicated and unsolvable, or it is having a particularly easy form. So I do not know if their theory of such Louisville integration exists for Exists for modified Bessel functions in it. The best closed thing is the differential Galois theory, but we have just made a guess that any particular solution is of this form. So a similar guess was being done by Miller, Green and Van Van Hoff when. Miller, Green, and Van Van Hoff, when they first arrived, when they first gave the explicit solution, but just an additional motivation why a particular solution has this form. So now we assume that we have a particular solution of this form. We substitute the solution into ordinary differential equation. On the right-hand side, we are going to be having actually something of this form as well. We are going to be Of this form as well, we're going to be having a product of some rational function once again times modified Bessel functions. How do we know that? We know that because we know that they are recurrence relations on the modified Bessel functions. And if you have a modified Bessel function of an integer index, you can always express it as some rational functions times k0 plus rational. times k0 plus rational functions times k1. So now our particular solution is parametrized by coefficients in this rational function and everything that is left is to solve system of the linear equation on these coefficients. So however, given that we have a lot of symbolic, a lot of parameters, this is unfortunate. Parameters, this is unfortunately not so easy to do. So let me just show you on the next slide more or less a matrix which we get. And you can immediately see that this matrix, you can immediately see that this formulas and all this modified Bessel function not only have. Besides function, they not only have application in the string theory but also in the cross-stitching. And the black dots here denote the entries of matrix which are not zero, and the white ones are the zero ones. So you can see that we need to solve some sister of linear equation whose matrix is going to be a band matrix, which is having this nice. Having this nice particular form. Unfortunately, experimentally, it turns out that the solution is going to be pretty big and you cannot do this by hands. I also figured out that Wolfram Mathematica is not capable of solving the system of linear coefficient for some or another reason. So maybe I just embed Mathematical. So I just wrote a program in Python, which is doing this. In Python, which is doing these calculations autonomously. So just let me show you how it almost approximately looks like. It's just about 200 lines of text. And for example, this part is going to be describing this matrix. And then we have some recursive definition of the modified Bessel function. Of the modified Bessel function, and so, for example, if you want to find a solution with alpha equals one-half and beta equals one-half, then after one less than one second, you are getting this marvelous solution. And we can already verify in both from Mathematica that the solution. That the solution, that this is indeed the solution of this differential equation that we needed. So you can change it to get the solution that Van Hoof was obtaining together with Miller. And then about after one second of the solution, we also have something that we can verify in. Something that we can verify in both from mathematica to be that I hope we can verify in mathematical. Yes, we can verify mathematical that the right-hand side of our ordinary differential equation is going to be just this product of the modified Basel function. So this is programmed in Python using the library which is called numerical. Called numerical answer. It's not numpy. This is symbolical Python. So, and if you're having a question, why was it using C or C ⁇? Because it would definitely be faster. And the answer would be because I couldn't find a module in C ⁇, which is doing the symbolical solution of our linear equation. Python has it, and it is in our SemPy open soft open source software and Open source software and it's kind of working pretty nicely. So, however, this size of the matrix and this that we need to take, it depends on the parameters alpha, beta, and r. And so, what Python, what this Python code is doing is taking this. encode is doing it is taking these parameters are alpha and better and it finds a symbolical solution in n1 and n2 to to be able to treat all the full year coefficients simultaneously at the same time so if we um if we slightly think about about the asymptotical behavior of the solution at Behavior of the solution at infinity, then we can also get the restrictions on the size of this matrix depending on these parameters. And very roughly speaking, we're using a motivation from Kovacic algorithm. I will come later to just talking about what the Kovacic algorithm is. So, and now I just wanted to show you that the easiest physically relevant solution. Relevant solution was found by Greenhof seven years ago. The next easiest physically relevant solution would be for the parameters alpha three half, beta five half and r equals four. And the and one of the and I didn't on this slide, I just wrote the rational function for the zero, zero component of the standing in front of the modified vessel function. So you see the rational function. So you see that unfortunately the calculations are becoming very big and I do not know if there is a way to really simplify that, to really simplify the output. So with the help of this Python script, we are capable to find explicit solutions, at least if alpha is smaller than 30, beta smaller than 30, and R smaller than 15. In general, the time for the solution grows approximately more or less linear. Approximately more or less linear with alpha and exponentially with the spectral parameters. So you might ask me why exponentially, because usually you would need all to the power of n to the power of three in order to find a solution of our linear equation. But it turns out if you want to find them symbolically with the integer coefficients, then you are facing a problem. And you have to And you have them there to, and the most common algorithms that is just the Gaussian elimination, which is implemented in SIMPy, would need exponential time depending on the values of R. There are some algorithms that allow for the polynomial growth. However, I wasn't seeing them being realized and it was about one week to the conference and I didn't dare to write it by myself. Into by myself. So interestingly enough, then we got all the physically relevant solutions that would be appearing in the scattering amplitudes for the graviton, for the small expansion of the energy. And then we've actually decided, oh, why don't we try some other values of alpha, beta, and r? And so it turns out that there are some solutions that are physically relevant, which are not present. Physically relevant, which are not present in our Chester articles in these physical articles, but where we are called can find solutions. So, in particular, for example, for alpha equals beta equals three half and lambda equals two, the solution is particularly easy. That is, and yeah, now I'm calling this solution to be particularly easy. And so it contains the particular solution. A particular solution of our modified Bessel equation, and it has the homogeneous solutions. So, and I would like to point your attention at the moment that I was never talking about these solutions and how to choose alpha and beta properly, and if there is some reasonable choice for such alphas and beta. Alphas and betas. So if you want your solution to be not growing exponentially when you are going inside a cusp when y is tending to infinity, you would have to kill the contribution better and one and two. With the alphas situation are more you need to be way more careful with alphas. So It turns out, so usually people would want a solution that would not be exponentially expanding. For that reason, we need to feel better. However, we are still left with the choices of alpha. And it turns out that choosing the wrong alphas might destroy the automaticity of the whole solution. And very roughly, a necessary condition for your solution. Condition for your solution to be automorphic is to have some certain asymptotic expansion for each Fourier coefficient. We figured out that although that in okay and in this physically relevant situations, manipulating alpha and one and n2 can kill the leading term of the asymptotic expansion of the y tends to zero. So it means that if you if you have this solution in if you have this solution in the if you have such a solution in the physically relevant situation manipulating alpha can make a very good very good asymptotic expansion as y goes to zero so however it turned out that in physically irrelevant situations such nice asymptotic expansions are not happening and even moreover the most natural choice Moreover, the most natural choice that we could think of of choosing is alpha, n1, and n2 makes all converge, all solutions diverge. So, however, the sums they can be regularized with more or less the Ramanujan summation formula outside the domain of its convergence. So, according to some very clever reasoning, the Zach here, The Zach here, the solution of our partial differential equation with this Fourier coefficient, with this nth Fourier coefficient, is automorphic if and only if the contribution from the contribution from the homogeneous part is vanishing. And at the moment, you might be very You might be very unhappy and saying to me, but Senior, the particular solution of an ordinary differential equation is not defined uniquely. So, because you can just add to any particular solution a solution, homogeneous solutions to obtain the particular solution. So, what are you talking about when you're talking about the vanishing of the homogeneous part? So, it turns out that in So it turns out that in this particular situation that we are working with, there is a canonical choice. We can separate the homogeneous part from the inhomogeneous part because we have modified Bessel functions which are linearly independent from each other. So interestingly enough, it turns out that our solution seems to be automorphic if and only if we're having the vanishing of the homogeneous part of each of the four. Of each of the Fourier coefficient. And in fact, what are these choices of alpha n1 and two that need to be made? They are going to be explicit exactly some product of the divisor functions multiplied by functions on n1 and n2. So, in fact, why and so you see the solution. The solution seems to be automorphic if and only if such sum vanishes, and/or such sum vanishes. So, interestingly enough, it turns out that these sums, you can think of them as an extension of the Ramanujan summation, where the sum additional shift is introduced. So, there are these marvelous formulas on infinite sums of the divisor functions. Divisor functions. If you sum infinitely many divisor functions, you have a chance to get a product of Riemann zeta functions. Totally marvelous. And in fact, this Riemannutian summation explains to you the vanishing of the homogeneous part of the zeroth Fourier coefficient of such generalized Eisenstein series. Series. So additionally, it turns out that every solution that we obtain are very nice from a perspective of the differential Galois theory. And let me just lead you through a crash course in the differential Galois theory. I would be assuming that you know what a Galois theory is. So and in the Galois theory, And in the Galois theory, you usually start with some field, which is just some field of numbers. In differential Galois theory, you start with a differential field. That's a field together with an operation of derivation, which is satisfying Leibniz rule of differentiation. Additionally, in the Galois theory, In the Galois theory, from a field, you are studying extensions of this field obtained by adjoining solution of certain algebraic equations. So, yeah, certain algebraic equations. So, what you're doing in differential Galois theory, instead of adding the solutions, the roots of some polynomials, you're ending a fundamental system of solutions of certain differential equations. Points. So it is indeed differential in Galvois theory in this sense. Then, similarly to the usual Galois theory, there is a group of automorphisms of an extension that fix the original differential field. And I guess it's the main Galois theory is that you Is that your polynomial admits a solution in radicals if and only if the Galois theory is solvable. So there is a similar statement in the differential Galois theory. And in fact, with the help of this statement, we can prove that our Our friend's modified person are elementary functions if and only if the values of the parameter of the if they have the half integer indices. So that can be done with the help of the differential law theory. So now interestingly enough if If we start with the differential field of rational functions to which we adjoin modified Bessel functions of index zero and one, I'm sorry, that was a misprint. And then we take the Picar Visior extensions of this differential field with the help of our Help of our partial, with the help of our ordinary differential equation that we have obtained, then the problem that we have reduces, the problem is our equation solvable in terms of the nice functions, just reduces to a conjecture that the Galois group of the Spicarvis your extension with respect to this feed differential field of function is good if and only if after. If and only if alpha plus beta plus r belong to 2z. So, and this is a conjecture at the moment for small alpha and beta and r, we have obtained a statement by simply providing a solution. And I would like to mention that we believe that this conjecture might even be true because. Be true because this condition resembles a lot the statements for Galois groups of special functions. For example, you can usually study the special functions with the help of the differential Galois theory, such as modified vessel functions. But you can also do that for the hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric function. You can sometimes do it for this point polynomial. So you can do this for a lot of special functions. And in a lot of the special functions, the condition will be very similar to what we are taking here. So, and additionally, we would be really hoping that there is an algorithm which allows you to calculate the color group of this differential equation. This differential equation. Unfortunately, not that I know for this particularly ODE, there is a statement in the differential Galois theorem that there is always a logarithm for finding a Galois group. And here we are having an ODE where the coefficients are the rational functions and the modified Bessel function. In the case when we were in the rational coefficients, there exists. Efficients, there exists so-called Kovatic algorithm to calculate its covari group and find the exact solution. In fact, this Kovatic algorithm is the algorithm in a world from Mathematica behind the solving an ordinary differential equation of the second order. Well, one of the algorithm. Well, okay, more precisely, they are stating in one place in their documentation that they're using the Komatic algorithm. That they're using the Kovatic algorithm and other places of the documentation, they're stating that they are not disclosing to the public what they're using, but we will be suspecting that this is a Kovatic algorithm. So these Kovatich algorithms, they in some cases you can perform them by hand. For example, you can do that for such a modified basic function. You can do this sometimes if you're doing a Sometimes, if you're doing a Schrodinger equation, and for example, if you're considering the harmonic or selector, then you would be obtaining an condition that your Kalois group is good if and only if you are having your eigenvalues to be exactly the eigenvalues of the harmonic correspondator. But in general, unfortunately, the Kovatic algorithm for their modified Bessel function does not really. function does not really does not really exist at least does not exist at the moment however uh in the case when we are um sorry this is yeah so however if we are in the case when alpha and beta are not half integers if they're integers the right hand side of our modified baseline equation would be Bessel equation would be more or less rational function. By more or less rational function, I mean that it's going to be multiplied by some exponents and stuff, maybe, but this is like not such a big problem because we know that this thing is an elementary function. And so in the case when alpha and beta belongs to that, Kovatic algorithm or some modification of Kovatic algorithm should work in this situation to study. study the to study the some partial differential equation appearing in the string theory with that i would like to thank you for your attention i would like to thank you for your patience and i would like to say sorry if i was mispronouncing a lot of things and i would beg your forgiveness for for But forgiveness for me not being as agile as you probably expected due to not good health conditions. I know this is not an excuse, but thank you once again for your patience. And that would be the end of the talk. Thank you so much, Kisania. Does anyone have questions? Does anyone have questions either here in Oaxaca or from wherever you all are joining us, from abroad? Yes. So, this is maybe a very naive question, but because I know nothing about string theory, I was wondering if. I was wondering if there are other arithmetic function groups that are relevant to this theory, because you talked about just the modular group. But yeah, so. So first, I believe that your question is not naive. And second, I think that you're overestimating my knowledge of string theory. So I can tell you that the modular group is appearing here because people in the Here, because people in the string theory at some point say that they're performing an toroidal compactification for the small dimension, and then they're saying they're working with the modulus spaces of toruses, and the modulus spaces of the torus, it's extremely connected to the fundamental domain of the SL2Z. And so, this example, this example with PSL2Z, it's With PSL, that it's an um in a way, it's a toy example that is appearing in the string in the string here. In general, you would be wanting to work with more general harmonic, with more general Lie groups and more general locally homogeneous spaces. So, but like I can only work with PSL present at the moment, we can only work with PSL. We can only work with PSO together. There are some extensions where instead of H you are you are having H to the power of N, or where you have gamma modular K where gamma is a semi-simple group and K it's maximal compact subgroup. So they're they're that types of things appearing, but uh rather than SL2Z Other than a SALTUZAT, if you're interested about whether for this situation, any other group other than the Assaltuzat is appearing, not to my knowledge. Thank you. Do we have further questions? Yes. This is Clara. This is Clara. Hi. So, thank you, Senia, for this very, very nice talk, very nice math, really. And please don't worry. We understand you were very sick and we are very grateful you still made the effort to do this. So, you don't have to apologize by any means. So, that's first of all. And then, second, I mean, this, I don't know how much sense my question makes. So, when you So when you when you consider the solutions on the expansion so so there are the previous one actually I know yesterday so we have the modified Bessel functions of first kind are of second kind and as you pointed out the when we have cast we just take off the modified Bessel function of first kind because it's at infinity but when you assume the general But when you assume the general form of the solution, when you have the products of the modified Bessel functions, I mean the series or the sum with the modified Bessel functions k alpha or I don't remember the next slide maybe I don't know you only consider the Bessel functions of second kind and then yes exactly that is there a reason why you just left out the modified Bessel functions The modified vessel functions of first kinder, yeah, like yes, yes, yes, sure. Assuming the general form of the um um these, yes, yes, yes, these are precisely these this on the right-hand side, we are having this modified Bessel function of the second type appearing, because these are exactly the modified Bessel functions appearing in the Eisenstrand series. So, we are doing like when we are trying to write down this thing. Down this thing, we just blatantly multiply the one four-year expansion for the Eisenstein series times another four-year expansion for the Eisenstein series. And then the Eisenstein or the Eisenstein series, they are known that they only have modified Bessel functions of the second type. The full four-year expansion is known. And it is known that. It is known that the growth of the Eisenstein series inside a cask is at most polynomial. And the bad behavior of the Eisenstein series is only happening in the zero term. Everything else is just exponentially dampened as we are going inside the custom. So that is the reason why this modified vessel function on the right-hand side were being taken because they're exactly the same. Being taken because they're exactly the ones that are appearing in the right-hand side of the ones that are appearing in the right-hand side of the Fourier expansion of the Eisenstein series. That's yeah. Thank you very much. Are there any further questions in Oaxaca or in Zoom? Or in Zoom? So, yes, for the modular group, this Eisenstein series describes the continuous part of the spectrum of the Laplacians. So, I was wondering if the discrete part, the mass forms, are they completely relevant to your problem in string theory, to your equations? equations or do they have some oh i have no idea so uh people people have people have studied in in in particular kim has studied this solution with uh the help of the with the help of the mask cusp ones as well and i truth be told i i have no idea why I have no idea why we are having Eisenstein series appearing on the right-hand side over here. People are saying some clever and not understandable terms, at least for me. And it's actually, interestingly enough, it is kind of still a conjecture in a way that these things appear in the scattering of gravitons. People do not have their exact proof that this is what is happening. To prove that this is what is happening, and they kind of need the full-year expansion to compare the scattering of the gravitons that they're obtaining with the help of some other methods that they're using to compare it. So they actually need that these generalized Eisenstein series. They need to know more about this generalized Eisenstein series. But this is like, this is known that the generalized Eisenstein series with alpha equals beta equals three half is appearing. three half is appearing in the scattering in the low expansion of the energy for the scattering amplitudes for gravitons. But for higher generalized Eisenstein series appear that people as far as I know there's they're claiming that they're either claiming that they appear because of some physical reasons that I sometimes do not trust that blindfoldedly because sometimes they're just saying we are sometimes they were just saying we are we are applying resolvent we're applying some operators to we're applying operators to the functions which do not belong to their domain and sometimes sometimes they say that some oh yes sometimes they say we are using the the we are using the summation for the for the we are using the Ramanujan summation outside the domain of its Outside the domain of its convergence. Or we are summing up infinitely many Meromorphic functions and not even care if they are convergent or whatever. So, okay, sorry, I should stop rambling about that. And I'd rather say that from the perspective of the physicist, they have generalized Eisenstein's theories and scattering of the gravitons. From the perspective of mathematician, I will be more careful about gravitons. Be more careful about claiming that this is exactly what is like happening for any R, alpha, beta. And as for the as for whether the real eigenvalues are appearing, I don't know. But I don't know. Thank you. Thank you. Do we have any last? Do we have any last questions? No, if not, then let us thank Senia again. Thank you for having me there. Oh, there might be something in chat. Oh, I'm sorry. No, sorry. I don't think so. I don't see anything in the chat. Yeah, no, it's good. That, yeah, no, it's good. So, thank you so much for powering through this, Kessenia, and wishing you get fully recovered very soon. Thank you so much, and thank you for you. Thank you for your attention once again, and thank you for the invitation. Oh, and now we're going to have a coffee break. So, we welcome everyone to join. We welcome everyone to join Gather Town. I believe Clara has sent an email with instructions for how to do that. I've used this before. It's pretty cute. So especially for the Zoomers, you might enjoy giving it a try. You get a little avatar and you walk around and it's almost like having a real physical coffee break. So check it out. And see everyone for the next talk in the afternoon. And before that, people will be meeting in your working groups. So I hope that goes well for everyone. Should I go down the Clara? Should I should I stop? Hi, Julie. Hi. Are you here? Yeah, I'm going to start if I can.
