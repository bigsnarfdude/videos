Great, thank you. Let me just move my Zoom windows. Can you all hear me okay? Yes, we hear you very. Great. I just want to say thank you to Anya for organizing yet another great meeting. My first foray into biomechanics was the meeting that you organized in 2018, I guess, in Montreal. And so it's nice to see some of you again and have the chance to talk to you. I'm sort of one of the biologists on this group. It's a very interdependent. Biologists on this group, it's a very interdisciplinary group. And I'm the lead author on this paper that I'm presenting: Jack Tridu, who's now a postdoc in Dresden. And this is in collaboration with Corey O'Hearn and Mark Shattuck, who are physicists at Yale and CCNY, and then some biologists who've contributed data as well. So I first started thinking about the spongy mesophyll in particular about six years ago when I started using micro-computed tomography, micro-C. Computed tomography, micro CT, to start to take images of flower petals for a different, wholly other project. And when I started looking at the diversity that I was seeing in these 2D slices, I was sort of shocked by one, how much diversity there was. And two, that in these sort of early divergent lineages that you see up at the top, in two dimensions, these structures look relatively mechanically stable. But once you get to, say, the eudicots down here at the bottom, when there's much higher porosity, in two dimensions, they're no longer mechanically. In two dimensions, they're no longer mechanically stable. They would be no longer mechanically stable, suggesting that there's a 3D effect to them that's inducing stability. And so, sort of around the same time, we started surveying a bunch of leaves as well to try to understand mesophil structural diversity. And we finally sort of came out with this paper that was led by another graduate student, Aleka Borsik, that came out earlier this year, looking at the spongy mesophyll in leaves. And what this was sort of showing was that there's a Was sort of showing was that there's essentially at a very coarse scale what looks to be two basic topologies in spongy mesophil architecture and leaves. One in which you have on the left side where it's sort of that what looks to be unstable in two dimensions, a very porous structure. And then what you see in the right, which is what seems to be two-dimensional lattices in the paradermal plane that are then stacked vertically through the depth of the mesophyll. Through the depth of the mesophyll, and that these roughly conform at the tissue level to a honeycomb structure. So, we've done the calculations on them and showed that across a wide diversity of species, those topologies that we see on the right have on average six-sided poly, or the air spaces have six sides, six-sided polygons. And on average, you have about three lobes per cell, though there's certainly some variation in that. One of the main take-homes from this message, from this Homes from this message, from this study, though, was that the major driver of this seems to be cell size. And so, as you get towards smaller cells, species with smaller cells and smaller genomes, you switch from the honeycomb topology into this more porous three-dimensional structure like you see on the left. So when I started trying to understand the mesophyll diversity, I went to some soft matter physicists because I really wanted to understand how you get this type of development. And the mesophyll is particularly And the mesophyll is particularly special because they start off development highly packed, and the cells are in near confluence. This is the paradermal slice of the mesophyll. It's a bit old, but you can see that these cells are highly packed. They essentially are polygons in two dimensions. And then at some point, they start to round up and form airspace. And so it's a pretty special tissue in that it starts off as near confluence, but then the cells have to, as they grow and expand, they have to. Have to, as they grow and expand, they have to at least partially separate to allow airspace formation, but still maintain connections to form a network of cells. So we were working on this model, which I'll talk about in a moment. And sort of as we were sort of developing it, this paper out of Chris Ambrose's lab at the University of Saskatchewan came out, in which they were tracking mesophil development in Arabidopsis through time. Rabidopsis through time. And so it provided this great opportunity to start to compare our model results, what we're predicting with our model, to their experimental data. And what they show is very similar things that if you see up here on the top left, the cells are highly confluent, and they're showing the patterning of this airspace formation as the cells actually separate, as they expand. One of the things that they point out, right, is that the cells must be sticky, right? So the cells have to remain, they have to be adhesive to each other. Remain, they have to be adhesive to each other, but at the same time, they also have to separate. So, there has to be some breaking point at which they overcome this adhesion and they separate. One of the things that they that in their paper they showed was that cell wall growth seems to be localized to the void-facing regions of the cell wall. So you don't necessarily see cell wall being grown where it's in where cells are in contact with other cells, but it's once you get a breakpoint and then you see the expansion of the cell wall only at these void-facing interfaces. These void-facing interfaces. And so, this actually ends up being a sort of important point in our modeling. So, my physics collaborators have this deformable particle model, which they've been developing over the last few years. What I'm showing up here in the upper left is the junction of three cells. So, the cells are formed by these blue disks, which are vertices, and the vertices are connected by springs. So, because they're springs, that means they can be stretched, but there's a point at which they actually break. They're not allowed to reform. So, if a cell gets They're not allowed to reform. So, if a cell gets close to another cell, it doesn't get sticky again. It's actually broken permanently. At each time step, all of the cells grow by a certain preferred area. In the model, this is delta alpha. And then only at the void-facing perimeter is cell wall added by a preferred length delta L. And at the same time, the preferred bending angle of that cell wall is driven to be negative by. Wall is driven to be negative by delta theta, which is the angle. And so I've shown the potential energy equation here for one cell, cell mu, and so does the shape potential energy. Now it's important to note that these parameters, delta alpha, delta L, and delta theta, they're not strange. They're actually, they're essentially stresses. And so preferred area in this case is qualitatively like increasing trigger pressure. And preferred length is localizing that growth to be on the cell walls. And the preferred bending angle. And the preferred bending angle, the change of theta to increasing by delta theta, is essentially based on microtubules being binding at the void spaces, so at the necks of the lobes that you see on mesophil cells, which has been shown experimentally. So effectively, what these changes, these delta alpha, delta L, and delta theta do is they increase the potential energy, which is then reduced by strain, by the expansion in volume of the cell. The expansion in volume of the cells at each time step. So I'm showing here a result of the model. So this is a simulation-based model. And the region on the left is sort of the actual tissue being grown from the same scale, the constant scale on the left. And so what you see, right, is that the cells start off as being confluent. And eventually, sort of initially, when it comes back here in a moment, you'll see the cells start to become. Start to become rounder and that forms airspace. And then the cells actually start to separate as it continues to grow. And the cells are being colored right now by essentially acircularity or asphericity. So perimeter to area ratios or volume to surface area ratios. And so they become more and more less circular, essentially. So we have a model that seems to work pretty well in being able to create these porous structures and yet having the cells still remain in a network. In a network, like we would predict. So, the question is: does this actually predict or fit? Can we get it to fit the empirical results that we see in a rabidopsis? I'm showing here on the right side in the panel B, and the colorful figures are the model results. And in the grayscale are micro-CT scans of the paradermal slices of a rabidopsis through development. And then in the bottom panels, again, sort of snapshots of early development. Again, sort of snapshots of early development of the model. And the plot is showing on the vertical axis, on the y-axis, is Calais, so the acircularity, so cell shape, the shell shape parameter. And on the x-axis on the bottom is the packing fraction phi, so essentially the opposite of the porosity. So it starts off at the left where the packing fraction is very high and the porosity is very low. And through development, as the tissue grows and you get airspace formation, the cells move to the right. So they decrease in. So, they decrease in packing fraction, they increase in porosity, and you get this in general increase in cell acircularity. So, the cell shape parameter changes. Now, one of the interesting things about the model is it actually captures some non-monotonic behavior that we see in the experimental results. So that's the box that you see in the bottom left of the plot. So, what happens initially, and that's also what's being shown on the snapshots on the bottom, initially you have, you know, the cells start as completely packed polygons in which there's almost Completely packed polygons in which there's almost no airspace. Initially, you get Cal A, the shape parameter, actually declining. So the cells become more circular, they become rounder because area grows, but perimeter does not grow because perimeter is localized to the void spaces, but there are no void spaces. So when you get that, right, that actually causes the cells to round, and then that actually causes separation, so allows void space to be formed, or airspace to be formed, which is what you see in the second frame at the bottom. In the second frame at the bottom. Then, once you have that void space around the cells, then you can actually increase perimeter at those cell wall air interfaces. And so then you can get the continuing expansion and the increase in the shape parameter that you see in the top plot. We've done quite a lot of, so I'm just showing sort of this main result here, but we've done a lot of parameter exploration. Okay. So one of the strange, one of, not strange, but one of the surprising results. Of not strange, but one of the surprising results that came out of this is that you need to have a positive tissue pressure on the entire system, which wasn't immediately intuitive to me. And so essentially what that says is that there needs to be some confining force, some confining pressure that's influencing the system. If it's too high, if that pressure is too high, you actually cause collapse, which is what you're seeing on the far right. The trajectories are going from the top to the bottom. Under really high pressure, you get... Bottom, under really high pressure, you get tissue collapse. So the whole tissue doesn't actually expand, and you actually get it to collapsing, and you get these really weird cell shapes that don't really form networks or realistic structures. But surprisingly, if the pressure is too low, so even if there's negative pressure, as in the tissue would be pulled, which you could imagine, right? So the epidermis expanding faster than the mesophyll, then the tissue could be pulled. And that would definitely cause airspace. But what we see is that when that happens, it actually causes rips. That when that happens, it actually causes rips. So you get airspace formation, but it's large rips in the mesophyll tissue. Unfortunately, I don't have any snapshots of that. And you don't get this sort of homogeneously distributed airspace around all of the cells, which is what you see in real tissues. We can start to play with other parameters too. So we can start to vary how much the sensitivity or sort of how much cell wall material is being added or how big the preferred area. Much how big the preferred areas change at each time step, which is sort of showing here on the left. And then look at the diversity of structures that get developed and the change in the shape parameter, cal A, that are the vertical axes in the plots. And again, in some cases, you get tissue collapse, even under not, even if the pressure is not too high, you still get certain, you get tissue collapse, which are in the bottom right figure, that was when the gray lines start to deviate back to the left. So they actually increase in power. Left, so they actually increase in packing fraction again. So, one of the things we're trying to do, we have this model now that works on, that seems to be working on two-dimensional mesophyll development in a rabidopsis, but we have a lot of data for other structures, for a bunch of other mesophils. And we know that this is a 3D process. So, this is on the left, I'm showing you a volume chunk of the mesophil of a Philadelphus Lewisii petal, if I remember correctly. And so, on the top page, And so on the top row of panels are just different slices in the different planes, essentially averaging across there, looking at sort of structure. And we've done the Fourier transform on those structures so we can, on the bottom row of figures there, so we can actually start to characterize, we're trying to characterize structure in three dimensions, so that then we can actually compare the empirical data that we find in the diversity of mesophil structures with the model results. And that's sort of what we're moving towards. And we can also start to compare it to known structures. To compare it to known structures, say random spheres, right, which have these known structural features. So, what we're moving to is something like this: right, this is an actual mesophyll from a dogwood, a cornice Florida bract, and the blue are the veins, and the mesophyll tissue, the volume is there in the, what I fall, it's colored in green. And so it's this pretty, it's this crazy mess, right? And so when I look at this, it's like, it's, it's, I have, I really want to know like how this develops. I really want to know how this develops given that there's so much porosity, and yet these structures are also very cheap to build, I think. So I'm going to end on just a few questions. One is how do we start to extend this model into 3D? We are starting to work with deformable polygons, but that work is very early. It's very computationally intensive to do these simulations. One question for you in terms of like potential reviewers, right, is how well do we need to match the individual cell shapes if the tissue level structural Cell shapes if the tissue level structural features that we can capture with the model match the empirically observed tissue level features that we see with the data. One of the problems that we have, and this came up earlier, is that for the most part, because we're working in the mesophyll, it's very hard to visualize with, say, confocal microscopy, but we can visualize it very easy with micro CT imaging. The downfall is that with micro CT, we don't necessarily see individual cell boundaries. So we can't, it's difficult. So, we can't, it's difficult, though not impossible, to do individual cell segmentation. And actually, we have been doing this by hand manually, which is, I will agree with Charles, it does take a lot of time. And then this other question that I have, which is, you know, I appreciate the showing of the Sapola model of epidermal cell growth and expansion earlier, because I sort of keep going back to that paper when I think about our model, right? And so I do wonder if the deformable particle model that we have could be used. Particle model that we have could be used as a general model for other tissues, right? So, epidermal pavement cells. In that case, the cells never separate, they remain fully confluent. And so, we can just tune up our adhesion in our model. So, I will stop there and take questions. So what challenges do you anticipate in the 3D modeling approach? The 2D is very, very compelling, right? But the 3D might deliver surprises, I suspect. Sounds like you have surprises in mind. I don't. Yeah, so I think it's a little early to say since we haven't fully gotten it working. I think that it's going to be, I mean, one obvious challenge is it's. One obvious challenge is it's incredibly computationally intensive. And so, getting the 2D model to work took a long time because we were having to do a whole wide range of parameter sweeps to try to get sort of figure out where in parameter space we were starting to get actual networks forming. So I think in 3D, you know, to some extent, some of these parameters may be the same or similar in 3D. So that helps. I think the other problem is that once you, you know, in 2D, so we can get what we So, we can get what we would say in 2D structures that don't look realistic or that seem to fail, but in 3D, they might actually work, right? Because you're stabilized by out-of-plane cells. And so, the 3D sort of solves some of the problems that in 2D, we might just discard those tissues or those results as being realistic. You know, I think in 3, we've been talking about how to move forward in 3D. One way is to start with the structures that are essentially honeycombs and stacked, but then Combs and stacked, but then it's like you essentially you just have the replicated structure vertically, and so you just have you know, is it off differences in adhesion vertically versus horizontally? Or do you start with the ones that are just seem to be porous in all direction, equally porous in all directions, and they're just growing in volume? That may be easier to start with than trying to get sort of differences in adhesion in different axes and incorporating cell polarity. So I'm not totally sure that was not a great answer, but it's definitely one that I think. It's definitely one that I think we're going to hit up against. Okay, thank you. Shals. So, thanks, Adam, for a really nice talk. And I'm curious about your discussion on the cell boundaries being difficult to resolve with micro CT. Is that the boundaries between cells that are still touching or the boundaries between the cells and the air spaces? Because one possibility if the former is true is that the cell boundaries that are touching don't matter so much, right? You could almost treat them as. You could almost read them as a continuum. And it's more the boundaries between the cells and the airspaces that are important and changing over time in the tissue. Yeah, so the boundaries between cells and airspace are extremely easy to resolve because micro CT is essentially measuring differences in absorption. So air and water sometimes have very different absorption. So those are easy. It's the cell boundaries when they're touching each other. And so those are the really hard ones. If it's a really thick cell wall, we can see them. They actually can be quite bright. And in some cases, we can even see chlorine. Right. And in some cases, we can even see chloroplasts inside the cells as well. It's the ones, but so it's those that are hard. At the tissue level, I totally agree with you. We just treat it as a continuum. We would, you know, my physics, we had a meeting yesterday where we're, they would really like to be able to get cell shapes and volumes to be at least statistically similar to what we see empirically. And so that's sort of, they're also theoretical physicists, and so they like to be perfect. So they first looked at the results that I, the plot that I showed you. Looked at the results that I, the plot that I showed you of the shape parameter with ferocity, and were disappointed that it wasn't matching perfectly. And I was like, no, this is really good, in my opinion. I would also just like to be able to get those individual cell shapes sort of from the experimental data for a variety of other reasons related to this model. But part of it is just to try to understand how much shape parameter variation is there. One of the things we're dealing with right now is that we can use some relatively straightforward three-dimensional. We can use some relatively straightforward three-dimensional watershedding algorithms to do the three-dimensional cell shape segmentation from the micro CT data. When we compare that to manually segmented cells of the same cells, there can be actually a pretty big variation, like 50% variation in the shape parameter or in the surface area. But that's because the water shedding algorithm can get a lot of very small changes, which influence surface area, but not necessarily volume so much. And so those are sort of the issues we're dealing with right now. Issues we're dealing with right now. I'd very much like to be dealing with some other imaging techniques, but I'm not fully set up to do that myself. And we're also interested in diversity, so species diversity, and that can be really hard to deal with that with, say, confocal. And I've tried to do some confocal imaging of the mesophil, and I wasn't really able to get it to work. But, you know, Chris Ambrose's lab has been able to do it. But they were doing that by actually peeling away the epidermis. There is yet one minute left for your Let for your presentation. Sorry. Oh, okay. I have a quick question. In your simulations, there's some periodicity that's impulsed, right? You're talking about sort of periodicity in terms of like how big the simulation is? Yes. Yeah, so that is one thing in there. So there's sort of the boundary conditions are that it's periodic. And so they're at each time step, they're sort of checking to see whether they're in contact with other cells. Whether they're in contact with other cells on the other side. Yeah, so it is periodic. So, looking at it, it looked as though it might be shearing. Is it possible that some loads are generated by imposing that periodicity? Like overall, if you compute the overall loading of the thing expanding, would you have shearing in terms of the entire tissue shearing, you mean? Yes, that entire tissue, if you impose periodicity, gene. If you're in post-periodicity, do you need to apply a load to keep it periodic? I see what you mean. I don't think so. I mean, the pressure is constant in all directions and growth is isotropic. And so I would need to talk to the physicists about that one. Can I get back to you, Anna? Okay, thank you again. Thanks. I would like that to be thanked to all the... I would like that to be thanked to all the speakers.
