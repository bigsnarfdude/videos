Then we can have dinner. Okay, um it's still night outside, so it's not like nighttime yet. But um yes, uh hopefully I have my voice. So I'm going to talk to you today about something pretty different from what we've talked about. I'm going to talk to you about SARS-CoV-2 in animals. It's going to be a little bit of transmission, a little bit of adaptation, and a little bit of within host diversity. So three pretty quick parts. I'm Evan Gill. I'm in the Department of Microbiology. I'm Emma Gill. I'm in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology. I sit at the Genome Center. I claim not to be a microbiologist. I guess I'm more of a genome person. I'm not a modeler. So, wherever I go, I claim not to be an expert in what the other people are. So, with that, yeah, I like genomes. I'm going to start with some acknowledgements. So, first, this is mainly the work of a PhD student who's in the back. Of a PhD student who's in the back, Sana Naderi, who has another talk later in the week. Another, she's here in this picture. Does that work? There she is, yeah. And Peter, PhD student, turned postdoc, who did the, helped with the genome-wide association studies I'm going to talk about, and Carmen Leah Morrell, who was a postdoc in the group, who's now at FAC. Some of you might recognize work that was supported by Cobarnet as well as. Coburnet as well as actually, this work was not really Kanbod. No, okay, we'll call it Kanbod. Sama's work later, 100% Kanbot. Okay, so anyway. Okay. So I like genomes. This was published in January 2020. The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually shared online on the website biological.org before the publication of this paper. So an underlying data. So, an underlying data sharing, right? It's really crucial. It's pretty amazing to have this genome sequenced and shared within a month, pretty much of its being sampled. Nature paper came later. So, this first genome was shotgun metagenomics, meaning they didn't know what this patient, not patient zero, but this early case of Wuhan had. So, they just took a lung gavage, sequenced everything, tons and tons of reads, managed to assemble this genome that turned out to be SARS-CoV-2. Assembled this genome that turned out to be SARS-CoV-2 that had similarity to SARS-1. And with this first genome, this enabled designing PCR primers to go and amplify up copies of genomes in a much more efficient way without sequencing a bunch of other crap you don't want. And now we have millions, I think we're in over 15 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences shared online on websites like GISAID and the Canadian Birosseek Data Portal, which Environcy data portal, which Canada we're pretty proud of to have our own resource that doesn't have all of the particularities that some of you may be familiar with with GISA. So all these genomes are mostly, mostly from human nasal swabs that people go and get out of PCR test and get a sequence. A much smaller number are from non-human animal species. That's going to be the subject of this talk. And there's also a fair amount of wastewater. We had a great talk from David earlier. Had a great talk from David earlier, and that's going to be the topic of Sima's talk later in the week. Now, this is a little bit of the data. So, for those of you who are not used to thinking about this data, right, so within an individual, we'll have viruses in the millions or trillions, right? And these will generate mutations that happen within patients. So, that's kind of what's illustrated here. You know, an orange population gives rise to a blue point mutation. Point mutation, and there's pretty deep sequencing of many, many short sequencing reads from that sample. So that will include some of this within host diversity shown in these C's, these minor variants, these mutations that show up that aren't in the consensus sequence, which is a T, right? So most of the viral population is a T, but there's these minor variants. So most, so the first part of the talk is going to be just. So, the first part of the talk is going to be just looking at those consensus sequence. And that's what most people think about when they build phylogenetic trees, that these are the major sequences that get transmitted. And the minor stuff is just little TP sequencing error. We don't really care about that. The last little part of the talk is going to sort of consider that within host variation, going down basically to the raw data to these two things. Okay, so animals, SARS-CoV-2. Animals, SARS-CoV-2. I'm not going to talk about origins. This is, okay. This is what I would call probably our best understanding of origins, right? Where we had SARS-CoV-2 in some bat reservoir at some location unknown that we will probably never know and never sample that came through some intermediate hosts in the In the seafood market in Wuhan, that was probably actually transmitted twice independently to humans. You have cases that are clustered around the market in Wuhan, start spreading in Wuhan, and then global international spread. We all know what happens next. I'm not going into this details. I'm going to be sort of thinking about: okay, once it got into humans, what animals did it subsequently get into? Did those animals then subsequently read? Did those animals then subsequently re-infect humans? So I'm talking about much more recent human-animal transmission. Okay, so zoonosis, animals to humans, and then zoanthroponosis, which is a word I think I learned from Angie Rasmison, this fun conversation she got to have as part of this covernet. That's animals back into, sorry, humans back into animals, right? So we have these cycles. So SARS-CoV-2 with different variants of concern, alpha, delta. Variants of concern, alpha, delta, Omicron is increasingly adapted to humans. It was probably pretty well adapted from the beginning. And what about adaptation to other animal species? So first of all, why do we care about this? The more animals, the more reservoirs the virus can infect, makes it hard or impossible to eradicate, right? Even in the impossible scenario where we did eradicate COVID for humans, it's in deer, right? So then you have to eradicate from deer. And you have to eradicate from deer, and it's a whack-a-mole, and we'll never do it. More interesting for evolutionary biologists as well is once a virus starts replicating and mutating in a different animal, this can open up new and unexpected evolutionary trajectories that might not really have any idea what the implications would be for humans. So, one paper here suggested that the Omicron variant, which kind of came out of nowhere. Variant, which kind of came out of nowhere, this really divergent lineage that we hadn't sampled before, could have evolved in a rodent host. That's probably not the most likely explanation, but it was put out there and it's plausible that the next variant of concern could be evolving right now somewhere in an animal that we're not aware of. So there have been some previous studies looking at adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to different animals. SARS-CoV-2 to different animals. And I'm going to highlight the idea of evolutionary trade-offs. Basically, the idea that there's mutations that help the virus adapt to one host animal but have the expense of infecting another. And so this is a cartoon from a paper that actually did experimental infections of ferrets and mink. So they put wild-type SARS-Booby-2 into a mink, let it evolve in there, and out came this mutant in the spike. In the spike, the spread virus, that is really good at infecting ferritin mink. But when it's challenged with human airway cells, it gets out-competed by the wild type. So this is a trade-off that gets good at mink, gets bad at human. So there have been a few studies like this, either experimental or sort of anecdotal, like how we sampled a bear and we sequence something, and oh, here's a mutation, right? So there's these kind of n equals one or a lion. kind of n equals one or a lion in a zoo, lots of things. So these are interesting, find these mutations. Some are the experimental ones are kind of plausible because you kind of have a phenotype, but these are largely anecdotal and kind of lacking any kind of generalizability. So what we set out to do with Sana when she started her master's before transferring into her PhD was to really kind of bring together what data is publicly available and see what we can generalize. Can generalize. So, the first part we asked: how many transmission events have there been from humans to animals and then from animals to humans? And again, this is post-Wuhan, okay, so this is not looking at deep origins. And she did this using ancestral state reconstruction on phylogenetic trees. The second part is a genome-wide association study where we're looking: are there individual mutations that tend to be seen in one animal compared to One animal compared to humans. So, this is a statistical framework that kind of takes the trade-off idea into practice, the idea that there's one mutation that you see more in one animal because it provides adaptation to that animal at the expense of human. And so, this work is published, so I'll go through it pretty quickly, low on details, but you can talk to me in the summer afterwards. And then the last little part that will be pretty quick. The last little part that will be pretty quick is this within host diversity part. So, actually, can you dig into the genetic diversity of the virus within each of those animals, see how that differs, and see if that can tell us anything? That's great. Okay, so we got as much data as we could. This dates back from about a year, maybe a bit over a year, so this could be updated for anything. I'm excited to do that. I don't think Santa wants to do it, but maybe someone will. And her coding workflows are pretty. Her code and workflows are pretty reproducible, so someone could probably go do this. So at the time, there were over a thousand mink, a hundred and some deer, 50, 60, so cats and dogs, and we drew a cut off there. So there's a very fun long tale of snow leopards and otters and coaddies and hippos. But like, you know, it's really small sample sizes, so we didn't consider any of that. But maybe going back, thinking through this, we could find something interesting, but we We could find something interesting, but we stuck with these four more sampled animals. So, for each of these, Sana went and found their most closely related genome sequence from a human that was in the database. And then she populated the data set with a random sample of genomes from humans, sampled over time during the pandemic, 50 sequences a month, and did 10 random resamplings of apples. Did 10 random resamplings of that to build up a tree and to take into account some of the phylogenetic uncertainty by doing that multiple times. And so she built these trees that look something like this. So this is a toy tree. So we have a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. So its branch lengths are proportional to genetic distance. And they're labeled in orange, let's say for a deer, and then in blue for humans. Okay, so those are the states. Humans. Okay, so those are the states on the tree. And so she does a discrete ancestral state reconstruction. This is in the 8 package in R, but Sana, with Carmen Leah's help, put this into a nice wrapper, which is called Kitty Fitty. You can talk to her about why that name was chosen over drinks or a meal. But the idea, and this is soon to be in our package as well. Package as well. So I think this should be nicely reproducible with whatever discrete states on the tree that you're interested in. And so, in short, what this does is identifies likely state transitions that are likely transmissions from animal to human or vice versa. So in this toy example, we'd see the root would be an animal, would be orange, most likely, and then you have a transition to human, supposed to be a transition to human happening here. Transmission to human happening here, here, and here on the tree. Okay, so this is quite simple. There's more, there's Bayesian ways of doing this that take into account sample. So this can be quite sensitive to the sampling of the different animals. So there's some caveats here, but it's a simple and kind of relatively quick approach to do this. This is what some trees look like. These aren't the ones that were in the final paper, but I still like them anyway. Or they are the trees. Or they are the trees, but they're just in a different way. So, colors are a bit funny, but it's okay. So, the human sequences are in gray, so it's mostly human. And then the different animals are in orange, and we've broken it down. We have separate trees for cat, dog, mink, and deer. And then in red are the possible transmission events. So you can see for mink, there's quite a lot of them, these red triangles. And then the blue squares. And then the blue squares are sort of a subset of those where we bootstrapped filtered. So basically, just some just trying to account for some phylogenetic uncertainty and look for the ones that we're more confident in. And this is showing transmission events from each of those animals back into here. So it's kind of just what it looks like. And just a little side note here: in deer, you can see, you can kind of see this, and this is why I like these trees. Kind of see this, and this is why I like these trees. There's some long branches that end in an orange tip, so that's a deer, right? So, quite a lot of long branches, and this suggests unsampled deer-to-deer transmission, where that long branch mutation is building up. We haven't sampled the intermediate, so some of these deers are accumulating these long branches. There's other studies that have found similar results, but I wanted to just highlight that because it will be relevant later. Later. So, summarizing the ancestral state reconstruction in those trees. So, for each animal species, considering transmission from humans to those animals, and again, this is, so we have the counts of those transmissions, either the unfiltered, which are the darker dots, or the bootstrap filters, which are sort of a little bit more conservative estimates. But we see all of these being not too variable from animal to animal, kind of. From animal to animal, kind of centered around 50 events, right? So 50 human-to-animal transmissions for each of those animals. Pretty uniform across different animal species with some variation. Again, there's some differences in sample size to take into account for here. And then in the other direction, there's some pretty dramatic differences. So, from animals back to humans, really, really rare. Okay, so really. So really like zero to just a couple events for cat, dog, and deer, but then quite a lot. So even with the bootstraps, more conservative estimates, in the order of 30 or so, independent mink to human transmissions. So mink really stands out, and these were often on farms where they were in close contact with people working on those farms. They were intensely studied as well, so there might have been some contact tracing that went into that, but these were sort of better identified. And for the other animals, you know, maybe one or two, but often not. And again, the replicates here are just phylogenetic resamplings. So just sensitivity to the phylogenies. Okay, so take home, not much transmission from Much transmission from most animals to human, except for MYC, where there's really quite a lot. So, the next part is this genome-wide association study. So, we're interested in identifying particular mutations that are associated with each animal. So, this is a method that I developed with a graduate student, Peter Chen, who's now a postdoc, using a method called Poutine, which he named Proutine for no real particular reason other than he likes protein. But I have an explanation that I'll flow. I have an explanation that I'll float, which is that the French fries are the phylogenetic tree. So we really like phylology because that's really the foundation of everything. But then sprinkled on that tree that make it really interesting are these homoplasic mutations, which are the gravy and the cheese curds. Okay, or maybe okay, maybe the um yeah, okay, I'll I'll work on that, but it's uh it's it's it's it's something like that, all right? Are humans gravy or cheese curds? Yeah, so actually, maybe, yeah, so maybe actually the homoplasic mutations can be the gravy and then the humans versus minks, so the different what we're going to sort of code as phenotypes, right, in the sort of language of genome-wide association studies, those can be the cheese curds, the distinct our red and blue points here. I'll work on that. So, right, so basically, we're using the phylogenetic tree to really control for population structures. We have the strong phylogenetic signal, where we can have lots of mutations that are happening on a branch that are statistically indistinguishable in terms of trying to associate them with a phenotype. In this case, the phenotype is really just the animal that it was sampled from. So, we're going to focus on these homoplasic mutations, which are X's here, which are mutations. Here, which are mutations that happen independently in the tree, so these are statistically distinguishable. So, and these homoplasies, in addition, also talk about convergent evolution, right, happening multiple times. This is also a hallmark of positive selection. So, if a mutation is adaptive, you might expect it to happen or be observed multiple times, depending on. But it will happen at random with some baseline mutation rate. So, we do a genotypic ancestral reconstruction. So, we do a genotypic ancestral state reconstruction down the whole tree to get the ancestral genotypes. We're just going to use the phenotypes, so the deer versus human labels at the tips. We're not going to reconstruct that. We're just looking at the tips in this case. And we just do a simple binomial test here, where x is the number of homoplacies in our cases, which would be the deer or the animal interest. Deer or the make the animal interest that's not human. N is the total number of homoplases at this particular nucleotide site. So we're doing the test for every nucleotide, every polymorphic nucleotide in the genome. And the expected proportion is just the proportion of cases, so the percent of MINC or whatever in the data set. So that's our simple test statistic, but all it implicitly controls for all this population structure. Controls for all this population structure. And then we have these Manhattan plots. So, this is a typical way of showing a genome-wide association study. So, the x-axis is just the position in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. It's hard to read, but the different sort of alternating colored paths are the different genes in the genome. So, the spike is here, reference. And the y-axis is the negative log p-value. So, basically, how excited we are. How excited we are about that association. Okay, so for dog and cats, there's nothing. Okay, so it's a really flat, there's no good associations, and these are our smallest sample size. So it doesn't mean that there aren't mutations that could be associated or could adapt the virus to these animals, but we haven't found them. Yet some more interesting for Mink, where we get three really nice GWAS hits, so these three red points. They're red because They're red because they're non-synonymous mutations. So that means they change the amino acid sequence, which also biologists tend to like in terms of DWAS fits like it plausibly does something. And I should say these are corrected for multiple hypothesis testing as well. So these seem to be good hits. These are three that have been previously reported in the literature too. So it's nice that we recover them in what we think is a statistically robust way, but they're things that other people. Way, but there are things that other people have seen. One is in the spike, so it's in 501. This is one of the distinguishing mutations of the alpha variant as well, and then a couple of other mutations in different genes that could be of interest. Deer are, we were really surprised by this, and you know, did this in lots of different ways, but this seems to be, we're convinced, we actually see 26. We actually see 26 GWAS, so 26 different point mutations that are statistically associated with deer. They're all across the genome. They're not in spike. None are in spike. And you see a mix of blue and red, so some of them are actually synonymous, meaning they change the nucleotide, but they don't change the protein. So this is more mysterious because they could be doing something for RNA stability or translational efficiency or all kinds of different things, but these provide some interesting hypotheses for people to look at. I think the For people to look at in the wet lab. So, last part: looking at the within-host diversity. Okay, so we've been thinking about consensus sequences so far, and now we're going to look deep into the reads. This is an even smaller data set because not as many people share their raw data, so we have to go to a different database to get this data. But we need it. So, what's the logic here? So, in like one bullet point, okay. One bullet point, okay? This is hand-wavy coalescent theory, essentially, which is that the within-host diversity will scale as a function of the viral population size in that person. So in a larger population, you have more mutation, more individuals that are able to mutate, so you will see more mutation. This could also scale with the length of infection, so more time for mutation could give you more time for mutation. Could give you more time for mutations to accumulate. Okay, so there's lots of other things, demographics and selection that go into this, but in a nutshell, that's kind of like what we're looking at here. So we ask how this varies across animal species. So Sana went and got the raw sequence data from NCBI, mapped them to the reference genome, did some quality filtering so we need enough depth of coverage. We're only interested in minor variants of 5% frequency or higher. Below that, we're worried it's going to be sequence. Below that, we're worried it's going to be sequence error or something like that. And so we call these intra-host single nucleotide variants or I-SNIVs that are within hosts. And then separately, using a method called Freya, which is actually developed for wastewater, we infer the number of likely distinct lineages. So it could be POCs, but they could be any sort of distinct Pango-defined lineage of SARS-CoV-2. Of RSAR scope. So here's what it looks like in terms of the number of isonics. So just the raw number of mutations. And so human is here. I think the median is around 2 or 3. That goes well with earlier literature on this subject. And what should stand out to you is deer really stands out. That is borne out in a simple Wilcoxon test. It's also borne out in a linear mixed model that includes. Model that includes the random effects of sequence coverage that includes tissue being sampled because these were mostly nasal swaths, but there are some other tissues that were sampled, which is kind of interesting. And lab versus natural infection. So that's what the red points are here. So a lot of the cats, some of the dogs, those red points are experimental animals. Okay, so we included them. And they tend to be a little bit on the low diversity side because they're pretty recent infection. Because they're pretty recent infections that we control for this as a fixed effect model. Not going to get into any more detail than that, other than to say that, you know, the consistent effect is we have higher within host diversity in deer, and this is broadly consistent with a longer, perhaps more asymptomatic infection of large population-sized deer. In terms of the number of lineages, right? Of the number of lineages, right? So, this could be like co-admixed infections, and people have suggested that deer get infected because they eat garbage or eat wastewater, right? So, they could potentially be getting multiply infected. You do see a little bit of this. So, deer have a bit more higher lineage diversity compared to humans, and that's significant in a Wilcoxon test, but it doesn't stand up in a model that controls for some of the other covariates, so we're not. Covariate, so we're not super confident in that. So we don't think that this higher diversity endears is easily explained by combination, can't fully exclude it. Okay, so to wrap up and just bring those three parts together. Okay, so for cats and dogs, small sample size, so we don't want to make large conclusions. The lack of transmission from cats or dogs back to humans. From cats or dogs back to humans, despite the small sample size, so there's caveats. But this is consistent with them being dead ends, so they're domestic animals. Someone will affect their cat, but that cat is not going to go out and infect more humans, more cats, so they're kind of dead ends. But small sample size, so it'd be great to have more data on this. For mink, okay, it's like almost 530. This is a raccoon, not a mink, so it's just okay, okay, good, right? So this is like a clip art. Okay, good, right? So this is like a clip art issue, but it's something that looks a little bit like a mink, okay, but it could be a recognition. Right, so in the transmission analysis, we see relatively shorter mink-to-mink transmission chains. We see a lot of make-to-human, human back-to-mink, and so on, right? So we don't see these uninterrupted mink-to-mink transmission chains. We see relatively low within-host diversity in mink, which means infections are caught pretty early. Infections are caught pretty early, the viral population size might be kind of low. All of this could add up to explain that there's less opportunity for the virus to adapt, to make, and we see fewer GWAS fits. So there's less opportunity to gain these adaptive mutations. Deer, in contrast, have these longer deer-to-deer transmission chains. So there's these long branches. We don't see evidence for a lot of deer-to-human transmission. It happens sometimes, but it seems to be a lot of deer-to-deer to deer. To be a lot of deer to deer to deer, uninterrupted cycles. Also, higher within host diversity, so these might just be longer, more chronic infections, larger population size. These factors combine perhaps for more opportunities for the virus to adapt, to deer, and this explains what we get more genocides, more detectable adaptive mutations. So, just to put that together, more sampling. So, animals are, there's more and more sequences that are being sampled. Sequences that are being sampled, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of human sampling that's happening. And I think that animals are valuable, and you might catch very rare and weird variants in them. And maybe you can learn more about transmission and adaptation. As I mentioned, the GWAS hits, these polymorphic nucleotides are candidates to really learn what they're doing for adapting to these different models. Is there a trade-off where they're infecting those animals and adapting? Infecting those animals and adapting at the expense of transmitting to humans. Or actually, the worst case scenario, right, is that there is no trade-off, where they're going off in some unexpected evolutionary direction that then makes them more virulent or more transmissible in humans, but we don't know. And then I'll leave you with this. Nice thought: is right, basically we need to sample more because perhaps the next variant of this one could come from. Could come from an animal. So, those bear signs on the door saying, Step one, don't get attacked by a bear if you do.
