Nice generating sets. So to get some notation straight, our convention, I probably want a larger pen. Our convention, or my convention, is when I say a toric stack, what I really mean is just a smooth toric Toric DM stack in the sense of Borisoff, Shannon Smith. So I'm not really going to use a lot of fancy stacky stuff. So if you just want to think about a smooth toric variety, you're fine. Really, the advantage of thinking about this is that we can think about the derived categories of simplicial stuff as opposed to just smooth stuff. So we're allowed some mild. Smooth stuff. So we're allowed some mild singularities in a certain sense. And to remind you, if or I'll tell you, how do you build these things? Well, you have an open set of affine space and it's G invariant for some G that maps to the diagonal torus that acts on it. And then you just make the stack. Just make the stack this quotient, the quotient stack associated to that. And so, what's nice about this is that it allows us to define the, well, you can think about the derived category in kind of a nice way. It is, when I say derived category, I mean really the derived category of coherent sheaves on this stack, or, and this is the way that I usually and this is the way that I usually think about these things. It's the ordinary category of sorry the derived bounded derived category of coherent sheaves that are equivariant, G-equivariant on U. Okay. All right, so that's kind of just some boilerplate to get started. Again, I'm not really going to get into the sacky stuff. I'm going to spend most of my time drawing pictures. So the question that I want to consider today So, the question that I want to consider today is: well, how do you describe this derived category? Which of course is a pretty broad question. And I'll point out that in a certain sense, we have a very good answer to this already, which Alicia mentioned, I think she might have mentioned in her talk. In any case, I'll remind you: there's this. In any case, I'll remind you: there's this theorem of Kawamata from 2006. And that basically says that if I guess there might be some technical conditions here, but if this comes from a projective simplicial Toric variety, I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of exactly how he, exactly, the special. He exactly the special case that he considers, but it's basically enough so that he can run the minimal model program and get all smooth projective toric varieties. In this setting, we know that this has a full exceptional collection, which I'm not going to describe because I'm not really going to talk about them much. And also, Alicia defined these in her talk. So, this is pretty much the best you can ask for for a The best you can ask for for a derived category basically says that we can describe this thing. Well, it's not necessarily strong, I suppose, but it's pretty close to just a module category. So this is a very strong result. And the proof is via the MMP. It's brilliant in my opinion, but it's highly dependent on a lot of arbitrary choices. So that's the one. So, that's the one thing that makes it hard to use if I want to use this in the arithmetic setting, which is where our sort of ongoing project comes from. So, this is poorly behaved in the sense of the arithmetic setting for a variety of reasons that I'm not going to get into, but mainly it's because it doesn't have, there's too many choices. I want something that's close to canonical, or I can construct it in a symmetric way. On the other side of the coin, On the other side of the coin, you might say, okay, well, how good can this exceptional collection be? And there were a lot of theorems, sorry, there were a lot of conjectures that kept getting broken, but I think that F.E.Mov's sort of denotes the state of the art, at least in showing that this is, you can't expect too much from these exceptional collections. There exist smooth, projective Tauric fauna varieties. Projective Tauric fauno varieties that do not have full exceptional collections of line bundles. So Kawamata just constructs some objects. He claims heaves, but I think that that's not entirely clear still. But if you demand something like line. Um, but if you demand something like line bundles, then uh, you uh, you can't, even for you know, toric smooth toric final varieties, no stacky stuff involved. Um, so what I'm going to talk about today is, well, let's try to find nice, a nice generating set. So it's much weaker than having an exceptional collection, but hopefully it'll be small. And what'll be nice is that it'll be canonical and easy to compute. And easy to compute in examples. So, this is the sort of the goal of today. Okay, so now some pictures. This is just to get my notation straight in a certain sense. So, when I talk about a toric variety, if you haven't seen them before, then I hope that you can still sort of follow the ideas, even if you haven't seen these before. But essentially, Tauric varieties, even or toric. Tauric varieties, even or Tauric stacks, at least in the setting that I'm considering them, you can basically consider them as fans that are in some real space. And there's a lattice, N, that the way that the lattice interacts with the fan has some strong geometrical meanings. It's going to turn out to be basically irrelevant for what I'm going to do. And then you also have the Picard group, the group of all invertible sheaves. Group, the group of all invertible sheaves on your stack. I'm going to just tensor everything with R. It turns out that this isn't going to affect basically any of my theorems. So the picture I have here, you have this Gale duality where these XIs, these represent the these Vi's represent orbits of codiment, or yeah, codimension one orbits of Codimension one orbits of the torus on the torque variety, and these are going to be your t-invariant divisors, their corresponding line bubbles. And I'll explain what these ZI's are in a minute. So I'm going to be really interested in this simplicial complex of the fan. So people usually consider this directly, but I'm going to consider it as just an abstract. Consider it as just an abstract simplicial complex. So, this is the if you have a fan, then you can consider it like a simplicial complex by just remembering which rays are in each cone, basically. And if you take what's called the Alexander dual, this is a complement in two different ways. So, you take the complements of the sets that are not Of the sets that are not in the original fan, and this also turns out to be a simplicial complex. And this is called the usually the combinatorial Alexander dual because of some theorems that I'm not going to talk about. Okay, so I'm going to refer to the Alexander dual a little bit later. It's maybe not entirely necessary. You can probably get away without it, but I find it clearer to follow what's going to. without it, but I find it clearer to follow what's going to go on if I do that. Okay. So our sort of main, or my main starting point for this is a description of the K-theory of these torics, of these toric stacks. So this goes back to there are other versions of this in the case of just toric varieties. And people have been thinking about the K-theory of these things. People have been thinking about the K-theory of these things for a long time, but to my knowledge, the sort of the most comprehensive statement about what this thing looks like is the following. The K-theory of this algebraic stack is the, well, you take the Picard group, you take the group ring over the Picard group. Okay, so basically, you should think about. Okay, so basically, you should think about these as finite linear combinations of line bundles. Modulo some ideal. And this ideal you can describe, if you've seen the description of the Chow theory or the cohomology of a smooth toric variety, then this is very, very similar to the Stanley Reisner presentation. Stanley Reisner presentation, but it's sort of a multiplicative version. And so this is the ideal generated by, I'm going to phrase it this way. So it's a little different than the way that Borisov and Hua describe it, but I think that it's that it's, oh, sorry, this is Borisov and Horia. Sorry. There's another paper by Borisov and Hois, which is also very relevant. Anyway. Relevant anyway. And I'm going to take elements of the Alexander dual. So, I mean, this at this point, you should be skeptical of this notation because what I immediately did is I undid what I just did before. So these are essentially the non-faces of your fan. So, and so why is this the case? Well, Well, if you look at the cock string of these toric stacks, then you can see pretty easily that they're generated by all line bundles. And it's also not too hard to see. Well, so what are these ideals? These are basically they're the Kazoole resolutions of varieties on your open your affline set U that you've Set you that you've taken out. They're in the complement. And so they just vanish. So this is, it's not hard to see that certainly the K-theory is an image of this, but I guess you have to work a little bit harder to see that this is, there's not more. But we actually only, I only need this description. I don't, you know, there could be more ideals. It turns out there aren't. This is the main content of this theorem. Okay. So these XI's of. Okay, so these Xi's, of course, again represent the corresponding line bundles to these to these rays. And so, what are these Z's? So, let me define these Z's. We're going to talk a lot about these Z constructions. So, Z sub sigma is just the convex hull of the support of these. Of these relations, essentially. So, one way of thinking about what the K-theory is going to look like is this is a lattice, right? Or sorry, it could have torsion, but I'm going to, again, it turns out that the torsion is just not going to enter into the picture at all. So I'm just going to ignore it throughout the talk. You basically have a lattice. You basically have a lattice. It may or may not be generated by these. This is something that happens in the stacky situation, but certainly these are lattice points. And these are basically what your relations look like. And so you can, there's going to be a coefficient of like one here, minus one, minus one, one. One here. And then you're going to have a coefficient of minus two, and then a coefficient of one, and this type of thing. So these z's are basically the. These Zs are basically the sort of geometric ways of viewing the relations of this sort of multiplicative Stanley-Reisner presentation of the K-theory. Okay, so maybe I'll pause and take a look at the chat, make sure that I'm aware. Okay. Okay. So what are these? So I'm going to talk a lot about these Z's. These Z's. So, in this particular case, by the way, Z13 corresponds to the fact that these two are not a cone. And Z24 corresponds to the fact that these two are not a cone. And Z empty set is clearly in there because all four of these are not a cone. So all of these are in, you know. So, all of these are in our Stanley-Reisner multiplicative Stanley-Reisner ideal in some sense. Okay, so why is Z? So, this brings us to, I guess, the most important geometric thing that's going on in my talk. These Z's are all what are called zonotopes. So, a zonotope is a Minkowski sum. Um, is a Minkowski sum of line bundles, or sorry, of line segments, or if you don't like the language of Minkowski sums, or it's just a linear projection. Of a hypercube. So we can see this in a particular example. So let's, if you draw your old friend the wireframe cube. Yes, there we go. There's our old friend, the wireframe cube, right? So if you're, when we're drawing this, we're drawing it in sort of three dimensions. If we make it solid and If we make it solid and we don't distinguish the faces at all, then when you project it down, you're going to have this interesting shape where every pair of sides, each face is going to be parallel to exactly one other face of like the same length. And so this is what a zonotope is. And these Stanley-Reisner relations, at least the Relations, at least the generating relations, their supports are all zonotopes of a particular form. And here's this picture is just to give you a sense of what they can look like in sort of more complicated settings. So in the two-dimensional case, you're always going to have a bunch of line segments. And the Minkowski sum, each, you're basically, if you think about how the Minkowski sum works, you're basically going to get something like this. Now, notice that each line segment becomes a pair of Becomes a pair of parallel sides of your zonotope. And this thing here is just some example of, it's just one three-dimensional zonotope, and I've given you lots of different angles. I think that the program that I was using to draw it has a pretty steep perspective, so it can be a little bit misleading. But each of the faces is itself a zonotope. And so there's this very interesting sort of inductive structure that we're definitely going to take advantage. Structure that we're definitely going to take advantage of. Okay. Okay. So now on to the toric for Benius, which is sort of the other piece of the puzzle of what I'm going to talk about today. So this is the toric for Benius. So the torque for Benius is. So, the torque for BNES is kind of delightful. I think it's kind of neat. So, for any natural number, you can let f of m be the map from the stack to itself. It's an endomorphism, okay, induced by B induced by, well, notice that upstairs in U. Notice that upstairs in U, right, your original affine space, you have these, you just have n entries, and you can just take the nth power of each of these. And since you're modding out by a torus, or sorry, a group of multiplicative type, this turns out to be an equivariant map. And so when you take stack quotients, you get this nice, well-defined morphism. And of course, this looks a lot like the Frobenius homomorphism. It's not quite that. It's because the absolute Frobenius doesn't actually do anything to the points. It only does things to the sheaves. But we're interested in the sheaves. So let me point out the following theorem that describes what the image of this thing sort of looks like. And so I'm going to attribute. Sort of looks like. And so I'm going to attribute this to several different people who have contributed various pieces. So Thompson was essentially the first to describe this in the case of smooth torque varieties. Ackinger in 2015 has a much cleaner proof in the smooth projective case. And actually, despite the fact that it appeared later, Okawa and Uehara described Uehara described this for smooth toric stacks. And they build on Akinger's description, on his sort of changed proof, even though the publication dates are a little funky. And essentially what they proved is if you take the push forward of the, they proved more than this, I'm just taking what I'm interested in, of the trivial sheaf. Okay, it's a direct sum of lines. Okay, it's a direct sum of line bundles, and in fact, this agrees with the Frobenius when you're in characteristic p, but I'm doing everything over the complex numbers for now. Ackner actually showed that if this is true for all line bundles, and you're talking about a smooth projective variety, You're talking about a smooth projective variety, then it must be a toric variety. So this can be used to characterize toric varieties. So it's a very strong property. And moreover, not only did they just, they say, hey, it's a direct sum of line bundles, they actually described exactly what they were with multiplicities. So moreover, I'm going to define this TF to be the union. Oops. Over basically all natural numbers of the L that are inside this push forward, where L is an invertible sheaf is an explicit finite set. So they describe So, they describe exactly what it is for any particular M. And it turns out that after you take M to be high enough, you start to get just the same things over and over again. So, but if you just take the union of everything, you just need a sufficiently divisible M, then you get an explicit finite set, which I'm going to describe on the next slide. But they basically do so. So, this brings us to what sometimes I've heard called What some I've heard called Bondol's conjecture. It was actually an announcement in 2006. He discussed some ongoing work and mentioned the following in passing, but it never appeared in print. So in any case, it was that this set generates the divide. Generates the derived category of X for X smooth proper variety. So the theorem that I mentioned, or sorry, the work that I mentioned by Oka and Uehara built on this. So they proved They proved this in 2013. They showed that they generalized the Toric Frobenia so that it applied to Tauric stacks. And then they showed that this thing actually generates the derived category of a Tauric stack, but only in the case where the dimension is less than or equal to two. So this is, to my knowledge, the state of the art of this. Knowledge: The state of the art of the situation at the moment is so it's unclear. I, you know, I don't know if this is true. Even for smooth proper varieties, this has never appeared. But what I'm going to talk about today is the following. We've proven that, in fact, this set. Can I interrupt you for a second, sorry? Sure, yeah. So go ahead. So classical only makes sense for prime powers. Yes. Is there anything of that sort here or just you call it because that's that's an excellent question. So we call it the Frobenius because, so, you know, if you are working over, you know, in character, so in character. you know in character so in characteristic p uh then this fp to the n uh this push forward gives you the same uh collection as the the usual frobenius so you're defining them a little bit different because uh the absolute frobenius is defined as an identity um on the topological spaces but it turns out that the push forward uh by the absolute frobenius gives you the same By the absolute Frobenius, gives you the same answer by this push forward by this just this endomorphism. Does that make sense? So they do agree in characteristic P. Not the maps themselves, but the push forward. And when you say they agree, that means that you have a clear way to identify all the line bundles in characteristic P with the ones in characteristic zero. Yes. Yes. Yes, so the characterization agrees in both characteristics. Sorry, it's because they are all combinatorily defined in terms of yes, exactly. And in fact, I'm going to give you a description shortly. Does that answer your question? Yes. When I say the announcement for X most proper variety, you mean Torik. Torik Torik, yes, thank you. Yeah, so uh I have one more question. My understanding of Bondal's announcement from long, long ago was that his intuition for this was related to some mirror symmetry predictions. Yes, I am not at all going to touch that. So I came at this from a different, very different perspective. Different, very different perspective. So you cannot tell us what this from Venus would be on the mirror side. That was an oppression. Not offhand. It is mentioned, he does talk about this in his announcement. And yes. And possibly what I'm doing today will be helpful towards understanding that. I don't know. I'm interested in this for different reasons than Bondal was originally. Thank you, Vera, Christian. Yep. Very personally. Yep. Right. So the theorem that I was going to state today was that was essentially that we can do what Okala and Uahara did, except we can do it without this dimension assumption and do it for all Torx stacks in the smooth Torx stacks in the setting that I'm talking about. So I'll point out that our proof is very, very different than what they do. We're going to use some of their tools. We're going to use some of their tools. So, I don't want to say that what I'm doing replaces what they've done. We use some of their tools, but they use the MMP and I'm just going to attack it directly. So a very different perspective than the sort of other way of thinking about these things. Okay. All right. So I'm about halfway through, which is good. So the Halfway through, which is good. So, the remainder of the talk, I'm going to give you a sketch of how this works. And time permitting, I'll give you a little bit of an indication as to why we're so excited about this and why we started thinking about this to begin with. So, one thing right away that I'll point out is that one thing that's interesting about this. Oh, I'm about to describe what the actual torque. What the actual toric Fibenius looks like, and then I'll make the observation I was about to make. Okay, so here's some more pictures. These are what the Toric Fribenius looks like. So let me be a little bit more precise. So let's r to the N to pi, I'm going to call this map pi, is the usual projection. Projection from the if you have the torus invariant divisors, there's a map to the Picard group in toric geometry, and I'm just going to tensor everything with R. And this turns out to be harmless, so I'm not going to get into exactly why, but it's a little bit of a lie. So if there's torsion in your Picard group, then the torque for Benius contains all the torsion sheaves, and so you don't have to worry about it. So it suffices to basically pretend like the Picard. Suffices to basically pretend like the card group has an attortion. So, let this be the canonical map that takes, I guess, a T-invariant R divisor to its Picard class. And we can define the following three sets. They're all very closely related. So, Z is going to be the image of, I'm going to take a hypercube. I'm going to take a hypercube. I'm going to take the closed interval from minus one to zero to the n, upstairs in r to the n, and project it down to the car group. And so we get a zonotope, like the pictures that I have, or the pictures that I had before. If I take, I'm also going to just refer to some other sort of variants on this notion. You could take the Um, you could take the open cube and project this down, and this will give you the interior of the zonotope. And then the last thing, and this is the one that's most important for our purposes, is what we call the half-open zonotope, which is a little bit misleading. And I'll tell you why that's a little misleading in a moment. But you can take the half-open interval to the power of n, and then you can project down. And to understand what's going on here, To understand what's going on here, if this is zero, then when you take the Minkowski sum of these half-open intervals, you're going to get all these points that are like extremal, that are adjacent, and you're going to get all the interior points. But you're going to miss out. This boundary is all going to not be there. So this is what happens. This is what happens when you take this image of this sort of half-open set. So here's a three-dimensional version of this, and I picked the colors to suggest sort of a corn on the cob. So you have all the stuff inside, and then you have this little piece of husk kind of on the corner. This is the trivial sheaf in some sense, as we'll see momentarily. And then you have all this other stuff, but it's really you're missing. But it's really you're missing the skin except right by the trivial sheaf on the on the faces that touch the trivial sheaf. So it's a little bit of a bizarre set. But essentially, again, I'm being a little bit sloppy with torsion, but if we ignore, if we pretend like we don't have any torsion, which again, I claim is essentially harmless, what Thompson, Ackinger, and Okawa and Uahara Okawa and Uehara, they essentially describe the Toric Trabenius is this set intersected with the, or basically you want the classes of the Picard group rather than the whole real span of it that are inside this half-open zonotope. So I don't think that any of them use the word zonotope, but if it's If it's after, at least after Thompson, it was fairly clear that this was what was going on. So, this is a very nice set. And we claim that this generates the derived category. And it's very easy to calculate in practice, which is super nice because our main interest is actually doing explicit calculations with the derived categories of toric varieties and looking for symmetric. And looking for symmetric exceptional collections and so on. And this is our mean tool. And so, our goal to sketch the proof that this set generates, our goal is actually, I'm going to show that if you take the finitely supported Recorded elements on this group ring of the real vector space. But I mod out by these sort of discrete ideals that I talked about before. Maybe I'll just zip back to the description of the K-theory that I talked about before. So essentially, what I'm saying is that rather than considering the Picard group, which is some lattice, I'm going to tensor with R and I'm I'm going to tensor with R and I'm actually going to consider all the real divisors. But the things that I'm mudding out by are these sort of discrete objects. So we're going to be interested in sort of the, they correspond to finitely supported things. But what I'm claiming is that you don't need to care about the specifics of what the lattice is in order for everything to go through. You're going to see that if you just the algorithm. Going to see that if you just the algorithm works when you tensor things with the reals, and it's pretty clear how you can restrict it to the lattice to any given lattice. And so this takes care of all the weird stacky stuff all at once. So this is back to where we are. So we want to show that this set or this ring, excuse me, is spanned by By elements supported on this half open zonotope. So if you'd like, you can think of P as being a lattice, and you're probably not going to lose much, but I find that it's actually cleaner just to think about it as being all the real vector space, the whole real vector space. And the idea is that we're trying to use the Is that we're trying to use the relations, these Stanley-Reisner relations, to show that it actually has to, that, you know, you start with any randomly finitely supported, you know, you have a bunch of points with integer coefficients, and the claim is that using these relations, you can put it into this half open zonotope. Okay. All right, so now I'm going to give you sort of a flavor of how we go about doing this. So, the first step is maybe the easiest in some ways. And this is, I'll explain these pictures in a minute. So, step one is we reduce to generation on Z. So, this is the closed zone. So, this is the closed zonotope. So, it doesn't actually even matter where zero is. And what I've done here is I've moved it so its center is at the origin. And we can take scalings of it. And we get this sort of every point on the plane is going to be on some scaling of the zonotope, exactly one unique scaling of the zonotope. Okay. And so we basically define a partial order. We basically define a partial order on the points in the real vector space as follows. So, given a P that's on some scaling of the main zonotope and some Q that's on another scaling of this zonotope. We say if lambda is less than mu, then of course we say the point. Then, then, of course, we say the point p is less than q. So, in some sense, this is sort of like a distance function, sort of like an L1 norm, except it's like a zonotope. Okay. And then, but we need some tiebreakers if sometimes we need some tiebreakers if they are both on the same zonotope. So, if lambda equals mu, then we say that p is less than q if p lies on On a higher-dimensional face of the zonotope that they both lie on. Okay, and so now that I already sort of have my picture, so over here, these are basically our relation zonotopes. So, if you think about what the relation zonotopes are, these came from Kazoolet resolutions. So, these are basically: you have coefficients at the corners that are always plus or minus one. Now, there might be lots of other stuff going on inside. We don't care. We're only really interested in the extremal vertices, and their coefficients are plus or minus one. So, we can use them to basically iteratively, you have some random finitely supported. Supported sets. So suppose you have, yeah, let me show you an example. If I take P to be this set here, then I can pick a relation and put it there. And notice that if I sort of apply this relation, I subtract it from the polynomial or the group ring element that I'm looking at, then all of the other elements. And all of the other elements after I've replayed the relation are going to have a smaller, are going to be smaller under this partial order. And notice that clearly this will work, this particular relation will work for all of the sets on the interior of P. But if you put your point P instead on a boundary, then Then, well, so notice that this guy is still going to work, but now you're going to have some points that are still on that scaled zonotope, but they're on a higher dimensional face. So you're still lowering their power. And then notice that this is the wrong relation to use if you want to move points off of this one. You want to use one of the other relations instead. And so it's a lemma that. So it's a lemma that I hope is kind of geometrically clear. Oops. The lemma is that if P is in the whole real vector space, except for the closed zonotope, okay, confined relation. Confined relation Zi that only touches it once, such that all other points, sorry, find a translation of a relation so that such that all other points in that relation. points in that relation satisfy q less than p so this is it's a lot like groebner basis the the uh uh the groebner basis algorithm the multi the polynomial long division except it's you your monomial order is this weird uh distance that that sort of takes the zonotopes into account and uh here's what and what's really interesting is that if you get down to this zonotope then you start Down to this zonotope, then you start to run into problems. It starts to fail precisely when you have the zonotope itself. So, if I think about it, basically, because if I put this on the edge here, then it's definitely going to touch other extremal vertices. And so it basically works as long as your relations are, as long as your points are just outside. But as soon as you're on the zonotope itself, But as soon as you're on the zonotope itself, this strategy fails. You can't reduce the order anymore. So basically, this only says that we can essentially reduce to the case where we're generating on the original zonotope Z itself. Okay. And I want to make a comment before moving on. This step does not rely on the idea. I told you that these relation zonotopes are coming from the sort of Stanley-Reisner relations, they're the non-faces. It turns out for this to work, all you need is the vectors, the vector configuration. So this works regardless of what your fan structure is. So you only need what the rays are of the fan. So in some sense, this Z closure This algorithm basically works regardless of what you're, it's a birational invariant, it's more than that, it's a small invariance in the sense that what do I want to say? That as long as you're not changing a codimension one subset, then this is still going to work, basically. And you're going to get the same algorithm. But if you want to do better, you need to take the actual fan into account. All right, so in some sense, this is the other thing that I want to say about this is that you can translate Z around. So this algorithm works anywhere. So if you want to move around Z, then you can. It doesn't necessarily just work for the Cerfrobenius. So depending on your lattice, this might be really useful. Okay. So this brings us to this next step. And here I've given you sort of a pictorial idea. Giving you sort of a pictorial idea as to why you call them zonotopes. So this is step two. And so there's an inductive argument, but I'm trying to just show you that it suffices to consider only it suffices to consider only Extremal vertices of Z. So, in other words, this is, I know, a vague thing, but I have lots of, I'm hoping that the pictures can make up for my not being precise. If we prove that if you take an extremal vertex that's on Z but not on On this half-open zonotope, if you can find a relation that moves it away from the extremal vertices, but maybe is still, you know, not on the in the interior or the half-open zonotope, but just on faces that are not the extremal vertices, then I claim that we win. And the reason for this is an inductive argument where you first start. Argument where you first start with the faces and you show that you can reduce the faces, and then you take the facets, and then you take faces of co-dimension two, and then co-dimension one, and so on. So here's, by the way, why they call them zonotopes. So the red, this is the same zonotope written six times, but in each case, there's a you can You can take all of the faces that contain this one parallel edge. Here, they all contain this one parallel edge. Here, they all contain this one parallel edge. Here, they contain this parallel edge. And so the idea is that you can project in the dimension, or sorry, in the direction of each of those parallel edges, and you get a new zonotope where each of these Where each of these lines corresponds to sort of a face upstairs. And the idea is that if we understand how to do it for extremal vertices for any zonotope, then we run the algorithm here. And this tells us what to do upstairs in order to fix the things that are not on the extremal vertices. So this basically gives us an induction argument. I know this is just a sketch, but it essentially says. Sketch, but it essentially says we only need to worry about figuring out how to use relations to get these extremal vertices off. And everything else, if we know how to do it for a general zonotope, then we can appeal to induction on dimension. Okay, and so before moving on, let me just define V is going to be the integral span of I wanted to give this set of extremal vertices a name. I'm going to call them T. So this is a direct summoned as a Z vector space of P. So essentially what I'm saying is that I want to understand Is that I want to understand, I only care about the extremal vertices. If I only look at those, I basically say that I want to reduce these to only the cusp of the zonotope. I basically want only this point, and I want to show that all these other points, those are the only ones that I'm considering, and I only care about what the relations do to those points only. Those points only. And so, this is what the space V is. It's now just a vector space. Okay, so let me on this next slide, hopefully it'll become a little bit clearer what's going on here. So this is a zonotope. And what am I trying to do here? I'm trying to understand how the relations move around the external, the extremal vertices. So here, So here, this is my original zonotope. And basically, what I'm trying to say is that I only care about these red dots on the outside. And as you move around the relation and touch the different extremal vertices, you're going to get different relations in this vector space V that just contains the things supported on the extremal vertices. Right? So I'll explain what these two different boxes really mean, but you can see that as you move around your relation, it's going to touch different extremal vertices. And as your relations become more smaller, then they're more able to do things. So, this relation, for example, is enough to show that if you have a point on the, if you have the if you have the The uh, if you have the trivial sheaf, then there's a relation that contains uh this guy and then some points that are all in the interior. And so, if you can get rid of the trivial sheaf using that relation, if you had that in your set of possible relations, okay, so what are these things? So, for a random set, a random subset of your indexing set, so you have n rays, right? Let's put Right? Let's pick a monomial upstairs. So this is just a, in our sort of Laurent polynomial ring upstairs, you have a monomial x to the s. Okay. And so I'm going to make the following definition. And this is, I hope that the picture is going to make the definition clear. So for sigma and s in my subset E, there is a unique There is a unique tau, another subset of E, so that x to the s is in the support of x to the tau I not in sigma. Not in sigma one minus xi. Okay, so essentially what this is saying, so and oh, I should say, so let L sub sigma superscript S denote the image of this of this of this In the extremal vertices. So, this one here is basically saying if I have a relation like Z1 and I want it to touch the vertex corresponding to the empty set, then there's only one place for me to put it. And if I want this relation and I want it to touch the empty set, there's only one place of putting it. And this basically says gives me Gives me where the extremal vertices that that relation touches when I put it at the empty set. And so these are for each of the possible given relations, there's only one way of translating them so that they touch the empty set, at least upstairs. This next box is instead we take the point one three, which is not even, it's not even a point, it's a point in the hypercube from where the zonotope has descended. The zonotope is descended. Okay, it's not in the original thing. But you can still make sense of this idea, even though these are not actually, you know, you can still make sense of these ideas. So these, each of these relations, there's a unique way of putting it upstairs so that it touches the monomial corresponding to x1, x3. And then when you map it downstairs, you get sort of a unique relation like this. So I hope that that makes sense. And something that is really not hard to prove. That is really not hard to prove, but I found kind of shocking when I proved it. It's really just an interesting observation, but it's really kind of amazing, is it turns out that it doesn't matter for all s and s prime in your indexing set. So remember that we're not interested in all possible relations, we're given a particular All possible relations. We're given a particular set that comes from this Alexander dual. And so these guys are coming from. So this thing is a priori. This is the things from the Stanley-Reisner ideal, right? These are only the ones that come from the given set, but they all are the ones that are translated so that they touch S. So all of these guys, for example. So, all of these guys, for example. Or, you know, maybe suppose you only have the fat ones, then maybe you just have the top four. And this is as a vector space, not as a ring. So you're not allowed to translate once you have one. But what turns out to be kind of interesting is because it's a simplicial complex and you have the bigger relations, then you can in fact check that this is the same as if you had taken the span of all of them based at some other point. So, and I encourage you to check this. If you insist on, so if you have this, if you have this guy, then you, it's Z23. So, because of simplicial complex stuff, you also have to have Z2, Z3, and Z empty set. I claim that this relation, this relation, this relation, and this relation are going to generate the same vector space as these relations. Which is not super obvious, but if you play around with the pictures, you can see that they in fact span the same exact set. If you take into account the pluses or minuses at each of the vertices. So this basically says that you can actually translate things around. And this is really nice because it means, for example, that what you can see that this and this do the same thing to the extremal vertices, even though the relations themselves. Even though the relations themselves, you know, it's not as obvious. Here, this thing is basically empty, so it's zero. And so, what that implies is that you know that this is a linear combination of ones below it, even though you don't have, and you can explicitly write them down. Okay. So, this is powerful, and this kind of brings me to the end, the last step of our. End the last step of our sort of picture. And if you missed this, then I hope that you can understand the next part, even if this seems a little bit bizarre. This is how we prove the theorem. We need one more sort of step, one more lemma, and it's the following. So our lemma is, so if You have an inclusion of simplicial complexes that's a horn filling. And there's two particular types that I wanted to focus on. So by a horn filling, I mean suppose you have all of the facets of a simplex except for the interior in one of them, and you fill it to be the whole simplex. You fill it to be the whole simplex, including its interior. And then there's a condition on the dimension of this simplex, which is gonna be useful later on, is less than. Or you can also have something where you're just missing the interior of the simplex and you fill it in. But here we want to insist that the dimension of the simplex is strictly less than d. This simplex is strictly less than d. Then the span of these L sigmas, and doesn't, by the previous lemma, it doesn't matter what the S is, is the same as the span of the Alexander dual of the Horn-filled set. And it turns out that a horn filling is Alexander dual to itself. And so I'll explain that in a minute, but let me finish off with, because I'm running out of time, I want to make sure that I give the last sort of lemma that makes everything work. The lemma is that if sigma is a proper subspace of a simplicial d-sphere, okay. A simplicial D-sphere, okay, then there exists a sequence of horn fillings as above. You know, epsilon one, epsilon two, up to epsilon, whatever, q equals epsilon. Equals epsilon horn fillings. So, what is this saying? So, this statement here is basically saying that, okay, I'm given some relations. Those are my Stanley-Risen relations that I started with. What this is saying is that if I can identify in the Alexander dual, if I can identify Dual, if I can identify a horn filling, then I can fill it in and get a new relation for free. And Alexander Jewell takes the empty set to the entire, to every set in your entire simplicial complex is filled up. And so basically what this does is it says, and I'm going to go to the previous slide to kind of point this out, that if I have That if I have, for example, all of these relations in my simplicial complex, then the corresponding simplicial complex is a horn, and I'm missing one, three, and one, two, three. So even though they're not in my original simplicial complex, the lemma says that there is some way of combining them in the vector space so that they are there. And so you actually get everything. Everything. And one can check that as soon as you have this guy, you basically have all of the vertices. And so, what this is saying is that in some sense, and this lemma at the bottom is basically saying that if you start with something that's a proper subset of sublicial sphere, which is basically any toric variety that's not proper, then you can build it up as a sequence of horn fillings. And I've kind of drawn the idea here. I've kind of drawn the idea here. And so, what that means is, suppose that this is your simplicial complex for your that corresponds to your toric variety for the rays, then the Alexander dual is going to look like this. And the fact that you built your original guy up using horn fillings means that you can undo them on the fan, and this actually fills. And this actually fills in Stanley-Reisner relations until you get basically everything is a relation. And so this proves generation because you can move all these extremal vertices inside. So sort of a last step that's actually kind of subtle is, well, here's the inspiring. Well, here's the inspiring lie: is that the interior generates this vector space? So not even the half-open zonotope, but the interior of that closed zonotope generates if this guy is proper. If this is a proper, is not proper, excuse me. If you're If your Toric stack is not proper. And I say it's an inspiring lie because it's not exactly true. It's tricky with the induction in terms of the faces of higher dimension and so on. But essentially, the idea is that you just need, if your sheaf is not proper, you don't need the trivial sheaf. But if it is, then But if it is, then you do need the trivial sheaf to finish things off. And that is basically what this Husk is doing in some sense. Basically, you don't need this. This is a little bit of a lie, but you don't need this except in the situation where your stack is proper. And so it's actually tricky to show that that's the case. But the basic idea is. Idea is that aside from that one technicality, this basically gives you sort of an algorithm for demonstrating that Bondel's announcement extends to all smooth Toric stacks. Of course, this is just a sketch. So I'm basically done, but maybe I'll just say aloud that the main reason that we're interested in this Tauric Ribenius is it's Interested in this Tauric Frobenius is it's canonical. So, exceptional collections, you can write them down all day, but there's tons of them. This Tauric Frobenius is a bunch of line bundles. It's relatively small and it generates. And in fact, frequently it's already an exceptional collection immediately, but not in general, obviously, because of Ethiop's theorem. But the idea is that it gives us something that we can compute with and something to us something that we can compute with and something to start with that's much more manageable than than the original uh presentation of the k-theory ring um and i will end there thank you ah sorry i i uh i missed uh the questions in the in the in the in the chat i can answer them now is is that a good question Is that a good idea? Do people still? Okay, so yeah, Bernowski asked. Oh, sorry, and they were just asked, I believe. So, okay. Yes, are the X scripts between the generators manageable? Yes, absolutely. Yes. I haven't gotten around to doing this, but yes, it should be. They're just line bundles. So you, yeah, I mean, you can compute them with Macaulay 2 or Sage. There's ways of explicitly computing the X groups between these generators. X groups between these generators. So that's another thing that's nice. And this is basically what people did when they were trying to understand whether or not they were exceptional collections or not. Does that answer your question? Yes. Okay. And then the other question was, what happens to the zonotope under Tauric VGIT? And that's exactly the cool thing that I hope I said. I want to maybe take you back to a particular zonotope. Back to a particular zonotope. As you vary the GIT, the full zonotope is always just going to generate by the previous argument. But the half open zonotope is also going to generate, but for a different reason in some sense. So here, the relations you need to use are completely, they don't care about the fan at all. But to show that this generates, you really do need to know the particulars of the fan. Of the fan. And so, what's going on is somehow the, as you move around the different chambers, you're changing your relations, but your generating set is the same. It's very bizarre and it's something that we're actively looking into. Does that answer your question? Yes, thanks. Okay. Do we have other questions? All right. Well, I hope that people can watch. Well, I hope that people can walk away from this talk. If nothing else, then you've learned how to shuck a corn husk in a talk today. Okay. Thank you, Lucy and Alexander again for a very nice talk. Just want to interject here. I'm about to take a group photo for the in-person group, but we usually do a merge of virtual. A virtual photo as well. So, if anyone's in the Zoom meeting would like to turn on their cameras, I'll take a quick screenshot and we'll include you in the group photo.
