Versions. One more math, one more images. What do you guys prefer? Wow. Or images? Math? Math? Images? They're the same. Great. Well, thank you, Miguel. Excited to be closing this out today. This is the prime time spot, I'm sure. But hopefully, this is gigantic. So my name is Chris. I've had a lot of fun hearing about all of your work, meeting a lot of you guys in person, your work with C2. I'm going to be telling you today about this paper, but about mixing with elastic instabilities in 3D porous media. So hopefully that kind of cues the right words for you guys. And I'm very lucky that you guys have already introduced all these topics. So I can really kind of skip over a lot of the motivation. This is the system that we This is the system that we use. So, some of you guys are familiar with this, but the basic setup is to build a 3D medium that we can image directly inside of. So, this is something that is accessible to many simulations, is typically very hard to access experimentally. And so, the way we do this is we pack grains of glass into a portcapary and then stitch them together, basically to build our own fake glass rock. This is fully borosilicate, it's chemically similar enough to us rocks. For the problem I'll be doing today, all of the The property we do today are all of these are spherical grains, and they're just a sort of. And then we can inject any fluid we want into it. Today I'll be telling you about viscoelastic polymer solutions. I'll tell you more about those in a little bit. But the real key is that we tune the solvent of whatever we put inside of this to be able to refract and expand. So as it invades the medium and displaces the air, the whole thing becomes transparent. Now you can see the flow. And this gives you access to a lot of things. We'll put dyes in there and then pore space. You can see how those dyes move around. You can also put part of the flow. Those guys brown. You can also put particles in there. So we've seen a lot of processed images of this. So I just wanted to show you the raw image looks like for the simulation people here. These are fluorescent particles that are moving in 3D, and we are using a focal microscope to see just a single plane. And so you're seeing the in-plane motion of these particles. And you can do a few things with that. You can measure the velocities, and you can visualize the streamlines as they change dynamically. So you guys have seen this video as well. One of the really exciting things that we see. One of the really exciting things that we see in 3D media is that polymers can produce elastic instabilities that are very similar to the elastic instabilities that people see in 2D, but with some interesting nuances because of the 3D tortures force case. And in particular, we see that there's a lot of peculiarities, the type of disorder you get in 3D packing, that give differences in the flow structure as well. So I'm not going to tell you too much about this, but we've already seen some interesting work upon the flow resistance of these types of flows. Of flows, and the worst thing you can do as an experimentalist is propose your own model, like that anyway. And just this is the most naive model you can do to say what is the dissipation associated with the shear of these fluctuations. And so, this is how you would kind of compute that. The model agrees decently that at least for this data. But as many people in the audience pointed out, I neglected these sprayed history effects, which play really, really important roles for many fluids and for many geometries. And in fact, maybe I should add birefringent strands as well, which we don't have access to infinitely, but play the Have access to information, but play their own important role. So you've seen a lot of how these play a role in a lot of other talks. And so it's really exciting as an experimentalist to see these observations cue really exciting deeper theory than we found before. And so I'm going to tell you about something completely different today. And I'm going to go against the best intuition and show you another model that I've made, which is drastically simplified. And hopefully you people in the room can show me a more beautiful theory to match our. More beautiful theory to match our observations. So, this is a topic that most of you, or maybe some of you, are familiar with in chemical engineering, which is flow reactors. So, this is a type of porous medium where you have different chemicals moving through it, and as they move through this tortuous pore space, they react, either because there's something catalytic about the grains themselves, or because the porous medium is providing a mixer. And this is really important in the range of pharmaceutical and social chemical industries. This is something like a multi- Industries. This is something like a multi-trillion dollar mobile industry, so it's really important. But you guys probably can already recognize that this is challenging because you're out with low Reynolds numbers. So you're going to have interesting transport limitations. And what you guys maybe don't think a lot about is that there's a molecular scale chemistry happening, and that adds an additional time scale to the problem that I certainly haven't seen, at least in this conference, but hopefully some of you guys have already thought about. So here's just a brief outline. You videos. That would keep video to this title. You have already seen how the flow structure can play an important role in things. Well, I don't know. You'll see the videos briefly. But what we can do is we can look at how things mix, because when things react, they first have to find each other. So there's a mixing transfer problem, which is rather interesting. And I think it's something that you guys already have a good framework for thinking about. And then once they mix together, they have to do. And then, once they mix together, they have to do their chemistry as they react. And so, this part is pretty easy. A lot of you guys do this. This part's a little bit harder. But we have now ways to visualize directly the real-time reaction kinetics in CG. So we can see things converting A before D goes to C. We can see that happening within the forces, which we think is really exciting, giving us access to information that we don't usually have. So, here's the pay-per-view as we're going to follow along. I'll try to keep you actually the data set. And interrupt me. So, when you're in little Reynolds number, a lot of you know that you don't have turbulent mixing. So, this is not mixing like you have in your coffee cup when you stir things up. You have something called laminar chaotic infection, which is a really well-studied field. This is a lot of the work that really motivated us. If you've ever made bread and you have to meat it, you are mixing it, but it's not turbulent. You are mechanically mixing things together. And this type of mechanical mixing, the sequential stretching and folding mechanism, is really important for describing the rate of. Important for describing the rate of mixing that you have. And this is just as an image of what this looks like. So there's no turbulence here, but you can mechanically mix it. And as many of you guys know, in chorus media, when you're at low Reynolds number, the kind of mixing you get is this type of stretching and folding caused by the geometry itself, because you are stretching and folding fluid elements over the grain themselves. So this is really cool. There's a lot of really, really beautiful work in this field, and it always produces, I think, the most beautiful. Produces, I think, the most beautiful images. But there's some inherent limitations to this. Most importantly, that this is a geometry-dependent thing. So you can't change the flow rate because you're at all rent stumbler. If you just ramp up the flow rate and push harder, you don't get any improvements. So we are going to visualize it directly. Here's a very similar setup that I already described to you. So this is just a three-point medium. I've made it a little bit wider so I can stick two needles in it and inject two different fluids and just watch how they mix. Watch how they mix. And all of these, the fluids are going to be identical. So this is the same solvent I'll use throughout everything, but no polymers at all. And I'll match things with peculiar, which is supposed to describe their mixing. This is a video. You maybe can't see it, and this is kind of the point, that you are mixing things spatially as you move from left to right, as you flow from left to right. But the flow isn't changing in time, so you're only eating this mechanical, geometrically different driven mix. Different driven mixing. And as you look spatially down the medium, you get more mixing as you move further and further down, but that mixing is a little bit modest, at least in the medium, which I compare strategically. And as I just said, and as many of you guys know, this is not something you can change with flow rates. So if I do the same experiment at a bunch of different flow rates, and anyone wants my PEM number, you get a constant amount of mixing. You need the same length of medium to accomplish a target amount of mixing, and you can't change that with flow rate. And you can't change that with flow rate unless you go to really, really high random steps. That's a fortune. So, the question, very simply, is what happens when you have these elastic instabilities? I'll skip over that. And what you see, perhaps not surprisingly to some of you, is that you have really dynamic flows above the onset of this elastic instability, and that translates to transport in the solute zigga mixite. So, this is at the same depth as that large thing before. Large negotiation before is a few things. One, it's fluctuating like crazy. The other thing is that it's more mixed. So, somehow, all these fluctuations are productive, and these mixing mechanisms are somehow cooperating together. We can look at how this mixing increases as you move downstream. You can now see more gradually that as you move through the medium, these fluctuations are producing more and more stretching and mixing of your fluid, kind of in within pores. Of in within ports, and at the end, you are much more balanced. If you measure things in the same way and say, how long of a medium do I have to use to obtain a target mixing? And we see a pretty sharp drop-off above the odds of the instability. So the instability starts here, there's a bit of a delay, and then you see this really strong decrease in the mixing model. Oh, had it right there. Oh, had it right there. So, the question is: what is the actual mechanism that is quantitatively determining this? And as you probably can guess, if you look at the streamline fluctuations or velocity fluctuations and pair that up with the concentration fluctuations, these things are linked rather particularly. So you can see here, you can see this light because there's this kind of sharp line where you're going from a high concentration region to a low concentration region. And as your fluid is fluctuating and creating kind of transient eddies, you are. Transient eddies, you are pulling and stretching and folding the fluid over here. So some of these fluctuations are providing really important stretching at the interface where you have diffusion that's driving the mixing between two fluids. And I won't go into it too much because this is something that's actually pretty well established, but we can quantify this. We can predict from the velocity field how much mixing you should be obtaining using finite time of Yapenol X points. This is an experimental way to use velocity information to predict. Information to predict how much particles are being separated in time. And this is some way to quantify the mixing. That's fairly well established for turbons. And the very, very simple mechanism that we'd like to say is that you have two very different types of mixing happening. One of them is purely mechanical and it's not changing the time. One is very dynamic and it's happening at the force scale. And because these are happening at very different scales, you can say that both of these things are just folding and stretching the fluids at different scales in different ways. Scales in different ways. So the way that folds add is they are multiplicative. So if you fold a thing once, you have two. If you fold it again, you have four. If you fold it again, you have eight. This is a multiplicative thing. So if you said that both things are folding and those folds are independent or superposable, you should multiply them together. And because you're multiplying things together at some fixed rate, you expect that to increase exponentially in time. That's typically defined as mixing time or mixing length. Or mixing length. So then, because you have two exponentials, multiplying the rates that you can measure, a rate of mixing should just be added together for laminar chaotic infection. So this is the laminar term that you guys are very familiar with. That should be this right here. So there's models for this already. It's dependent on the grain size and your geometry of your medium. And for this, we can plug in our finite time with Apple's exponent with a little F that I encourage you to look at the paper to look into, which is basically accounting for the disordered. Which is basically accounting for the disorder of your porcelain game and heterogeneity in the flow instability, which is playing a very important role. And this model, we think, works reasonably well. It captures certainly the magnitude, it captures the fact that you've told it when the instability is starting. And the kind of transition, not so well. And so there's a lot of more complicated things happening here. These instabilities are probably interacting in a special way. So I'm excited to see what kind of modeling. To see what kind of modeling you guys have to improve this. Oh, and we can also measure the dispersivity. I haven't showed you that data, but the dispersivity is a measure of how quickly things are spreading out. So we don't do that experiment directly. If you put like a little stream of dye, you can watch as it kind of gradually spreads out through your porous medium. And we have a way to estimate that for moments in time independently. And the model works reasonably well for that as well. And there we see a 6x increase. These are both important things for These are both important things for a lot of industrial applications. What I promise you is something new: how we can harness this for chemical reactions. And this is, I think, a very different type of mixing because you have additional time scales that come into play. This part is a little bit hard because most of the time you can't see chemical reactions. You just have to do it and then measure it at the very end. And so the system that I've developed is this complicated chemical, which has this very cute thing, SCARF. Star. And the basic is that you have a molecule that is in a phenolic form, and if you reduce it to the phenolate form, there's a shift in fluorescent transmission. So this is a rather unique property because we can see both of them, and they're going to have different colors, which means on our microscope, we can distinguish from the color, the pixel, the concentration of both of these. You can see this with your all-eyes, and it's rather beautiful. So if I have the reactant and I just really push all the way to the left-hand. Push all the way to the left-hand, sorry, the right-hand side of my equation, I can see the shift in color visually, and I can also see that on my microscope. So, here is that reaction proceeding in that porous medium, where I have two streams. One has my phenolic form of my reactants. This is reactant A. The bottom one has sodium hydroxide, which is my reactant B. There's a little bit of fluorescent in here, just so that you can still see it from the pore, but where the pore space is. And at the interface, you can see where the two reactants are meet by diffusion. Two reactants are able to meet by diffusion. The reactor to produce the cyanol. This is exciting because, as chemical engineers, even we don't usually get to visualize these in real space. And you can see as it moves through the medium that you're, first of all, getting a wider band of where you're producing this product. You can also see the signatures of these folds, which are caused by this mechanical geometric-driven mixing in this laminar flow. And now, if I had the polymer, as you can guess, you see a much more dynamic, rich process of these things mixing together. So here you have some, maybe the easiest one to look at is here upstream, because you're just beginning to see the fluctuations from the medium heating into the upstream, that you are fluctuating this interface between the fluids, and that's just expanding the interface and creating more regions for the two reactants to meet each other. Two reactants to meet each other. And as you move through the medium, very quickly, you begin to not see very much of the reactants at all. You're just creating so much product that really, really are related to the medium. And so when we measure this, it looks a little bit different. For the laminar case, actually, things get worse at higher Peplin numbers because there's two time scales. One is the time to fix, and one is the time to react. And if you push something faster, you are moving very far away in a short time. Very far away in a shorter period of time, and you have to give it time for the reaction to take place. You actually want to be operating at low Peclet numbers if you want to be efficient. So, if you want to have a short reaction, you have to get low Peclet numbers, but if you want to high throughput, you also kind of want, you have to kind of move in this direction. So, there's this inherent trade-off that you have to deal with in industry, at least in these kinds of flow reactors. And if you add your polymers in, you see that you can break that trade-off entirely. So, there's some optimal where you are pushing your fluid just hard enough. Pushing your fluid just hard enough, see this improvement. For our case, we're really getting close to the kinetic limit of our reaction, which means the mixing is happening so fast that it doesn't matter how much faster you mix, you're not going to get any closer. Does that mean it's any closer to that? And for what we're observing, this is about a 5x increase in reactivity. So you've reduced the length of your wired reactor by 5x, which we think is rather important. And so I've already hinted at this, but the question is, how? Already hinted at this, but the question is: how exactly is it doing this? And if you look at the pore-scale flow, you again can see signatures of what's happening. You can see how these fluctuations are stretching the interface between these two fluids. And in the same way that that's increasing mixing, you are exposing more of the two products together. And as soon as they move in, they can react. And the modeling for this is also very similar. So, this is maybe a model that you guys are not familiar with, but this is called the segregating mixing model. This again is a Segregating mixing model. This again is a really strict-down, simple version that allows you to plug in these two separate things and just slam them together and get some predictions of your overall rate of reaction. The first thing is that there's some chemistry that has to happen. And if you had a well-mixed chemical reactor, like we would really love to have, and all your reactants just work together all at once, there are some reaction kinetics that happen. There's a rate associated with that, which we can measure to be 10 seconds for these fluids, for these reactants. Of these reactants. And that just causes you to have an exponential increase in the amount of pattern. But you also have to mix. And that mixing is very heterogeneous across the medium. Some parts of the fluid mix very early, right at the very beginning, before you're even entering the medium. Some you have to get to the very end, and it still hasn't had a time to mix. So the reaction hasn't started yet for a lot of the fluid. And the way you incorporate this is you say that those two processes are completely independent, which is obviously not entirely correct. Not entirely correct. But you say that every parcel of fluid at some point in its history becomes omnipresent. And at that moment, I turn on my clock, and now I begin reacting. And now I just use my very simple reactor model. In reality, these two things are happening simultaneously. And this integral becomes much more complicated than at least I can handle. Maybe some of you can handle it. What that gives is a very simple prediction, right? That you should just integrate this, and it's messy, so I don't want to put it on the slide. But it's really easy to do analytically, actually. And this mixing time. And this mixing time, we've seen from the solutes that are non-reactive, is just the superposition of your two mixing modes. And for those of you that were wondering, there is kind of a second number that emerges here, which is the DOM colour number, which is comparing the rate of transport and mixing for the rate of reaction kinetics itself. So that is playing a role into these things. And for the downcore numbers we're accessing, this is what the model is. Down corners we're accessing, this is what the model does. So, once again, we have the onset not quite right, the magnitude decently right. And what was happening here is probably what I said: the fact that you have reaction happening at the same time as mixing. And here, where we expect in our model to have a lot of fluid elements that are incompletely mixed, the segregated mixing model is under-predicting how much mixing you have because they're still reacting very, very slowly. And our model says it hasn't started yet. It hasn't started to do that. So, if you have a more in-depth model, we expect that that would be better justify these things and provide better design. So, thank you guys. I think I finished early enough for our dinner. We think this is really exciting because this is the first time we're able to visualize these chemical reactions. And there's really, really interesting dynamics happening and new time scales, which makes everything more complicated. So, this is super important for a lot of industries, but I think what it's interesting. But I think what is interesting for people in this room is that there's a lot of radology here that can pack points. There's additional time scales and the coupling between those, and especially if you have reactions that involve temperature, which most of them do, that really has interesting feedback back into ureology with the straw. Thank you guys. Excited to hear your questions. Thank you very much. Question for Chris. For a great point. Nice. Thanks. I agree. So you shorten the length, but do you price in the dissipation that you have to do? Beautiful question. Not planned. Oh, you quite buy that. Oh, yeah, of course. No, this is an important thing to have measured. So it turns out to be kind of a wash. So you shorten the length, but your increase in mixing performance kind of roughly offsets the increase in resistance. So it doesn't seem to matter too much. So it doesn't seem to matter too much. So if the primary thing that you care about is how hard I'm pushing the fluid, I wouldn't bother with all of those. Maybe for a different geology. But you shorten the length, so you have to buy less these precious beads. I don't know why they match. There's some scaling arguments I could do, say, to wave my hands, but they match more closely than I would expect. That's a good question. Um very very nice experimental system and experimental work. Um so uh I guess two questions. Uh like so is it you mentioned the end temperature can have a huge impact in this in this system what what's the enthalpy of that reaction? The change of enthalpy of that? I don't know on the top of my head. It's a very small reactants, and if you have concentrated reactants, And if you have concentrated reactants where there's not a lot of solvent, it's mostly a reactant, they are the ethical changes, really, like a larger role. No idea. This is intentionally chosen because there's no change in temperature. I don't know. And the other question, you at such a point, you say that this folding effect that you and and and you model it with a like a simple exponential, a simple thing. Is just an exponential. I was thinking, like, I mean, like, it shouldn't be a stretched exponential because, like, you have all so many landscapes that travel during X. You think it's going to be a stretched exponential because of what there's because you have all these different landscape or time scales, the way the different frequencies of the EU system, right? So, for turbulent flows, it's often just an exponential. And the aquana exponent is good. And for the laminar chaotic invection, which is the laminar. Laminar Kaonica vection, which is the laminar case state, just one point, that also actually is an exponential related to the geometry. So there's actually two Lyapunov exponents here. I just called ones that's different. Okay, to talk about it. And because those are both, I don't know if I have this slide, we've measured this for individual fluid lamellae and you can see that their interface does increase exponentially. Yeah. Good question. Yeah. I agree. Fantastic work. Thank you. So I'm wondering what kind of a role does the disorder in the course media play into triggering instability? Now that is a proper plan. Not coordinated. The disorder is really, really important. So this is something that we established in our previous work, that if you look across the medium, some pores have a really fertile consent-wise perceptor, some you have to really prank to height. And that has a really interesting implication because there's in intermediate range, there's chaotic and Answers, chaotic and land reports coexistent. And Emily Chen is doing a lot of really, really good work characterizing what that really looks like in different types of media. So I'll leave that as a conversation you can have to learn more about it. We think this is playing a really important role. That's going to be blurred out in a lot of the fitted coverage we're using with this. A follow-up to that. So with this type of thing, how do you go about upscaling? Go about upscaling. I mean, you somehow to get characterized differently. Enough course. Yeah, exactly. So, this is, I think, Emily is actually the expert on this. She's figured out, I don't care any thoughts on this. Yeah, so in my talk, we're trying to use a pore-scale approach to link the pore-scale approach against the flow resistance, right? And so, I was looking at crushed plastic pipe, and so even more disordered than this. And what I had done was image 15 pores and confirmed. Image 15 cores and compile all those flow statistics, and we found that even that was not sufficient just because of the sheer nature of the geometrics led to such heterogeneity in the flow field. And this is something we're currently thinking about is like what is enough to capture all of this geometric disorder and how that relates to sort of the different features and disabilities. But we don't really know the answer right now. But in the ordered systems that I showed, just using Just using one unit cell was enough because the flow statistics were not very good because the geometry was identical. So a lot going. Thanks, Chris. I wanted to ask, I assume you're putting the polymers in the solutions that you're lemon injecting. Yes. So you're making them. And they're getting more viscous and and non-neutonium in nature. A non-Newtonian in nature. I was wondering, very next, but wondering if you make one Newtonian, one non-Newtonian, does there help you in any way in terms of the diffusion lengths and things like that? That's a really cool thought, especially because, yeah, you know where you mix the polymers and how easy it is to add those to your I'd assume one reagent could use right your one in your Use your one and your Utokian faster than this one. Yeah, I think that it becomes realogically very complicated because then you're also, your Polymer solution is immediately diluting itself as it moves into the medium. But you can maybe design that so that it's concentrated enough so that when it dilutes, it's still unstable. The viscosity usually is kind of fighting, right? Because the polymer is making things worse. The polymer is making things work. So, your instability actually has to make up for the increase in viscosity that it's adding. I don't have intuition if you were to say, like, if I added it to just one, if that would be better than if I added to both. And just a quick question. Since you are looking for like a a theory or an explanation for mixing and reaction, have you tried to look at the maybe the erosion of dispersion for this philosophy through it? The history of what? The Eristelo dispersion theory, the classical dispersion. Yeah, well, so that's kind of incorporated into the laminar chaotic induction. I guess I'm assuming that that dispersion isn't being changed by the non-Newtonian nature of your fluid, except through the instability. Does that answer your question? Maybe we can. Sure, okay. Yeah. That that's the tailor dispersion is kind of what's responsible for the pore scale. What's responsible for the port scale geometric mixing? Yeah, but I assume that if you have a visual elastic fluid, somehow it will have to provide. Yeah, so then you really want to parse the instability from just the maybe just the sheer, if you just had like a sheer thinning fluid, I think that makes the Taylor dispersion, I guess, I don't know. I would guess a little better if you have more wall. I think a little bit better, but I'm not sure. I mean, have you thought about simplifying your geometry, for example, having channels with undulating walls? Because all what you need is, in the first place, as I understand it at the moment, initiating the elastic programs. It's true, yeah. So it would be better for modeling. No, that's true, right? If we want to develop better models, you're right. This is kind of a more messy experimental system that is. Experimental system that is trying to near more closely with the application. But is maybe a little bit hard because you have, yeah, if we had more simple walls, you could reduce how much laminar mixing is happening. And we really just have the instability. Yeah, I'd be happy to do it. Ideas for free. Thank you very much. I will try to develop those different scales of your flow, different modes of flow. Different modes of different metals that are prevalent for example, I don't know, TCA or token of the composition to see, because you have data, so you can basically do some sort of analysis to see, for example, the pores that you have mixing, is it related to some sort of flow modes? I mean, is there something? Yeah, so the pore scale flow. Yeah, so the pore scale flow is very chaotic. It doesn't have any, you know, we haven't been able to measure any spatial or temporal scales. If you look at the power spectra, they're just power logs. But this is a really interesting idea. So we haven't looked at it yet, but I'd like to throw out a simple space for you. Maybe a snapshot file. Yes. So it's big. So I think the layout of exponent is a pretty simple metric, right? You can just plug and turn. Metric, right? You can just plug and turn. But if there's a presence of coherent structures, those play really important roles and a resource. And 2D, those play really dominant roles. So that that's it for today. Uh I think there's no particular plan tonight. I think there's no particular plan tonight. Just so for tomorrow, we'll start at, remember, we're starting at 8:30, not 9. Okay, and the idea is we'll have about an hour to wrap up. And that should be interactive. We'll prepare some notes to summarise the week, hopefully. And then hopefully those notes will be corrected. Both notes will be corrected. And I guess the other thing you know, thinking about
