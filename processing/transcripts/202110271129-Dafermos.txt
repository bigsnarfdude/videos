I certainly wish I were there. So I'll talk about the current status of the nonlinear stability problem for classical black holes in general relativity. And in particular, I'll focus on the most recent complete result, which is a theorem joint with Holzigel, Rodnyansky, and Taylor. And the reference for this result is in the archive preprint that I've written here at the title. That I have written here at the title. So, let me first give you a brief outline of what I plan to say. So, I'll begin sort of with a formulation of the full problem of non-linear stability of curve. So, it's exactly what you think it is, but it's important to say it in the right way so that we can then go on. And then I'll present in some sense what is the current status quo on this problem as far as complete rigorous mathematical proofs are concerned, which is Are concerned, which is a full proof of the non-linear stability of Schwarzschild without any symmetry assumptions. So, I'll present that, and that's essentially this paper that I just mentioned, joint with Holzigel, Rodnyansky, and Taylor. So, the proof is a little bit longish. So, in particular, I won't be able to give all the details in this talk, but I'll try to give you just a glimpse of some of the components that go into the proof so that one can understand what are the difficulties. One can understand what are the difficulties. And then finally, I'll give an outlook, and I hope in the outlook to touch on themes that in particular concern the case of cosmological constant, in particular negative cosmological constant, and in that way, at least tangentially refer to some of the themes of this very nice workshop. Okay, so off we go. Let me first sort of formulate the full problem of non-linear stability of curve, and it's very, very simple. And it's very, very simple. So, what one wants to show is simply that the Kerr family of solutions for the vacuum Einstein equation are indeed asymptotically stable in the black hole exterior region in the full sub-extremal range of parameters. Don't ask me about extremality. We'll get to that later in the outlook. So this is the open problem. Now, how do you formulate it? Well, the easiest way to formulate it as follows. Think about Kerr as arising from characteristic initial data. Characteristic initial data, initial data that are depicted here in this Penrose diagram with, let's say, one cone going off to infinity and one cone piercing the event horizon of curve. So the region of interest is completely in the domain of dependence of this sort of initial delta. And now let's imagine that we perturb ever so slightly this initial delta. So the question is the following. The arising space-times of the full non-linear Einstein-Vacum equations should have the following. Equations should have the following properties. So, first of all, they should still possess a complete future null infinity. Okay, you should still be able to attach a boundary to them, which you can call future null infinity. And moreover, the past of this future null infinity should be bounded, just like Kerr, by a regular future-complete event horizon, H plus. Okay, so this is really the statement that you still have a black hole solution. You know, you still have a black hole solution where faraway observers live forever. And if bad things happen, and they do inside the black hole, they're all protected from you by a regular future-complete event arise. Okay, so that's question one. It's the statement that this very important volitive property of the Kerr family in itself is state. So, statement two is that the metric should remain globally close to the original Kerr metric in the exterior. Okay, so you perturb the Kerr. Perturbed occur, you sort of evolve the fully nonlinear Einstein vacuum equations in this exterior that sort of one says exists, the metric should remain close to Kerr. And finally, is the statement that not only does it remain close to Kerr, but it asymptotes back to another member, a nearby member of the Kerr family, as a suitable notion of time goes to infinity. And you shouldn't, that time goes to infinity. I don't know if you can see the cursor here, but in any case, it just means that you go. Any case, it just means that you go to this top point of the penis type. So that's the problem. And if you want to give sort of nice names to some of these statements, so the first statement is actually, you can think about it as a statement that weak cosmic censorship holds in the neighborhood of Kerr. So one way to formulate, in fact, weak cosmic censorship is in terms of the completeness of future null infinity. This is actually a formulation that originally goes back to Geroch and To Geroch and Horowitz. So, of course, that's conjectured to be true, not just for data arising from sort of close-to-Kerr data, but generically in moduli space. Well, good luck proving that. That will take many, many years, I suspect. But this would be the statement that that's true, at least in the neighborhood of Kerr. Statement two is the statement of orbital stability of Kerr in the language of dynamical systems. And statement three, finally, is the statement of asymptotic. And three finally is the statement of asymptotics that we've got. Okay, so you might think that it's a little bit greedy to ask for all of these statements at the same time. You know, we would be more than happy, for instance, if we could just prove statement one. It would already be a highly interesting, non-trivial statement saying some sort of stability for macros. But it turns out that the reason that I'm writing all these statements at the same time is not because I'm being greedy. It's because you have to prove them all at the same time if you have any hope. Time, if you have any hope of giving any. And this goes to sort of very general sort of technological constraints in the mathematics of nonlinear wave equations of the type of nonlinearities of the Einstein equations. And the only way that we really know how to prove nonlinear stability is to prove strong quantitative decay towards the thing to which you approach. If you don't know how to prove, You approach. If you don't know how to prove that, then we don't know how to prove any sort of stability statement. So, these three statements really come as a package. And in some sense, the thing you have to understand very, very well in order to prove this is the linear stability of the final state. And somehow, in we sort of non-linear analysts, we're very good in taking linear stability of the final state. Of the final state statements and turning them into full non-linear stability proofs, sort of, you know, for the full Einstein equations. Okay, so that's the problem. So let me go to the current status quo, which is the full nonlinear stability of Schwarzschild. So what is the statement? Well, basically, the statement is that everything I just said in the open problem about Kerr is indeed. Problem about Kerr is indeed true for Schwarzschild. That's to say, the Schwarzschild family is asymptotically stable in the black hole exterior. Except that, sort of, if you're paying attention, you'll already say, well, wait a minute, how can the Schwarzschild family be asymptotically stable? Because, well, in particular, I can perturb into the Kerr family. These are stationary solutions. They are not going to asymptote back to Schwarzschild. They will, well, they're stationary. So they'll stay put. So, how can the So, how can the Schwarzschild family be asymptotically stable? And the actual statement of the theorem is that the Schwarzschild family is asymptotically stable exactly modulo that phenomena. So, what does that mean? That means that it's asymptotically stable for the full expected set of perturbations. And what is that set? Well, the statement is the following, that in moduli space of initial data, so again, think of Schwarzschild as arising from this characteristic initial data. So, in this infinite. Data. So, in this infinite-dimensional moduli space of all vacuum-initial data near Schwarzschild, there's a codimension three sub-manifold of vacuum-initial data sets containing Schwarzschild, and such that for all initial data on this codimension three sub-manifold, everything we said previously holds, but for Schwarzschild in place of Kerr. That's to say, the arising solutions arising from this data, they possess a complete future null infinity. They possess a complete future non-infinity, whose past is bounded by a complete regular event horizon. They remain globally close to the Schwarzschild metric in its exterior, and they asymptote back to another member of the Schwarzschild family as a suitable notion of time goes to infinity. So let me make some very basic remarks. So, why codimension three? Well, this already comes from linear theory. So, in linear theory, you can really think of the Schwarzschild family as a Family as a co-dimension three subfamily of the larger Kerr family. And it's co-dimension three, not one, because you also have to take into account of the direction of the Kerr axes. And in view of that relation, it turns out that this theorem is really an if and only if. That is to say, if your initial data do not lie on this codimension three submanifold, then Submanifold, then your space-time will not approach Schwarzschild asymptotically. So, this is really a complete characterization of the perturbations of Schwarzschild, which are asymptotically stable in the full non-linear theory. So, the other comment that I want to make is that this codimension three sub-manifold is teleologically defined. And we're going to hear this word again. Defined. And we're going to hear this word again talk. What does that mean? So, in general, for sort of general initial data close to Schwarzschild, there is no way to know whether you're going to asymptote to Schwarzschild other than evolving the Einstein equations and seeing. Okay, so there's no way to read off explicitly the delta whether you're going to evolve to Schwarzenegger. And this is one of the difficulties of this problem, because, well, Problem because, well, you know, there's no characterization a priori of this codimension three-subman, but you have to construct it along with a proof, and you have to construct it, and we'll get back to this later, by evolving all nearby initial data in time for a sufficiently long time. So that's one issue. So you might think that, well, this makes this problem a lot harder. What's the gain? Why is this theorem easier? Well, this theorem is easier because, as I said, Well, this theorem is easier because, as I said, the main tool to show non-linear stability is to have good linear stability results around the final state. And because in this theorem, the final state is always Schwarzschild, what you need is linear stability around Schwarzschild and not more generally around curve. And at a technical level, linear stability around Schwarzschild is slightly easier. So that's sort of the origin for this statement. Origin for this statement. So that's the theorem. And again, if you want to use these sort of evocative labels, you can think of the first statement as the statement that weak cosmic censorship holds in a neighborhood of Schwarzschild. The second statement as being the orbital stability of Schwarzschild. And the third statement, the asymptotic stability of Schwarzschild, all, of course, with the, you know, for the class of initial data considered, which, as I said, is a necessary condition. Is a necessary condition for truth. Okay, so that's the theory. So, before saying anything else, let me immediately put it into context of previous non-linear works. So, as I already mentioned, the main difficulty in some sense in these theories, in these theorems are linear. And we'll talk about linear theory later on. But for now, let me just talk about previous non-linear works and I'll give more. Works. And I'll give more references, of course, to previous work later. So, actually, the only non-linear stability result in the asymptotically flat world for the Einstein vacuum equations without any symmetry previously known is the non-linear stability of the trivial solution of Minkowski space. And the proof of this first appeared in the iconic book that you see on the slide, written by Christozulu and Kleinerman. And there have been many subsequent developments, in particular, a later approved by Lindbergh-Britansky. Later proved by Lindbergh-Britansky and contributions by many people. So that's really the only previous regime where there was a full non-linear stability result without symmetry for asymptotically flat solutions, the Einstein-Back equations. Okay, so what about in the black hole context? Well, all previous work in the black hole context was actually restricted to symmetry class. And while the first type of results which were proven were under spherical symmetry, and of course, we all know due to Birkhoff's theory. Symmetry. And of course, we all know due to Birkhoff's theorem that if you want to study general relativity under spherical symmetry, like it or not, you have to add matter. And so the first sort of non-linear stability black holes concerned the Einstein scalar field system under spherical symmetry and are due actually to Salzulu. And there were some later sort of improvements by myself and Lutnyask from a long time ago. And of course, in spherical symmetry, you can In spherical symmetry, you can hope to do much more than just the non-linear black holes. In fact, these results sort of were proved as part of the much more general proof of due to Christothulu of the weak and strong cosmic censorship conjectures for that model. Okay, so there is something that you can do for vacuum under something like spherical signetry if you're willing to go up one dimension. And so, in the vacuum case, the first nonlinear stability results. Uh, result for a black hole is actually due to Holtzigl in his PhD thesis, where he showed the non-linear stability of the five-dimensional Schwarzschild solution under what's known as Yankee-9 symmetry. Okay, so these two examples have the sort of commonality that they both reduce, analytically speaking, to a one-plus one-dimensional system. A more difficult problem is still under symmetry, proving nonlinear stability in regimes where the equations do not. In regimes where the equations do not reduce to something one plus one. And the first such result is a much more recent result of Kleinerman and Scheftel, where they considered polarized axisymmetry. So again, polarized axisymmetry, this in particular kills the current solution, but in any case, it's a symmetry assumption, which you can study this problem. And the equations, if you want, they reduce. The equations, if you want, they reduce to something which is 2 plus 1. Okay, so there is this previous work. And actually, this work depends on some of the linear theory that I developed with Rodnyansky and Holzigel, which I'll talk about later. And finally, I should say that I've restricted my discussion to the asymptotically flood world, but actually there are also analogs of these problems if you add a positive cosmological constant to the Anschl equations. Now, in general, these problems in particular, they're not. These problems, in particular, their nonlinear aspects become much simpler, although they still are certainly not easy. And in particular, the nonlinear stability of the Sidder space was proven back in 1986 by Friedrich before the non-linear stability of Minkowski space. And back in 2016, there's a very beautiful work of Hinz and Balsi, who proved the non-linear stability for very slowly rotating curtains. So these are some previous results for context. Okay. Context. Okay, so with all that, maybe I'll try to give you some of the components of the proof to give you a flavor of what goes into this type of analysis. So what are the components of the proof? Well, the first thing you have to do in order to prove something about the value-Einstein equations, just like the first thing you have to do if you want to evolve the equations on the computer, is you have to choose a gauge. Okay? And actually, there are many. And actually, there are many sorts of requirements that go into a gauge for the gauge to be good. So, we all know that the equation should be well posed in that gauge. If you don't have well-posedness in your gauge, that's certainly very bad. But it turns out that if you're studying a stability problem, it's not enough for your gauge to be well posed. You also want your gauge somehow to respect, you know, you want your gauge to respect the stability aspects. Because you can imagine a problem in which you have. In which you have stability in some geometric sense, but if you write the wrong gauge, you don't see the stability in your gauge. And it turns out that there are linear and non-linear aspects to why a gauge is good from this point of view. And it's important to keep both in mind. Okay, so with that being said, what is our gauge? Well, it turns out that the gauge we decided to use for this problem is sort of good old trusted. Good old trusted gauge, namely the gauge of double normal coordinates. And this has been used actually in many instances in the non-linear analysis of the Einstein vacuum equations by various people, starting from Stotlu. So what does it mean, double mal gauge? Well, it's very simple. So how do you construct a double mal gauge, at least locally? Well, the first thing you do is you choose a sphere in your space-time. I just chose one. It's on the slide. It's on the slide, and then you look at the future of that sphere. And we all know the future of the sphere is bounded by two null columns. So I've just drawn them there. Okay, locally, at least. So now, so I've already made one choice. I've chosen that sphere, but now I'm going to make another choice. I'm going to foliate, let's say, the, let's call it the outgoing Melcone by spheres. Okay? So I've just made a lot of more choices by choosing how to follow this by spheres. Foliate these by spheres. Of course, once I foliate these by spheres, I can also look at the future of all of these spheres. Okay, so that, if you want, introduces another family of null cones. Let's call them ingoing blue null cones emanating from these spheres. And now finally, I can do the same thing with one of these ingoing null spheres. That's to say, I can choose, let's say, this original ingoing blue null cone, foliate that by these red spheres, and now look at the future of these red spheres. And I'll look at the future of these red spheres. And this gives me a family of outgoing null cones. So, in summary, I have two families of null cones, null cones that I can call ingoing and outgoing, which intersect on spheres. And using a double null gauge, so it's very easy now to sort of construct a preferred system of coordinates such that the level sets of the coordinates are, two of the coordinates are the Of two of the coordinates are these null surfaces, and they are sort of complemented by angular coordinates, which are defined in some geometric way by Lie transport. So basically, writing the English equations in double null gauge means writing the English equations in these coordinates. And in fact, introducing sort of a frame normalized to these coordinates and then decomposing the sort of what we often call the spin coefficient. So if you want the second fundamental. So, if you want the second fundamental form of these sort of foliations thought of as submanifolds and the curvature tensor with respect to this sort of canonical frame, you know, decomposing them like this and writing those equations down. So that's basically the system. I'm not going to write it down, but that's basically sort of the system. And I claim that this is a sort of a way to view the Einstein equations as a well-product system, which is good. Okay, so and we'll come back. And we'll come back to why it's good in just a second. So, that's the choice of gauge. Okay, so the second extremely important component of the proof, in some sense, the most important component of the proof is knowing how to show linear stability of your solution in the gauge that you chose. So, in our case, in this double-null gauge. And moreover, it's not enough to show linear stability. And moreover, it's not enough to show linear stability per se. You really need a sort of a quantitative version of linear stability where you have sufficient decay in time. Because when you go to the nonlinear problem, you know, the way you deal with the non-linearities is you hope that you can deal with them, deal with them as error terms, and you'd like to integrate them in time, and they still have to be small. Okay, so essentially, this was a big stumbling block in the mathematical theory of this subject for many years, how to understand linear statistics. How to understand linear stability in the true sense, okay, not just mode stability. So, some of these issues were actually mentioned in Elena's talk earlier today. So, how to understand not just mode stability, but actual true linear stability. And the first proof of linear stability of Schwarzschild was obtained in previous joint work of myself with Holzigel and Rodnyansky. Actually, this first appeared in 2016. And it's contained in this paper that was published a few years later. And well, I'll tell you now what goes into this paper, because in some sense, these are the at the physical level, these are the most important issues for the problem at hand. But before that, maybe I'll immediately tell you a little bit about the post-history of this linear stability problem. So subsequently, there were further generalizations of this linear stability analysis around Schwarzschild. So first to the slowly rotating curve. First, to the slowly rotating Kerr case, when the rotation parameters are much smaller than the mass. So, this is due to myself, Holtzkl and Rodnyansky, and also independently Ma. And then there were further extensions of that by various people. There's the work on the charged case, so stability in the context of the angle-Maxwell system by Georgi, which we heard about this morning. And finally, the sort of most difficult aspect of this linear stability analysis. This linear stability analysis has been generalized to the full sub-extreme local case by Schlappento-Rothman and Teshire Dakoshta. And I'll sort of mention this later in the talk when I talk about the outlook. So, okay, so what goes into this linear stability problem? What are the sort of difficulties? So the first difficulty is to show quantitative decay for gauge invariant quantities. And everyone knows that sort of you can parameterize fully in the full Kerr case, in fact. Fully in the full Kerr case, in fact, the gauge invariant quantities by the so-called Tukowski equation. So, the first step is actually just showing quantitative decay properties for Tukowski. And this turned out to be very tricky. And in fact, this was a big stumbling block in the theory, how to understand this. But it turns out that this could be understood by exploiting a physical space version of transformation theory that actually goes back to Chandra Sakari in the sort of frequency picture, and combining that with a lot of progress. That with a lot of progress that had happened in the mathematics community for understanding just the scalar wave equation on black hole exteriors, and many people have contributed to that problem over the years, including, well, the problem actually goes back to, in sort of in physical space, to a very beautiful paper of Bob Wald from the 70s and Kayen Wald, and many people since. And perhaps the final result, which is pertinent to this, is a theorem of myself and Rodneyan's. Is a theorem of myself and Rodnansky Schleppett a lot. Okay, so that's the first thing, but of course, it's not enough to understand the gauge invariant quantities because you have to show stability in the gauge. And this is the first nice thing about double-null gauge, in that double-null gauge suggests a hierarchical approach to understanding the gauge-dependent quantities from the gauge-invariant quantities. Okay, and it turns out that if you order the quantities, the gauge-dependent quantities, The gauge-dependent quantities in double-mell gauge accordingly, one by one, you can estimate them starting from estimates for the gauge invariant quantities. Okay, so that's one very important aspect of double-null gauge. And there's one other aspect of this problem that I want to emphasize because it's already a linear aspect. So, in things, geometric gauges like double-mell gauge, if you want to have stability, then you You want to have stability, then you have to normalize the gauge teleologically. So, what do I mean by that? Let's go back to this picture. So, here in this picture, you remember that there's a lot of freedom in defining a double null gauge. There isn't a unique double null gauge, let's say, in Schwarzschild or in Kerr. There are many, and there are many because you can make many different initial choices. You can choose different sphere. Initially, you can foliate your sphere, your future of your sphere. Your future of your sphere by spheres initially in different ways, etc. Okay. So, a very important thing to keep in mind with these sort of geometric gauges, which are defined by transport equations, is the following. If you pick this sphere here, this black sphere that I've drawn, okay, then somehow generically, this red sphere, this later sphere, is going to look like I've drawn it. Okay, it's going to be deformed. To be deformed, even if my space-time indeed asymptotes to something very, very nice, this red sphere is not going to asymptote to a nice sphere. And the reason is very simple, that there's memory. So because there was some radiation that went out, even if things eventually settled down to something nice, this red sphere is not working. So what that means is if you're trying to show even linear stability in something like double male gauge, you will not. Something like double null gauge, you will not see stability of the gauge-dependent quantities if you start with a sphere here. So, how do you deal with this issue? Well, you have to turn this picture on its head. That's to say, instead of first choosing a sphere here and then foliating, choosing a foliation of the future and a foliation of the past, you do everything starting from some later sphere. You choose this sphere to be good, you look at the past null cons. Past null cones, and you foliate them to be good. So, this is what's called teleological normalization of the gauge. And it's the, you know, these geometric gauges are great, but if you want to show stability in them, you need to teleologically normalize them. And so it comes with a territory. So these are the sort of linear difficulties. So once you have a good linear stability, then you can work in earnest on the non-linear stability problem. Non-linear stability problem, and it's by no means trivial, by no means to pass from linear stability to non-linear stability. There's some serious purely non-linear difficulties. So, what are they? So, one of them is, well, you know, the non-linear problem has nonlinearities. And in some sense, there are good and bad nonlinearities. You see, we forget how lucky we are with the Einstein vacuum equations. If you write the generic sort of system of nonlinear wave equations with quadratic nonlinearity, Equations with quadratic nonlinearities in first derivatives. So, this is sort of if you write the Angstian equations in coordinates, that's exactly what they look like. Then, the generic such equation will not satisfy even nonlinear stability of the trivial solution. So the reason that you do have nonlinear stability for the Einstein equations is that the nonlinearities present are secretly much better than they first seem. And see, one of the other aspects of choosing a gauge. Of the other aspects of choosing a gauge and the importance of choosing the right gauge is that you have to see that good property in the gauge. And in fact, one of the difficulties, let's say, with studying this problem in harmonic gauge, which might be the most obvious gauge to use, is that it's hard to see why the nonlinearity is a good. So a second advantage of double mal gauge, besides just the fact that at the linear level, it allows you to unravel the system so nicely, is that at the non-linear level, it allows you to. That at the nonlinear level, it allows you to see that indeed the nonlinearities are good. So, of course, the second difficulty is that at the nonlinear level, the final curve parameters that you expect to approach to are, again, teleologically determined, just like the gauge has to be teleologically determined. And of course, in our theorem, because we're actually trying to find specifically those initial data that Asim told to Schwarzschild. That as I'm told to Schwarzschild, then the you know the very stable manifold we're trying to construct it is also teleologically determined. This is the point that I made earlier. And finally, in doing this in a non-linear setting, you know, in the linear setting, you know that the solution of the linear equations exists globally for all time. You know it just by linearity. In the nonlinear setting, of course, you don't even know that the solution exists. This is sort of the first statement, after all. You don't know that. The first statement, after all, you don't know that future null infinity is complete until you've proven everything. So, at any given time, you actually have to work on a slab of space-time and sort of do things on a slab and then argue by some sort of method of continuity that you can keep on increasing the slab and show at the same time global existence, the completeness of future null infinity, and the sort of orbital and isymptotic stability states. Orbital and asymptotic stability states. So, to do this, you have to argue by continuity. And it's very important that all your constructions that you make are continuous. Okay, and this is actually a sort of technically true. Okay, so these are in some sense the non-legal. Okay, so let me just mention very, very briefly one corollary. So, as I said, the full stable manifold, which is codimension three in modulus. Which is codimension three in moduli space is only teleologically determined. But it would be nice to know that there are certain initial data sets that you can identify just looking at initial data that lie on that stable map field. And we all know that there must be such things because we all know that, let's say your initial data is axisymmetric, and let's say that the Comer angular momentum is initially zero. We know that under axis symmetry, the Comer angular momentum is a momentum. Under axisymmetry, the comer angular momentum is conserved. So, the only thing that such an initial data set could asymptote to, if indeed you have stability, is Schwartz. And so, we indeed show as a corollary that all such initial data sets, they lie on our stable manifold. So, in particular, one has stability within axisymmetry with vanishing Commer angular model. And actually, the set of perturbations considered in that recent work of. Perturbations considered in that recent work of Kleiner and Shifteau, which I mentioned. Well, there are a further infinite codimension subset of the axisymmetric initial data with vanishing comma angular momentum because they are also assumed to be polarized. So that's just a little curl. Okay, so let me end the talk by discussing a little bit the outlook. So remember, this was the full problem of non-linear stability of the current. Non-linear stability of the Kerr exterior, as I sort of began with in the talk. So it's natural to first think about the very slowly rotating case. And in fact, as I mentioned briefly, the linear theory for understanding the very slowly rotating case has been unlocked in actually two independent papers. So one by myself and Holzego Rodniansky, and another by Ma. So based on this, it's very reasonable. It's very reasonable to try to now tackle the full nonlinear stability problem in this very, very slow developing case. In fact, there are several groups who are trying to write up such a proof. There's work in progress on this problem. In particular, there's some recent and upcoming work of Kleinermann Schiftel, Keinemann Schaftel, Georgie Shen, and also work by other people. Okay, so that's one thing, but in some sense, why stop at very slowly rotating case? But very slowly rotating case. Actually, the linear theory in the full sub-eximal case has been unlocked in this even more recent paper that I mentioned of Shlapento-Rothman and Teshereta Koshn, where they understood the boundedness and decay properties for the Tsukowski equation in the full sub-extremal range. So their paper has the frequency space analysis, and they have an upcoming follow-up, which will have the full physical space analysis. So in view of this, one can really hope. So in view of this, one can really hope for a resolution to the full non-linear problem in the full sub-extremal case in the near future. So it's very challenging, of course, to write down a full proof. There are many sort of technical issues that occur on the way, but it's reasonable to expect that such a theorem is now accessible. But looking further in the future, one of the most interesting directions is to understand the extremal case. Understand the extremal case. And one of the reasons is that the extremal case is not only a problem of stability, because it's actually subject also to instabilities, in particular to the Araticis instability on the event horizon and also other more mysterious instability properties. So nonetheless, one may still be able to show stability away from the event horizon, provided one understands appropriate null structure along the event horizon. Batteries. And well, there's some interesting work on a model problem related to this by Angeloblos Aretaitis Geig. It's actually some numerical work in spherical symmetry by Harvey Real and his collaborators. And we make a conjecture in the paper, in the main reference of this talk, so conjecture 4.2, about this problem. And somehow our setup is, I think, suitable for trying to. I think it is suitable for trying to look at this problem exactly because, of course, anytime you want to talk about extremal black holes and their stability, etc., that is by its very nature a co-dimension, a finite co-dimensional result. Because, of course, generically, when you perturb, you perturb away from extremality. So what one's interested in this problem is the finite co-dimension set of perturbations for which you remain extremal. So what happens to them? So that's sort of the question. I think this is a very interesting question. A very interesting question. And of course, this may be a window on the modulo space of the Einstein equations where interesting things happen. Okay, so let me finally talk a little bit about the cosmological constant. So of course, you can add a positive cosmological constant to the Ancient equations. And I already mentioned this beautiful result of Instagram, where they showed that in the very slowly rotating Kurt-Sitter case, you have non-linear stability of the region between the event and the cosmological horizon. Horizon. Actually, remarkably, if you drop the assumption of being very slowly rotating, you look at general sub-extreme occurred to sitter black holes, even the mode stability is an open problem. And to my knowledge, it hasn't even been systematically sort of looked at numerically. So it would be very interesting to understand. But in some sense, I think the most interesting problem of them all, and the problem where you have potentially the most surprises, is to look at The most surprises is to look at the negative cosmological constant case. And very, very briefly, the reason why this problem may be very, very interesting at the non-linear setting is precisely because of the slow decay in linear theory. So it's a theorem due to Holzigel and Zmilevici from several years back now, that if you look at just the linear wave equation on current anti-desider in the exterior region, of course, you now have to put boundary conditions at infinity. So if you put maybe the simplest case of boundary conditions, namely reflected boundary conditions, then what they showed is that general Then, what they showed is that general solutions of the wave equation, although they do decay in the exterior, they only decay inverse logarithmically in time. And this is a sharp, the generic solution will only decay rapidly. So that in some sense is very bad news for nonlinear stability, because the only way we know how to prove nonlinear stability results is by integrating in time the error terms. And if the error terms are only decaying inverse logarithmically in time, then it's almost as if they're not even decaying. Almost as if they're not even decaying. So, on the basis of that, you know, very naive, I agree, sort of thought, Holtz-Golden's Mulavici have conjectured that actually the Kerr anti-desider family is non-linearly unstable with reflective boundary conditions. So all current anti-desider zones, starting with Schwarzenegger case. And this can be compared with the recent theorem of Jorgos Moshevis, who showed that pure ADS space-time is non-linearly unstable, at least as a solution to various Einstein-Mother systems. Into various Einstein-Mother systems, which allow you to study this problem under spherical symmetry. So, of course, in the pure ADS case, it's even worse because your perturbations are completely confined. There's no decay in linear theory. The black hole case is subtle exactly because there is some decay. There is this logarithmic decay. So, is the logarithmic decay enough to sort of ensure nonlinear stability? That's very much opaque. That's very much open. If it is, then this would have to depend on a type of mathematical analysis which would be very, very new. So, this is certainly an interesting problem to study, both mathematically but also heuristically. All right, so let me end there. Thank you very much. Any questions? Yeah, hi, I'm Alice. Let me ask a question. Yeah, hi, I'm Alice. Let me ask a question. In your double null coordinates, do you have to worry about caustics or are they taken care of by this teleological so in general you would and that's to say so certainly in a general space-time you know you start you double null gauge will break down exactly because of calculus now of course the the premise in in sort of when proving stability is because you hope at the end of the day to show that things are stable so you The end of the day to show that things are stable, so you hope that things remain close to what you were perturbing. So, in particular, you better not form caustics. Okay, of course, you only know that you don't form caustics when you've proven the whole theorem. And indeed, you're right that somehow if you don't teleologically normalize, then you may very well form caustics in future evolution. So, that could very well be the case. That could very well be the case. Even though somehow you are, you know, your geometric space-time is close, okay, if you define the double-null gauge in the wrong way, then you could certainly still form calculus in principle. Thank you. Toby, go ahead. Yeah, I mean, I was just wondering in the ADS case. I mean, I was just wondering in the ADS case whether you might expect very large black holes to be stable. Well, at this level, there's no way of distinguishing that at this sort of heuristic level. So people, I mean, I should say that, I mean, since Gary Horowitz is here in the audience, I mean, he has actually thought about this problem much more than I have at the heuristic level. And so, you know, I think there's certainly insight. I think there's certainly insight to derive from that. But sort of at this naive level, I mean, if you believe, I mean, okay, this is the conjecture of a pessimist. Okay, it is the conjecture of a pessimist. This is the conjecture that says that, okay, if there is not, you know, a definitive stability via decay mechanism, then eventually, at some very long time scale, things will be unstable. And okay. I suppose I just mean as you make the black hole bigger, somehow the mechanism for dissipation becomes greater. So you might hope. I don't know. Yeah, it's not clear. Yeah. I mean, the intuition I have is these very slowly decaying modes are ones with high angular momentum, right? And they have a big potential barrier. And so, in some sense, there can be Barrier. And so, in some sense, they're confined out in the asymptotic region. So, I don't see why a big black hole would, you know, avoid that. You would still worry about forming small black holes, you know, far from your black hole because of this nonlinear instability. But anyway, I mean, okay, I mean, same from the point of view of just a practitioner of. Of view of just a practitioner of non-linear wave equations as well as a relativist, so my sort of twin hats. But just this is actually a very interesting problem from the point of view of mathematics, exactly because it really teases our methods in that in the theory of nonlinear wave equations of the type of the Einstein equations, so that these in technical language, which these In technical language, which is sort of what we call quasi-linear supercritical equations. We really, the only way we know how to do anything is when you have polynomial decay at least some rate. And there could be interesting structure here that you just don't see like that. You have to see in frequency space, you have to see in other ways. And it's very hard to use that even if it's there. So anyway, I really think that this is a So anyway, I really think that this is a direction where there'll be new mathematics to learn here, which will be necessary to understand. And if you know, if you believe in instability and you want to actually show that it has happened, then I really recommend looking at these papers, the papers of Moschidis. It's complicated to show. I mean, to actually design initial data such that in the full nonlinear theory, you Theory, you can show instability, you know, which is a non-linear fact, which is not instability because of sort of this phenomenon. It's very, very tricky. So anyway, so I think it's a very exciting direction for all of us. Any other questions? If not, let's thank Malice again. Thanks a lot.
