is going to give us the second lecture this workshop and going to speak on brand branding problems away from Z and Legments from Saudi Arabia thank you thank you again for invitation it's excellent experience to to be in this workshop thank you talk so okay the first page it was the same as the last The same as the last time. So it explains the branching problem, multiplicity, structures, and this. Okay, it's fine. So today we'll focus on the situation that The situation that we try to control this big representation, the representation from a big group by some kind of information from away from set, and so that the branch problem reduces learn the functionality. Okay, so that's that's the different nature. Yeah, so most of the talk was about, you know, giving G. About, you know, given G, H, the geometry structure analysis, but the limitation you didn't put much restriction. Okay, so that so that's the situation here. Okay, so briefly view this automorphic. Yeah, you have two groups and then you take automorphic form and then you take the period. Yeah. Because the period. Yeah, so yeah, so for such an integral, if we now the this function are caspido, then this integral may not convergence, so you have to localize it otherwise. Fine. So in the automorphic theory, we have to characterize Automorphic theory, we have to characterize the non-vanishing. This is typically like a Gangrouse Plus conjecture. And if you put the wavefront set information for wavefront set, and then we want to understand the spectral sigma, right? So that's the point is there is some information about Lana's functority. About lands functionality will be included here. Okay, so briefly review that the variable C-time correspondence is one of these typical examples have been studied for a long time and by many people and very productive. So, you have two vector spaces: the one is orthogonal type and one is symplatic, and then you take it. On one symplotic, and then you take a tensor, which is a big, bigger sympathy space, and so you have the commuting pairs, one is orthogonal group and one symplatic group and contained in the symplatic group. And you consider this SETA function. Yeah, this is like a Schwartz Schwartz functions, and then you consider the Can see the theta function. The theta function is automorphic, but in general, is in the double colour of the symplatic group. Okay. And then we can see the how duality between the spectrum is also going to go beyond this sympathetic group. If If this big period norm varies. Yeah. So basically, you have a big group SETA function and restrict to the reductive pair subgroup. And then you pick up two automorphic forms on the subgroup and then integrate it. So this is like a trilinear period, right? Trilinear period, right? Like this. But since this situ function has minimum Galvan grave dimension, or you call the win-front set, right? Here the condition of Wi-Fran set comes in. So Winfront set of the sigma function is the closed, right? So the minimum orbit, and then you have boundary zero, gets in. Yeah, this is. Yeah, this is the smallest that you can get. Okay, because of this, so that you expect this the branching decomposition has a nice spectral information. Yeah. Okay. So the question is how do you understand this spectral occurs in this correspondence? And so Whatsabaji was the first. Uh, was the first one and used the repentation theory approach to study the classical Schimola correspondence, which is like a SO3 and SO2 covering group. And Steve Lawrence tried to understand the local sataki parameter, the structure of local sataki parameter for these spectrums. But it turned out that which It turned out, which, yeah, it was discovered by Steve that it looks closely to Lannis Vantality, but it's not exactly the same. Yeah. And then later on, Jeff Adam come up with the conjecture that actually matches the other plummet instead of Lanan's plummet. So this is why they say, okay, it is actually related to so-called other Lananda transfer. Called the other Lanz transfer instead of Lananth transfer. Okay. And these things happen quite sort of in general situation. Not just this classical CETA corresponding looks like this. If you replace the CETA function by other minimum, if you go to E8, right? So you have minimum automorphic minimum representation looks like a seta, so-called the exceptional. So-called the exceptional theta correspondence, and the same kind of phenomena work. So, in other words, Adams' conjecture not only holds for the classical settlement, but also for exceptional settlements. Yeah, it turns out the general situation. So, this means the other parameter is a better way to describe this spectrum. Spectrum. So, okay, let's look at this what Arthur did. So, this is like a dispersed spectrum in my first lecture. We explained it. And then, according to the author, this space can be decomposed as the direct sum, which, like Haber sum, which is parametrized by so-called asset parameters. Metalized by so-called other parameter. I will explain this. And for each other parameter, you have a packet. And then you sum up the packet. And the multiplicity for each packet is the same. So you have multiplicity goes like this. And for classical groups, the multiplicity is either one or two. Yeah. So according to the Gavin Pietsky Shapilu theorem, you know, the class. Theorem, you know, the classical theorem, this multiplicity is finite. Okay. But here is more specific for quasi-split. Yeah, actually, this is a quasi-split classical group. As I point out in the first lecture, that if the general classical group Gen Z Lee has an example, you can have higher multiplicity. But for quasi-spread is one or two. One or two. And now this diagram shows us the endoscopic theory and other parametrization and Langlands functority. Okay, so gives you the oscillator parameter, but I haven't told you what the other parameter is, okay, but just the picture. And so from this endoscopic classification, for this parameter, you construct the packet. Yeah, so this is the asset. Yeah, so this is the asset packet. This is, you know, by asset choice formula. And then this is from classical group packet transfer to GL. But in the GL, the packet you expect is like one guy, so it's automorphic. How do you get this automorphic guy? Get this automorphic guy for the prophecy. This is by the Lannand serial Isentan series. Yeah, so this is the Lannance serial Eisenhower series gives you automorphic realization of RC parameter in GL, which is transferred from the RC pocket with this parameter. So that's the committing diagram for this endoscopy theory. Okay, now let's see what is Now let's see what this oscillator parameter looks like. Yeah, so I explain here for other orthogonal group, but you can do similar things for unitary group, sympathetic group, and so on. Okay, so for other orthogonal groups, the dual group is sp2n. Okay, so in other words, these will be synchronized. So, in other words, this will be symplicated type. And so, the other parameter can be written as a formal sum. But the meaning of this will be the automorphicalization of this formal sum will be the isometric series. So each guy will be like tau i b b i. Okay, tau is the class form of gla and b is the integer. Okay, so these So, these for this, these are called the simple assembly. So, this simple other parameter will be realized as residual or isenthyl series induced around the equal block. You know, this will be, this guy will correspond to automorphic form of GLAI times BI. And so the level you have GOA, GOA, GOA, B blocks. DOA, DOA, B blocks. And you put there each tau i, it's the same tau i, and then you introduce a parameter so that this will be like a generalized Chipei residual, like the Shibei representation. Okay. So this is, so in other words, the other parameter, this simple parameter corresponds to the Shipe residual representation, and the general parameter will be the full induce of the Shipp√©. Full in use of the Chippe blocks. That's the roughly it looks like the automorphic form on GL corresponding to such a formal plumbing. Okay. Of course, in order to make this simple block to be symplicated type, so you have the parity conditions. Okay, so they are different kind. And so there's a certain parody. And so there's a certain parody condition I will explain later on. Each guy will be symptomatic type for smaller guy. And then the endoscopy transfer will be things like this. Each block has this representation, like Shube type. And then you put together a transfer to this. That's the endoscopic transfer. Okay, but this picture works for all classic groups, which now. Group, which now you know by other choice formula. Okay, so now let's look at a little bit further about the simple type. And so you have this other parameter, like one block, simple block, and then the rest. But this simple block will be like, so this guy is a symplatic type. So this will be the remaining dimension. So if A is even. So if A is even, and then tau should be symplicated type, and B should be odd number. If tau is orthogonal type, and then B is even, they are checked. Okay. And then the endoscopy looks like this. Okay. The similar things for the other case. Yeah, for all other classical. The oscillatory group, other classic group look the same, and now we are talking proposed this conjecture, which is Ginsburg and me proposed a long time ago. Yeah, I think in my paper in 2014 in Pietette's Hapilo Memorial volume, it's a long paper, explains this conjecture. So we want So we want to make the endoscopy transfer by related to this branching problem, right? You have the integrals like this. Okay, the point is we want to find a kernel function, looks like a theta. But this theta, there is possibility there, right? The classical theta is no cost, like the London problem. The Land parameter also parameter was that the classical way repenting is attached to GO1. Yeah, so it's like a unipotent repentance, right? It's like this. But these guys will be no longer unipotent, but still relatively smaller graph and kill of dimension. Yeah, so in other words, the wavefront set, you have certain property. Property you construct this so I will tell you how to construct it in a one plot situation. So if you construct such a kernel function and then you put two cos forms, so if this is the integral norm vanishing and then these two guys will be the endoscopic correspondence. Yeah, so just like if the kernel is like a classical theta, this will be the theta correspondence. This will be the set of correspondence. This the relation will be the Adam conjecture, right? So this is like a generalization of that. Okay, so this means that because the integral, you can, because it's a double integration, you can do one variable at a time. So you get the endoscopy translifting or endoscopy descent, meaning that you start with the small group because the bigger it will be lifting on the front. Bigger it will be lifting, or the from bigger to the small will be descend. Okay, so in other words, this will match its extension of Adam's conjecture. Okay, so how do you construct this kernel? Okay, so we have to the in you know, a sort of a kind of automorphic wingfront set, yeah. So, but uh, in this So, but in this sense, this size of automorphic form described by Free coefficient, like a unipotent integration, like this, or degenerative Wittak models. And so that we have to introduce this. So you consider this the new potent orbit. Yeah. And then classically, this is a stable orbit or parametrized by combinatolic. Or parameterized by combinatoric data, right? Balakata data or these tableaus or partitions with certain actual like comm is 2D. You parametrize the larger orbit. Okay, so now you start with one unipotent. You introduce this SO2 triple and then the And then under the adjoint action, this Lie algebra will decompose the eigenspace, like this. And you choose like a unipotent parabolic type. And this is the levy part. Okay. And then you get the Lie group, the algebra group with the Lie algebra. And this will be the parabolic subgroup. Okay. And you can show that this parabolic subject. And you can show that this parabolic subgroup depends on this orbit instead of X after conjugation. And you start to pick up this, you know, the eigen up to two. Yeah, at least two. Yeah. So this will be the unipotent subgroup. But we can introduce you the killing form, introduce this character attached to it. Okay. And once you have. Okay, and once you have this, yeah, so this is like if this is g1, this negative one or one is zero, sometimes you call the orbit even. And then the uniform subgroup will adjust this guy. And you get the automorphic character attached, and you introduce the Fourier coefficient like this. Coefficient like this. Okay. But yeah, so you can check this integral. Okay, you get a stabilizer. This integral will give you automorphic form on the stabilizer. And now if this other part is non-zero, and then this will be your Heisenberg structure, and so you have introduced a free hydrocophic coefficient. But in this talk, we will not talk about. In this talk, we will not talk about that. Okay, so now in general, the other parameter looks like this, and then you can have various kinds of construction. So, in other words, this kind of construction. So, in other words, this community diagram tells us we can do this simple type one at a time. Okay, so that's the strategy. And now you take this simple type. Yeah, so it means that I will use the synchronize simple type to construct the kernel and then you make the correspondence. This will produce the Produce the light things endoscopy correspondence for us. Okay, so now let's see how to construct this kernel. So you take a tau symplatic type and the B is the R. And now you take a cospital data, right? So this will be, you have to consider the orthogonal group, they are big. Okay, that's quite a big problem according to giving. Giving endosycarat data. And then in this big orthogonal group, you have this GO2 block levies like this, right? And you put same tau because tau is a fixed simple type class form in this box, okay? And then you show that this is. And then you show that this isomer series attached to this hospital data has a residue, has a pole at this point. Okay. And now you take the leading term in the Laurent expansion, which gives you automorphic representation, which will be like a generalized, like a Shubeta residue for classic groups. Okay. Okay. And now the point is this residue, we know exactly what oscar parameter is. Is this kind, right? It's a sodium simple type. Is that the pole is on the most left? Yeah, most left. Yeah, most right. Most right. Yeah. And then this, we also know. This, we also know that the wave front set you can determine. Okay, so this is quite a small wavefront set, right? So in other words, you got some representation which is very, very small. Okay. But of course, it's not minimal because this guy has hospital data, okay, in the block. And now you take a partition like this. Like this. So, as you know, if you are familiar with the partitions, so if you take a free coefficient attached to this partition, and you will have a nice stabilizer looks like this. Yeah, so in other words, we'll realize this endoscopy group as a stabilizer of certain neopotent element. Okay, and so. Okay, and so we take the Fourier coefficient of this residue along this Fourier coefficient with this partition. This gives you a kernel. This is the kernel. Yeah, so in other words, this residue is still too big. Too big. You had a cutoff. By taking Free A coefficient, you will reduce the wave front. The wave franc of the guy reduced to a certain point so that you get the right stabilizer and then right indigo. Yeah, so that's the kernel. And with this kernel, you can produce the correspondence like this. Okay, so basically, you start with a tau hospital here. Okay, and with a giving B, you You use the parabolic induction, right? So, Isinglan theory is a parabolic induction. You take a parabolic induction and you take the quotient. This is like a standard module, take a quotient, right? That's the leading term of the relation, okay? You get a reasonably small representation, right? And this representation you take, you know, according to the Wavelength. You know, according to the Wavelength set, you take certain Fourier coefficients so that the stabilizer says stabilizer is the product of the two guys, right? The two guys. And so that you produce a kernel function which is landing on the product of two guys. And now you integrate the custom of these two guys against this kernel. And the conjecture will be if this Conjecture will be if this integral non-zero, you get correspondence whose other parameter is exactly what we want. That's the endoscopic correspondence. Yeah, exactly like a setup functions. Right. Yeah, so this illustrates the idea that if you want the branching problem to produce particular properties, you have to put a control. You have to put the control of this big representation to a certain degree so that the branching spectrum will be simpler and nice to behave. So that's the idea. Okay, that's the opposite to the general analysis approach. You don't control this reputation, but you control geometry analysis. So that's what we general spectrum. Yeah, different nature. Yeah. But for these applications, I think you better put some control so that you can get some information you can handle. Otherwise, you know, you get lost. Okay. And then since the parameters, there are so many parameters there. So you can vary parameters. You can construct all kind of, you know, you start with this guy, you have different kind of things. This guy, you have different kernels, and then you can construct different landing on different things, just like a CETA correspondence. You know, sort of start from an orthogonal group, and you have so many symplatic groups and start with symplatic group, and you have these towers. Okay. And then we ask, see the first occurrence, and then what do you get? All these properties. Yeah. And you can, of course, like a lot of inner product formula related to L function. formula related to L function and all this kind you can do it. Yeah, so same thing. So once you're construction and then all these kind story you can continue. Okay now the other situation the other situation will be looks like this. Yeah. And so but the construction somehow it's not easy to construct this way but Not easy to construct this way, but it's easy to construct this way. But this looks like, you know, if the other orthogonal group and then top of cover is exactly the theta situation. But now you attach to tau instead of the character. But this is also the theta correspondence. So in other words, the endoscopic correspondence is commuting with the cetaccane. So you can do this. Do this, but you can have similar construction kernels, so I will not explain. But for this, you need a free Jacobi kernel instead of just think of the free equipment. But see, same nature, yeah. Okay, so now let's see, uh, consider the button. I still have my time. Yeah, so yeah, So now we consider like a very special case. Yeah. And so in this case, the residual will be just tau two. Okay. Yeah, like two pieces. And then the partition will be just this simple type. Okay. And in this case, the world also group is one. Okay. And so this means you And so this means you just from the kernel and then you produce the automorphic. So the endoscopic lifting will be tau to the kernel. The kernel is the target. So that's the so-called automorphic descent Ginsburg-Wallace surgery and myself in surgery did for this case. Yeah, of course, for general. Yeah, of course, for general classes split classical groups and then they have a book about this situation. And another thing is like you, yeah, this is like, I have a lot of diagrams. Yeah, so I mean, yeah, so this point is Lennon's functority, right? Lennon's functality. Functality, right? Laman's functority talk about, you know, when you study automorphism, you are not focused on one group. They are all connected, right? And so that's why I always get the diagrams. Okay, here is the diagram looks like this. Like tau 1 is like a simple oscillometer, just cospido, right? You start here with a cospido, okay. Okay, and you go if you go here, this will become a residual non-tempered. Yeah, if this here the one will be tempered. Assume Lamanu, okay. Assume Lamanujin, this will be tempered, but this is not tempered. Okay, all these are non-tempered, but they're simple. These are all this packet will have a member which is a shipping residue. A super residual type for orthogonal group. Okay. But there's also degenerate class form there, like a non-Lama New June type class form, because for group which is not GL, Lama New J in general, not true. Okay, they are the counter, of course. So the custom leaves here will be all non-tempered, but only this guy is. But only this guy is expected temperature. Okay, but now you have this simple descent, make all these kind of commuting diagram. Yeah, this diagram is a commuting diagram. So you take a descent. So here, see, for example, this is like a SO3N plus one, right? So you have a level where GL2N. GL2M and SO2M plus one, right? So you put here like a tau three, you have three taus there, right? And so this is like the distinct one will be the residue, right? Maybe you have cosmonaut. Okay, so you take this, you take a descent, you see, you basically kill one beep. Yeah, you reduce. 1b. Yeah, you reduce the 1b from 3 to 2, you get this packet. So, in other words, for this diagram, you take other packet to other packet. And so, this is also the way you construct the other packet, right? So, in other words, this diagram for other packet, your construction. So, this is a descent. This is like a parabolic induction. This is a parabolic induction. But somehow, the construction of other packets. Construction of other pockets from small group to big group is also this way. Okay. So that's, I think this buying his thesis, I think, has worked for sympathetic group and carbon group by doing Freya Jacobi design. This diagram, this is by Yin's thesis. So it's a nice, nice filtration for this. Yeah, this is like a Yeah, this is like, you know, simple outside parameter is a kind of DNA for cosworms. Okay, so this is like a double helix. Yeah, this is like a double helix for DNA. You have it? Oh, I can add a short question. So, does this diagonally extend with similar so you have this similitude also? Simility? Uh yeah, you you expect, yeah, yeah. So same thing. As long as you can define, you know, peso design, the Jacobi design, it should work. Okay. Yeah, you should think about it. Even spin group. Yeah. Yeah, for spin group, you can also do it. But of course, this is an open question, how to do the cloud exceptional group. Cloud exceptionally. Yeah, so okay. So now we do more twist descent. This is the idea that we delay. And so you do the basal descent. And so you can show that there is so-called the lowest that you can go. This is so-called the first occurrence. And you start with the cosm. If you take a vessel, If you take a vessel, you may have a complicated spectrum. But if you go to the lowest one, which you call the first occurrence, and then this will be itself is cospidal, but may not be irreducible. Okay, so it's here the sum of the irreducible cospidos. And this is a multiplicity-free decomposition because the multiplicity one theorem. Principle or basal model for freight copy, right? We mentioned many times in the lectures. Yeah, well, the contributor, right, for the multiplicity ones here. And so, so the and also plus the gangrose plus our conjecture, we show that you can show that this sigmas are leaves in different work. Lives in different organ packets. Yeah, so the spectrum you can have very precise information out this. Okay, but now we ask even further about these spectrums. So this is the conjecture. Okay, we proved this for some special case, but in general, Some special case, but in general, this conjecture is still open. So, if you take a pi cusp, which is yeah, this is actually for general classical group, not just for this, but for this, okay. With a genetic acid run. This means genetic acid probability means this cusp form is not too small, the wave runs that not too small, okay. And here you go, the first occurrence, you get the caspidal spectrum. You get the caspetal spectrum from this. We claim that this conjecture claims that there's at least one guy there has generic asymptomatic, meaning that in this decomposition, there's one guy which is not too small. Reasonable, right? Yeah, illegal, right? Because you start with something big, okay? And once you get this, we got a We got one more diagram which constructs the other pocket. Yeah, you can construct the other pocket by this descent map. So, how do we do? Well, we start, see, let's giving a pie here. How do you construct this pi by the sort of integral? You have an integral formula for this pi. Formula for this pipe. The construction means you can express automorphic form from pi by certain integral, right? So that's the construction of the descent. Okay, how do you do? So first of all, we do this direction means you do descent and go to the first occurrence and then you pick up a one which is good from this assumption. Okay. And use this and with this guy. And with this guy, this other parameter, right, you produce a new other parameter here and bigger group, and then you do descent, and you produce another, this automorphic representation is concrete. This automorphic form are giving by formula, integral formulas, okay? But the claim is this guy equivalent to this guy. Equivalent to this guy, yeah. This will be giving you an irreducible representation which is isomorphic to this guy. That's the construction. Yeah, so in other words, giving, if you give me any automorphic representation, in a cosmetic automatic representation, and we don't know how to construct, but you need to give a little piece of information about the wavefront set, and then we can find the integral formula. The integral formula to express this cross form by integral. So that's the whole thing. Yeah, so okay. Yeah, so and then according to this, Lei Jiang and I prove the GDP, a global GDP, yeah. So period now managing the So, period not managing, the L function not managing in this direction. But the opposite direction, for the moment, we still have assumptions about the wave function set of certain residue. Yeah, so if this L function The norm vanishing like at half, and then we consider isoman series. This guy will have a residual, and we expect that the residual has a wavefront this type. Okay, once you get this, and then we can prove that Jangolus Pols are conjectured, the other direction. Okay, actually, in reality, but actually in reality we need a little bit weaker than this but this this is the way enough yeah but but the other things is a little bit technical involved so i will not explain but that's basically is what the win from set of certain small representation really matters okay okay one more diagram so So this diagram produces two different approaches to global GGP. So this triangular basically is what I did with Lay, but the whole thing is what I did with Ginsburg and Rawlers for all classical groups in these three papers. Okay, so basically, you see, you see, you get the tempered as a parameter here for cast forms. And this is the GGP vessel model, right? So the tempered. But now you, in order to do this, you induced up both sides. So here is like three pieces of this parameter. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is definitely non-tempered. Yeah, this will be the residual setting type. And this will also the residual setting type. And we calculated this basal period or free jacoby of this non-tempered guy by because both are not constant, so you have to use asset truncation and things like that. And to calculate the complicated integrals, and then eventually you find. And then eventually you find this guy occurred inside. So that's the way you can prove like a period norm variation implies the L function normal. Okay, but so about the wavefront set of this you know this conjecture is sort of one. Is sort of one of the information we really need. How do you test it? We can only prove some special case, but in general, so far, I haven't got an idea to do it. But on the other hand, you can imitate, do the local theory. And do the local theory, it turned out to be very successful. So if you start with irreducible, admissible representation with the generic as a parameter. With the generic as a parameter. This is both Archimedean and Piadic. Okay, this is F is the local field, general local field. And then we show that the spectrum, the first occurrence you guess, actually, they are all discrete series representations. You know, you start with representation with just generic aspect parameter, meaning that the representation is not too small. Actually, you're Actually, you got the much better discrete series representation. Okay, and then the discrete series representation can be explicitly explained as what are these L parameters you can calculate. Yeah, so all the L parameter you can determine by the L parameter for pi, okay. So, this means that we can continue this descent in some sense, right? You start with something, you descend, you get a better repo condition. So, this means you can keep going. So, by using this, like a so-called consecutive descent method, you can determine the wavefront set of pi. Yeah, so other parameter has a gene, you know, other packet has. gene you know other packet has a generic other parameter means that there's one guy you have has weighted model but there's many other representation in the packet so the question is what are the wavefront set of the for the remaining guys right that's the way we determine yeah so we can determine the the remaining guy okay so now this is the last slide so okay so Size. So, okay, so now come up with like a period, right? Let's relative London and Benze, Marketesh. So, for the moment, I think according to Witek and his student, you know, CDA correspondence and Gangls-Processor conjecture will be the dual, the two sides in the relative learners duality, right? But now I got the endoscopic correspondence. The endoscopic correspondence, the question is: what is the dual side for this? Okay, we have some progress in the special case, but I hopefully to report this in the future. Thank you. Correspondent. I mean, you are saying that you can formulate the local theory. Yeah, you expect it, right? So you replace the residual by the Lanand quotient and you replace the Fourier coefficient by Bessel model or, you know, like a degenerate weighted model, like what Bashi Mogherin did. And then you do things similar. You do things, same thing, yeah. You expect the same thing. Uh, yeah, I didn't write the local part. I write all the framework conjectures for global setting, but I expect the same thing happening, just like a signal. And is there, so this is what for a non-temperance, so like you try and get non-tender. Yeah, this is like a general answer. Yeah, you can also get the temper ones by this pronoun. I have a question here in the beginning when you construct these kernels and start find some new volume orbit. Notice that all these new volume orbits always have two sizes. I mean, it's two length sizes, so that stabilizer will be the product of two classes. Yeah, that's like just design. You have to design this because. You have to design this kernel so that you get the right. Of course, you can have general more pieces, but this is totally down. Yeah. I mean, like more than, but like you chose a particular basically you picked a maximum value to work with, right? And as you expected, that was going to give you a kernel that would give you what you. A kernel that would give you what you had very slowly, right? So, like, just what if you just did something like just take some maximal value and just give us some more kind of construction? Is there a kernel associated with that? And those might give you some technology. Yeah, you can get something out as long as you design well. You have to know what you want. I know. What you want, I know, yeah. If you know, if you know more about what you want, yeah, and you know how to design the content, that's what I did. Okay, so uh, we will take a sort of short 10 minutes break and thank you.
