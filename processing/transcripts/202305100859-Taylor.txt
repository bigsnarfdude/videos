Good morning everyone. So I guess let's start. Welcome to the phase retrieval day of the conference. A stable phase retrieval, so I should say that. And our first speaker is Michelle Taylor, currently of UC Berkeley, but in July he's starting at PhD reprint. And he's graduating this Friday, I've been told. So more So, more reason to congratulate you. And you'll speak about stable phase retrieval part one. Well, thank you very much, Andy, for the introduction. And of course, to Vladimir and the rest of the organizers for bringing us to this wonderful place and for allowing me to speak here. So, today's topic is stable phase retrieval, and it's based on a joint work with Mike Christ and Ben Penno. So, that's No. So that's some sense a harmonic analysis-inspired approach to the problem. And then another joint work with Dan and Timor and Ben, where, well, it's closer to body virtuses, structural properties of these substances. All right, so I can just give you the definition. There's just one topic we're working on, and it's pretty simple. So you let's say. You, um, well, let's say it's the definition. So a subspace E of a bonic lattice X does stable phase retrieval. Okay, and I'll always just probably I'll always just probably say SBR. If, well, I can find a constant C bigger than or equal to 1 such that whenever I take F and G in my subspace, if I know that the absolute value of F is close to the absolute value of G, right, then to within this constant C, I can recover the phase and say, well, well actually f is close to a multiple of g. So this I'll call this inequality star. All right, so let me explain to you kind of the basic intuition for this and first what is this implement being taken over and um this is one of the few I guess subjects in bonic lattices where the scalar field really matters. The scalar field really matters. So if we're working on complex scalars, well, this inf is taken over all lambda equaling e to the i theta in the unit circle. So it's all possible global phases. But in the real case, well, how many phases are there? There's just plus or minus one. And so this infimum becomes much, much simpler. So in the real case, this m minus lambda is one, the normal f. Lambda is one, the norm of f minus lambda g is just, well, the norm of f minus g, minimum, the norm of f plus g. Two possible global scalars. And of course, this really tells you that real SPR problems are much easier. Complex SPR problems. So, hopefully, this now explains what we're doing in this inequality, but maybe let's take the simplest case now and try and get some intuition of what's happening here. Okay, so the simplest case of this inequality star is: well, what happens? Is, well, what happens if I take f and g in my subspace and they have the same absolute value? It can certainly be possible. Well, this inequality will tell you that the right-hand side is zero, and so the left-hand side must be zero, and I can deduce that f and g must be multiples of each other. Okay? That will imply that f is just a unimoduling multiple. Is just a unimoduling multiple of g, and because, well, these have the same absolute value, this lambda is modulus one, so it's literally just a scalar in the unit disk. And this implication where you know the absolute values of the function, you know some linear constraints, and you can recover the function is what's called phase retrieval. So, this implication is phase retrieval. And more generally, phase retrieval is recovering from the absolute value of the function, the function itself, up to whatever ambiguity is present. And what ambiguity is present? Well, we're working in subspaces, so I can, if I have f in my subspace, lambda g will be in my subspace, when lambda is a unimodular scalar, and certainly these two functions will have the same absolute value. So I can actually go. Right? So I could actually go backwards here. So phase retrieval will say that whenever I take two elements of my subspace, they have the same absolute value if and only if, well, trivial case happened where they're just multiples of each other. They're linearly independent functions. And stable phase retrieval, well, says a little bit more. It says, well, not only can I recover functions, I can do it in a stable way. So phase retrieval, I can. So phase retrieval, I can maybe say, means that the map F going to F modulo phase, where I say two functions are equal to a global phase, is well defined on E. And this inequality here just says that not only is this map well defined, it's also Lipschitz with constancy. So that's So that's well, that's the topic for today. All right, so the question may be like, why this topic? Because usually in bonic lattices, we're interested in sublattices and rich structures involving the lattice, but this is somehow the opposite, right? If E was a sub-lattice, this would be impossible, right? You could never be able to construct functions from their moduli. Functions from their moduli, right? Unless you're making one-dimensional or something like this. So these subspaces here have to be somehow small and they have to be as far from a sub-lattice as possible. So why would you want to build such subspaces? Well, it turns out that they're pretty important in applications, or at least when the bonnet quadis is L2, they're important in applications. All right, so let's do, let's, I'll briefly. Alright, so let's do let's briefly tell you. And also I'm doing this so that when you, or if you would like to look at the phase retrieval literature, you won't see the definition formulated like I just put. You'll see something else that might look different, but I'll show you how you can reduce to this definition. So, what you will see in the literature is phase retrieval for operators. And the, well, from my perspective, I mean, people will disagree on this, the most important is the Fourier transform. Okay, so it turns out, so in certain, in crystallography, so crystals in D.C. So crystals and DNA and all these things. You take some kind of measurement system, some measuring apparatus, and you probe the crystal and you measure something and you want to say, well, that's somehow what you're looking at. But the problem is that these detectors don't detect the signal you want. What they detect is the absolute value of the Fourier transform. So in crystallography, the detector... The detectors measure the absolute value of the Fourier transform of the signal you're interested in. And so what's the problem? Well, you have access to this measurement, and you want to actually see what is my image I'm looking at. So you have to somehow go from the magnitude of the Fourier transform. Of the Fourier transform and recover the function back. And in the applications, a global phase won't matter. You can never recover the global phase. So that's what they're happy to recover as at the module of global phase. So obviously, since the Fourier transform is unitary at NL2, knowing the non-judgment of the Fourier transform is not enough to determine the function. So, well, you might say you're out of luck. Well, you might say you're out of luck, but not really, because you're doing some physical experiments, so you know there's some constraints. You know your signal has to look like something, and it's not an arbitrary function, it has some special properties, so there'll be some linear constraints involved. So this process here is determined by the physics of the problem. Or we can interpret it as that the signal lives in some linear subspace of L2 of constraints we know. Of constraints we know a creole. Okay? And then, well, this recovery here, although it's nice theoretically, you will have experimental errors and whatnot. So you'll want some kind of stable recovery of your signals. And so if you want stability, what you're going to be interested in is an inequality of the form, well, nth of modulus lambda equals one. of modulus lambda equals one of norm of f minus lambda g is less than some constant times the norm of the absolute value, let's look at hats for the sake of Ronnie out of the space, minus g hat, where hat is also a Fourier transpose. Because by the same logic, what happens in the trivial case when absolute value of f hat is absolute value of g hat, this inequality tells you I can recover f and g. They're just global multiples of each other. They're just global multiples of each other. But then this also says that this map, taking the Fourier transform of a signal in moduli back to my original function, is also Lipschitz. Okay? And the problem is that this inequality here doesn't look like this one here until we have an operator mixed in. I mean, of course, it looks like it, but there's hats on this side and no hats on this side. Okay? Well, how do we? Well, how do we fix this problem? We use pointer L, right? So you can put ats here. And well, now you just do a little change of notation, right? So this stability estimate you'll want for F and G satisfying your linear constraints. But when I make the change in notation, F is capital F hat. is capital F hat and G is capital G hat, little F and little G will be in the Fourier transform of this subspace. So F and G will be in the Fourier transform of this subspace. So well inequalities in Fourier phase retrieval valid for a subspace E can be reinterpreted in this Latinx language, Lattice language by just switching. Language by just switching E over to the Fourier side. And we can just work on the Fourier side and forget about the operator. So that's the problem in Fourier phase retrieval. And well, I'm going to, well, the purpose of this talk is to build the first examples of infinite dimensional subspaces that do Fourier phase retrieval stably. So it was known you can do it possibly unstably. It possibly unstably, but there are actually no infinite-dimensional examples where you can do it stably. I'm going to work on inverting the problems. I'll work in this setting here, but before I transfer the subplace, I'll have this problem. All right. So this is one application. Another application generally is when you replace the 4A transform by some other operator T. By some other operator t, having a Hilbert space to x, or let's say to L2, for simplicity. And this operator, depending on your applications, is probably going to be the Fourier transform or the analysis operator of a frame, something like this, right? So the point is, in all these problems in phase retrieval, what are they trying to do? They're trying to recover the magnitude of a function. Magnitude of a function, or the function from the magnitude of some operator applied to the function. And this operator is what's determined by whatever physical problem they're looking at. So it's usually Fourier transform or Gabor Trisor or something appearing in application. But the point of our kind of reformulation of this problem in terms of botic lattices is to break this step into two parts. Part one is I recover. Part one is: I recover Tf, modulo phase, from the magnitude of Tf. And then the next step is, well, I recover F from Tf. If I can do both of these steps, I can do this step. But the thing is, this step is pretty easy. This is essentially your operator's injective. Or if you also want stability, Or, if you also want stability, it has a continuous inverse, so it's bounded below. And this step is: well, up to notation, dropping the t's, I can put it in the language of that inequality over there. So for exactly the same reasoning here where I can put hats on both sides by Planterelle, well, up to some distortion, because if this operator will be an isomorphism, I can then kill the operator and just talk about substance. kill the operator and just talk about subspaces of quantum planes. Okay, so a subspace E contain of, well, an operator T from H to L2 determines a subspace T of H contained in L2. And the kind of questions of phase retrieval for operators turns out to be the same as the question of what's this subspace of L two. Of whether this subspace of L2 is stable phase retrieval as a subspace of Lockerblattis. Okay, so in some sense, it's that the physics determines the operator, the operator determines which subspace of L2 you want to do phase retrieval on, and we're just going to ask the question of, well, in general, or even in L2 or in general funny plattices, which subspaces to phase retrieval. Okay? So I think that's enough motivation for this audience at least. So we can go. This audience, at least, so we can go straight to Bonic Lattice's. But there are many others that come up. So, the Pauli problem in quantum mechanics, you can measure the magnitude of the wave function and magnitude of its Fourier transform because it's a position and momentum. You can measure densities, you can recover these, and you want to recover the original wave function. Well, you have to do some kind of phase-retriple problem there. So, these are problems stated by Pauli going back to. Polly going back to the introduction point here. All right, so let's go immediately now to the obstructions to stable fixtures. Okay? So as I mentioned, the subspace E can certainly not be a sublattice. That would be way too much to ask. That would be way too much to ask. And there's actually a very much more tight thing that can happen, and you can't have any disjointness in your span. So let me explain this. So let's say I take f and g with almost, what I call it, normalized, but almost Almost disjointly supported. Okay, so the picture here is this is my function f and this is my function g. Okay, they're two functions that are almost disjointly supported. And I'm going to explain to you why this is bad for phasor triple problems. Okay? And the reason it's bad is, well, if I take f plus g. F plus g, it'll, morally speaking, look like this picture I drew. But if I take f minus g, what's going to happen is this side of the picture is going to flip, right? So this side of the picture is going to go down here, right? And why is this bad? This is bad because f plus g and f minus g are nowhere near multiples of each other, right? f plus g is not a multiple. Is not a multiple of f minus g in any reasonable sense, but you agree these functions have very similar absolute values. So the absolute value of f is very close to the absolute value of g, and this is a problem. I have two functions whose absolute values are close. Sorry, f plus g. It is very close to f minus g. Yes? Okay. Yes? And I think f and g in my subspace, f plus g and f minus g will still live in my subspace. They'll have very close absolute values, but they won't be close to multiples of each other. Okay? So this is the somehow what we call the obvious obstruction to phase retrieval. Alright, so um well it's a fact. Well, this is fact. If E is a subspace of the bonic lattice does stable phase retrieval, then E does not contain almost disjoint pairs. And well, I can make this. And well, I can make this precise. So, what is almost disjoint pair? Almost disjoint pair means, or let's say lacking almost disjoint pair means there exists an epsilon bigger than zero. Whenever I take f and g and the sphere of e, I can say that if I m th them, the norm will be bigger than epsilon. So, if my subspace is to do stable phase retrieval, such an inequality. Such an inequality must be true, right? Yeah. Related to the constant C you have in this case. It'll be one over that up to. Well, okay. Let me state the theorem and then I will tell you. So the theorem of Dan, Timor, Ben, and I is that for real scalars, for real Bonnock lattices, this is the only obstruction. For real Bonnock lattices, Real bonic lattices. This is the only obstruction. And as Pedro was mentioning, there's a relation between this epsilon and c. So it'll turn out that up to a constant 2 in one direction, c is 1 over epsilon. So having no So having no epsilon almost disjoint vectors tells you you do one over, or two over epsilon stable phase retrieval. So yeah, this is the theorem that, well, it makes real bonic lattices much more friendly to phase retrieval. This theorem is absolutely false in the complex case. There's way more obstructions to stable phase retrieval than just, well, I don't know, I don't have any disjointness. In the applications, do they provide? In the applications, do they prefer real or complex scalars? It depends. Yeah, so it really depends on the problem. And we have results for both. So, I mean, and we just have more results in the real case by a large margin. Okay. So, obviously, I'm not going to tell you about the proof of this theorem, but I'll tell you why it should only work for the real case or how you proceed in this theorem. So, the proof. So the proof, step one is to get yourself a metric space. And I guess, as Daniel was already saying, this is not so hard. You embed into an infinity sum of L1s and you can build yourself a measure space. So what's step two? Well, you take two functions f and g, and you can build, you can partition the measure spaces so that the Partition the measure spaces so that you can match the signs or have opposite sides. So you can define whatever I want to do: i is the set of all t and omega such that sine of f of t is equal to sine of g of t. And well, the thing about real scalars is then the complement of this set will be the set where they have opposite sides, right? So I complement. So I complement is the same set, but I put a minus sign here. And so I can partition my measure space into pieces where they have the same sign, or pieces where they have the opposite sign, and then you can, on these two tortions, you can recover the absolute value from the functions and place it to games. So step three is, well, not general stuff, but well, concrete computations. We compute with these. Compute with these with this kind of idea, and you, well, you will say if you had almost disjoint vectors, then by partitioning vector space doing some tricks, you can then build some other vectors where, or sorry, if you do SBR, then, or if you fail SBR, then you can build some almost distributed vectors by chopping them up and then being careful to stay in your measure space, or not being so careful because you can pass through nip in some of L1s, and this problem will pass. All right, so that's all I really want to say. The proof is not hard once you know how to proceed, but of course, this proof is never going to work in the complex case because I can't partition my measure space. This is for good reasons. All right, so what's the important connection here? Well, as many of you know, there's this large literature on almost disjoint sequences in bonic lattices, right? This whole casual chain. Lattices, right? This whole Kazzwelchinsky theory. And well, now it relates to phase retrieval because if you do stable phase retrieval, you'll have to be a subspace of this form. And well, you can resolve these things. So it is an ephonomia, right? It's an ephonomia, yes. Even with control of the constants. So the important connection Is with the subspaces lacking almost disjoint. And here I want to be clear: sequences are classical. And okay, I'll always say this. When I say almost disjoint pairs and almost disjoint sequences, I'm assuming they're normalized, right? So, or that'll always be an assumption. All right, so what do I mean by an almost disjoint sequence? Let me just say that Fn is almost disjoint. By my convention, means that, well, it's a normalized sequence because I want to actually measure distribution. Because I want to actually measure disjointness. And there exists a sequence dn, which is disjoint, where the distance between fn and dn goes to zero. So asymptotically, you behave like a normalized disjoint sequence. And it's very clear that if you do, if a subspace does stable phase retrieval, it cannot contain almost disjoint sequences because it doesn't even contain almost disjoint vectors. Contain almost distrained vectors at all. But, well, the important part for us or how we could solve problems outside of Bonic lattices using Bonic lattice techniques is, well, these are very well-studied subspaces and they have remarkable properties. And I'll be concrete and just say, stick to the LP case. So I'll stick to P being between 1 and infinity and μ a probability or my measure. If I had a measure, let's say probability. And I'll say, well, for a subspace E containing an LP, mu, the following are equivalent. Property one as well, this property that I'm claiming is classical, so this non-existence of almost disjoint sequences. Almost disjoint sequences. So E contains no almost disjoint sequence. This is the property I really am interested in a priori, but this property is equivalent to, well, there exists an index q less than p, and when q is 0, I really mean converters in measure, let's say. So I could add that as a third one, or a fourth one. or a fourth quote. The L P norm is equivalent to the L Q norm on V. So the subspaces lacking almost disjoint sequences are exactly the subspaces, well, when you look inside them, the L P norm and the L Q norm will be equivalent for some Q less than P, and then by a certain holder inequality argument, you can replace this by for any choice of Q less than P. I think this theorem will work in both cases. But it's the phase retrieval problem where the complex scalars is the issue. Does this theorem make sense? So they have to be subspaces where the L P and L Q norms are the same on that subspace. Are the same on that subspace, but I'll warn you: when you do stable phase retrieval, you take absolute value of f minus absolute value of g, and this leaves the subspace, right? So this might be measured in LP. You want to bound that by minus lambda equals one, norm f minus lambda g. Here, it doesn't matter if I put LP or any lower LT because they'll all be equivalent, but here you're leaving the subspace. So there's some technical things to do. Things to do. And there's more you can say about this. So, for example, when P is not 2, these are the subspaces not containing little L P even isomorphically as a body space. So, if you contain L P isomorphically, then you contain it almost disjointly, is the standard way you can say these. All right, so I'll call this as the property here, property star, and I'll label it as P because it does depend on P because you're P because you can only go down in this theorem. You can go down from P to Q, but you can't go up. So I'll say a subspace of L P that satisfies this theorem, I'll call it, I'll say it has property star, depending on P. Okay? And the simple observation here is that SPR in LP implies SPR, or implies the star. SPR, it implies the star property depending on P, and the star property depending on B implies the Q version as long as Q is less than or equal to P, because you have this very natural exists. Is that okay? All right. The converse is far from true. And the reason, well, I guess everyone knows Radamachers, right? Everyone knows Rademachers, right? Kinchin's inequality tells us all the LP norms are equivalent on the Rademachers, but you agree that the Rademachers all have constant moduli. So, or well, yeah, constant moduli. I can't recover a radio macro from its absolute value because all the absolute values of the radio macros are exactly the same. The same. So this reverse implication here is far from true, and well, that's the work we have to do. Okay. All right, so um the point here is that this property That this property star, depending on P, has been studied in two completely different fields of mathematics. Well, not completely, they're both analysis, so you know what you need to say. So there's the harmonic analysis approach to this, and then there's, I would say, the bonic lens or LP structure. LP structure. It's a bunch of analysis. Okay. And this, roughly speaking, is how these two papers broke up. So the first paper with Mike and Ben, then, well, they are both harmonic analyst PD people. So we took this approach. And then in the functional analysis approach, well, obviously diving into our head. Obviously, Dinner's forever had too many things to say. So, very lucky to have a good group of collaborators. So, this is roughly speaking how these two papers divide. And, well, how they divide a little bit more concretely, this is what I would say is the, okay, I don't know how to face Bob Bluzzinski. Something like this. Z after the C. And so the original D. With C. And so liberation networks. C, as we would say. And then how many things do I put on top of it? A slash across the L, and an accent on the N. Yeah, so I guess for this audience, this is the one you know. So say you have an order continuous bonic lattice, you have a dichotomy, says, well, either I contain normalized disjoint, normalized. Well, either I contain an almost disjoint normalized sequence or I'm isomorphic to a subspace of L1. So this allows you to reduce in many cases from a general abundant glattis to subspaces of L1. And then in L1, they can actually do things, or I can, at least try to do things. And in this direction of the problem, you go to the theory of lambda p sets, which is a very deep theory, well, an empirical. Theory, well, on par with the Polchinski theory, but of a different play. So let me tell you first about the lambda p set theory so that if I run out of time, then I can continue on this part. All right, so what is lambda p set theory? Well, you just take this almost disjoint sequence characterization and you say, well, which Fourier polynomials have this problem? So you want to. So you want to connect it to harmonic analysis. You say a subset lambda of integers is lambda v if, well, the span of the trigonometric polynomials supported one lambda, right, as this property star, as star in the L P topology. The LP topology. Okay? So you're not interested in general subspaces of LP. You're interested in ones formed by functions whose frequency sets are supported by lambda. Okay? And this is what a lambda p set is. And the problem is building lambda p sets is very difficult in general. So I'll just say some facts. For one less than or equal to p strictly less than two, lambda p sets are automatically lambda p plus epsilon for some small epsilon. This is number one. Number two is due to root n for p equaling four, six, eight, and so forth, an even integer that's not two, lambda p does not imply lambda p plus epsilon. Okay, so this is rooted. And the proof is combinatorial. Because you have an even integer, you take an L P norm of something like this, you can split it. Like this, you can split it and you do a bunch of comatorial tricks. You build very interesting sequences with no, with certain properties, and you build stuff like this. What's still, I think, considered to be extremely difficult is Bourgain's contribution, who proved that for any p strictly bigger than 2, this is also true. Or it's also not true. And this is what I'm progressing is actually. This is what a preview is active papers. I don't know if we can use or not use it. Everyone sees I spell previous things. This is related to the constant you have on the equivalence of norms or not? Uh what constant? You get you you you're saying you have that between the V norm and the G plus, right? Pre-normal GPS, right? Yes. That's a constant involving this. But you just want one constant for each. If you say that the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I want one constant. So I'll just say a subspace. Yeah, yeah, if there exists, if it has this property on a qualitative level, there will be a constant. If there is some constant for which this happens, and those implications, they don't look at what is the relation between the two. Yeah, so it would be lambda speed, so there would be some finite constant, and lambda p plus at the There'd be some finite constant, and lambda p plus epsilon, that constant is infinite. I mean, the first factor? This is so the original proof of this relies on Rosenthal's theorem that if you're, you know, when you have a subspace of Lp, when P is bigger than 2, when you embed into L P plus epsilon, that's not so quantitative. There are new proofs of this that are probably quantitative, but I'm more comfortable with citing Rosenthal for this. You're right, though. You're right though, if you want to bring Pizier into the mix, PZA likes CDON sets, and CDON sets are exactly the sets that are lambda p for all finite p with optimal control of the constant. So the constant grows like root p as p goes to infinity. That's one characterization, the difficult characterization of seed on sets. So this concept does matter, but for my purposes, let's not. And well, okay, so what I want to say really is the density of the sequence matters. The density of the sequence matters. Okay, so for p bigger than 2, if you're a lambda p set, then if I take my set, intersect it with the head of the natural numbers, it can grow at most like n to the 2 over p. So the density of the set lambda, where you do, where we're interested in showing. Where we're interested in showing it's a lambda p set, has a certain maximal density. And these proofs here go by showing that you can build lambda p sets that witness this density. And so they can't be lambda p plus epsilon, because then they would have worse density. And Rudin's construction, entirely explicit. Bourgain's is entirely probabilistic. If phi is not an even integer, no one's written one down. They exist, but probabilistic means there is no construction. Construction, how do you write down a lambda p set is not lambda p plus epsilon? No one's ever written one down, other than saying a high probability basis or the probability one basis. This is still an open problem, and the case p equals two is also an open problem. No one knows whether lambda two implies lambda two plus epsilon, though on the Banach space level, it is not an open problem. But you know, Rosenthal's theorem works for E script of estimation. All right. All right, so yeah, as you were saying, so there's other people, so PZA contributed, and Rosal, maybe Talibrand can be contributed to property one. But well, what does this relate to phase attributable idea in this CPT paper? Well, can we use these? Can we modify these constructions? To make them do SBR. So that was our question or conjecture. And the naive answer is, well, absolutely not, right? Why? Because Why? Because I take any trigonometric monomial, its absolute value is 1. How can I recover, I cannot recover which trigonometric polynomial I'm at from its modulus because the modulus is 1. All of these subspaces fail stable phase of people. Not a single one will work. And there's a much bigger elephant in the room, is that I haven't given you a single one. Room is that I haven't given you a single example at all that will work. I haven't given you a single SPR subspace, and that's because until very interesting work of Dan and Nikki and Ingrid Doboshis and Robert Galdebrank last year, there were no examples. So the first example of an infinite-dimensional subspace that does SPR was constructed last year. And this should be very much contrasted with the finite dimensional case. With the finite dimensional case, where if you look at these papers of Candish and all these others, these papers prove it about 10 years ago and they already have over 1,000 sites on these papers. So it's not for lack of trying. I mean, the finite dimensional case is very, very well studied, and phase retrieval implies stable phase retrieval, some big constant by compactness. Phase retrieval in infinite dimensions is very possible. Stable phase retrieval is a different game. Phase retrieval is a different game. So there we go. So why were there no examples? Well, let's look at the T being the analysis operator of a frame. So this was one of my motivating examples of the types of phase retro. Of the types of phase material problems people are interested in. And if the frame is a discrete frame, so in the discrete frame, Cahil, Kisaza, and Dobashis prove that, well, this operator cannot do stable phase retrieval. And I can explain to you And I can explain to this very easily. A discrete frame, well, it comes with an analysis operator, T, and it's a map into little L2. That's basically what discrete means. Why can't the image of T in L2 do stable phase retrieval and also be infinite dimensional? Well, we have gliding hub, right? You take an infinite dimensional subspace of little L2. Infinite dimensional subspace of little L2, you block the humps, you build almost destroying vectors, you fail stable base which you want. It's as simple as that. This argument doesn't work in finite dimensions, obviously. What's maybe more difficult is Alfarian Groves did the same thing, the same non-existence theorem for continuous frames. So then you have a map into an L capital L2 space. With capital L2 space, and you're interested in subspaces which do have stable phrasal on this image. And subspaces of this form will always fail, stable phrase-triple. So in particular, the examples that Dan, Nikki, Ingrid, and Robert built are subspaces of L2 that cannot be realized as the image of the analysis operator of a frame. In little L2, every subspace is the image of an analysis operator of a frame. But in capital L2, you can build a. In capital L2, you can build other ones. Alright. How much time do I have? Okay, I have some time. This is not an eraser. This is a blackness. All right, so the first one is a little bit of a little bit All right, so the theorem of, well, okay, let's just call Nurbank Gilbert Shees framing freedom. There exists infinite dimensional subspaces of real value L2, which do SBR. The first examples, and I should mention this is 2022. And okay, I should also mention that although there's negative results for the analysis operator frame, the Fourier transform is different. Fourier transform, as I said, I build, well, okay, there's some issues with real scalar versus complex, which we'll alleviate soon. But if I take their sum space, take its Fourier transform, that will do Fourier. If it's Fourier transform, that will do Fourier if you're true. So although it doesn't work for frames, there's other operators where it is still physically relevant. All right, so let's come now to the examples from this paper with Mike and Ben. And well, I mentioned that I would like to use trigonometric polynomials that are monomials. I'd like to use e to the 2πi and x. I'd like to use e to the 2πi and x as my basis of functions I build to do stable phasor table. I can't do this, but I can't, I uh don't have to look too far. So the closed span of, well, I don't look at e to the 2 pi i n x, I take its real part. Sine of 2 pi, let's say, 4 to the nx, n runs of n, does Does SPR actually an LP of 0, 1 for L finite? So it's really as easy as taking the real part. Another theorem is that if you take a sequence of IIDs, so if omega mu is a probability space and Rj in L. And Rj in L4 of mu are IID, means they're IID. Well, when can they not do stable phase retrieval? Well, if their modulus are all equal, they can't do stable phase retrieval, right? Because the modulus wouldn't determine the functions are all accurate distributed. But if this is not true, then they do SBR. And they do SPR. And then the span, well, I just say the span of Rj contained in O4 does SPR. So for higher ID mean zero variables, the only obstruction is that their modulus is identically constant. All right, and but what I should note here is that these examples are for real scalars, so they give some more of me, a little bit more. Give some more of a little bit more concrete examples than here, although this is also concrete. You build it by hand. These won't do complex stable freeze retrieval, and I can convince you of this very easily. Let's say I have a botic lattice, I have a subspace, E, right? And this subspace contains real vectors. Real vectors. So f and g and e are real and linearly independent. Okay, I claim just this knowledge already prohibits complex phasor triple. Well, why? I look at f plus ig. I look at f minus ig. These functions, because these are real and then they're independent, will have the same modulus, like I said, just because they're real, right? Guys, just because they're real, right? But they won't be multiples of each other because they're linearly independent functions. So same modulus, but not multiples. Okay. So I guess in these theorems, you clearly have real vectors in your span. These will not do stable, they won't even do phase retrieval. Not even will they not do. They won't even do phase retrieval. Not even will they not do stable phase retrieval. They won't do phase retrieval. Okay. So, how do I build complex examples? Well, again, the nice thing is you don't have to look too far. Instead of replacing either 2 pi i and x by sine of 2 pi and x, you replace it by a trigonometric polynomial with non-positive moduli. And that will essentially work. Okay, so another example. I guess it's the first example. I guess it's the first example that does phase retrieval in infinite complex spaces. If you let n be bigger than or equal to 2, and you take p to be a trigonometric polynomial, alpha k e to the 2 pi i k x. It's a trigonometric polynomial. It's a trigonometric polynomial. If you assume modus of P is not identically constant, and you assume that you have a number A, which is more than twice this number here, this N, then when I look at the span of dilates of, well, I should use a different, yeah, let's call this capital N, capital N, and then I can. Capital N, and then I can use N here. I'll look at spans of dilates of this, but it's sufficiently lacinary dilates. This will do FPR in all of the LP spaces in the complex sense. Did I say that clearly enough? So, you take a trigonometric polynomial, you assume its magnitude is. Polynomial, you assume its magnitude is not constant. If the magnitude is constant, you're in trouble, right? You can't do phase retrieval at all. But as long as you assume the magnitude is not constant, you dilate it by a sufficiently lacinary dilate, you can do complex stable phase retrieval. And this theorem almost looks like a contradiction with this sine one, but there's a very innocuous assumption here: that this sum starts at one, right? Sine is formed from frequencies 1 and minus 1. And this is cancellation between 1 and minus 1 that makes them real. Like sine is a real function. Here, crucially, k is starting at 1. There's no negative frequencies in these functions, and this book guarantees that these functions are genuinely complex. If I had real functions, I would be in trouble, but these functions are genuinely complex. All right, so these are just some simple examples. I wrote this inequality of Rudin, this n to the p over 2 over p. We can witness these maximal density when we're even integers. I don't know how to do the analog of Borgain, but when you have an even integer, I can build for you an SPR subspace that has maximal density even in the lambda p sense. So it is very, very dense. These are not dense, these are lacinary dilations. I can replace this. I can replace this A to the N with a very structured sequence that is very, very dense, but it's not, the structure of that sequence is non-trivial. You have to actually play with this. All right. So let me finish now with some functional analysis. So now we actually have examples, so we can start analyzing. So, we can start analyzing: well, what properties do these subspaces have? So, obviously, they can't be too big, they can't be sub-lattices, they can have almost like they can't have distinct vectors in them, but what can you say? And I think the question you should ask even before then is where do instabilities arise in beta table? And I already told you, disjoint vectors is where they arise. But that's only good enough in the real case. This is not good enough in the complex case. And what we're able to prove is that instabilities always occur on orthogonal vectors. Okay, so the theorem FOHT, I think, instabilities In phase retrieval are maximized on orthogonal vectors. Okay, what do I mean by this? I take the Hilbert space, L2, I take F in G. Take f and g in my Hilbert space, then I can build f prime and g prime staying in the span of f and g, right, where these f prime and g prime are orthogonal. And when I replace fg by f prime g prime, I tighten the SPR inequality. So let me see how this works. This is the works. This is the left-hand side of the inequality. So if I want to tighten it by replacing fg by f prime g prime, I need to get a bigger thing with charms. So the left-hand side after I orthogonalize gets bigger, the right-hand side gets smaller. Norm probably norm minus f times minus g dominates norm minus f prime minus minus g. Does that make sense? So I start off with two vectors in L2. I can do an orthogonalization process staying in the span so that with these new orthogonal vectors, the SPR inequality is tightened. Tightened, right? And the corollary is to prove spr in L2, I can assume without loss of generality that my functions f and g in my subspace of L2, which I want to prove stable phase tribal or on, are well, one is normalized, one is in the ball. In the ball, and crucially, they're a thoma. This is scaling, and then this is the theorem. And why is this useful? Well, what happens when my vectors are orthogonal in this phase part of the thing? Well, the phase gets killed, right? So for orthogonal vectors, norm of f minus lambda g, where lambda is a unimodular scalar. As a uni modular scalar is just norm of squared plus norm of g squared square root of. So I killed the phase out of phase-retrieval problems. And importantly, because of the normalization, this is just some number between 1 and root 2. And if I don't care about the constant, I can assume it's just some number there. And so I can prove, if I prove, you know, so basically in the phase retrieval inequality, Basically, in the phasor tribal inequality, I can essentially assume this side is just some number between 1 and verse 2. I never have to deal with the case when this number is small. And that's one of the main obstructions in Bayes tribal as well. People have to deal with what if this quantity is small, but we can deliver an Eisenhower with some number losing one and root two. So this is the So, this is the kind of the way we actually build subspaces. But the cool thing is that this theorem works actually on the level of Bonic lattices. So, I can replace L2, well, in an appropriate sense, okay? I can replace L2 by any Bonic lattice, but you're going to ask me, well, what does orthogonal mean? Well, it turns out, since this part of the argument is two-dimensional, I'm a Hilbert space, up to some root twos, right? So I put. To some root twos, right? So I put some one over, well, I can't remember here. Put some root two here, right? And this inequality in the proof, we can actually prove on the point-wise scale. And then that will work for any Bonach lattice. And then the orthogonal condition means that, well, this is true up to a root 2. So you can, again, even in general, So, you can again, even in general bonic lattices, you can kill the case where this is a small number. So, just to prove SPR, it suffices to prove it on well-separated vectors. And a corollary of this is if you can prove SPR, just even uniform continuity on the ball, you get Lipschitz continuity on the whole space, which turns out to be useful. All right, so Vladimir, if you don't mind, two more minutes? Okay. Oh, Addie, sorry? Addy, sorry. So, the last theorem I want to state: well, I had this theorems of Barbain and Rudin and Rosenthal, which says, well, lambda p implies lambda p plus epsilon in certain cases, but not in others. It turns out we can prove an analog of that. So let me remind you that if B contain an L P has SBR, then it has this star property. Then it has this star property, right? This unknowable disjoint sequence. And so I can view E as a subspace LQ whenever Q is less than P, right? As a closed subspace, because the norms are equivalent on this subspace. Okay? So question, does SPR in L P imply SPR in LQ? In LQ, where Q is less than E, or some Q less than E. Okay? Because I can legitimately ask this question because the norms are equivalent on that subspace, but I have to be careful because the absolute values don't live in that subspace. And the answer is somehow opposite of the Burgerian Rosenbelt that group, but for reasons you can, well, I won't have time to explain. So when P is bigger than To its way. So when P is bigger than or equal to 2, the answer is no. So not even for any Q less than P. So we can build a subspace of L P that does SPR and LP, and though all the LQ norms are equivalent on that subspace, when you view it in LQ, it won't do SPR. You'll be able to recover it. You won't be able to see all the recovered vectors. Okay? But for P less than 2, the answer is yes. The answer is yes. SPR and LP will apply SPR and LQ for every choice of Q less than P, if P was, sorry, not less than P. And we can actually prove something very similar to the Kaj-Polchinsky dichotomy, but with a small change. So this is the last theorem of the total state. So you take omega mu, it would be a probability. probability, you take E contained in L P of mu and you assume P is less than 2. A critical assumption is P is less than 2. Then the following are equivalent. 1 E does SPR in L P right this is the proper frequency setting though. This is the proper frequency setting, the rule of time. Two, E does SPR in L1, and the one norm is equivalent to the P norm on E. And this will give you this result that for previous lessons you can interpolate to the SPR property down and extrapolate it down with this. Because, well, if you do SBR, Because, well, if you do SBR of L1 and the P norms of a coupon, you can go up all the way up to P. Okay? And the last one is very similar, if you know, Katch-Polchinski sets with a slight twist. Okay, so it's almost purely measure-theoretic characterization. There exists some alpha bigger than zero such that whenever I take f and g in my subspace and I look at the measure of the set of all t. Of the set of L T in omega such that F at T is bigger than this alpha proportion of its norm, and G of T is also bigger than this alpha proportion of its norm. This measure has to be bigger than alpha. So, if you know Lambda Cash-Polchinski theory, there's a version of Theory, there's a version of this for almost disjoint sequences, but it's not exactly this. Here, you require that F be bigger than alpha times its norm, and G be bigger than, oh, let's put it in alpha times its norm, and the measure of the set where this overlapping is occurring has to be bigger than somehow. So, somehow, all that matters really is the amount they overlap on a measure theoretic level. So, as a matter of the measure space, So, a lot of the measure space where they take it. It's not like you have some geeky thing and then some wide thing, and then they have, they're not destroyed because one of them is super geeky and one of the super wide. It's just about the measures of their supports, essentially. Which is not true when piece bigger than zero. Okay? All right, so that's all I have for today. Any questions for me? So instead of finding spaces that does SPR, is there any approach that is trying to see if the spaces that physicists need a workout does do SPR? Checking if these spaces have. Yeah, so there's, well, as Addie was saying, moving to Zurich, and one of the reasons is because. To Zurich, and one of the reasons is because there's two people in phase retrieval there, and they work on these concrete problems in phase retrieval. We could say some things they didn't know. So, hopefully, the answer to your question is yes. But, you know, since this was so recent, right, we didn't even have an example until last year, so we kind of just So we kind of just tried to produce examples and then the next step is to try and talk with the people who actually work on these problems and see which are applicable to them, which or what questions they like and see if body classes can help. Yeah. I mean clearly this is very based on function spaces, right? Sure. We haven't seen any continuous functions. Oh, okay. So CFK has an infinite dimensional SPR sub. K has an infinite-dimensional SPR subspace if and only if the cantor of indictor derivative is infinite. So you can characterize the spotic bias property of Z of K entirely in terms of the compact value. Timor very much helped with this. So he can probably, if you want to know the proof, he's the one to ask. So, okay, so for lack of time, I couldn't say everything, but you can go much more general. You can go to CFK spaces. Spaces, we could prove that. So, if you don't have an almost disjoint sequence in your span and you're order continuous, then you can find a further subspace that does SPR. So, we have a theorem that says, at least in order-continuous spaces, I don't know how to do it without this, if you don't have almost disjoint sequences, in the subspace you can filter out all disjointness. And well, I made a list of things that I think we could speak about, but. That I think you could speak about, but you're welcome to ask me. So, another comment about subspaces of C of K spaces is that, so every separable bonic space, for example, embeds into C of 01. If you looked at an almost disjoint sequence, two almost disjoint vectors in C of 01, then they add up, like, their stand looks like L infinity dimension two very. L-infinity dimension 2 very close to it. And so this says that every subspace of C of 0, 1, which doesn't contain two-dimensional subspaces that are arbitrarily close to L infinity dimension 2, does stable phase retrieval in C01. That's actually a thing, in the real case, because of this almost distributed characterization, isometric arguments, Bonic-based isometric arguments help. Arguments, Bonic-based isometric arguments help. So, for example, you can prove, say, Gaussians or P-stables do SPR where they can be found. And the reason is, well, if they don't, then the, well, like, say, Gaussians are L2 isometrically inside of LP. Well, what happens if you had almost disjoint vectors in there? Well, you'd be L2 isometrically on two-dimensional level, but you'd also be arbitrarily close to little LP of dimension two, night concubics. So you can use just pure monic space. So you can use just pure monic space arguments to prove. In the real case, in the complex case, there's one. Other questions?
