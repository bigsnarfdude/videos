Anyway, it's a pleasure. So, this is all joint work that I've done with Sophie Ham. And it's concerning triangulations of three manifolds. So, triangulations of three manifolds are decompositions into tetrahedra. So, in particular, I'm going to be working with cusps. Let me make sure that that works. Let me make sure that that works. So, cusped hyperbolic three-manifolds typically, and we're going to be looking at ideal tetrahedra. So, an example to keep in mind, this is the classic example due to Thurston, it's in his 1979 notes, is the figure eight knot admits a decomposition into two ideal tetrahedra. The gluing pattern of the tetrahedra is shown over here. Gluing pattern of the tetrahedra is shown over here on the right. If you take two tetrahedra and mark their faces as shown, and then you glue them together, you will get this complement of a knot on the left as shown. Okay, so there are four different categories of important tetrahedra, which I have listed on this slide a little bit confusingly, but let me make some marks to make this a little bit easier to understand. So the first one is topological. So, the first one is topological. So, you decompose the cusp manifold into ideal tetrahedra. And by work of Moise, I think it's how you say that, every three-manifold has a topological ideal triangulation. You can decompose every three-manifold into these. A little stronger than that is an angle structure. So, to get an angle structure, you put an angle. Angle on each edge. And I'll say a little bit more about angle structures later, but you need to make sure that you have things like the opposite. So if this edge here gets labeled alpha, so does this one. So opposite angles agree on a tetrahedron. Also, the sum of the angles around an ideal vertex adds up to pi. And then finally, the sum of the angles. And then finally, the sum of the angles, when you glue a bunch of these tetrahedra together, the sum of the angles around an edge adds up to 2π. So an angle structure gives some geometry to a triangulation, but it's not a complete hyperbolic structure necessarily, because if you look at a cross-section of these things, if you have just an angle structure, then these triangles could be gluing together in a way that gives shearing. So this angle sum is 2π, so this is. Angle sum is 2π, so this is fine, but you possibly have, well, you're possibly not gluing in a way that gives you something complete. So that leads to a geometric structure, which is mostly what we'll be talking about in this talk. This is where you decompose into positive volume hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra, and the gluing gives a complete structure. So for a geometric structure, So for a geometric structure, you upgrade your, rather than just attaching an angle on each edge, you attach a complex number, which is an edge invariant to each edge. And the product of these complex numbers is equal to one. These are Thurston's gluing equations. And then finally, the strongest notion here is that of the canonical triangulation. So there's an There's an Epstein-Pennerty composition, which is dual to the Ford domain. And this is not always a triangulation, but when it is, this is the strongest possible geometry on a triangulation, and we call this a canonical triangulation. So the strongest is a canonical triangulation. If it has a canonical triangulation, it has a geometric triangulation. If it has a geometric triangulation, If it has a geometric triangulation, then it has an angle structure, and everything has a topological structure. I should just say I've noted a couple of things here. We don't actually know if all cusp hyperbolic three manifolds have even an angle structure, but it is known that not complements have one due to the work of Hodgson, Rubinstein, and Segerman. Okay, so let's talk about the geometric triangulations. That's the topic of this. Triangulations. That's the topic of this talk. There's a conjecture that every cusped hyperbolic three-manifold has a geometric triangulation. It's somewhat hard to track down the history of this conjecture because it seems that in the 1990s, 80s and 90s, people were just, they just believed this. Nobody really checked. So, for example, Benedetti and Petronio wrote their book, their lovely book on Book, their lovely book on hyperbolic three-manifolds under the assumption that every three-manifold had a geometric triangulation. And it simplified a lot of the proofs in that book. But I think there's a paper in 2000, makes the first mention of this conjecture by Petronio and Forti, where they say that they were under the impression that everything had a geometric triangulation and realized that their proof of this matter wouldn't actually. Their proof of this matter wouldn't actually work. And so then they gave a couple of proofs of some of the results in this book that didn't require a geometric triangulation. So anyway, there's a lot of evidence for this conjecture, aside from the fact that it seems like it should completely be true and everybody believed it in the 1990s. So first of all, first example is Snappy. So there's a lot of experimental evidence for this. We haven't found any counterexamples using Examples using computational tools. Virtually, this is true. So Luo, Schleimer, and Tillman showed that every cusp hyperbolic three manifold has a finite cover that has a geometric triangulation. This was in the 2000s. And then this Epstein-Penner, this decomposition into canonical. Decomposition into canonical polyhedra that I mentioned, you can always get convex ideal polyhedra. And then often you can just subdivide those into geometric triangulation. So that's some evidence for. You can see I've also got this evidence against those. So Young Choi actually found a hyperbolic orbifold without, sorry, I can't read that. So this is without a geometric triangulation. This comes from a Dane filling of the From a Dane filling of the figure eight knot, in fact, and she showed that there's no possible way to decompose this into ideal or into geometric triangulation, tetrahedra. And then also against it, Epstein-Penner. So this decomposition into canonical polyhedra, everyone thought that at first, well, we can just subdivide that and that's going to give us our geometric triangulation. But in fact, there are canonical polyhedra that are Canonical polyhedra that arise that you cannot subdivide without introducing flat tetrahedra. So, this is possibly evidence against it. But still, it's been open now for a long time since people realized this was a gap, and there haven't been proofs or no counterexamples yet. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about a theorem that's related to this. This. What we show with what I show with Sophie Ham is that all not complement in S3 that have a sufficiently highly twisted diagram do admit a geometric triangulation. And so I have to tell you what this sufficiently highly twisted diagram means. So what I'm going to be looking at are diagrams of knots and their twist regions. So a twist region is as A twist region is, as shown in this picture here, is where you have two strands of a knot that are twisting around each other maximally. Maximally, meaning it's not adjacent to another twist region to the right or to the left. And this is going to have some number of crossings, which I've labeled by CI. So over here in this figure, I've drawn a picture of a highly twisted A highly twisted knot. So we define highly twisted in the following manner. There exist constants C1 through Cn, so one for each twist region, such that you have at least CI crossings in each twist region. So lots and lots of twisting around these. So over here, this is This is a this would have C1 crossings in this twist region and C2 crossings in this twist region, and we could guarantee that this has a geometric triangulation. I just I realized I wrote here in the bottom, this is actually a two-bridge knot, and this is one family of hyperbolic knots, which we already knew admitted ageometric triangulation. And this is due to work of Francois. Francois Garrito and Fuder extending some of his work in the same appendix to that paper. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about this theorem. My plan for the 15 minutes that I have or so is just to kind of step through some of the ideas of this proof. And it's somewhat similar to some work that I've done in that. In that, to get a highly twisted knot, you get this by doing hydain fillings on parent manifolds. But the thing that's new in this case is we've got to look at the triangulations of these things and their geometry. So the basic proof ingredients is we start with these links, link complements called fully augmented links, and these have very explicit geometry. And I've drawn a picture here that shows you how you get these. Shows you how you get these. So you start out with an original diagram where you've got these twist regions that have lots of crossings in each twist region. And then to the diagram, you add this little unknot. So this loop here. So this is called a crossing circle. And so you insert it to the diagram. Or what you're really doing is drilling from the complement. And that's going to be a little bit more. And that's going to give you a completely new manifold in which all of the twist regions have these little unknots in them. Okay. Step number two is you remove pairs of crossings. So this, the manifold with two crossings here is homeomorphic to the manifold with zero crossings there. And so we can just remove these in pairs and we get something in this stage where. Something in this stage where every one of the twist regions has either zero or one crossings. And this is called a fully augmented link. So if we do this to the example that I had on the previous page, we had exactly two twist regions and we would end up with something that looked like this. So either this or possibly with one or one crossing in one of the twist regions. Okay, so fully augmented link is over here. Is over here. In order to return to the original link, you do Dane filling. You attach a solid torus with the one-on-end slope. And when you do this Dane filling, you put back in all of those two end crossings that you removed. Okay, and so that's this last thing to get back. All right, so what we're going to be looking at is the geometry of these fully augmented links, and we're going to look at their triangulations. Now, to do the Dane filling, we need triangulations of that as well. So, this is the second step of the proof, which is we're going to be looking at layered solid tori. And these are nice triangulations of solid tori. The topology of these triangulations was studied by Jayco and Rubenstein. They put a paper on the archive around 2006. They have not published it, but there's a lot of really great work in there. There's a lot of really great work in there. Ben Burton also has written a lot on layered solid tori that has been published. So they've gone through a lot of the topology of these things. And then the geometry of layered solid tori was studied by Gary Toad and Schleimer. So we're going to make use of both of these pieces of information to get our geometric triangulations. Okay, so let me say something about fully augmented links, and some of you. Links and some of you know a lot about this, but it's these are really really fun links. They've got some really explicit hyperbolic geometry that makes them easy to play with, and they can give you a lot of really good examples. Over here on the far left, I've got a picture of a fully augmented link here with two crossing circles. And remember that you'll have either a zero or one crossing in each, well, if you. In each, well, former twist region coming from your knot. So here I've got one crossing in the bottom, zero in the top. And we're going to decompose this into two beautiful geometric hyperbolic polyhedra. And the first step here is to cut these shaded two-punctured disks bounded by crossing circles. So I've kind of tried to illustrate that by separating these two disks up here and down here. Oops, wrong button to give you this first step in the decomposition. And then once you've separated these, for all of the ones where you have a single crossing, this is step two. You untwist that. So you just rotate it. At this point, there's a very obvious reflection symmetry. So in the screen here, you can see that if you reflect in the screen, you're going to get exactly the same link when you have these shaded disks that are poking. When you have these shaded discs, so they're poking straight out, then they will continue to poke out when you reflect. So we're going to cut along the plane of symmetry there. That's step number three. This is going to give me two identical pieces. It's going to have these different faces now. You've got these gray half disks and you've got these white faces on the plane at this point. And then you do what you typically do in hyperbolic geometry. Do what you typically do in hyperbolic geometry. You take all of the components, all of the things that used to be links or link components, you shrink down to be ideal vertices, and that's what's shown here in figure four. I've just taken these strands and turned them and just made them a little bit smaller. And this is it. I mean, this is the topological picture of the object that you get by this decomposition. It turns out that it is completely geodesic. So these shaded faces you're looking at are ideal triangles. Shaded faces you're looking at are ideal triangles, so they're totally geodesic. The white faces that you are looking at, they came from this reflective symmetry, which by Maastar rigidity, that will give you a geodesic surface. And so the white faces are totally geodesic. And so if you lift to H3, the white faces lift to give you a really nice circle packing. And the shaded faces are the correspond to interstitial triangles between those. Between those. And then, so if you remove this circles corresponding to all of them, then you end up with this hyperbolic polyhedron. Okay, so you can study these by studying circle packings. And there's a lot of literature out there on circle packings. All right, so we want to triangulate these. So, so this gives you, this is a nice ideal, convex ideal polyhedron. We want to triangulate it. So, remember, I told you that Epstein. So remember, I told you that Epstein-Penner gave us a nice triangulation, or not a triangulation, a nice convex ideal polyhedron or decomposition into ideal polyhedra. And when we triangulated theirs, things didn't always work. Because we've got this reflective symmetry, things are going to work here. So I can kind of walk through what that looks like on the next slide. Just before I do, for the next slide, I'm going to take one of the ideal vertices on this polyhedron. I'm going to take it to infinity and we're going to. Polyhedron, I'm going to take it to infinity, and we're going to be looking at this from a top-down point of view with our heads at infinity. Okay, so here's the view: if you a view from the crossing circle cusp. So in particular, take an ideal vertex that used to be a crossing circle. When you do that, you are going to get your shaded face, basically, this interstitial triangle. Now looks like this. This is a triangle with a vertex at infinity and a vertex here and here. And then there's one on this side. Vertex here and here, and then there's one on this side. And then your two white faces are going to be parallel, and you get this rectangle. So each of your polyhedron, when you take an ideal vertex to infinity, you get a rectangle. And here where I've got the dot, dot, dot, this is what happens to the rest of the circle packing. So there's a really nice circle packing in here, but because you always have these interstitial triangles as well, you know that there's going to be that part of the circle packing looks like two parallel straight lines and then these. Parallel straight lines, and then these two circles, like so, and then everything else is in the middle here. Okay, so to subdivide this into, we want to subdivide it into geometric triangulations, what we're going to do is we're going to add one more face by adding a big, this is a rectangle, so there's going to be a circle. This that's me drawing a circle is not so great at seven o'clock in the morning, but you can. But you can add a circle here on the outside that is not going to interact with any of these other circles inside the circle packing. So, this is going to be a new face, a new geodesic that's disjoint from all of those. And then once you've done that, just turn, subdivide, we've got this cusp that we turn into a rectangle only, or sorry, it's a rectangular prism. We just add a diagonal to that. Okay, so let me let me say that one more time. Okay, so let me let me say that one more time. So, for this particular cusp, when we put in this bigger circle that I've shown here, we turn this into a prism that looked like this, and we subdivide that into two tetrahedra. Okay, so that's two, two tetrahedra. We want to make everything tetrahedra. If you do this for every single cusp, then you will be left with a A um sorry, you do this for every crossing circle cusp. Uh, you'll be left with um a new um a lot of tetrahedra going into your crossing circle cusps, and then you'll have this other ideal polyhedron that's kind of that's that's central. For that, we're just going to cone everything to uh to a triangulation. So, because it's convex, we're actually we will get um At geometric tetrahedra. This is what everybody thought you could do in the Epstein-Penner case, actually, as well. You just cone and you'll get ideal tetrahedra. It's true. The thing that's different with this case and theirs is then when you have a reflection here. So you have two convex ideal polyheder that you're going to glue along these white faces by a reflection. By a reflection. Once you have subdivided one of these into tetrahedra, you can subdivide the other one identically by this reflection. And then when you glue by the reflection, you are going to be gluing triangles to triangles from the beginning. You're not going to be gluing the problem with the Epstein penner is sometimes they had a face where they had a triangulation. They had chosen, say, this particular diagonal of a square, and they were trying to glue that. Of a square, and they were trying to glue that to a face with a different diagonal of the square and had to insert something flat. Because we're gluing by reflection, this is never going to happen. And so, in our case, we end up with a geometric triangulation just by basically doing this very simple construction here. Okay, so that's convenient. All right, the next thing I have to tell you about are these layered solid tori. These are also basically this, this is. Basically, this is a super fun project because two of my favorite types of mathematics, if you haven't played with fully augmented links, you should because they're fun. If you haven't played with layered solid tori, you should because they're also very fun. So a solid torus, we're going to triangulate it. So its boundary is a torus, and we're going to be looking at the simplest triangulations of the torus. And these are just two triangles total. You pick, right? You have a you pick a You pick, right? You have a parallelogram and then you pick a diagonal. The slopes on the torus are isotopy classes of simple Bose curves. And if you have two different triangulations, then they're going to differ by a sequence of diagonal exchanges, where a diagonal exchange just takes, well, it's as shown, it takes this diagonal to this diagonal. Okay, these are encoded by the fairy graph. So the fairy graph tells you. So the fairy graph tells you, it gives you all possible triangulations of the torus, so labeled by their slope. So over here, if I have 0, 1, infinity, this triangulation, the torus here has slopes infinity, 0, and 1. And then if you go across an edge in the fairy triangulation, you get over to, if we go this way, over to over if we go this way we get over to one half that just switches the it switches out uh what does that do that switches out the infinity edge with the one half edge and so now this new triangulation of the torus here has slopes one zero and now one half and this is this is true as you step anywhere in this very graph so this is really fun over here on the right you can see this diagonal exchange it's This diagonal exchange, it can be realized by layering a tetrahedron onto the tori. So if I started out with a triangulation of the torus that looked like this, I just put a tetrahedron on as shown here, and that's going to have the tetrahedron has the one triangulation on the bottom and the other triangulation on the top. So if I have a path in the fairy graph, I get a path of triangulations of the torus, and these are related. Triangulations of the torus, and these are realized by layering tetrahedra on this on tori. And when you do a lot of layering, you'll get a space that's homotopy equivalent to, I guess I've been describing these as triangulations of the torus. I'm really going to be puncturing the torus. So we're going to get triangulations of punctured torus cross I. So remove the vertex in each case. All right, so to construct a layered solid torus, you start with an initial triangular. You start with an initial triangulation and then you go out somewhere to a meridian. So the meridian is going to be this, it's going to bound the disk in the solid torus. And you step through the ferry graph following a geodesic path, basically, until you get to the tetrahedron, or sorry, the triangle in the ferry graph right before your slope. And this is going to tell you, this is going to give you a bunch of tetrahedra. So here we have. Tetrahedra. So here we have one, and then we're going to add another one over here, and so on and so on. And you stack these tetrahedra until and you stop just before you go over to the triangle of the layered solid torus. And there you want this slope M, which is going to be obtained from a diagonal exchange. So M is the dotted one here. You want that slope M to be homotopically trivial. And so rather than putting a new tetrahedron on there, you just fold the boundary of the tetrahedron that you have. The boundary of the tetrahedron that you have, and that gives you this homotopically trivial slope. Okay, so that's your layered solid torus. Just looking at the time, it's about time for me to wrap up. Anyway, to get the geometry on these, you put angle structures on them. This was my second triangulation, and this was studied by Gary Toad and Schleimer. So I'm not going to go through this in a lot of detail, but the point is that Is that Gary Toad and Schleimer showed that if you have mild conditions on the dihedral angles of a layered solid torus, then you obtain an angle structure on that, and then you can upgrade this using a theorem of Cassiden and Riven that will give you an actual geometric triangulation. So, with some mild conditions on these layered solitauri, we get geometric triangulations. Okay, so we want to put these with Okay, so we want to put these with what I have. I have geometric triangulations of fully augmented links where all of my crossing circles are triangulated like so. And I'm going to glue to that a geometric triangulation of a solid torus where my boundary looks like so. So the problem is these don't quite match. So what we can do is we'll just simply adjust the triangulation of my fully augmented links, kind of in a manner that was similar to above. So we have these. To above. So we have these. This is in 3D. We've got all of these edges are poking up like so. This is still a rectangle. So you can just add another face to this. I guess I tried drawing that over here. You add another face, and then you can subdivide that. And that's just going to insert more geometric tetrahedra. But now your cusps are going to match when you're done with that. So I can remove, there will be two tetrahedra in my layered solid torus coming out like so. Layered solid torus coming out like so, and I can just remove them and I can put in my layered solid torus. And everything is going to match if I am careful. And the tool that gives that to me is Thurston's hyperbolic Dane Surgery Theorem, which says that if you have a high enough Dane filling, then you can deform your ideal tetrahedra, getting a spun triangulation in the cusp. But instead of having a spun triangulation, that'll give you an incomplete structure with these two tetrahedra. Pull them out, put in the same tetrahedron of the layered solid torus, and you are done. And that's basically the proof of our theorem. And then one note is we don't, because we're using this Thurston theorem, we don't know how many crossings we need to remove. To remove in order to get this result. So it's not effective, but it's still a nice more evidence that not submit geometric triangulation. So I'm going to stop there. Thank you. Thank you very much. So I think we're a little bit behind. Maybe just time for one or two quick questions and we'll move on to the next speaker. We'll move on to the next speaker. May I ask a question? So, if you replace instead of highly twisting, if you replace with complicated rational tangles, what happens? Yeah, so a complicated replace a complicated rational tangle rather than one of these big twist regions. That seems like a really good idea. The thing about Like a really good idea. The thing about the highly twisting is it's just a Dane surgery, and I know how to triangulate the complement of a layered solid torus. With a rational tangle, you would just need a rational, you'd need a geometric triangulation of that. And then you'd need to make sure that your geometric triangulation of that matched up with the boundary of the tangle. It'd probably be some sort of a four-punctured sphere. So you'd need to make sure that the geometry matched. So that's where you it would be probably be tricky. But it seems Tricky. But it seems that the idea might work, but making the geometry match, you don't have the same tools available. Thank you very much. So I have been interested in the relation between geometric structure and conveyance notation. Yes. Yeah, it's a good idea. Yeah. Okay, let's thank Jessica once more for her talk and get ready for the next one. And get ready for the next one.
