And also to speak. I think a lot of really exciting conversations. I'm sure that'll continue over the next couple of days. So I wanted to tell you about a couple different pieces of work in line with a certain perspective on fracton phases that I'll try to explain to you. So one is some work with Leo, it's based on this paper. It's based on this paper, which is just about to appear in PRL. Although I'll give a quite different perspective than what actually appears in the paper. So it's kind of complementary to what's actually discussed in our paper. And this is some other work also with Leo and with students Marvin Chi, which is sort of half written up and should appear on the archive soon. Okay, so for this audience, I hardly need to tell you. I hardly need to tell you what a fracton phase is, right? These are quantum phases of matter with gapped excitations of restricted mobility. And at least for me in this talk, fractons will always be, in other subdimensional excitations, they'll always really be fractional in the sense that you can't create one by any local process. Of course, there are other fracton-like excitations, for example, enforced by symmetries like dipolar symmetries. But in principle, they are locally creatable here. They are locally creatable. Here, my fractons and planons and linons are really fractional excitations. So, what I do want to talk about, though, a little bit is motivation. So, you know, if you're here, you probably know that there are plenty of different reasons to be interested in fracton phases. So, I'll give you one particular motivation, certainly not the only one, but it's one that I think is a pretty exciting reason to be thinking about fractons right now. Fractons right now. Okay, so this is kind of a quote-unquote standard paradigm for the theory of many-body systems. We like to think in terms of some kind of renormalization group to focus on the physics at longer length scales and lower energies. And we like to do that because we expect that when we focus on those low energy properties, there will be some universality that emerges and some kind of simplicity. And so we expect some. And so we expect some simpler, effective description to emerge that lets us ignore many of the microscopic details. And going along with this, there's a notion of phases and phase transitions. So phases are universality classes of, well, they're equivalence classes of ground states, let's say, of a quantum system that share certain universal properties. And usually we like to associate phases with Usually, we like to associate phases with fixed points of the renormalization group. And in some cases, that can be made very precise and very concrete. The idea is you flow to very, very low energy, and you have a description that includes all the universal properties of your phase and throws out all the non-universal properties. So, and going along with this, because part of Rg is going to long distances, so there's some coarse graining of the lattice scale physics, and we usually expect there to be some condition. And we usually expect there to be some continuum effective theory that emerges at long distances, which is some kind of quantum field theory. So one reason to be interested in fracton phases is that this paradigm fails for them and pretty dramatically. So it turns out, which I won't really have time to substantiate in detail in this talk, but you can ask me later if this is not familiar to you, that fracton phase. To you, that fracton phases can't be fixed points of any conventional RG procedure. You can make simple arguments that that's true. The quick argument is just look at the system size dependence of the ground state degeneracy in the X cube model. That's not compatible with it being an RG fixed point because the ground state degeneracy should be an invariant under an RG step. Okay, so now you can make fracton phases into RG fixed points. Fracton phases into Rg fixed points, but you have to radically modify what you mean by Rg. So, all the ways that we know of doing this involve actually integrating out some low-energy degrees of freedom. Okay, I'm thinking of like foliated RG where one integrates out some toric code layers. Okay, but that's very unusual. Normally, you're not allowed to do that in the usual RG philosophy. One thing this suggests is that if there is a continuum description of some fracton phase, it's likely to be beyond. Phase, it's likely to be beyond a usual quantum field theory because the RG procedure is so unusual. Okay, and it's still an open question whether there are any nice continuum theories of fracton phases at all. So here NICE has a technical meaning, although not very well defined, which means doesn't hide some strong dependence on the UV physics. There are definitely a number of continuum theories of fractons, but I think all of them, one way or another, seem to hide a strong dependence on the UV physics. Strong dependence on the UV physics. And so that doesn't mean they're not nice in a colloquial sense. I think some of them are probably quite useful. But I don't know if we have any nice continuum theories of fracton phases in this sense, and I'm not even sure if it's possible. And so this points out an even larger issue, bigger than fractons, which is that we really don't understand adequately how quantum phases of matter are related to quantum field theory. And if you ask me, And if you asked me, or probably most people, 10 years ago, I would have said, you know, it's an issue to understand how this works in many cases, how this relationship works. But in terms of general principles, we know how this ought to go. But now I would say, I think there are other reasons beyond fractons to say this too, that this is really a serious issue. We don't understand this well enough, and we need to think about this more. And fractons is a good venue to try to think about these issues. Andrei? Think about these issues. I have a question on the statements like S and A. So, the same relation between A and B, and define A and B. How do you find quantum field theory when we say quantum fields? Well, quantum, I don't think there's any, maybe this is being recorded, so maybe I'll get myself in trouble, but I don't think there's any well-defined notion of quantum field theory. For me, a quantum field theory is a continuum theory with some kind of RG procedure. It's not enough to write down some formal continuum Lagrangian, but that maybe is okay. Lagrangian. That maybe is okay at the classical level, but at the quantum level, we know there can be all kinds of problems with that. So you really need an RG procedure to make sense of that. So you can have a theory with a cutoff, but then you can imagine maybe getting rid of the cutoff using an RG. That's a sort of very traditional high-energy physics perspective. But that's the sort of thing that you need, I think. So quantum field theory is something like that. Do you include Bob and Reising theories? Sure. That's why you can think of them as RG fixed points that don't have Raja. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm not assuming I'm not requiring that there has to be a Lagrangian. You know, there there are classes of QFTs that are continuum theories that are very well defined. So TQFTs can be defined in a mathematically rigorous way. You don't even need an RG there because they're actually formulated in the continuum. Although, you know, that's also, that works because there are no low energy degrees of, local degrees of freedom, so that's not the usual case. All right. Okay. So good. So good. So, what does this have to do with symmetry, which is what this talk is supposed to be about? So, just a couple points. The first point is here, I'm going to focus on global symmetries of some fracton phase with fractional excitations, not symmetries of a subsystem SPT that's then going to be gauged to get a fracton phase. There's a lot more work. Many people in this room have worked on this topic. And there are some connections, but I won't explore them in this talk. Okay, so there's a little bit, there's less work, I think, on just looking at the global symmetries of fracton phases and their effective descriptions themselves. So why do this? Well, one thing that's certainly reasonable to hope is that if you have unusual phases, their effective theories, whether in the lattice or continuum, might have some unusual symmetries. And studying those symmetries is a route to understanding that's independent of particular constructions, right? We have lots of models. We have lots of model constructions of fractons, but we want to abstract away from that a little bit if we want to understand issues like universality and effective low energy theories. And thinking about symmetries is a useful tool on the path to doing that. And so I think thinking about symmetries can help to find either quantum field theories or quantum field theory-like theories for fractons. Something that will come up later in the talk is there's also a connection between symmetries. Connection between symmetries and geometry. So, an important idea in quantum field theory is that one thing you should be able to do with the quantum field theory is put it on spatial or space-time manifolds of different topologies and also with different geometrical structures depending on what kind of QFT you have, like an orientation or spin structure or metric or something like that. So, for fracton phases, we mostly don't know what kind of geometrical structures are needed. What kind of geometrical structures are needed to quote unquote put a fracton phase on an arbitrary space or even space-time? In some cases, we have a good idea about that. And you can actually sometimes discover something about the geometrical structure hidden in a fracton phase by thinking in terms of symmetry. So, I'll show you an example of that. Okay, so I'm going to tell you about two different things. Okay, so the first thing Okay, so the first thing is, and they're rather different from one another. So the first is a story about the role of global symmetries in the scalar charge theory in 2 plus 1d, U1 scalar charge theory. One of the simplest fracton models that we have, perhaps the simplest U1 fracton model. Okay, so this has an electric field and a gauge potential that are symmetric tensors. And the Gauss's law is this double derivative Gauss's law. Gauss's law is this double derivative Gauss's law. The charge is a scalar, the magnetic field is a spatial vector. And if you only care about the photons, you can write down, they're gapless photon modes, two of them, they linearly disperse and the velocities are different. If you only care about those, you can write down an E squared plus B squared type Hamiltonian. And you can do this on the lattice if the theory is compact, meaning that the gauge potential is 2π periodic and the electricians. Is 2π periodic and the electric field is an integer-valued variable. You really have to be on the lattice, I think, if you want this theory to be well-defined. Or if you don't care about that, you can at least write down a theory for the photons in the continuum. An important point about this theory is that you should think about it being an effective theory in two different settings. So it can definitely be an effective theory for a local bosonic lattice model. And we also know, thanks to the work of Michael Pretko. Work of Michael Pretko and Leo, that this is a dual description of the ordered phase of a 2 plus 1d quantum crystalline solid. Now, I don't have time to get into this really, but I think the physics in these two settings seems to be quite different if you go beyond the Gaussian level of this theory. And really, you should think about these as being two different theories, actually. Their ultra-low energy description is the same E squared. Energy description is the same e squared plus b squared, but my point of view is these are just different from one another. If you try to go beyond the Gaussian level, there are differences that seem pretty substantial. And so I'm going to focus on number one in this talk, partly because I understand it a lot better. I really know in detail how to understand this theory beyond the Gaussian level, and I'll tell you about part of that. Okay, right. Now, and this is what's different from the perspective in our paper, which is more. In our paper, which is more focused on elasticity theory. And the punchline of what I'm going to tell you is this is actually a familiar theory, but one with unusual symmetries. So here's a well-known fact about this theory, well-known but not often emphasized, but it's actually important for what I'm going to say, which is that this is not really a fracton theory, although it's in the fracton family. So if you consider the electrostatics of an isolated fracton, Electrostatics of an isolated fracton, okay, you can solve for the electric field and you find that it goes like log of the distance. So that means the electrostatic energy density goes like log squared and it diverges at large r. So an isolated fracton is not stable because its energy density blows up. So strictly speaking, fractons are not well-defined excitations in this theory at long scales. At some intermediate scales, they can be, but at the longest scales, from a strict point of view, there aren't really. From a strict point of view, there aren't really any fractons in this theory. Now, just a note: if you go up one dimension, this is different. The energy density falls off with distance. The energy still diverges, but that's okay. It's okay for the energy to be infinite, but the energy density has to fall off at infinity. And that's familiar if you think about vortices in a 2D superfluid. There also the energy is infinite. It diverges logarithmically, but the energy density falls off. Rhythmically, but the energy density falls off. And there's no problem talking about vortices in 2D superfluids, they're stable. But here there are not really stable fractons. So that's going to come back. So here's a question about this theory, which is an important question if you want to think about it as a possible low-energy effective theory of a bosonic lattice model. Okay, you might want to know what's the difference between compact and non-compact versions of this theory. And here's an old And here's an old and familiar story that I should remind you about. If you think about an ordinary U1 gauge theory in 2 plus 1 dimensions with, let's say, gapped matter, and say it's compact, we know this is confining due to proliferation of monopoles in space-time. Now, a nice way to think about that is in terms of symmetry. You observe that the non-compact theory has a U1 global symmetry where this is the conserved current and it's a magnetic symmetry. The conserved charge is just the magnetic flux. Charges, just the magnetic flux. And the point is that even if you take the compact theory and you impose this symmetry, maybe by hand, then it has a stable deconfined phase. But if you don't do anything special, there will be monopoles that are charged under this symmetry appearing in your action, and they'll destabilize the phase, the deconfined phase. So what we see is that this way of telling this story tells us that this question, compact versus non-compact gauge potential, is really a question. Non-compact gauge potential is really a question about symmetry in some sense. That's a nice way to think about it. And so maybe a better question to ask about the scalar charge theory is what are its possible magnetic global symmetries? All right? So, and the way to do that is to start with a non-compact version of the theory. So here's the non-compact. Now that this is in space-time, Euclidean space-time, okay, this is the Lagrangian for that theory. This is basically e squared plus b squared. Everything is written. b squared. Everything is written in terms of the vector potential aij and a time component a tau. So if you play around with this theory, thinking about the previous story, you right away find that there are two conserved currents whose conserved densities are the x and y components of the magnetic field. But notice that these are not independent. If you look at the spatial components of the current, this alpha xy appears twice, and because of that, there's actually And because of that, there's actually a third conserved current, which you can, it's really a derived quantity, but it's made out of these two and it has some explicit position dependence. Okay, so you can think of there being, you can think of this in different ways. One way of thinking about it is there are three U1 conserved currents here. Okay? And so then you might ask, well, what happens if we break some or all of these symmetries? Because maybe they won't be there microscopically. Microscopically. So to address that, it's kind of hard in this theory because any operator that's a polynomial in gauge potentials doesn't transform under these symmetries. That's true just because if you compute del mu j, it's just literally zero at the classical level. And so there are no manifest local operators here that are charged. That's just like what usually happens in U1 gauge theory. And you have to go to a dual representation. Theory, and you have to go to a dual representation to expose operators that actually transform under the symmetry. So, if you turn the standard duality crank, okay, using Hubbard-Stertonovich fields and so on, you can do it either on the lattice or in the continuum, you get a theory of two fields, Hx and Hy. In the continuum, these are just real fields. If you do this on the lattice, they start life as integer-valued fields, and then you can soften the discreteness. Soften the discreteness constraint by adding cosine terms. So it's a kind of sine-Gordon theory. Now the thing to notice about this is the first term has this weird form, and actually hx and hy are coupled together. So it's not just two copies of some real scalar field. It's a coupled theory of two real scalar fields. And if you study the symmetries of this theory, you find that there are shift symmetries where you just shift hx by a constant, shift x. Just shift hx by a constant, shift hy by another constant. That's totally familiar. But there's also weird position-dependent symmetry where you shift them both by some position-dependent linear function. And not surprisingly, the shift symmetries are associated with these capital J currents, whereas the space-dependent symmetry is associated with this little J mu current, the one that has the explicit position dependence. Position dependence. Uh no, it's not. So this is a different, I want to emphasize this point. It has the same Lagrangian, but this is not elasticity. Okay, so elasticity beyond the Gaussian level is different from this theory. It has a different phase diagram. There are constraints on what it can do that are different from the constraints on what this theory can do. So the Lagrangian is this may be a little. So the Lagrangian is, this may be a little pedantic, but it's actually a really important point, I think, for what I'm saying. This is absolutely not elasticity theory. If I just look at this Lagrangian and know nothing else, if you haven't this Lagrangian, can I look at it and already see it's not elasticity? Well, you know, you have to have some. If you just write down, you need to say something about how the theory is completed in the UV, I think. The theory is not defined if you don't say something about that. If you don't say something about that. And I think that saying the things you have to say are different for the theory I'm imagining and for elasticity. I actually don't really know in a completely detailed and precise way how to give a UV completion of quantum elasticity theory. In this case, I know because I know how to regularize this on the lattice and so on. But that would be different from elasticity. At the level of just writing down the Lagrange. At the level of just writing down the Lagrangian, at the classical level, there's no distinction. Yeah, that's certainly true. Yeah. Okay. So in the elasticity formulation of it or the interpretation of it, Cauchy is a substrate for those. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, and I'll mention that, right. Okay, so the kind of most interesting, well, maybe I'll mention something else that's related. Else that's related. So the most interesting question is: what's the role of this little J mu symmetry? Because that's the kind of unusual one. Because without it, you'd really just have a theory of two XY models, or more precisely, a theory of two real scalar fields with a shift symmetry, and absolutely nothing is unusual. It's a totally conventional theory. And in particular, without that symmetry, you can deform the Lagrangian to a much more standard one where you just have decoupled HX and H. Where you just have decoupled HX and HY scalar fields. And the same is true. It has to be true because this is really just a dual description. The same is true in the tensor gauge theory language, but it's not manifest. It's not obvious in that language. Now, in the elasticity formulation, what does this correspond to? Coming back to Leo's question, so breaking a little J mu symmetry would correspond to coupling your crystal to a substrate. To coupling your crystal to a substrate which breaks the rotational symmetry but still translation invariant. So you could do that by having a substrate which is another crystal whose period is incommensurate with that of the crystal that you started with. Okay, so there's a version of this breaking in the elasticity, kind of parallel elasticity story. So from this point of view, there's a consequence, which is that anything unusual about this theory, this tensor gauge theory, is rather fragile. Theory is rather fragile, and you need to have the J-Meosimetry microscopically. And so it's an open question whether or not this can occur naturally in some local bosonic model. I have some vague thoughts about this that we could talk about offline. Yeah. So so here here you want to realize this uh quasi-one dimensional symmetry, right? You just want you know, you want the conservation along each uh direction. Each direction, something like that. Yeah, there it is. So, I think there is a natural, of course, a natural realization of that. It's some p-band code atom system. There's a PX boson, PY bolt, and each hop along one direction, and you couple them together. There is a way to make a couple of systems. Actually, you can see that there's a course at one dimensional conservation in those systems. I see. Okay, I'm not, the examples I was thinking. The examples I was thinking about are a little bit different from that. But okay, maybe you can tell me more about that offline. I don't understand that example, but I certainly believe there should be an example. Yeah, so back then we were trying to realize some of the earlier model when Matthew and Leon did with the, well, it's not a new theory, but actually with a system in a one-dimensional thing. Right. But the P-valent called Adam was actually one of the things without the data. Right, yeah, okay, good. Yeah, okay, good. So you mean even with a little J cons conservation? Yeah, I think Tinka is saying that that system naturally has this symmetry like this. Right. One atom just hopping one direction, the other atom hopping in the other direction, you couple them together. It's a different theory, but still you have this kind of quasi-one-dimensional symmetry. That might actually have more symmetry than this, though. That might have a row-column symmetry, it sounds like, which is actually a much bigger symmetry than this. Yeah, this actually is a part of the symmetry. Yeah. So you might be able to break it down to this. So, you might be able to break it down to this in a natural way. Yeah. Okay, good. So, in the interest of time, I'm actually not going to talk about this part. Yeah, let me just skip that due to our busy schedule. You can ask if there's a higher dimensional version of this story. There's a big difference. If you go up a dimension, the fractons are actually stable. So it's a little bit, it looks less likely that the dual, you know, that you can have a dual description of the. That you can have a dual description of the 3 plus 1D scalar charge theory as a familiar theory with unfamiliar symmetries. But you can argue that actually there has to be some parallel story, although it'll involve magnetic one-form symmetries rather than ordinary global symmetries. And I don't know what the physical consequences of that are yet, because I haven't worked it out yet. All right, so let's move on to the next part in the interest of time. So now I want to switch gears and talk about the And talk about the role of symmetry in a set of condensation mechanisms for fracton phases. And I'm actually, in this talk, I'm going to focus on the simplest one that we understand the best. And so the kind of symmetry that's going to come up is a Z2 one-form symmetry. So I have to start by telling you more about what a Q-form or one-form symmetry is. Okay, so here A is an abelian group, okay, and I'm working in space, not in space-time, which is different from what you find if you read the Piner. From what you'll find if you read the high energy physics literature. So the symmetry operators are supported on closed d minus q manifolds, like this. And on a fixed manifold, they just form a representation of the symmetry group, and they always commute, if the manifolds cross each other or whatever. And going along with these symmetry operators, there are charged objects that you can think of as supported on Q-dimensional manifolds, possibly with background. Manifolds, possibly with boundary. And the idea is that if you have a D minus Q manifold and a Q manifold, they intersect transversely at points in a natural way. And the symmetry charge of this two-dimensional object you can get by adding up contributions from all these intersection points. So that's why this is natural. And the reason that its Q-forms symmetry is because the charged objects are in some sense Q-dimensional. Okay, that's where the Q goes. So what does this have to do with fractons? Fractons. Well, one of the things that higher form symmetry does is it gives a precise language for describing condensation of extended objects, like say strings, independent of particular microscopic models. And we know that there are a whole bunch of condensation mechanisms for fracton phases where you condense certain 1D extended objects, and you can put these under the heading of P-string condensation. So it was actually discussed yesterday. Discussed yesterday. All right. Okay. There are also U1 versions of this that I won't have time to talk about. So a reasonable goal is to try to put these two things together. Can we understand these P-string condensation mechanisms in terms of higher form symmetry? Because after all, they're condensation of some extended objects. And this should be useful to do because the ingredients that go into these P-string condensation mechanisms. P-string condensation mechanisms. You start with a state, which is usually some stack of familiar phases or a bunch of decoupled familiar phases. All of those are ordinary. They have a QFT description. And then you couple them and condense something in an unusual way, and you get to a fracton phase. So if you can understand the symmetries involved in that condensation mechanism, that might help for developing some quantum field theory-like theory of the fracton phase. And there's also a connection. Phase. And there's also a connection to geometrical structures like foliation. Alright, so now what I want to do is talk about briefly about three different kinds of one-form symmetry, one of which is related to fractons, and the other two are kind of more familiar. In order to do that in a precise way, I want to give a slightly different viewpoint on one-form symmetry. So let's now take our space. So let's now take our space to be a closed three-dimensional manifold. And I said symmetry operators are supported on two manifolds, but actually that's not quite right, because if you take a product of these two symmetry operators, it's supported on this union of manifolds, which is a space that has some non-manifold points in it where they cross. And so a little bit better thing to do is to think of symmetry operators as supported on cycles in homology. You can basically think of that as kind of formally adding up surfaces, and so you're allowed. Adding up surfaces, and so you're allowed to have crossings. Alright, so in more detail, a nice way to do this is to think about giving your manifold a cell structure. Just think about a cubic lattice, okay? That's a good cell structure on a torus, for example. And then I want to consider this group, which is the group of cellular 2 cycles with Z2 coefficients. So what are cellular So, what are cellular 2 cycles? Well, think about the cubic lattice. They're formal sums of plaquettes in the cubic lattice where the coefficients are 0 and 1. And for something to be a two-cycle, you look at edges of the cubic lattice, and an even number of placettes have to meet there. If an odd number of placettes meet there, then there's some boundary, and it's not a two-cycle. You can also use, the reason I like this cell structure is because you can use that to put down some degrees of freedom. That to put down some degrees of freedom and think about a lattice model which you stick onto some of the cells. So you get a Hilbert space. And then the point of view you can take is that a Z21 form symmetry is just a unitary representation from this group of cycles to the group of unitary operators acting on Hilbert space. And actually, this comes along with some locality conditions because if you think about a cycle that lives somewhere in space, the corresponding unitary should also be supported in the right way. Unitary should also be supported in the right place. So now, here are three different kinds of one-form symmetry. So this is maybe the most familiar. You can suppose that this representation gives you the identity operator whenever you have a two-cycle that's a boundary, right? So here's a picture, right? Think about a two-dimensional surface surrounding a solid sphere, and you say that all of those symmetry objects. And you say that all of those symmetry operators are one. So, a really simple case where this occurs is if you just take a pure Z2 gauge theory with no charges, and then you take the symmetry operators to be the electric flux through a surface. If you think about a closed surface like this, there's no charge inside by construction, and so that operator is just one. There can't be any electric flux through that surface. So, this symmetry is broken in the deconfined phase of that gauge theory. Of that gauge theory that has to do with the condensation of electric field lines, which is a familiar thing. One thing you should ask is: well, how do you tell? Like, why can we think about that phase in terms of symmetry breaking? So there are multiple ways. One nice way is just to observe that the symmetry operators act non-trivially within the space of ground states. And that's true for breaking up ordinary symmetry, too, if you think about it. Just think about the Ising model in the Ising model in the thermodynamic limit, where there's a two-dimensional ground space. The symmetry operators have eigenvalue one on one ground state, and the symmetry operator has eigenvalue plus one on one ground state, minus one on the other. So it projects to something non-trivial in the ground space. And that's the same kind of diagnostic you want here. Now, here's something very different that happens is whether or not that diagnostic is useful depends on Is useful depends on the global topology of your space. If you put this gauge theory on a three-sphere, there's a unique ground state, and you will never be able to use this diagnostic to tell that the one-form symmetry is broken. It doesn't mean it's not broken, it just means that you have to pick the right space. So the global topology enters, and that's going to come back in a second. Okay, so here's another example. You could imagine that every different cycle has a different symmetry operator. Okay, so there are no Okay, so there are no nontrivial surfaces that map to the identity operator. And this you can get if you put some matter into the Z2 gauge theory. Then you can actually have electric charge inside some closed surfaces. This is the same as the 3D toric code model. I don't want to talk about that much. I want to move on to the more interesting thing, which I'll call a foliated one-form symmetry. So, in order to even talk about this, you need to follow this work and assume that. Follow this work and assume that your three-manifold has some kind of foliation structure like this. So let's think about three different foliations by two-dimensional leaves. You can generalize that a little bit as they did, but I don't want to focus on that. It's not important for this talk. Then if you pick a finite subset of leaves, like is drawn here, and you stick them all together, that gives you a cell structure. If you think about it, it's locally going to look like a cubic lattice, at least for this version of what I'm describing. Version of what I'm describing. And then what you can do is say, well, let's consider a one-form symmetry with that cell structure where the symmetry operator is one if the cycle is a single leaf or a sum of leaves. And this is also non-faithful, some stuff max to one, but it's not the same as the topological one-form symmetry. And this is actually realized in the coupled layer construction of the X-cube model. Okay, so this was also discussed yesterday on the cubic lattice. So the way this works is that the foliated version of this story is that on every leaf you put down a two-dimensional toric code model. You use the cell structure on the space. So you put down the qubits on edges. Every edge will have two qubits on it. And then you choose one-form symmetry operators, which are just the, they're just products of the toric. They're just products of the toric code plaquette operators over some cycle or some closed surface. And it turns out this is a foliated one-form symmetry, and the way to see that is the familiar fact that if you product BP over a closed two-dimensional space where you have a toric code, that's just equal to one. That's one of the usual global constraints in the toric code model. So the question you can ask here is: what's charged under this symmetry? So this is an operator that So, this is an operator that kind of locally measures the magnetic flux. And so, the charged objects are actually built out of M particles. You can think about an M particle as a line object living on the dual lattice or dual cell structure, and you can make strings out of these M particles. This is an open one, this is a closed one. And those are the objects that are charged under this symmetry. So, you can turn on a coupling between the layers that respects the symmetry. Respects the symmetry, which is actually what we and Sagar originally did when we made this construction, although we weren't thinking about it in those terms. And what the coupling does is it creates these smallest loops like this. So not that surprisingly, if you crank up that coupling, you'd expect these loops to condense because you'll get lots of them. And then what you might want to ask in this symmetry language is: you'd expect that this weakly coupled toric code phase is a phase where the symmetry is preserved. Symmetry is preserved, and the loop-condensed phase, which is the x-cube phase, is a phase where the symmetry is broken. Okay, so it turns out that you can diagnose that by looking at how symmetry operators act on the ground state manifold, but you actually, this issue of choosing the right space comes up here. I'm just going to state this but not explain why because I want to finish up. If you try to do this taking the three torque. If you try to do this taking a three-torus with the obvious foliation structure, where you just get a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions, you find that all of the symmetry operators just project to one on the ground state subspace in both phases. So it doesn't tell you anything. It doesn't mean the symmetry is not broken in one phase and preserved in the other, but it just doesn't tell you anything. What you can do instead is stay on the three torus, but you can twist the foliation where now some of the leaves run diagonally. So this is a cross. Leaves run diagonally. So, this is a cross-section of the three torus. There are other leaves that are parallel to the screen that are not shown. And this thick dashed line is actually a single red leaf. So, it's tilted in this way. And if you study the X cube model on a twisted foliation of the 3 torus, which is really just another cubic lattice, but the boundary conditions are twisted using the translation symmetry, you can actually show that there is some symmetry operator that acts non-trivially within the x q. Trivially within the X cube phase ground space, but it acts trivially within the decoupled toric code phase ground space. And so this is really a symmetry preserving phase, this is really a symmetry broken phase. So it's really correct to think about these phases in this way. There are various generalizations of this that you can contemplate in other questions. I don't have time to tell you about that at all. And so let me just leave you with a summary. And we might have a minute for questions. Thanks. I see Andre raising it. There are two questions, but they are both very quick. So first, is it a twist appellation? Do you view it as an excuse model on different backgrounds? Or do you view it as a different model? I think you should think of this as, you know, it's analogous to studying Z2 gauge theory on a sphere versus a torus. It's the same, it's the same, it's you know, yeah, it the same phase is a little delicate, I think, but it's the same, let's say the same theory. It's the same theory, but put on a different space. But space means both topological and geometrical structure here. Yeah. Second question is, can you use width of this variation as a partial dampest? I didn't try to think about that. It should look like it's a part of that list. Partial deadlines. Yeah, in a game twist. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think you can, actually. Yeah. Yeah, I think the answer is yes. Yeah, Dominic? So for relative one formal centrality, you can think of it as a representation of the homology group of a manifold. Is there some mathematical language for what the polymated one is, like maybe some relative homology or something? Some relative homology or something? Yeah, that's a good question. And I don't know the answer. One thing that I can tell you is that on it, yeah, there is something interesting to say there. So the typical non-trivial symmetry operators for the foliated one-form symmetry are trivial in homology. They're just like boxes. But if you look on the right, But if you look on the right space, and in fact, that's an important part of why we had to choose this different foliation. If you look on the right kind of foliated space, you can have symmetry operators that are non-trivial because the cycle is not a leaf or sum of leaves. But those are cycles that are non-trivial in homology, but they're not a leaf or sum of leaves. So that's possible. So there is some story about homology there, which I don't fully understand. There might be something nice to say. There might be something nice to say along those lines. I think we might be a little bit over time, so maybe put the preference to the question if not finds. Thank the speaker again.
