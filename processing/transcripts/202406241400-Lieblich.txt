Thank you. Thank you very much for the invitation. I'm really excited to be here. This is my first time in Mexico, and it's also such an interesting conference. This is a really great group of people to get together. So I'm excited to see what happens this week. I was thinking about how when I was young, now I got became a math major. I was like a budding mathematician and I'd meet a family member who had no idea what was going on. And then you calculate like really big numbers or something. Like, really big numbers, or something, and I'd say, no, the only numbers I see are page numbers. Well, now coming here, I feel like I have to say in the other direction, the only infinity categories I ever deal with are one truncated. So I want to give a series of lectures that, in some sense, is a chronicle of failure, or might charitably be interpreted as a demonstration of how interesting the period index problem is. So, and in particular, I'd like to. So, and in particular, I'd like to think about what it is, how certain aspects of it work, and then why it might or may not be true. That's sort of the themes for the three lectures that I'd like to develop. And so this first one might be telling you a lot of things you already know, but I want to sort of establish a framework or some ground that we will use. So, here's a general formulation of this period index problem. Now, I haven't prepared like an incredibly dense lecture, so please feel free to interrupt me anytime. Like, I'd rather that we understand something together than that I plow through a bunch of whatever. And people so far have done a great job of that. I don't want to break the streak, which if I don't practice my Duolingo today, I will break my streak there. All right. So, here's a general formulation. Let's say K is a field and And F an abelian sheaf on, you know, on K. I don't know, on spec of K, and I mean on the Atal site, and I'll just call spec of K S. All right. And so now we can study cohomology classes. We can study sort of two invariants of a cohomology class. All right. So given an L. An alpha, and I've noticed, you know, I wrote some of these notes when I was not totally awake on an airplane, so I'm afraid there's some Q's that might become N's and some M's and N's, and things might get screwed up. Please just point that out to me. And I found at least one proof in here that made absolutely no sense. So anyway, so given a cohomology class with whatever index or whatever sheaf of coefficients here, there's two stupid numbers you can attach to it. The first one is called the period, and this is like archaic terminology. Archaic terminology, it's just the order. The period of alpha is the order of alpha in this collomology group. Now we know this is torsion, you know, it's Galois collomology, it's torsion, so the order is, there's always some finite positive integer, if you like. All right. And then there's another number we can associate called the index. This one is slightly more interesting. The index of alpha. There's various ways to say this. I've chosen one. It's the G C D of The G C D of degrees of separable field extensions such that alpha restricted to L is zero. Okay. It's like the index of a variety. Have you ever played with the index of a variety before? You're like, no, no. I only do K-theory spectra. If you take a If you take a variety, maybe I should say what that is. If you take a variety, there's also something called the index. The index of x, so this is a variety over k, the index of x is the G C D of the degrees of points. So it's G C D of the degree of the residue field of X over K. Over A, where X in X is a closed point. Yeah, don't worry about it. That's an absolutely, this is not, this is a good, good question, and I don't want to go there. Is that okay? But if you want, you could say separable. Close points are separable. Let's not do that. Or you could not have separable here, but I don't want to do that either. Let's just agree to be inconsistent. Let's just agree to be inconsistent. But if you were to imagine that sort of the cohomology class, like sort of is a variety and killing it is a point on the variety, then these are sort of the same. And in instances that we are familiar with, it basically is what it is. Okay. Now, the properties of Galois cohomology and the Sulov theorems and so on tell you that these numbers are related. So the basic relation. You're very good at asking very careful questions, which I very deeply appreciate. Basic relation is this. The period of alpha always divides the index of alpha. The period is VR, the index is - and d. The period always divides the index, and they have the same prime factors. And so that means that the index divides some period, some power of the period, some. Some power of the period, some mysterious number. Okay, and the period index problem is not very well posed as a problem. And so I'm going to state it in a way you shouldn't really state things. And that is, what is n alpha? More precisely, you might ask yourself. More precisely, you might ask yourself: if I take a field of a certain type as my field k, say the function field of a variety of some dimension, can I say what n alpha is in a way that is independent of alpha? That's what would be interesting. It's not interesting to say that it depends on alpha. Look, it does. The interesting thing would be, can this be independent of alpha? That's really the interesting question I want to ask. Want to ask. Okay, and it's easy to make examples. And I leave that to you if you feel like it after we've talked a little more. If you want to, you know, go out and make examples where you can show that you can arrange for a field that's nasty and a set of classes where it isn't independent at all. That's not hard to do. Okay. What comments, questions, thoughts, or feelings have anything I've said so far? Laid out this basic problem. We've got these two invariants. They're related in some way. We're trying to understand how they're related. We're trying to understand how they're related. Now, there's various problems of more subtle natures that reflect down into a problem of this kind. And so, I thought it would be nice to sort of think through a few special cases that are informative when we try to understand what a problem like this could mean. So, I'm just going to start some examples. It took me many years as a mathematician to realize that the essence of a theory is in its examples, not in its theorems. So I think it behooves us to think about some. So, I think it behooves us to think about some examples. For the first one, let's say q equals 1, and f is mu m. So we're talking about h1s mu m. This one you want to share something? Question? What's up? If I have any two natural numbers. Two natural numbers that satisfy this? What do you mean, any two? Yeah. Which one are you trying to get? These are two numbers. I would either repeat the question. It's not coming into the record into the recording. Sorry, sir. Yeah, it wasn't on full power. So I have two natural numbers, A and B. I have two natural numbers, A and B. A divides B. Does B divide A to the? I present to you two and six. So the key thing, this is a good question to ask. What this really means is that they have the same prime factor. That's what's important here. They have the same prime factors. And then given any two such numbers, yes, there is a thing of this kind. And I think to answer your question of whether you can cook up a To answer your question of whether you can cook up a cohomology class that fits into any diagram with this divisibility relation and this number there, the answer is yes. You can do it in an ad hoc way. You can always arrange for any particular example that you want. Yes, absolutely. But you will see if you try to write down examples that what you need to be effective at expressing an example is a plethora of material, like many variables and so on that you can lovingly manipulate to get things to be the way you want. And so, if you want to get very constrained examples, if you want to show that. examples, if you want to show that a field, that there's a constraint on a field, you kind of are naturally led to understand that if the field is kind of small, the relation should be tight. That's sort of what I'm going to explain this conjecture to you in a second. If you start writing down examples, you see you can do it, but you just, you need a wealth of material. Okay, great. All right, so Q equals one. This is something we all learn about as children, right? This is Kumar theory. And I want to say it to you in a particular form that will come up again in the third lecture. That will come up again in the third lecture. All right. Now, Kubernetes theory tells us here that the index of alpha, the index of any alpha, always divides m. And how do we see that? Well, that's a very coarse way of saying the following thing. There's a universal map. So here's a better way to see it. If I take the mth power map, what did I call this? Mu. That sends t to t to the m. This is sort of universal. This is universal for H1 with coefficients in Um in the following sense. All right, let's see here. For any alpha in H1 s mu m. One S mu M There exists a map, what did I call it? F from S to A1 such that now alpha is F upper star of alpha universal, where alpha universal is the class, so an H1 of A1 mu m. is the class corresponding to mu. Okay, the mth power map is a mu m torsor. It's a universal mu m torsor. If I have any mu m torsor over any field, I can get it by pulling back this one universal thing, and this has degree m. This is the degree of mu equals m. And so that says that no matter what, that's what actually, this is what. That no matter what, that's what actually. This is what you learned when you learned Kumer theory. That you just learned how to say this in a different way. You learned that any class in H1MUM is given by taking the nth roots of some element of the field. That's just saying you have a map from S to A1, and you're taking the fiber of the nth power map over that point. So here we have this universal map of degree M that captures all the cohomology, and so we know that the index always divides M. Who's A1? Oh, what? Oh, whatever. Sure, take GM. There's this map. I mean, no, no, you shouldn't be sorry. Of course, you're right. However, okay. We'll see later. When I talk about the related things later, this will just be a generic property. And then I don't mean. And then I don't mean, yes, you're so right. The way I said it, I should definitely do what you just said. Thank you so much. Okay, does this feel better now? Is this good? Yeah, good. I appreciate that. That's good. I might act dismissive, but I actually care and I appreciate it. Okay. So there's one example. And I'd like to emphasize that in this case, we have an answer. And where is it? Where did I write the answer? Oh, we have an answer, and we also know why we have an answer. Okay, we have an answer, and we know why. Okay, now let me show you another one. So, it's an example, that's an H1 example. We're going to jump to H3. So, when we think about these problems, are we always considering only one queue at a time? Yeah. But we don't have to. There's a host. There's a ton of interesting, like one interesting question is you take any finite set of classes at once and you see if you can simultaneously bound things and so on. There's lots of interesting questions like that. But for now, we're just going to. Um, but for the for now, we're just going to think about yes, just one thing at a time: one class, one field, one index. Yeah, good. Okay, second example. I think I'm saying this right. Okay, this is due to Suresh. Oh, maybe I should say something else about this. And there's a notation. So sort of the pedestrian form of this is alpha is parentheses A. Is parentheses a. That means it's k adjoin a to the one over m over k. It's the mth roots of a, and this is sometimes written like this. I'm omitting the lowercase m, the subscript m. And this you can call like a symbol. So Suresh proved the following thing. I don't remember when, and I don't, I think this is what he proved. Okay, so let K0 be. not be a purely imaginary is that what it's called is it called purely imaginary or totally imaginary what the hell is it called number field okay does anyone remember what it's called totally totally all right one thing that i should also recommend to everyone who's younger than me is not to get older all right because things start to leave your head that used to be in your head okay and and um and let our cat And let our capital K over little K have transcendence degree one. In other words, it's the function field of a curve. Let's just say it's, if you want, you can imagine it's just the function field of a curve, right? E.g. K is K naught of C, or C is some curve over K. Okay. Then, and this is an amazing theorem. Okay, I claim this is a super amazing theorem. I don't know why I didn't know about this before. Maybe Danny will talk about this. Then any alpha. Then any alpha in H3 of spec K mu m to the tensor to three is a symbol. Let me say what I mean. I mean that alpha is a cup product of three of those puppies, which is also sometimes just written a, b, c. Okay, for each tensor factor, you have one puppy, and you smash all the puppies together. And you smash all the puppies together, you tensor to the third power. And you get every columnology class, is one of these things like this. Okay. So again, again, you have a couple ways you can interpret this. You don't seem to feel like this is amazing. First, this tells you that the index divides M, right? Divides m, right? But you can also say it in a similar way to what we just said over there. And now I will get into the more sort of generic formulation. Go, let it out, please. Pull power. No, I mean this tells you that you have a universal bound that's independent of alpha, so yes. So I cannot have like an alpha. So this is a mu m, so the period already divides m. Yes, but right? Can I have the number of primes of the period is smaller than m? They don't have the same exact. They have to have the same prime factors. It's always true. Yeah. Always, yeah. Yeah, always, yeah, yeah, it's a miracle of Galak almond, yeah. And it's the it's like you learn algebra and you're like, where the hell would I ever use the Sulov theorems? Boom. Okay. So another way that you can say this is you could also, I mean, if you want, you could say that on over A3 minus. Minus the axes minus the coordinate thingama bobbers. We have a universal class, alpha, call it alpha univ again. And H3, let's call this U. H3U mu m to the tensor three. To the tensor three, then what Suresh says is that for all alpha in H3 of S mu m to the tensor three, there exists an F from S to U such that alpha is F upper star of alpha U niv. And again, we get that the index of alpha divides out. Divide down. Okay, so again, we know what happens and we know why it happens. Here, the how is a little, I mean, this is not an easy thing to prove. Did it? Oh. So I'm trying to parse this. Can you write alpha equals brackets A? Yeah. Who is A? Exactly. A is in K. Exactly. A is in K. It's an element education. Yeah. I just got it. Cooler theory. Yeah. Yeah. But so it is writing this FSV. Yeah. Okay. Does that work for you? Yes. Okay. Good. Thank you. Thank you for thank you. Good. Okay. So far, so good. A couple of examples. One thing to point out. Examples. One thing to point out, I don't know. Well, we don't have enough built up to point out anything yet. Okay. Let me show you another example. This is due to Matri. This is also an amazing theorem, by the way. Incredible. You see, these two we've said so far say that in certain conditions, I mean, in the case of, now, nobody pointed out the fact that for this to work, M has to be prime to the characteristic of K, but I think. Of K, but I think I invited you not to say that by freaking out before about separable versus inseparable. Whenever something needs to be prime to something, let's assume it needs to be prime to something. Let's just always assume that the periods are prime to the characteristic of the field and so on. In both of these cases, we see that there's an explanation that involves a single symbol. The cohomology class in question has a particular structure that makes it easy to understand. Structure that makes it easy to understand what the index is. Now, the Mercurio-Susslin theorem tells you that any homology class under certain circumstances can be written as a sum of symbols. So if you sort of dig into this, the natural question to ask might be, coming out of this, how many symbols does it take to write down a colonology clause? Symbols does it take to write down a cohomology club? Not what is the index? That's a very coarse question. You could ask, what about the symbol length? Danny, are you going to talk about symbol length? Okay. So third example. Beautiful theorem of MOPS3. And it goes like this. No, no, no, no, no. This is, yes, yes. Danny will talk about this one. No, I'm just kidding. Danny will say something that makes a lot more sense than I'm going to say now, and it'll be much deeper. This is just. Going to say now, and it'll be much deeper. This is just an example. So, let K be a CN field. So, for example, let me just eg a finite extension of just okay, like the function field of an n-fold is a CN field. Let's take Q to be 2. Let's take Q to be 2 and let's take F to be GM and let's say that this maybe let's say contains all roots of unity so we can avoid a certain issue that I'll explain in a second. So let's really, if you want, just think about function fields of complex varieties or something, just to fix ideas. Okay? Then for any For any alpha in H2 spec K G M that is P to the T torsion for some P and some T. We have that, I guess I could have just written this as mu p to the t, but alpha can be written. Can be written as a sum of, let me get this number right, at most t times p to the n minus one minus one symbols. That's just amazing. Okay. Oh, symbols of order p to the t. And so this implies. And so this implies that the index of alpha divides p to the t to the p to the n minus 1 minus 1, which is also just the period of alpha to the p to the n minus 1 minus 1. Okay, amazing, super fantastic. Note, very important to note, that the index, that the power here is That the power here is not independent of alpha because it involves p and the period was p to the t. This looks like what we want, what we kind of hope for is some kind of holy grail theorem, but it's not because the power in the relation depends on the period. In a slightly subtle way, it depends on just the sort of the prime. Elden, you're like, what? What are you thinking? You're thinking something. Thinking, you're thinking something. Sorry, so the creative system tells me that uh alpha this big is normal thinking, so you can write it as a sum of product from the market. Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh. Yeah. So when you say at most this number, you're saying like the sum is at most this number. Yeah, yeah. So it's like A1B1 plus blah blah blah plus ANBN, where n is less than or equal to t times p to the n minus one minus one. Yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, good. Excellent. Actually, I have a question too. So, yes. So, if you have that many symbols, then how do you know that the index divides p the t to the minus one? Why shouldn't it be p the t raised to the n, right? Raised to the t? Why shouldn't there be an extra t in the exponent? An extra t? The period. I would have thought that the index would divide p to the t raised to the power t times p minus one minus one. Am I missing a t? See, I thought that this, isn't the fact that this is not p to the t? Do I need another t? Oh, shit. Okay, is that it? Because each particular network has okay. Excellent. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I appreciate that. Good. Okay. So you could ask yourself in a setting like this: how optimal is the bound of this? Maybe this is the best. Yeah, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I wondered that when I wrote this down. Okay. So here's this conjecture that, now, this is a very complicated theorem involving decomposition. Complicated theorem involving decomposing or writing a class as a sum of other kinds of classes. This is much more complicated than asking, what is this number? How do these numbers relate? So if you just think about how the numbers relate, there's this conjecture due to Coleo-Telen. But it also has roots in work done by Artin. And I'm sure there's other people who thought about questions like this. In this form, it was definitely stated first. Was definitely stated first by Coleotelin, or maybe in a slightly weaker form. If K is Cn, then any alpha in H2 spec K G M, which is, this is, by the way, embracer group of K, which is one of the two branches of this satisfies. Satisfies index of alpha divides the period of alpha to the n minus one. Now I shall pause. Please tell me what questions, confusion, what's happening inside you. Okay, hold on. So let's start. What if n equals one? N. What if n equals one? Ah, yes, yes. Yes, yes, what if n equals one? Then this predicts that the index should be zero. And if n equals one, a theorem of 10 says that the Brouwer group of K is zero. Excellent question. I don't want to say implies that it is. Okay, good. Yes. So it checks. It checks out. That's very important. Now you say, what if n equals? Now you say, what if n equals 2? What? Oh, is that what you said? Okay. So n equals 2. The period should equal the index. So let's see. Do we know that? Is that ever true? What do we know? Maybe we should talk about that for a second. How many C2 fields can you think of? How many C1 fields can you think of? What? Give me an example of a C1 field. What? Finite field. Okay. Okay. Okay. C1 field. So C1, finite field is an example. Finite field is an example. Fq. Okay. Function field of a curve over an algebraically closed field. Okay. Where C is some algebraically closed. Oh. Now, all these have zero tribal Brouwer group. That's what Tense theorem tells us. 10's theorem tells us. Okay. If you want to go from a CN field to a CN plus one field, there's a basic thing you can do. If I take a CN field, you know, K, then K of T is Cn plus one. Oh my God. Or any finite extension of it is a Cn plus one field. So if I want to make a C2 field, if I want to test this conjecture, I could try to take some of these fields and add and make. And add and make something one-dimensional over them, right? So, some C2. So, if I want to do something C2, maybe I could take a global field. So, like, what do I call it? K containing FQ of T from finite X. So this is a global, what's called a global function field, right? Is it still called that? Is that an old man term? I don't know. Equi-characteristic global field. Do people still talk this way? Okay. Or we could take. Okay, or we could take, or we could take k to be the function field of a surface. Or we could take k to be, again, the function field of some curve over this Laurent series. C over spec curve, right? Now we actually know the conjecture. Now, we actually know the conjecture in these three cases. And let me call it A, B, and C. Who did C? Danny? Who did C? You? I mean, you have a proof of this, right? Did we prove this together once? We did this. I did this. You did this. A bunch of, who did this first? I don't know. I don't remember. Me? Me? Okay. No. I literally have no idea. Okay. But go me. Okay, now this one, this is part of class field theory. How many of you have experienced class field theory? There's a classification of the Brouwer group. It's a very beautiful thing. You can write down what the Brouwer group is. Beautiful thing. You can write down what the Brouwer group is for a field like this. And it has to do with these things called local invariants. You compute, this is actually similar to what came up in this like high-pollutant motivic, crazy shit happening talk that Tess gave, where you see you look at each P and you figure out what's going on and you've sort of assembled its integral structure. The classical computation of the Braille group of a global field says you have to understand what it is at each completion. And then there's some mild relation that they have to satisfy. You can't have arbitrary data at each completion. You can't have arbitrary data at each completion, but given that you can create a global class. And if you understand what is happening with that, you actually see that the period has to equal the index. In fact, all the classes must be stick-like. It's called the Brauer-Hasse Noder. It says alpha is cyclic. Module of the formal roots of unity that I don't want to get in. This is A. Classical math, 19th century. Classical math, 19th century, early 20th century math, tells us the period equals the index because, again, we know a structural result about the Brouwer classes over a global field. Apparently, I proved C. I won't talk about that one. It's related to what I'm going to talk about at the rest of the lectures. And it also to how B works. So I want to tell you about B now. Hell no. Yes, can we come back to that? It's so not known in general, it's not known in any single example. Oh, oh, no, right, right. Fascinating thing. We don't know it for all C2 fields. Very interesting, yes. Fascinating thing. We don't even know it for a curve over a C1 field. There's a lot we don't know. That's what makes this part such an interesting. That's what makes this part such an interesting problem. Even for basic things we don't understand at all. Thank you. Excellent. Yes. You use the structure of these fields. I mean, ultimately, you could prove A ultimately using the Langve estimates. Okay, you can prove C using deformation theory. And I'll explain to you how B works. It has to do with the properties of rational points on rationally connected varieties over functional fields or curves. There's no general mechanism to explain why, even for a curve over a C1 field, something like this should be. And again, I will come to this later. This will be some. But I will again, I will come to this later. This will be something we talk about. I'm holding this and I don't know why. Oh, so let's just think about another conjecture, again, that we can't prove. Nobody knows how to prove. I don't think anyone believes this anymore. And is this due to Colliotilln, the simplicity conjecture for surfaces? Maybe it's colliotil n again. So if you look at this C2 field that we understand, this global function field, this curve over. Understand this global function field, this curve over a finite field, you see again that we have the structural property that the period equals the index because the classes are cyclic. And there's this conjecture that Kolya Tolin made, I think, later in life, that the period should equal the index for a C2 field for the function field of a surface. But there's a more refined conjecture, which is if x is a surface over an algebraically closed field, then any alpha. Then any alpha in the Brouwer group of X is thickly. That's another way of saying it's a symbol. Okay, and again, stay away from the characteristic of X. Okay. Now, this is also, you know, there's this long-standing analogy between fields like this and fields like that and whatever. And you might believe this is true. Nobody can prove it. Whatever, and you might believe this is true. Nobody can prove this. Nobody has any idea. Nobody has a clue. Probably not true. We may have differences of opinion. All right. But there is evidence for this conjecture. There's a theorem of de Jong. And I mean, in some sense, there's some part I added to it, just because Johan didn't realize something about characters like P, but really, it's the Jong's theorem that says, It says if X is a surface over an algebraically closed field, then any alpha in the broad group of its function field satisfies period of alpha equals index of alpha. Now I wonder, it must be that Koletullian wrote down this conjecture after that theorem. I think that many of them. Yes, function field. Yes. Oh, so I should say, right, right, let's say that here. This is better. I mean, of course, these are equivalent because I didn't say a projective surface, right? But let's not do that part. I don't want to be the guy who always talks about the empty set or whatever. Okay, good. So far, so good. Now, there's something. Now, there's something that I think is worth, you should be very afraid of. I want to write this somewhere. Confuse myself mightily about this. Earlier in the year, this business where you've got mu M or Mu M Tensor 2 or whatever, this makes a huge difference. So note. I think I'm like a third of the way through my notes. Is that something right? Okay. So, note. So, be afraid. Or maybe this is an opportunity. Here it's an opportunity. All right. H two of spec R mu four is Z mod two Z. H two H2 of spec R view four to the tensor two is zero. So when you don't have enough roots of unity, it really matters. And this is related to the Motivo homology stuff. You end up in the wrong piece of the filtration if you're not paying attention to what you're doing when you don't have roots of unity. So in some sense, as I'll try to explain in the last lecture, this whole framing is wrong, but it's always massaged over because you basically always assume there's roots of unity. Basically, always assume there's roots of unity. This is clearly not the right way to ultimately think about this problem. If you look at Suresh's result that I quoted, it's about h3 with mu m to the tensor three coefficients. That's where we understand. It was not about h3 with mu m coefficients. Now this is about h2 with mu m coefficients. That's not right. It really ultimately should be something about h2 with mu m to the tensor two coefficients. It's just hidden in the fact that we allow ourselves roots of units. ourselves roots of union. Okay, so now I want to, now the introduction is done, now I want to start talking about what I want to talk. I don't know what I'm talking about. Yes. The quaternions. It's just, oops, it's actually two torsion. But it's still there. It's still in the four torsion, the rare group. Okay. Now, one thing we've realized over the last 20 years. Over the last 20 years, is that palmology is like sand through a sieve. You try to hold it in your hands and it just empties through your fingers and disappears. And if you want to study a question like this, even though it's about cohomology, it's better to study it using some kind of correct geometric model for the cohomology class. So I want to say a little, just briefly, a little bit about what geometric models. Geometric models I'm going to use to think about these problems. And I want to start by just pointing out something silly. If you take, let's say, a class alpha in H1 of S, what am I using? Mu n. If I write this down, If I write this down, what's the first thing you think? What's the first French word you think of? Tarseur. This corresponds to. Comage. Okay, so it corresponds to a torsor, T over S, which is a physical manifestation of the cohomology. Okay, and that physical manifestation persists under. Physical manifestation persists under base change. What? Danny, what's the problem? Do you want to say it into the microphone? Oh, I didn't consent to editing. All right. So this is better. The Flomage is better than just the colonology. Let me give you an example of why it's better. If I take, you know, C D crossed of respect. Take C D crossed over S with T, if I base change T to T. Well, this has a diagonal map, provides a section, and this tells me that alpha restricted to T is zero. The torso becomes split, it becomes trivial. But to do so, I had to use the structure, the geometric model itself, to make the argument. You see this here? I could not, if I want to just say, oh, look, it's true, why is it true? Oh, it's true because if I take the geometric model. Oh, it's true because if I take the geometric model that persists under base change, I can create a section using the well-known diagonal. And so the point is that the geometric model still exists even when the colonology class has vanished, when it's zero. And we can use that to make constructions, local constructions, do descent theory, and so on, that we cannot do with colonology classes themselves. All right. So what is the geometric model? Please. No, no, no, it's not. No one apologizes for your questions being stupid. This is not permitted. Just ask your question. It's okay. Yeah. Okay. A, it makes sense to ask a question. A, it makes sense to ask a question. B, I don't think it follows. And C, I certainly can't say anything about it. It's an excellent question. Not a stupid question at all. Yeah, good question. I don't know. Excellent question. Thank you for bringing that up. I don't know. Yeah, good. All right. Oh, so right. So you understand our geometric model of H1. What is H1? Geometric model of H1. What is a geometric model of H2? Of you know, some alpha in, I don't know, H2 of S mu n. I was talking to one of you the other day because I was trying to understand who am I talking to here? What's going on? What's this thing going to be about? Hey, what do you know about the Brouwer group? Oh, I think it's quaternions. I know something about algebra. Quaternions, I know something about algebras. I don't really know whatever. Is it a what about gerbs? Oh, yeah, no problem. Those are you know, infinity stacks that have been truncated. Okay, so I think many people are familiar with the geometric model in ways in deeper ways than I am. But the answer was provided years ago by Giraud. Okay, and Giraud taught us that H2, maybe it was also Grotendijk, that whole school, that classes in H2 But classes in H2, what? I heard something. Was that outside? Was it Danny? Or were you? Are you watching YouTube? Okay. Classifies mu and gerbs. Okay, now, honestly, who knows what a mu and gerb is? I'm really curious. One, two, three, who's never seen a mu, never seen one before? Never seen one before? All right. We can talk more after this because this is going to be a lightning tour, and I'm happy to explain this more. A muN germ is a kind of stack. And it's a stack that wishes it were the stack of muan torsors. So it's like going up one categorical level. Here, a class in H1 classifies a. Here, a class in H1 classifies a torsor. A class in H2 classifies a category that wants to be the category of torsor. So, a mu n gerb, early s to s is a stack, okay, such that, and this is not quite right, what I'm about to say, when I base change to k bar, it becomes isomorphic to the stack of new end torses. So, this is the stack of new end torses. Now, why do I say this? Torses. Now, why do I say that's not quite true? You could say a mu n torsor is a scheme over s so that when I base change it, it becomes n points. Well, that's you've forgotten structure when you data. That's not quite right. You have to remember the mu n action. And similarly here, saying it's a stack that becomes isomorphic to the stack, that's not right either. You have to remember more structure. And particularly, you have to remember a way in which μ n equals the automorphism group of any object. Of curly s, sort of functorially. That's an important datum that is included in the structure of a mu engine. All right. And now under this correspondence, if I think about sort of H2 and I think about GERBS, here the class zero corresponds to the classifying stack itself. And And other ones don't. Okay. And so, for example, what does it mean to say to say that theta s splits alpha? That is to say, alpha restricted to t is zero. That corresponds to saying that if I take s cross t, that this becomes isomorphic to the classifying stack of mu n as a t stack. Stack. So here's this geometric incarnation of this cohomological effect. Okay. The message are good. What's that? Go for it. Yeah, so I was just wondering, what is the journal support for the market? The germ associated with the quaternions. It's the gerb associated to the quaternions. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you could say, so what is the gerb associated to the quaternions? So let's say I take h over r. Okay. I can make a stack where I go like this, an object, so let's which we call this s sub h, s upper h, s of h, what do I call? Curly h, curly h. Okay, if I evaluate it on an R scheme, T. Okay, so T. Okay, so T is some R scheme. I'm going to tell you what the stack is by telling you what its sort of objects are. Okay, what is an object here? It is a sheaf V on T plus an isomorphism P from the sheaf of endomorphisms of V to the quaternion base change to T. Okay, that's called the gerb of trivializations of the quaternions. And the Skull-Nother theorem and various things tell you that this has the right structure. I guess if we want it to be a mu2 thing, this is as a GM gerb. If you want a mu2 gerb, you would add an isomorphism between wedge 2 of V and O T. That's optional. It depends on your coefficients. Good. That's a good question. Thank you for asking that. All right. Oh, and in fact, that's an excellent question. All right. Oh, and in fact, that's an excellent question because these, if you take this gerb here and you think about the package that you've got, you can pull this sheaf out of the package. So T going to V on T, or maybe I should say V of T, this is a sheaf on curly H. And it's this particular kind of sheaf. And these are going to play an essential role. And these are going to play an essential role. The fact that you have this sheaf on this gerb as part of the package encoding the Brouwer class is like the most important thing for the method I'm going to explain to you. But let me come at that from the other end now. Go. The index of. Yeah, so on this torture side, yes, they're the same. They're the same. The same, they're the same, and on the stack side, it's the same, right? Yes, yes, yes, but it's going to be geometrized in two different ways. And this is what's going to be interesting about this. You can directly geometriize it in the way you just said. You look at points of the stack and you see what their degrees are. That is a literal translation of saying that the field kills the thing. But there's a more interesting formulation that's more subtle that works in this case. And actually, one question I have for everybody here who knows more about higher stacks and so on than I do. And I'm going to just put it over here for now while I work my way. I'm gonna just put it over here for now while I work my way across. Is what is the correct model for higher order callbolling? So, don't answer this yet because there's a piece of, there's something I want to show you that makes this a little more subtle than it might at first seem. But this very important question, what is the right model for classes in HQ? In HQ. Of course, you could say, you know, a Q minus one gerb, but you're about to see that, as you, as you've already, as we've already seen, there's a sheaf on the gerb that is a very important object. So it's not, maybe it's a Q minus one gerb with a Q minus two gerb on top of it or something. I'm not sure what it should be, but I think that's actually an important question. Okay. You may. Do you want the microphone of power? I mean, I always think of. I mean, I always think of like both 200. You could, I mean, yeah, yeah, and now, yeah, you're, yeah, good. All right, so here's an observation that we've sort of been primed for here. BMUN carries a sort of A sort of universal invertible sheet L univ, which corresponds to uh-oh, uh-oh, did I just break the whole okay, corresponding to the inclusion of mu n into gm. A sheaf on b mu n is a representation. A sheath on B mu n is a representation of mu n. The line bundle on b mu n is a map from mu n to g m. There's a trivial line bundle that's the map from mu n to g m that sends everything to zero. Then there's this canonical line bundle, which is just the canonical inclusion of mu m into g m. mu n into g m, sorry. And this has a special property that you can say in terms of the stack. Of this day. So, property of L univ. If I take any sheath on BMUN, it has an action of the inertia stack. When do I stop? Now? I have 10 minutes. Oh, great. But shouldn't I stop it before the end of it? When is the break? When is the call? Someone tell me to schedule. I'm going to go look. I don't want to take too long. Okay, after. Okay, after me is the photograph. Okay, so I'll go for another few minutes. So if I take a sheaf on a stack, it always has an action of the inertia stack on the right. So then the inertial action L UNIV cross UN to LUNIV has Has its associated. I really hope I'm not making a sign error, but it actually doesn't matter. Left action, scalar multiplication. Now, I mean this in the sense that when you make the associated left action, you have to invert, even though it's an abelian group. The left action of a The left action of a root of unity is given by the right action of its inverse. Okay. Does this make any sense at all? This is the thing. Either you know what I'm talking about or you don't. And if you don't, let's talk afterward. I would love to explain this to you. If you do, you do. But if you don't, please just come talk to me. It's easy to explain. You just have to sit down and do it together. There's a name for this property of a sheath that. Name for this property of a sheep that crept into the literature from mathematical physics. And it's called being a twisted sheep. So, general, the name came from physics, I think. Those are the people who started doing this stuff. Definition. Sheaf F, maybe I should say quasi-coherent so we don't freak out on Bμn or on a mu n gerb, really S is twisted if the canonical left action left inertial action. Left inertial action mu n cross F to F is scalar multiplication. It's just a name. If you think in general, the drive category of S, or maybe we should start with just Q co of S, it breaks up as a product, sum. Product sum, direct sum. This is very confusing. Oh no, is it a sum or a product? As a sum of categories q coi of s, where i is a character of mu n. I'm confused about what I'm supposed to put there. And these are just the ones that lie in like the one slice. Okay, now here's this idiotic trick. This is leading somewhere, I swear to you, it's leading somewhere. And if you're getting confused, it's okay because we'll have like a reset in a second. I'll get to the gestalt of this in a moment. But so now here's a trick. Let's say I've got S, the S and the S. got S the S mu n gerb representing some alpha in H2 of S mu n. And now suppose you've got a T to S splitting alpha. And let's say that R is equal to the degree of T over S. Okay, so we've got this finite, there's a finite field extension, if you like. Well, if I take. Well, if I take S cross over S with T, this becomes isomorphic to B mu n on T, and this is mapping down to S. This is again an R to one map, right? And here, I've got this universal sheaf. This is this twisted invertible sheaf. Let's call this pi. And down here, I have pi lower star of L U niv. And what is this? This is a twisted sheaf. And what is this? This is a twisted sheaf of rank R. All right. And so, what turns out to be the correct formulation of please. Please. Go ahead. Say it. So this twisted means twisted with respect to full character view, but it's non-incombanical mutual. That's what twisted means. But if I change some other random thing, then call it I twisted or something. Sure. Yeah. That's the standard thing is to call it I twisted. Then one twisted is just called twisted. Yeah. And if you look at the old literature on this from the physics days, of course, it's many liberties are taken in ways that are In ways that are mathematically quite dangerous and have caused all sorts of errors. So, I guess what is zero-twisted, a zero-twisted sheaf is still a sheaf on the stack. If the Brower class is trivial, L-Univ is not a, well, yeah, let's not, I don't want to list other people's errors. Okay. I have plenty of my own to enjoy. Plenty of my own to enjoy. So here is really the geometric, sort of the key lemma. The key lemma is this. Okay, so we've got alpha in H2 of S mu n. The index of alpha is equal to the minimal rank of, well, let's say that S is a gerb. Is a gerb represents alpha. Okay, it's a muon gerb representing alpha. Then the index of alpha is the minimal rank of a twisted, minimal positive rank of a twisted sheaf on S. But now remember, you asked about the index. Is the index just the index of the stack? Whatever, yes, it is. But here's another formulation: the index is the smallest possible rank of a twisted sheaf on it. If you like, you know, it's the twisted K theory. You look at the rank map and you look at what the image of the rank map is, right? Now I said K-theory. Okay. Now, I Now, I want to actually tell you that this is this obvious? I don't think this is actually obvious. So, let me tell you a proof, okay? And I think this is a proof, what I'm writing here. But the reason I want to include this, the reason I want to harp on this, is that if you look at the question over here, what is the correct model for classes of higher homological degree? If you look at this question and you think about this scenario that we're dealing with, the H2 and the reformulation in terms of this coherent model. And the reformulation in terms of this coherent model for it, these coherent sheaves on the stack. This is a very peculiar, very special to this situation, as far as I can tell. It's not obvious how to translate this into that. And I guess I want to show you this proof to emphasize this fact. All right. So let's say, so, okay, as I just pointed out, if you have something of degree R that splits the class, you get a twisted sheaf of rank R just by pushing forward the universal line one, universal twisted line one. The universal line one, universal twisted line one. So I kind of want to go in the other direction, all right? So let's say that V is a twisted sheaf of rank R. And I want to make a splitting of degree R. Right? So consider a general endomorphism V from V to V. V from V to V. This is like a matrix, if you like, but it's a matrix, not really, because it's not a vector space, but it acts like a matrix. And in particular, the characteristic polynomial f of phi has degree r. That's the rank of this vector space, of this sheet. And well, now we have to. And well, now we have an operator. So if I have this operator on a module, I can promote the action from just a k action to a k-adjoint t module of the characteristic polynomial action, right? So V inherits a T structure, capital T, where T is spec of K bracket T modulo F of P. Okay. So now what that means is that V is, you know, pi lower star of W, where now W is a sheaf on S on S. Oh shit. Is this not approved? I was going to say S cross T, but there's something funny about what I know. No, that's okay. Does she find S cross? No, yeah, no, that's okay. It's a she find s cross t. Yes, no, this is okay. And now here's the coup de grace. All right. We've just shown that there's some finite extension so that V is the pushboard of W. Yes? Are you with me? Anyone with me? Does anyone know what I'm talking about? We've got S cross T, we've got S, we've got W, we've got V, which is. We've got V, which is pi lower star of W. We know that this is R to one, and this has rank R. So this has to have rank one. And this has to mean that W is isomorphic to L universal. And this means that alpha restricted to T is zero. Hello? Yeah. Hello? Yeah. I was confused by the other direct for the other half of the argument. So do you is it really the minimum of the ranks or do you have to take a G C D? Turns out to be the minimum. It turns out to be the same. Is that clear? No, I would say nothing about this is clear. Okay, okay. Yeah. It's true. Okay, but I feel like I've gone far enough in time that I'm going to stop now. Then I'm going to stop now. So, what I'm going to do next time, let me just tell you, I'm going to explain the proof of De Yong's theorem using this setup. And then I'm going to reflect on the geometry of the moduli space of twisted vector bundles on certain gerves as part of how this kind of result works. That will lead us to a discussion of the geometry, some of the subtle properties of those moduli spaces, some basic, very basic examples that we don't understand very well. And then on the third day, I will follow up with a And then on the third day, I will follow up with a looping back to the discussion we had at the beginning about whether things are cycles and what their universality properties there might be for classes of this kind that might tell us why such a thing should be true, instead of just how it might work in certain cases. But I want to emphasize, if something was confusing to you about this, please just come talk to me and I'm happy to explain. Thank you. So, where did you get? I just chose one. Just do it. Okay, so end of V is a central simple algebra. Just choose a random element. That's all I'm saying. I mean, we're kind of like. We're just making a splitting field for the algebra inside the algebra. Allah crash in. Yes. So this is just a way of saying that it didn't have to invoke any of that theory. Invoke any of that theory. What? S is a field. I'm just dealing with fields. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Could be constant. You mean it could be the identity map? Is that what you're saying? That won't produce anything interesting because that will. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, so your job is to figure out why picking one isn't going to work. Okay, but it has to do with. Yeah, you can make situations where you gain no useful information from the wrongly chosen endomorphism. You really want to have the characteristic polynomial be legit. You want it to be irreducible. For instance. Or maybe you want it to have. Or maybe you want it to have big enough factors that whatever. Yeah, maybe you just want the eigenvalues to be distinct. Yeah, something like that. Right. I mean, you can, it's interesting to ponder what happens if you take like zero, if you take like things like you're saying, and like write out what happens and then try to chase through what's going on. It's a good idea to do. Yes. Yeah, but if it's a link to the yeah. I guess yeah, like the endomorphism is actually the endomorphism. Yeah, the endomorphism ring is a finite dimensional vector space. It's got like a bunch of stuff in it. And now you're like, what if it's a finite field? Well, we already, we don't worry about the finite field. Broad group is zero. There's other ways to handle that. Otherwise, it's like if it's an infinite field, you can always use a random element. It'll avoid any. Like B to B is a twist, right? Like not from B to B as a linear space is a unpositioned formation is a priori twisted actually not no in any space the endomorphisms of a sheaf is a k module it's this is a this is a space over k the the endomorphisms of a sheath form a k module it doesn't matter yeah yeah everything yeah but that's a k that that's a k space right at the base of everything is k so maps are still a k vector space Space. You don't need to worry about twisting, right? Right. Now, if you take an untwist, if you take sheets of different twistings, take the hum between them, that k vector space is zero. Right? That's okay. In this case, it's not zero. And is it obvious? Well, I know, but there's a thing you can work out. I'm happy to explain more if you want, but I think we should go take a picture. Yeah. Okay, yeah, let's play this thing.
