    Well if if anyone has put an AirPod through the washing machine, the the um important takeaway is that you can still hear through it, but no one can hear you from it. Okay. Something's going on, you can still discreet. Maybe there's some conversations here. Apparently others have experienced that. I think that it's showing up on our screen. Alright, so we're maybe waiting. It sounds like we can't hear advanced and they can't see us. Here advance and they can't see us. Okay. Did I run downstairs and find somebody? Sorry about that. All right. I messaged. Did you message? I messaged a couple days ago. Oh, two weeks. Okay. How about you last night? Mine lasted about a year without the washing machine. So I felt like that was a pretty solid script. Downstairs. Okay, so we. Okay, so waiting. Yeah, all the plugs are still red, so. What you could do in email is have everyone just link it to Zoom, send everyone the email and bring them out the Zoom link. Oh, you're sending very beautiful images. We've got a bunch of images. There we go. Yeah, we're back. You're back. Cool. It was because of the in their back. Can you all see us? Yep. Yes? Yep. We might still not hear you, but maybe that's because we're not switched. We're back. Go for it. Okay, go ahead. Okay. I'm good. Alright, so we will start again. So, like I was saying, my work's in complex systems and the work that I'm going to talk about today is specifically at the scale of cells interacting to form skin patterns. And so this is the organism that I'll focus on. Is the organism that I'll focus on? It's zebrafish or organiopurio. And what you see in this video here, which we'll restart in just a second, is the tens of thousands of cells on the fish skin self-organizing to produce its pattern as the fish grows. And the black pigment cells in particular are the easiest to see visibly in this image. And so I wanted to mention that it is a nice outgrowth of some of the work that I'll talk about. Of some of the work that Paul talked about, in the sense that it's one scale up, but what's going on behind the scenes here is that these cells are interacting with each other through a variety of different mechanisms. These are some of those pigment cells that have been pulled out of the fish skin and put in petri dishes. Here you can see some of the black cells moving around and interacting with each other. But in this video in particular, you can see a black cell reaching out and retracting cellular extensions. Cellular extensions pretty dynamically. So I think it's a nice story to tell as we go up the scales. Alright, and so in terms of more biological background about this fish, what you need to know at the cellular scale is that not just are there those black pigment cells that we could easily see in the video on the last slide there, but there are also other types of pigment cells on the fish skin. So if you look in this image here, again, we can clearly Image here. Again, we can clearly see the black melanopore pigment cells. Those are similar to the human melanocyte pigment cell. But there's also silver or blue cells and orange or yellow cells in the fish skin as well. And those, you can kind of see the blue iridescent cells, the flecks, and the black stripes, and then the orange and silver is really just kind of an iridescent sheen. It's harder to see the individual cells there. But the kind of key here is that. The kind of key here is that the black cells are always present only in the black stripes, but the other types of pigment cells in zebrafish are present all over the fish skin. They just take on different colors and forms in specific stripes. So these aridophores appear silver in the light stripes and blue in the dark stripes, for example. And then the cells interact in all of our different favorite ways that cells interact. They move, so here you see a black cell leaping. Here you see a black cell leading the way and a gold cell following. They are born through differentiation of precursors and division of existing cells. They also die off through competition. And then one of the places where the biology is kind of actively and constantly changing is in this box here. So the other big thing that the cells can do is change their shape and change their color. And so if you've seen me talk about zebrafish before, this picture is slightly different. So up until So up until about 2013, the biological community was completely ignoring the segotype of cells. They thought it wasn't active in the patterning process. And then around 2013, we got this picture that actually those cells were really important and that your silver and blue cells can kind of change from one form to the other. So a silver cell could become blue and a blue cell could become silver. And now, as of December 2020, what seems to be the case actually is instead To be the case, actually, is instead it's some shared precursor cell that I've drawn as a magenta square here that differentiates into either the silver form or the blue form, and that there's just less of those shape transistors. But what you see at the bottom of the page is just a nice timeline of the pack time development process. It's a video from Dave Peru's lab. I think it's really beautiful. I wish it was in color. But what you see there is as the fish grows, these stripes are kind of added sequentially outward. Added sequentially outward from the center of the fish. So, kind of baseline question in zebrafish pattern information at this scale is: we want to understand how are the cells interacting to produce robust, reliable stripes. And what's going on behind the scenes is that we've got all these castic messy cell interactions. And really, because these kind of cell behaviors and the aridophores are the newest cells I've seen, those are the interactions that we need to, but the most important to understanding. Most important to understanding. Now, the other reason that people study zebrafish both biologically and mathematically is because zebrafish don't just have stripes. They have a whole range of different mutant patterns that can form due to genetic mutations. So here I'm showing you just a few of many different zebrafish mutants. If you look at these, what I think maybe you notice for the remainder of the talk is that a lot of these mutants are kind of similar. Are kind of similar. There's a lot of kind of broken black stripes or curvy black stripes on a yellow background. The other kind of interesting feature here is that some of these mutations disrupt the pattern in different ways on the body and the fins. For example, this specific mutant here is always characterized by the single black spot that appears at that boundary, versus this mutant here has nice normal tail fin, despite the body being messed up. Despite the body being messed up. And so, if you think about this across biological scales, what's going on is that you have some gene that is coding for some protein. Those proteins might appear in, for example, gap junctions for how the cells communicate. So you can think of a single gene coding for a single finger on a hand, and maybe two cells are communicating by shaking each other's hand. And then through all of those kind of collective cellular handshakes. Cellular handshakes, you lead to the interactions of tens of thousands of pigment cells that generate your phenotype. And so, what's exciting here is that the experimentalists know what gene codes for what protein, and they know what gene is associated with each mutant pattern. So, for example, if you have a mutation in the leopard gene, you get a spotted superfish, and that's a gene that humans share in common with the superfish. Now, what's not known. Now, what's not known is kind of the intervening parts, where what we don't know is how does that change in gene translate into a functional difference and how the cells are behaving to result in a different pattern. And Veronica, I just want to check. Is that a chat on a question or okay, all good? All right. So really, we don't know how is that change of gene functionally impacting the cycle by handshakes to lead to an altered pattern. And so most of my work focuses on this scale. Focuses on this scale, where I look at how the tens of thousands of cells interact to form an altered pattern. But really, what I would love to do with, you know, listening to these talks are really interesting. I would love to kind of move down the scale where can we actually understand the mechanisms of how the cells communicate. But really kind of pie in the sky, long-term goal for what motivates my research biologically is that I want to establish these links, help establish them between genotype, cell behavior, and phenotype for this fish. Behavior and phenotype for this fish. Okay, so if you're going to do that from a modeling perspective, the way you go about doing that, right, is building models, changing parameters in your models, and then understanding what altered patterns can come out of those models. And I think the way you do that depends on the modeling approach that you use, where one of the traditional ways of studying these types of patterns is to take a continuum or partial differential equation perspective, where folks often use reaction diffusion equations. Use reaction diffusion equations. I've looked at the sum using non-local partial differential equations. But in this case, what you're doing is modeling the density of itself. Now, an alternative approach would be to take a lattice-based or an agent-based perspective. So agent-based modeling is what most of my work focuses on, and I'll show you a video just as an example of this. But in this simulation, each point here is a pigment cell, and you're going to see time counting up in days post-provisioning. Counting up in days post-crombitization. It's how old the fish is. And the rectangle is going to be growing because the fish is growing. So if we start this, you can see the points moving around, the cells interacting, the number of cells on the fish growing in time. And so what's going on behind the scenes here is that each point has a differential equation describing how it's moving and responding to the other cells in the domain. And then on top of that, you throw a specific equation. And then on top of that you throw stochastic rules that say when a cell should differentiate, die off, change its type in the fish kit. So as you can imagine, right, the continuum models are analytically tractable. We can do nice analysis to understand what types of patterns can emerge as we change our parameters. There's a lot fewer parameters. But for the age of these models, we get a ton of parameters, and it's really hard to do analysis on these things. And the real reason for Things. And the real reason for this is that you might think: well, if you have 10,000 pigment cells, you have 10,000 coupled differential pagans, and maybe we can do some sort of dynamical system perspective on this. But the real issue is that your number of differential pagans is growing as your number of cells grow. It's also changing randomly in time as you throw random cells at the fish skin domain. So we really can't face a dynamical systems perspective. And so what that really means is it's kind of been mindful. Really means is it's kind of been my modeling work has been limited to me by hand changing parameters in the model and then making a call of whether or not a certain parameter replicates a fish pattern. And I think that there are real challenges that come with this. And so I'm just going to show you two zebrafish mutants here and two simulations of those two mutants. And I think if we all look at these, depending on how we're all kind of collecting, Depending on how we're all kind of collectively feeling, and you know, if we're in a happier mood or a less happy mood before lunch, we may think that these are really good matches between the simulated data and the biological data, or we may think that there's questions here. And really the challenge is that when you, it's not just that you can't analyze the models, it's also that the biological data itself is qualitative. So we don't have a quantitative description of this fish that we could Of this fish that we could match through extensive simulation. Instead, we just know that there's messy blue spots roughly aligned in stripes with peppered black cells. And so we have to ask, did we reproduce that or not? And I think this one is even harder to determine if we reproduce objectively. Now, on top of that, there's this issue of the reality that well reaperfish, wild bank reaperfish, are nice and reliably Fish are nice and reliably robust and have nice perfect stripes. The mutants are really, really messy. So, a single mutant picture might be published in the biological literature, but if you were to go looking through the tanks of these mutants, there's a lot of variability in what this genetic mutation can lead to in terms of the pattern. And then on top of that, our models are also stochastic. So if we're just publishing a couple example pictures of the model, that might not be characterizing the very Might not be characterizing the variability that can come out of the model. So, really, we're kind of trying to match these two moving targets where everything is messy. We really like to be able to say that we can reproduce the realistic variability. And then just more generally, if our goal is to build predictive models that can help link genotype and phenotype and cell behavior, we really want to be able to address questions about model uniqueness and understand if a single parameter is zero. you know, if a single parameter is the only way of producing a human fish or if there's other ways of doing that. So really what this boils down to is before we can do any sort of sensitivity analysis or any questions about model uniqueness, we just need to be able to quantify these patterns. And so in terms of my work, like I said before, the broad biological goal that you should keep in mind for this talk in this much longer term is that I want to use this seafruff. Is that I want to use this separation to help link genes, cell behavior, and visible animal characteristics to understand those mutant patterns. And this really feeds right into the mathematical goal, which is to say, how do we handle these really messy models where you have a bunch of stochastic cell behavior? And it's hard to quantify it objectively. So we want to get our hands on that. Okay, so my work on zebrafish spans a range of different kind of sub-projects. Um, kind of sub-projects, but the stuff that I'm going to talk about today is the agent-based modeling work and then our methods for quantifying agent-based patterns. And these are specifically based on topological data analysis and more specifically versus the homology. Okay. I want to acknowledge the folks who were involved in the work today and some of these other projects. So I'm going to show some NVIBO data that is from the New Sein-Polkard Lab at Max Planck Developmental Biology. And then the top of the Biology, and then the topological methods were led by Melissa McGirl, who's at PHP student at the time and is now at Spotify, and Bjorn Schochrad. And then the model was also with Bjorn. And then later on in the talk, I'll also highlight some work that was with two really strong undergraduate students, Olivia and Harita, who helped with the image processing of the in vivo data. All right, let's jump into it. So in terms of the additional biological background, The additional biological backgrounds that you need to know before we jump into the HIVE model. Like I said, there's these various types of pigment cells that are present in the fish skin. I think this is really a simplification, just saying that there's black, melanophores, silver and blue, rhythophores, and orange and yellow. Xanthophores is probably many different subtypes. But what you want to think of is that these cells are kind of arranged in a mosaic on the fish skin. They come in three different layers, and from that mosaic, we see And from that mosaic, we see a nice fish pattern. And so what I want to mention here is that all the prior work on zebrafish, including my work and what I'll talk about today, all comes from the perspective of, I would call it, phenomenological rather than mechanistic modeling. So the way that the cells interact on the fish skin is through many different menus. There's gap junctions, there's fish and signals, you can think of ligands and receptors, there's cellular extensions of There's cellular extensions of different lengths and some of these involve macrophages. But really, none of the models work on the scale of how the cells are communicating. They all work on the scale of just cells are communicating. And we don't know the mechanism behind it. But really, the models that are out there span these agent-based, lattice-based, and end-continuum approaches. And what I'll say is that up until 2016, all of these models. All of these models were two-cell models. They were just black and gold stripes, so black and gold cells. And it's only even more recently that we've included more pigment cells in the models. Okay, and so our model that I'll talk about today was the one that was trying to address these questions about silver and blue or rhinocores and how they change their shapes. Okay, so that kind of just gives you an overview of the model on one side. Model on one side. We use an agent-based approach, so that means that we're considering these independent cells that are interacting on a growing 2D domain. This gives you a sense of what the domain looks like relative to the size of the fish, but it will just grow as the fish grows. And then the cells are just point masses. So at this point, I didn't have data on cell size. I do now. So we can start to include cell size in the models. But at this point, it's just a point mass for each pigment cell. So m to the i. Each pigment cell. So, m to the i is the coordinate of the i flex cell, x p sub i is the xy coordinate of the i born cell, and so on. So, you might start with 100 cells on your fish skin, and then over time you end up with maybe 10,000 at the end of two months of development. So, the cells interact both locally with their neighbors, and then related some to what Paul was talking about, they also interact for quite long range through cellular extensions. And so, here you see one of those types of And so here you see one of those cellular extensions. That cell is reaching out a leg. It's about five cell diameters across. It's reaching about half a stripe width away. So it's quite long range. And we include that in the model as well. And then all the ways that the cells are known to interact appear in the model. So there's cell movement through differential equations, one ODE per cell, and then cell birth and death and cell shape changes all take the form of stochastic discrete time rules. Discrete time rules. And so at the time that we were building this model, we thought of this as really just descriptive, taking known biology and plopping it into a mathematical framework. And where the field was really rapidly evolving and is continuing to change biologically was in these rules for how cells change their shape. There was really nothing known about how the cells were changing their shape. They thought they could see the cells changing their shape. Now they think they can see the cells changing from precursor shapes. Changing from precursor shapes, but from really from a modeling perspective, it works out very similarly either way. And we've adjusted this to check it. But really, this is where the model is being predictive. Okay, so just to give you a little bit more on what the model looks like, this is an example of one of the differential equations in our model. Here we're just using a kinematic approximation. So the velocity of the ice black cell is equal to the sum of the forces it feels from other black cells, for example. Feels from other black cells, for example, and the sum of the forces it feels from orange cells. These are pretty local forces, they really just act to keep the cells at nice distances away from each other, but the parameters here are based on measurements of cell-to-cell distances and based on measurements of cell speeds where we have them. And then everything else, like I said, is a form of stochastic discrete time rules. And just to give you a very broad sense of what these rules look like, this is an Look like. This is an experiment that was done by Shabirukunda's land, where what he did was take a laser and kill off a large region of the pattern in the two gold stripes and then watch what happened to the cells in the center over time. And what they found was that these black cells die off with a pretty large rate. And so kind of the conclusion was that somehow or another, these black cells need a survival signal. Black cells need a survival signal from the orange cells to stay alive. And so it hasn't been linked biologically yet. But what one could think about is that maybe, you know, either, depends on whose perspective you're looking at it from, really the polls talk, but there might be these cells are reaching out a leg to touch a gold cell and they can't find one. Maybe a signal isn't passed, or maybe they depend on a gold cell reaching out a cellular extension to find them. And then that signal to be. And then that signal can be passed. So, we're not including the cellular extensions directly in this model. I have some work going on with several new collaborators to try and build these in. But for our models, we're just saying, well, let's make it, let's simplify this. Instead of modeling the leg, let's model the cells that that cell can communicate with through a leg. So you kind of take an annulus around this black cell, it's the point of interest, and you say this annulus has a radius as long as. Has a radius as long as that leg, and what we're interested in doing is saying, count up the number of black cells in that red annulus, count up the number of orange cells, and if the number of black cells is greater than the number of orange cells with some parameter here, then with some probability, you kill off the black cells. It's kind of in a homogenized mean field way of accounting for the success of the cellular communication through these legs. But really, all of the model rules. Of the model rules in our model, the sine cell movement take this general form where we're either evaluating a cell of interest or we're evaluating a precursor cell. And I don't show the precursors in the model, but you could be evaluating a position where there is no cell to ask what's going on in its local neighborhood, what's going on in its long-range annulus, should a new cell differentiate in that region. Okay, so for cell birth and cell death, we had a pretty good sense. And cell depth, we had a pretty good sense of what these rules should look like. We didn't know the parameter alpha, but we knew the length scales that should be involved and what the form of the inequality should be. For our shape change rules, they're continuing to evolve. We knew really nothing. We didn't know what the length scales were, we didn't know what the parameters were, we didn't know what the form of the inequality should be, or what cells should be acting on the center cell. And so really the approach that we did here was to break the biological data. Is to break the biological data up into separate sets for model development and evaluation and then finally prediction. And so what I haven't told you before is that there are two main types of mutation that can lead to pattern differences in zebrafish. And the first is really kind of a boring mutant. These are these five fish here, where all your cells are interacting normally, but some cell types are missing. And so for example, this mutant here called Beffer has no Mutant here called Befir has no orange and no yellow cells. This one has no black cell. But all of these cells are behaving normally. So, what you want to do in terms of prediction is just say, can we put forward one model for how these cells are changing their shape that is consistent with all six of these fish, wild pit, and these five mutants, without changing any parameters in our model and just requiring that we take out specific elements. And so the way And so the way we did this, just because again we didn't have any means of quantifying the patterns, was by looking at a whole bunch of zebra pictures kind of pasted all over my wall and trying to puzzle out what these cell interactions could possibly be. And so I think the major question then is, are the cell interactions that we puzzled out the only cell interactions that are consistent with these six fish? I don't know. Is it really limited by Is it really limited by kind of the subjective check that I'm in for parameter space? And then there's also those questions that I raised at the beginning: where it's just: is this a really good match for this picture? And can we reproduce the broader variability across these means, across our stochastic simulations? But kind of going through this process took a pretty long time. And so we put forward the model and then we said, well, let's step back and ask, can we reproduce something we didn't build in? And this is where you go. In and this is where you go to a bunch of evaluation experiments. I'm not going to show these, but we did well. And so, then, of course, it's not approved related to kind of this PRL question about the experiments that I could have. It's not approved at this stage, at least for, but we believe that it says something meaningful. And so we can use this model to start to make predictions on the mutants that we're actually interested in, where these are the mutants where all your cells are present, but some cells. Cells are present, but some cell interaction is changed in some unknown way. And we want to understand what cell interactions are changed so we can make an experimentally testable prediction about what cell behavior is associated with EH gene. And so I'm showing you just a few of the fish that we've done this for. This is a leopard-mutant zebrafish, and then these are evolutionary relatives of zebrafish, where we change a specific set of cell behaviors, and we can lead to an experimentally tested. Lead to an experimentally testable prediction. And so, if I was kind of looking at these fish only, I'd say, ah, well, we got it, we got these four fish. It's pretty clear that this one goes with this one and this one goes with this one. But it becomes much more challenging as soon as you open it up to a wider class of patterns. And so the reality is, like I showed in that very early picture at the beginning of my talk, there's a whole lot of zebrafish means that are associated with different genes. With different genes, but that lead to patterns that are kind of similar. And not only are they kind of similar, but these are all messy, distinct mutants. So if I pulled 100 fish out of the tank for each of these fish, some of them might actually look exactly the same as some of the others. You've got to look at these in terms of distributions. And so if I'm changing a cell interaction in the model, that raises a question of which spotted beaverfish is the right one for this parameter change. For this parameter change. And so the way that you kind of go about this and ask: is the prediction not just is it unique, but is it the right one? One way from a modeling perspective is to just check whether we are consistent with vacational analysis experiments. This is where you start to cross fish. Another approach is to say, well, we can use the fact that these fish look similar on their bodies, but their fittings. On their bodies, but their fins are pretty different. This fin is significantly different than this one, even though these two fish might not be easy to tell the difference from otherwise. And so, what we're doing now is starting to build kind of full-scale vaporfish model simulations so that we can see the fins and the body and require that our predictions are consistent across those regions. Okay, but the other approach you could say is just, you know, all of these methods, no matter what, they all rely on modeling for. What they all rely on a modeling perspective, so it's all eyeball norm. And so, the other possibility would be to say, well, if we want to answer the question of uniqueness, we need to go this route of developing methods for quantifying these patterns and quantifying them both in silico and in diesel. I know I'm running out of time, so I will go through this pretty quickly. But if we look at these fish pictures and you want to search across your parameters to be able to address questions about fish. Able to address questions about predictive uniqueness. Really, what we want to be able to quantify is the number of stripes in an image, number of spots, the number of breaks in stripes. We want to understand spot roundness and stripe straightness. And the approach that we used to do this was based in topological data analysis because we wanted it to be an interpretable method that was really cell-based, because the practices were cell-based. And so I just kind of did a crush. And so just kind of as a crash course, there's more references on this, including some from one of our organizers down here. The kind of basic idea behind topological data analysis and versus epomology is that it is a means of measuring the shape of your data. So one of the ways that this can work is by putting a ball around each data point and slowly increasing the size of the balls. And then when two balls intersect, you draw a line between the points. You draw a line between the points. So, the key here is that there are nice computational resources out there that will tell you, as a function of the ball radii, how many connected components and how many holes or loops are present in your data. And we use that as a means of measuring patterns. I'm going to skip through the details, but if folks have questions, I'm happy to go through it and just say what we do is we apply for Say, what we do is we apply persistent cosmology to the positions of our pigment cells. What that means is you take cells here, put those falls around it, and then as you increase the size of the ball, what will come out of your prisonology computations is that the number of stripes in your image is just the number of holes in your data if you're wrapping to a periodic domain, and the number of spots in your image is just the number of connected components. The number of connected components in your data. You can also get measurements about stripe width and stripe curvature from this as well, but I don't want to keep everyone post-lunch. I will say that the approaches that we're using for zebrafish, I think, can be applied to many different types of applications. We had to make some very specific choices for our biological problem here to make it work. But what we are going to But what we are going to upload on GitHub soon is a set of methods that won't require as many choices, so that it kind of identifies what is the right choice and how to apply charismology to this data. So yeah, I'm skipping all the kind of the technical details of this, but all I will say is that it really gives us a means of quantifying our patterns so that we can actually get measurements of Measurements of stripe width, of stripe curviness, and look at those measurements on many, many more simulations. So it's not just the modeler viewing patterns, but we can look at thousands of simulations and understand the variability across those things. The other kind of direction that we're moving in is to say you can look at changing parameters in your model without having to be limited by a modeler viewing the pictures, we can identify. In the pictures, we can identify what the role of various parameters are. So that hopefully we can begin to address this question about marble uniqueness in the future. And so really all this, my favorite part of this method is that you can also apply it to the biological data. And so now what I'm doing is working with this large set of images from the new Scientology Lab, where we're actually taking the biological data, extracting the pigment cells. It's a little bit of a hassle because the bio. It's a little bit of a hassle because the biological data is messy. And grabbing them, and then you can apply for system ecology to that data just as well. So that in the future we'll be able to quantify what is the difference or similarity between many, many real fish and many simulated fish. All right, I will stop there, I think. And thank you all so much for your patience and for having me. And I'm happy to take questions. Thank you so much, Al. Thank you so much, Al. So we'll be taking questions really soon. I just wanted to give this announcement verbally as well for virtual participants. If you all can stay another minute after we're done with the Q ⁇ A to allow for staff to take a group photo of us. But with that, it was a lovely talk as always, Al. And let's see who might have questions from virtual virtual. Hello? Go ahead. Yeah, so great talk. And so I'm just kind of working on this agent-based modeling. And so I was wondering if you came up with any kind of good strategies for finding Strategies for finding bugs when you're creating these models and even the software? Yeah, that's a good question. So my models are all MATLAB and mainly matrix multiplication for various things. I think at the very beginning, I probably started with much simpler models. So just, for example, turning off self- So, just for example, turning on cell birth and cell death and only having cell movement. So, then you would ask: Are your cells interacting in the way that you'd expect? We've also looked some at continuum models, so you can check there that the cell movement interactions in the HIV based model are consistent with what you'd expect in the continuum model. It's harder when you have cell birth and cell death, but I would say early on, I think it was just looking at components of the model at a time and turning off. The bottle at a time and read off the other pieces. Yeah. I've asked you many, many questions throughout time about these things, but you mentioned that now you might have masses of these different cells from experiments. Are they different between these different cells that you're modeling, the agent-based model? Are they like significantly different? I'm just curious. It's a good question. So the Malagora sublack cells are so much. For is the black cells are so much bigger than the other cells, at least in the pictures that we get. But I think it's important to keep in mind that these pictures are when the cells have been treated with some chemical, so they are contracted. I think the reality is that the orange cells and the silver cells and the blue cells probably have probably more spread out in terms of their cellular extension. So I think, yeah, that's what I would say: is if the black cells look bigger. Say is the black cells look bigger, but it's probably more of a network between the other cell types. What we are most interested in is within a cell type, because the way that they're treated impacts them differently, is there differences between the cells at the boundary of a stripe or in the center? And is that at all related to how quickly the cells are being born or dying off? That's one of the questions the experimentalists have asked us. Very interesting. Yeah. Very interesting. One more question from Zoom. And yeah, hi, nice talk as usual. Could you say a little bit more about how you're thinking about the distributions of patterns that you see? I mean, I can imagine that in real fish, that variability can come from different sources. It comes from the variation in cell types that you talked about, or stochastic differences, or other. Or other underlying phenotypic and genotypic differences. So, does it matter, do you think, where the sources of variation come from in comparing to your models? That's a good question. So, I think, so when I say variability, I mean variability within one single gene. So, this fish, in theory, being right, it should have all its cells behaving in the same kinds of ways. There's going to be many. The same kinds of weights, there's going to be messness in that, but it creates, right? It can be compared to stochastic simulations of our model under one set of parameters. Now, I think that I'd say one kind of variability that we want to avoid is variability in just the image processing and how we grab the cells from the image, right? That would be bad. So, we're really checking that. But I think, let's see, what we are after now, and I didn't talk about this at all, is to understand. This at all is to understand: can the variability tell us something about the mechanism of cell communication? So, I'm working with this group of postdocs who are starting to put in cellular extensions. Actually, in the model, we want to understand what kind of noise just comes out of that process, how successful ribosols are communicating under what time scale, and how would that transform into like my annulus picture, right? And then you want to also ask, And then you want to also ask, and this is kind of on our to-do list, is if instead it's a signal that's a diffusing signal, how would that impact the type of noise that would be present in the simulation? And then we want to connect that to the agent-based model and say this is the distribution that patterns that emerges from that type of variability. Maybe that tells you something about the mechanism behind the scenes. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thanks. Any questions from the room? Any questions from the room? Assuming we can hear you. You should be embarrassed. Yes. Maybe just one quick one? Yeah, later. Yeah, just one quick one. Great talk as ever. When you construct this sort of agent-based model that has many cells and rules in it, and then maybe later you find out that one rule should be changed because the biologists. Changed because the biologists know more or something. How do you do that without affecting all of your previous conclusions? Meaning. Oh, that's a good question. Yeah, right. Yeah. So this is related to this picture. This picture came in December 2020, right before all my tender tech interviews. And I was like, why? Why would you do this? Like the biologists are like after me. So this was a really easy change. Change and it was just changing the cell differentiation to just precursors coming from it. And I don't have nice videos of that yet, but it works out just fine. What I would say is more generally, when I was working with some of the zebrafish evolutionary relatives, I was talking to Christiana just like and I told her, there's so little known about these fish, I'm concerned that if I put out a model, I will be wrong. If I put out a model, I will be wrong. And what do I do then? And she said that that was completely fine, and that absolutely would expect that I would be wrong sometimes. And that's kind of how you push the build forward. So that is, that's kind of what I try and remember. In some senses, we're all kind of punching through and trying to get a sense of how to get there. But yeah, this particular change was very, it was really. It was really kind of just like a mentality shift in the model. Thank you. I don't think we have any more questions. Right, let's thank Al and Bull for this great session. And I will leave it on to Burris after to tell us how to do this. Do this. Would you mind turning on your cameras? And I will take a couple screenshots and then we'll try to flush the shopping.
