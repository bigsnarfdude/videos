It's my pleasure to introduce the last talk of this conference. So, Jay Shah will talk about the two theories of real signal control spectrum. So, thanks for the invitation to speak, and I promise I won't go over time since I am giving the last talk today. So, I'd like to first recall the work of Nicholas and Schultz on cyclotomic spectrum. So, let's let P be a prime, and let's consider the scar. And let's consider the subgroup of P roots of unity. I should say P to the K roots of unity. K greater than or equals zero. And Nicholson Schultz introduced a fantastic definition of a notion of a cyclotomic spectrum, which I'll call a Borel cyclotomic spectrum. So a Borel cyclotomic spectrum, which we've already seen, Spectrum, which we've already seen in this workshop, is the data of a spectrum X with mu P infinity action, together with the data of a map from X to its mu P t construction, which is mu P infinity equivariant. And here I identify the mu P infinity equivalent. And here I identify the mu p infinity action in the take instruction as usual as the residual action, where I identify the quotient of mu p infinity by mu p with itself via the p-power map. So this assembles to an infinity category, sic, spa, sub. Wait a minute, this is a tank construction is over C P or residual. Over mu p, yes. So mu p sitting inside mu p. So if I have a residual action on the tank construction. A residual action on the take construction, particularly but this group is isomorphic to mutually any higher B tau. So this is a notion of Borel cyclomic spectrum that appeared, for instance, in Martin's talk. And it yields an infinite category by taking the lax equalizer of Borel mu Pfinney spectra with this tape construction, of the lax equalizer of the identity of the take construction in that category. I'd like to compare to, however, the I'd like to compare to, however, the more classical approach to sequel topic spectrum, because that's the heart of the somehow what I'm speaking about today. So let's let, on the other hand, mu p infinity, genuine equivariant spectra be the inverse limit along the restriction maps of genuine mu p and equivariant spectra. I'll cease using the adjective genuine, I'll just denote such categories by And by spa upper G, for instance. So we have the mup geometric fixed points as a functor from mu pn spectra to mu pn minus 1 spectra as the quotient by mu p. And by taking the inverse limit, I pass to, passing to infinity, I get an endo functor. which also denotes by phi mu p of μ p infinity spectra. And the definition is as follows. A genuine p-cipilatomic spectrum is the data of a spectrum x. X in UP infinity spectrum, together with an identity equivalence, I should say, between it and its UPG metric fixed points in that category. So UP infinity equivariant in the genuine sense. By taking now not the lax equalizer, but the equalizer of the identity and its endospheric metric fixed points, I obtain the infinity category. I came in the infinity category of genuine piece of the lattice spectrum. And I'd like to relate these two categories that I've written down before you. To do that, I'd like to introduce a bit of notation to hopefully make the forgetful functor a bit clearer. So if h is a sub g, then Sub G, then we have the G matrix points bucker from G spectra to spectra equivariant with respect to the Bile group. But I also can restrict to the underlying spectrum of this Bile group equivariant spectrum and remember the residual action of the Bible group. So, in other words, I'm discarding the geometric fixed points outside. Fixed points outside of H when I do this restriction functor. And let me denote that by the functor which sends here some spectrum y, sorry, which sends phi h x to x upper phih. This with the bottom convention. If h equals e, let's write also x e for x phi. X speed for X phi for down the line spectrum. Then given some genuine P sickletomic spectrum, I have, first of all, a mu p infinity equivariant map from X E to the T construction with respect to mu P. construction with respect to mu p, which passes through the geometric fixed points with respect to mu p. Can I ask what's the difference between phi h of x and x and phi h? So here I have a genuine viable equivariant spectrum and here I have a Borel Vile group equivariant spectrum. So maybe I should sorry I should have said that this is just functors from B of the Vile group to special. So it's in other words I take I take the underlying spectrum of the geometric fixed points regarded as a Bogecovariant spectrum with the, and I remember the action on the underlying spectrum. Is that the limit of? Yes, it's, I use this notation because it's just the limit in categories of the action on spectrum. Yeah, so the G-action, of course, acts trivially on spectrum. I need this. I need this. You apply H superscript to denote the Borel biogroup equipment guy. That's right. Yes. Maybe as a concrete instance, when H is the identity, the first functor is the identity of a functor, and then the second functor forgets to Borel. So the equivalence, which is specified in the data of a genuine P cyclotomic spectrum, if I pass the underlying spectra, it just restricts to an equivalence, which is UP infinity equivariant in the Borel sense. And then I always have a structure map from the UP geometric fixed points to the K-construction on the underlying spectrum, which is moreover in this situation mu p. Moreover, in this situation, μP infinity equivariant. So I thereby get μP infinity equivariant map. Like so. And this will define the data of Borel cyclotomic spectrum. So this is manifestly functorial. I therefore get a forgetful functor from genuine pieces. From genuine p-cyclatomic spectra to Borel P-cyclatomic spectra. And the theorem of Nicholas and Schultz is that this is an equivalence. Well, it's not exactly an equivalence, but on full subcategories of bounded below objects, U restricts to an independence. Restricts to an inference. So by bound below, I mean that the spectrum after forgetting action is bound below. So after neglecting action, the spectrum is bound below in the homotopy. So although this formulation of sort of an equivalence of infinity categories may seem abstract, it has amazing computational consequences. So as corollary, so let's recall that both T C and the genuine TC in the genuine or old sense and TC in the new sense, Nicholas Schultz, are co-represented by the unit in the respective categories. So here I'm thinking about P typical a T C. Since the forgettable functor is semantic monoidal. You obtain as a corollary the equivalence of Tcgen of X, P, and Tc on the underlying Borel piece atomic spectrum of X, P, when X is bounded below. Why do you need it to be symmetric together? It's just that. I don't need to be symmetric. No, I just need to send a unity again. Oh, the unit. Yes. Since these two functors are both. Since these two functors are both co-represented by their respective categories, if you just define abstractly these two functors as being co-represented by the unit, you can give formulas based on the definition of the respective categories. So TCGEN turns out to recover the usual definition as inverse limit over Frobenius and restriction maps of X, where I take the categorical fixed points. The categorical fixed points. On the other hand, you have a fiber sequence formula for Tc, which makes no reference to concepts of genuine equivariant homotopy theory. Namely, it sits in a fiber sequence, and here I'm thinking about X as being a Borel piece of atomic spectrum. It sits in the fiber sequence where I take the fixed points with respect to the UP infinity action, and I have a map to the K construction U P, completely fixed points. Computerly fixed points. And I have my structure map followed as a Frobenius together with the canonical map. And I've here I've taken the home through fixed points of that Frobenius map. I take their difference and I get a fiber sequence which computes Tc and C. So I get an equality of these two formulas in this situation. My goal today Is to extend this work to the real cyclotomic side. For the main motivation is, of course, to deduce new. Use new computational tools for TCR, which is the real analog of T C. I have this notion of real topological hawks oh homology that we've seen earlier of some, say, E sigma ring. Of some, say, E sigma ring spectrum, or sigma's assigned representation. And it is known by work of Hoganhaven to emit an orthogonal O2 cyclotomic structure, which Which permits one to write down the definition of TCR in this context. I'd like to write down a definition of a Borel syncotomic spectrum in this talk, which is analogous to how Nichols and Schultz think about cyclotomic spectra, but in this context of real THH and real TCR. In this talk, I won't be focusing too much on, say, calculations of THR rather. I'll be focusing on the structural aspects of genuine equivariant homotopy theory that I need to make sense of writing down a theory of Borel real P-cyclotomic spectra and comparing it to this sort of notion of O2-sickletomic spectra. Everywhere, the basic idea is that. Where the basic idea is that I need to replace the circle by the orthogonal group, which is the semi-direct product of a circle with C2, where C2 acts by complex conjugation on the circle. In my setting where I'm thinking just about these infinite groups, I'll be replacing the p to the k roots of unity by the dihedral group. And I need to think about spectra which are morel equivariant in the S1 direction, but genuine equivariant in the C2 direction. Let me first not talk about that, but rather indicate the definition of syncotomic spectra, which is analogous to Hoganhaven's notion in this context. So a genuine Real piece of atomic spectrum is the data of the D2P infinity equivariant spectrum together with an equivalence between X and its UP geometric fixed points now taken in the category of D2P infinity spectrum. So this will yield a complete category R sic spot gen P, which admits, for instance, a forgetful functor to genuine P cyclotomic spectrum. So this is sort of the obvious notion or the obvious notion to consider when you're extending cyclotomic structures to the O2F variant set. So, for a Borel theory, I need to generalize two concepts. So, there's no restriction on the C2 geometric figure point? No. So, in the Perel theory, I have to consider Consider what it means to extend spectra of μP-infinity action to now C2 spectra with a twisted VP and detection, which JD discussed in his talk. And to extend the tape instruction, And to extend the tape instruction respect to mu p to appropriate C2Epper variant refinement of the tape construction, which in this instance will be a parameterized tape construction, which is central switch. So I'd like to explain one through the lens of equivariant class fine space. Through the lens of equivariant classifying spaces. Considering replacing classifying spaces by equivariant classifying spaces will allow me to make sense of this notion, quotes, of more generally H spectra with twisted n-action. So let's let n be a normal subgroup of g. And to be safe, I should stipulate that n and g are finite. It's not so hard to, and indeed it's true that what I'm going to be saying is true in the in-finite setting as well. Though I think I always need the quotient to be finite. So let me introduce a bit of a. So let me introduce a denotation. I'll denote the extension n to g to g mod n by the letter psi. So how do you think about equivariant classifying spaces? Well, if I take that extension and I write down the corresponding fiber sequence of spaces, then if I think of this as a conf vibration, it's recording an action. It's recording an action of G mod n on the plastine space Bn. If I think about G mod n spaces as pre-sheaves on the orbit category OG mod n, then I can think about Bn as a Borel, G mod n. G mod n space by write com extension from BG mod n to OG mod n. To be specific or explicit about that, I'm going to take Bn, which has this G mod n action. In other words, it's a functor from Bg. In other words, it's a functor from B G mod n to the infinity category spaces. I'm going to write con extent to the orbit category such that this functor assigns to an orbit, g mod n over h home to the h fixed points of that action on the n. Now, it's important in the theory to consider not pre-shees of spaces. Pre-sheaves of spaces sort of by themselves, or I should say, to think about a different model of pre-sheaves of spaces on the orbit category. Namely, you have an equivalence between left vibrations over some base S and And functors from S to spaces. And I want to take this pre-sheaf and think about the corresponding left vibration. So to recall, given the functor F, I can associate to it the Groton construction F, which is an affinity category over my base S, such that the fibers are the values of F on the objects of S and the fields of the On the objects of S, and the functoriality encoded by a lifting condition on this functor. So, this is the corresponding left vibration. And I want to take this pre-sheaf and think about its corresponding left vibration, which I'll denote as the upper psi g by that n. Now for remarks. Now, for a remark. I obtained this by the sort of inexplicit procedure of unstraightening a functor to a left vibration, but in fact, I am an explicit model for De Grotti construction in this context. So I could let B psi G mod N M be a full subcategory of OG op on the n 3 g orbits. I could then take the structure map pi. I could then take the structure map pi to be the map which quotients pi m. And that's an explicit model for the Gromium construction. So, in this context, I think about equivariant classifying spaces to have a notion of promoting a G mod N spectrum to some Gmod N spectrum to something which emits an n action twisted by the extension psi. So, what's the target? In this language, the natural target for functors out of this left vibration over OG mod and off are co-Cartesian vibrations over OG mod and off. So I also should consider, in other words, G mod n categories. G mod n categories regarded as quote-Cartesian vibrations over OG mod null. And I have a very specific one in mind, namely, if you look at the following pre-sheave on OG mod et al in categories, which sends g mod n over h to h spectra, and whose functoriality Equals that of restriction conjugation. Well, I had a question kind of answered earlier. So different from just assigning to each orbit there are already fixed ones? Or is it the construction? It's the same. So it's a lemma to check that they're the same. These are this these These are robot. So I find this presentation advantageous because it's an explicit model of the Grand Deconstruction, which is useful when I think purely in terms of vibrations, rather than this potentially inexplicit unstrain. But really, I mean, if you think about what this is, it's just in terms of this vibration, you're going to write down a section category. Then you identify that. So I'm considering this pre-sheaf of categories of OG mod n such that the value on the terminal orbit is g mod n spectra. So I'm just taking g mod n spectra and I'm extending that via the restriction and conjugation functoriality to a pre-sheaf. So let me denote the unstraightening. The unstraightening of that to a co-cartesian vibration as SP underline G mod n over OG mod nL. So this, if you like the language parameterized categories, is the G mod n category of G mod n structure. Now I have Now I have the target of functed sort of diagrams indexed on this equivariant classifying space. So I can define a G on N spectrum twisted n action is a Is a, which is maybe I should indicate that's twisted by the extension, is a functor B psi g mod n to S the underlying G mod n over O G mod n op, that preserves Co-Cartesian images. If you dislike the language of Co-Cartesian vibrations, Language of co-Cartesian vibrations, and you would prefer to think about the precise of categories instead, then the meaning of the condition that my functor be over OG by naught and preserve co-Cartesian edges is that it is the same as a natural transformation of the corresponding pre-sheaves. And maybe I should make a comment. So I said that this is the natural way in which I might think about endowing the G mod N spectrum with an N action. I, in general, has considered this sort of twist by the extension psi. But making sense of the notion of the underlying spectrum is a bit tricky in this context. So for the underlying spectrum, The underlying spectrum of such a diagram, which I'll call X, you need to pick a base point, which, in other words, is a section of this quotient from G to G mod F. So I should only expect to even make sense of the idea of an underlying spectrum in the case of a semi-dark crop, in other words. So the definition is perhaps only sensible in that case. In any case, this choice of base point is typically not canonical. There may be multiple such. So we've successfully discovered the The concept which replaces the notion of a spectrum G-action, which I need to make sense of my definition of Borel-Consycatomic spectrum. In our case, we consider... Sorry, can I ask you a quick question, really? Sure. So can I regard this category you constructed at the end of the category? At the category of G minf spectra with side fist and N action. Can I regard that as a vocalization of G spectra with G vocal? Yes, so it's the vocalization with respect to the. I'll say this in a second actually. Oh, maybe in a couple minutes. Oh, wait for a second. Yeah, I'm going to say this in a second. So let me introduce a notation for this category. So So uh where should I put this? Such functors assemble to a category. Could you maybe choose a different color? Yeah, should change blue. I should have remembered that. Red is a bad colour. So green is good colour. So I can write down this into any category. In our situation, we're thinking about C2 functors from the C2 equivariant twisted classifying space of mu P the to the C2 category of C2 spectra. And this will be our C2 spectra. C2 spectra with twisted UP infinity action. So, Mark, you can be quite explicit about what type of objects you're considering here. So, let's note that in terms of my description of this aquifering classifying space as n free g orbits. N free G orbits. The only N free G orbit up to conjugation, so in this case, I have mu P infinity free, D2P infinity orbits, are, of course, D2P infinity 1 itself and D2P infinity mod C2, where I pick a splitting of my quotient map. For instance, Quotient map. For instance, I could pick the matrix given by 0, 1, 1, 0 as gated. The vile group, moreover, here is isomorphic to a group of order 2. In terms of the presentation of C2 equivariant spectra by their geometric fixed points, the data of such a C2 functor Functor, X is the same as considering the underlying spectrum X with D2P infinity action together with the two metric fixed points. If I'm going to view X as embedded in G spectra, as I will say in a moment, but I have this object which should be thought of as the geometric fixed points of X with respect to C. X with respect to C2 with the positive fraction, and a map from that to the take construction, so with respect to C2, which is equivariant with respect to the product. So such objects aren't so intimidating, perhaps, if you think about the parameterization of spectra in terms of their G-mention response. Maybe this functor category parameterizes into any categories. Is the output a parameterized entity category? It's just an ordinary category. It's like considering natural transformations versus the internal hom in the category of functors. So one can do one or the other, but in this case I just considered it category natural transformations. So So, to understand this functor category better, going back to the perhaps generic setup, I want to embed it in the category of G-spectra, which I color. And there are two ways in which I can embed that. So, there exists, so I have a little use capital F and AP X Pi C2 to X E T C two. And I have written after it's C2 equivariant, but it's C2X. So the C2 is by C2, I C2 is, by C2, I should have said that I mean the vile group of C2 in D2P then. Ah, that's a different C2PP. Very good. Very good. Oh, because the other one is D2P. Okay, okay, yes, great, okay, okay. So there exists a restriction functor from G spectra to this category of G mod n functors. To this category of G mod n functors, the next on this classifying space. And this admits fully faithful left and right adjoints, which I'll denote by By J Laura Shrik and J Laura star. This should be followed as analogous, or rather a generalization, in the case where n equals g itself, of the restriction functor from genuine to Borel equivariant spectrum. In this case, that restriction functor admits. That restriction functor admits fully capable left and right adjoints, which identify this, rather embed this category of functors from BG to spectra in two different ways into genuine G spectra. Namely, I can take the embedding as free objects with respect to the trivial family, or as co-free objects. Likewise, I have a similar description of these two different embeddings, which I will write on the next screen. So this is where the family comes in that we've encountered a few times already in this workshop. So let's let gamma n be the n3 g family. So So, in other words, it's the subgroups H such that H intersects N trivially. Then J lower streak has a central image, the gamma and torsion G spectra, where X, such a spectrum X is equivalent to E gamma N plus. And plus smashux. The geometric fixed points are supported on the family. It's another way of saying it. And J lower star has a central image, the gamma incomplete tree spectrum. In other words, the map from X to the internal R from E gamma N plus comma X is an equivalence. Map to the gamma n. Mapped to the gamma n completionist equivalents. I'm not sure how standard this terminology is. I learned it from a paper of Matthew Dauman Noel. I think it's fairly canonical terminology. Free and code-free might be more. I thought free and code-free usually was only said in the case of a trivial family. Actually, what did you, how did you call these objects in your paper with me? Um the notation changed and nobody remembers. The terminology changed and nobody remembers. So you may of course be familiar with these concepts from generalized take home. So I think this proposition is rather remarkable. It's identifying somehow, you know, in the case of G-spectra, you have both the co-free and free objects because the equivalence between torsion and complete objects, they're canonically equivalent. But I have an independent description of the category as the category of functors. That's the sort of theorem that I'm generalizing when I write this proposition. Write this proposition. So I locate, in particular, I locate the subcategory as a concept in parameterized category theory. I need the language of parameterized category theory to make sense of an independent description, independently embedding up that category. So now, like, I don't, a priori I would have had to, like, give way more data and given a G-spectrum and then checked a bunch of conditions. But here you're saying I can just specify. Here you're saying I can just specify at the outset more precisely that to have. So, another way in which I can use these embeddings is to define, independent of knowledge of index category theory, the notions of parameterized orbits, fixed points, and the parameterized k-construction, which I need to complete my definition of Pharrell-Piece of Cotops. So, definition, let's look at the definition of the definition of Definition, let's let x from B side g mod n to g mod n spectra be a g mod n functor. And the psi parameterized orbits x lower h psi is defined to be J Lures Shriek of X and taking n categorical fixed. And taking n categorical fixed points to get a G mod n spection. So, this, if you use the formula for J. Lower Shrik, then you would recover the definition JD spoke about in his talk. Likewise, the psi parametrized fixed points, x upper psi, is defined to be J lower star, and then I take n categorical fixed points. To n categorical fixed points. And I wrote a map here. That map arises from the canonical map from canonical map transformation from the left adjoint of the restriction function to the right adjoint, which is always present in such a situation. Finally, I have a parameterized k-construction, which is of course just a cofina. So let me call this a norm math. So let me call this a norm map. So that defines the second piece, it's the second construction I need to make sense of my def what I'm going to write down soon. It's my definition of Berrel Constitution. Before I do that, let me just mention why you might deserve to call these objects as defined parametrized orbits, fixed points, and tape. parameterize orbits, fixed points, and tape. There's an independent definition of these two objects, namely, I can let, if you're familiar with the language of index or parameterized category theory, I can let this be the G Moden collimit of the G Moden diagram. This will be the fixed points will be the G Moden limit. Limit of the Gmod N diagram. And the tape construction, well, that requires a bit more technology to set up if I view these as just G by the n limits and G by the n co-limits. But it turns out that I can do a Hopkins-Lurry style definition, inductive definition of a parameterized norm map. Trice norm map and then define the take instruction as the cofactor in that sense. You could do the same in the situation where you're just looking at functors, for instance, and define a take instruction independent of the embedding of functors from BG to spectra as co-free and free objects from G spectra. So the comparison that you need to relate these That you need to relate these two definitions amounts to the Adenz isomorphism for N and G. Well, yield the comparison. And this is slightly not right instant. So, using all this parameterized technology, I can finally get the main definition of our work. So Morel real piece of atomic spectrum is the data of a C2 spectrum X with X with twisted UP Finny action together with a UP twisted equivariant map from X to the parameterized state construction with respect to mu P and C2. So by this I mean C2. So by this, I mean this is notation now for just x upper t psi, where psi equals mu p and dgp. I just use the less heavy notation in the case where I know what the action of C2 on the normal socket is in this dihedral set. This assembles to an infinity category. This assembles to an infinity category. Usual sort of definitions of lax equal acts or it assembles to an infinity category, R6 sub P. And our main theorem of our work, my work with JD, is that you can write down a forgetful functor relating the two theories as before. And that this forgetful operator restricts to an equivalence on underlying down and below objects. Rather, I should say, full subcategories thereafter. Where underlying bound below, I mean just that if I forget both the μP infinity equivariant structure and the C2 geometric fixed points, then I have a bound and below spectrum. So I could say that that is cal below. So maybe I should pause and ask if there are any questions at any time. You could just throw in a bunch of random chunks, a junk of whole C2 geometric fix points, and expect, does it say something about why that doesn't matter? You would expect that the whole C2 spectrum would be that. So the geometric fixed points has connectivity like that, maybe of the tate. Maybe it's the reason. It looks like that the tape is usually. Yeah, so I don't want to impose a bound blow condition on the G measure, on the C2 G measurements. So something's going to occur. If I have some object, say X here, then I can think about it, for instance, sorry, I can, an object which is a relatively piece of. An object which is a relevant piece of stock spectrum is such data. So let's forget the Frobenius map and just view the C2 spectrum maps with some twisted action. Let's also forget the twisted action and just think about the C2 spectrum. Then I'm saying that the condition of being bound below is only a condition on the underlying spectrum of that C2 spectrum. So in particular, there's not a condition on the connectivity of the geometric response. That's what this means. So. So there are two possibilities. Yes. So it falls out of the proof of that. So more technically, it falls out of the proof of the dihedral take norbit law. But I agree that it's a somewhat surprising condition. I also have a question about this right-hand side. So can you do that also for S1? So, can you do that also for S1? Where you would have like this? This is. It's tricky if the group is compactly. So, usually you don't want to define things in this manner way. Because you have a shifted channel. But they set it up in a definite manner. We haven't written that. So, is this why you're restricting UP infinity? Yes. And then so, I guess maybe you could define the take UP infinity. So I guess maybe you could define the tape and p infinity as just the language of the tape in the p. That's right, that it is the lament. In the infine situation, it's easy to make sense of the construction. I mean, I could also have thought about replacing UP infinity with O2, sorry, with S1, and written out a similar definition. However, the comparison would be a bit screwed up. It's the same phenomenon that happens in the Nicola Schultz work. So I don't think. So, I don't think I have a great answer to Tillen's question apart from examining the proof of the dihedral table. It turns out that the connectivity of geometric fix once is not interim to the proof of the tape. But I think that it's because that's related to the connectivity of the tape, which you can't require to be you can't require that to you can't control the connectivity of the tape construction. Well, certainly this is better because now I can stick in Borel C2 spectra. Yeah, yeah. Before, so in that definition you were erasing now, what was J This? So are you talking about this J? Yep. So that was the left adjoint to the natural restriction functor from genuine G spectra to Gmon N spectra, twisted psi and X. So just like with So, just like with the embedding of Veralgi spectra as co-free and free, so I denote the left adjoint, namely the embedding as free, as JLOR star, sorry, JLOR Shriek, and the right adjoint as J-Loir star. So, the thing I'm erasing, so this approach to the take construction is the Greenleaf-May approach, and this is maybe the Lurry approach or Hopkins-Lurry approach. And yeah, so they're they're turned out to be the same. Turned out to be the same. The JLo trick is like that E fancy F plus Smash something, and then otherwise. Yes? So you can give the same formulas that JD wrote down for computing these fibers in this situation. So what's the corollary of this? So what are the implications for TCR? Implications for TCR. So you have TCR gen of XP is again equivalent to TCR of U R X P in the U B B situation where I define these functors As the functor C2 co-represented by the unit. So again, you are here. Forgetful comparison functor is symmetric and noidal. I consider C2 core representability because I want an equivalence of C2 spectra. It turns out everything is enriched, naturally enriched over C2 spectra. This is particular. In particular, so you can read off the formula for TCR gen without conditions on X, that's just the limit over the sort of obvious definitions of the Frobenius and restriction maps in this context, which are maps of C2 equivalent spectra. If I consider the mu Pn categorical fixed points as a C2 spectrum, we likewise have that T Cr, that's that P, is the fiber Fiber of taking the parametrizer fixed points to the tape and then parametrized fixed points of Frobenius fixed by election minus the development. So you have these formulas in complete generality, then you have an equivalence of formulas under this. Equivalence of formulas under this UBV assumption. Together with a complete reconstruction of the data of the sort of genuine equivariant, in particular the dihedral fixed points, from just the structure of the Spirel real piece of atomic spectrum in this UVB set. So you have the same formulas giving those dihedral fixed points as iterated limits. So let me just comment in the So let me just comment in the brief amount of time I have, five minutes, on the proof. So, proof, there are two inputs. Roughly speaking, there's a computational input. So if I have x is a functor from BC2, From BC2 to mu B squared to C2 spectra. Then I can take the parameterized orbits, follow the parametrized tape, and I have vanishing in a UVB set. So that's what I call the dihedral tape orbital. So to actually relate it to something To actually relate it to something like the cohomology of the dihedral group, you would have to write down a formula which relates this parameterized take instruction to just take instructions involving dihedral groups. But one can do such a problem. There's also a categorical aspect or Hafton's proof, namely, I want to use the parameterization. The parameterization in terms of geometric fixed points of G spectrum. So the optimal way, in my opinion, for proving result like what Nicholson and Schultz prove is to use a description of G spectra as data. As data encoded by the geometric fixed points, together with maps among such, where I slip in generalized take instructions. So let me just comment. So this presentation, so in terms of geometric points, well, Well, if you have a CE spectrum, X, that's the same as X underlying CP action, CP geometric fixed points to get over that. And I thus get that CP decomposes as a fiber product of some categories. Where I use upper HCP again to the notebook. Here I have the tate, and here I have evaluation one. So the tape orbit lemma implies a similar iterative description of CPTN equivariant spectra. Where this is an equivalence on UV, sorry, down below objects now. And this sends a CPN spectrum to its system of geometric fixed points and maps from the CPN geometric fixed points to like k double the CPN minus one and so on and so forth. Minus one and so on and so forth. So if I ignore that attaching data, I'm just looking at the geometric fix points for this equivalence, which again is the equivalence bound below subcategories. So you pass to infinity to get a description of C P infinity spectra, and then you can literally identify the geometric fixed points as a shift functor. Functor. Once you do that, it's not so hard to prove the theorem of Nikols and Choltzek. In this situation, I want analogous decompositions of dihedral equivariant spectra. And you play the same game. So here, you just replace, for instance, Cp spectra with D2P spectra. That decomposes as a pullback, where I have now C2 functors. Two falters replacing Borel equivariant here and just no action there. You have the same number of descriptions of dihedral spectra. So you have a description of this guy, you have a description of this. And once you understand those descriptions and understand the action of the geometric fixed points, you produce the action. So I think that's all I have to do. Thanks for your attention. Any questions for Jay? Sorry, I mean, I guess like do you do you use geo theory and like sort of say everything in terms of like geometrics you can Everything in terms of like geometric figure points, also? Yes. I mean, then, I mean, I'm wondering if there's a way of saying that without choosing an X's as well. I mean, like, writing all tools is my direct product with X's. So, in a semiconductor, like all choices. So, are you saying I'm choosing a splitting of the determinant map? Yeah. So, I don't know of a way of getting around that, but yeah. So I don't know of a way of getting around that, but yeah, maybe. I choose the same, I make the same convention Gabe did in this talk. I know this is a whole bit in your paper about monoidality of these recalled months. Can you say a little bit how that fits into the story? So is that just is this that to get the lax monoidality of the So yeah, a basic way in which it enters is that you want the tape construction to be lax symmetrical than light. The tape construction to be lack symmetric in one, for instance, and the parameterized tape construction to be lack symmetric than all. So I need it for that, for basic applications. So yeah, so one advantage of the Greenleaf-May approach is that it shows that the lack symmetric, the TAK construction is lack symmetric and original, which is not obvious from taking the co-fiber of the Nord map. Any more questions?
