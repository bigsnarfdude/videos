So, this is a rough plan of the talk, but I know it's 25 minutes. I need to keep everything brief. And I'll first give a very, very brief review of the result with local diffusion and without a free boundary. And we all know these classical. And we all know these classical papers were Fisher and KPP, the three former Soviet Union mathematicians, they tried to use these Recognition diffusion equation to describe the spreading of the species. So here, so U stands for the density of the species. And so there are two terms. This is the diffusion term, this is the growth term. So the diffusion. term. So the diffusion term is obtained by assuming that individuals in the individuals of the species move around in space following this rule of Brownian motion. And the great success of this model is because it gives you a spreading speed. And this was already indicated and claimed in the feature. Claimed in the Fisher KPP paper. But this work by Aronson and Weinberg in 1978 really described this in a way very easy to accept for even the biologist. So they proved that if your initial population is concentrated locally, in mathematics, we say the initial function as compact support. And then the population for large And then the population for a larger time would be close to the current capacity one inside of this growing ball of radius increasing nearly linearly C star times T. And outside of the ball, the population density is close to zero. And this gives you a clear meaning that the population spread into new territory with this asymptotic speed C-star. Moreover, Moreover, these C star can be calculated rather easily using this model. If you take the fission nonlinearity, actually, these C star has this very simple formula, 2 square root D. D is the diffusion coefficient. And this is obtained by looking for self-similar solutions of this type. And then you reduce the original PDE parabolic. PDE parabolic probe to this ODE. And then even Fisher and also KPP, they were able to determine this ODE has a solution we see greater than equal to C star. No solution we see is less than C star. And they already claimed that the C star should be the burning speed of the species, not everything greater than C star. And this was And these results really indicate indeed the C star is the spring speed. But of course, like every model, it's not perfect. And this classical model one has a shortcoming. That is, if you really want to understand the population range determined by the model, then it doesn't tell you exactly what is the population range. Because by natural Because by naturally, the population range is where, at time t, is where the density is positive. But the strong Maximum principle tells you that, well, as long as t is positive, this is the entire Rn. Though you assume at time equals zero, the population range at t equals zero, because we assume the initial function has compact support, then it's a bounded set. And to fix this problem, one way is to nominate a small constant delta. And instead of using this to denote the population range at t, you use this one. So you ask the population density to be greater than delta. And then this set omega delta at any time t is like at t equals zero, it's a bounded set. And then you can use the boundary of this set to represent. This set to represent the spreading front. And then the Aronson-Weinberger result indicates that this spreading front is contained in this annulus spherical shell with a thickness 2 epsilon t. Well, compared to C dot T, that's small. And that's why we interpret that this spreading speed is a C. Suburban speed is a C star. And of course, mathematicians want to make everything accurate, and it was shown that actually this population density is determined completely by the wave profile with the minimal speed C star. But to get this accurate expression, you need to have this so-called logarithm. To have this so-called logarithmic shift, it's not the exact wave, these months that you need to add these shifts. And that's a bit of a history. And also, you can say if the solution is not really symmetric, you get still these shifts. The coefficients determine precisely, depending on the dimension. Depending on the dimension. Now, to fix the problem that the population range is not determined by the classical model, one way to fix it is to introduce a free boundary. You just assume this semi-linear parabolic problem is In a parabolic problem, it's defined only over the population range omega t. And then the boundary of omega t becomes a non-moving boundary. So we have to introduce a free boundary condition to determine that. But it turns out that this problem is well posed. So when f is identically zero, actually this reduce to the su. This reduced to the so-called waifis Stefan problem that was used to model the melting of ice in contact with the water. But with F, the fissure-cappy P nonlinearity, this is a different problem, and we could use it to model the spreading of a species. And this is a feature. And this is a physical explanation of the free boundary condition in spherical symmetric setting. And so this condition here is reduced to one like that. And in one space dimension, it's similar. And in joint work with Songmi and Guo, we proved that this problem three had. That this problem three has a unique weak solution. So we have to look for weak solutions. And one main result about this long-term dynamics is obtained in joint work with Hiroshimi Matano and Klei Wong. And we proved that this population range is expanding all the time and its boundary. Boundary is smooth outside the convex hull of the initial population range. And moreover, you look at the long time because this is expanding, you can talk about the limit of the population range defined in this way. And we can show this limit has only two possibilities, either it's a bounded set or it is the entire Rn. Moreover, when the population range is a bounded set, we can come back to look at the density function, which we can show in that case, it converts to zero. So that's what we call the vanishing case. The population vanishes. In the other possibility, we can come back to the population density and it converts to one, the current capacity. Moreover, we can also come back to see more about the population range. It's a boundary, we can show in case B becomes smooth after some initial time. A larger time is smooth and it's a smooth closed harposurface contained in this spherical shell. And the thickness of the shell. The thickness of the shell is bounded by the original initial population range omega zero. Moreover, this radius of this shell goes to infinity with asymptotic linear speed. And this linear speed is again determined by a kind of a traveling wave problem. You look for travel wave solutions, your problem. You, your problem in one space dimension, and your parabolic equation is reduced to this ODE. But now it's over the half-line instead of the entire real line, like in the classical Fischer-KPP case. But in joint work with Ben Dong-Lo of Shanghai Normal University, we proved that this problem has a unique solution, unique solution pair. This is C is the spring speed. Is the spreading speed we use there. And this QC0 star is the wavel profile. And actually, we can show that this wavel profile determines the profile of the density function. And by the way, I should mention that actually the first paper to use this step in free boundary problem to help to understand the population range. The population range was this one joint work with Ju Gui Lin of Yangzhou University. And in this paper of 2010, we consider the one-dimension case. It's simpler in one dimension because you don't have to worry about the regularity of the furry boundary. And as we could say, and so this smoothness is a big issue for free boundary problem. And that's a numerical simulation telling us that even if you start from omega zero like this, annulus will cut in two dimensions. And so it will, the population range will evolve eventually like a bull, growing bull. And this has an indication in the classical An indication in the classical model and the density function near the front really is represented by this traveling wave with speed. I think it was a C star instead of C there, the notation. And in the new model with the free boundary, this is a sharp boundary at the front. And this density function. Density function looks like this wave profile curve here. And also for the free boundary model, we could show indeed the density function is determined completely by this wave profile function. But again, if you want this kind of accuracy, you need logarithmic shift here. So this RT behaves. So, this RT behaves like that. You put this here, you see this is a logarithmic shift. And this coefficient, this C0 star, it's determined by the semi-wave. And this C1 star is obtained through this complicated formula. So, this is for the really symmetric case. If it's not really symmetric, you can use comparison principle to get this kind of estimate. The free boundary is contained. The free boundary is contained in the spherical shell. It's a radius, and it is a logarithmic shift, but its thickness is bounded. And also in joint work with Zumi and Gua, we proved that the relationship between the new model 3 with the free boundary and the classical model 1 is the following. The classical model 1 is the limiting problem of the free boundary model. Of the free boundary model when the parameter mu go to infinity. So mu is here. And there's a biological meaning in deriving these conditions. The mu one over mu is proportional to the population lost near the front. So we assume that the population is lost. We assume that the population wants to expand its territory and then it has to make some sacrifice. And so if k is the units of a sacrifice, and k equals d over mu, or mu equals d over k. So when mu goes to zero, basically it means you assume there's no population loss for the species to For the species to expand is a territory. And then you recover the classical model one. And for both one and three, we now call the local diffusion model because we used this Brainer motion assumption for the movement of the individuals in the species. But in many cases, so non-local diffusion, which takes into account for long-distance dispersal, is more realistic for population spreading. So long-distance dispersal can include factors like species, like plant species, the seed might be carried by human. Might be carried by human beings by flying, but it can train to faraway places. All these factors is better represented by using a non-local diffusion. And in one space dimension, and if we look at the classical Fischer-KPP model, but we replace the local diffusion with the non-local diffusion, this is one way of doing it, using these probability kernel functions. This probability kernel function. So if we assume, so an individual at a location x can be, can jump to any other location y with this probability, then instead of a running motion assumption leading to the Laplacian operator, we would have this. And then the classical model with the non-local diffusion becomes that. Diffusion becomes that. Everything else is the same, except instead of u sub xx, we have this non-local diffusion operator. And with this one, of course, the property of the kernel function is very important. And usually, we assume it's continuous, non-negative, and even and normalized. And then it turns out that for the long-term dynamics, That for the long-term dynamics, whether this kernel function is thin-tailed is crucial. So it's called thin-tailed if you can find some lambda so that this is integrable. If not, we say it's a fat tail. A result by Weinberg already indicated was the effect of Effect of thin-tailed kernels. He proved that for this non-local feature KPP model. And so it's a long-term dynamics. In a sense, it's similar to the local diffusion model. And so you start with a compactly supported initial population, then the density would converge to one, the current capacity when t goes to infinity. To infinity, and then you want to understand how fast they spread. And then, why we proved that you look at the front, the front goes to infinity, like linearly, if the kernel is thin-tailed. Otherwise, this limit is infinite or infinite speed. And this is usually called x. Usually called accelerated spreading. It spread faster and faster without a finite speed. Garnier even checked that if your kernel function at infinity behaves like that, then it's exponential growth for the front. And if like this, then it's t to the better with a beta greater than one. So superlinear spreading. With the And with the fractional appliances, the story is a bit different, but there are some similarities. The kernel function now is singular at zero, and also it's not integrable. And early result of Capri and Rogdoffy proved that in that case, the spreading is exponential, and they can determine the sigma star here. determine the sigma star here using the dimension and the s appearing in the fractional Laplacian. Now, how about this free boundary model? So for the non-local diffusion model, both this and that, there's the same kind of shortcoming that is, if you care about the population range, this model doesn't tell you what's exactly the population rate. It tells you a spreadsheet. It tells you a spread speed, but not the range. And we can do a similar thing in one space dimension. We can again look at the same equation, but assume it's only satisfied in the population range. So we assume the range is given by this one-dimensional changing interval. And then with the same kind of biological assumption as we used for the local free boundary. For the local free boundary model, we would derive these equations to govern the evolution of the free boundary. For this problem, okay, we assume this the basic assumption for the kernel function, we assume Fu takes the Fischer KPP form for simplicity. And I'll just skip this for explaining how we arrived at these. We arrived at these free boundary conditions. But let me only mention that. So we have a well-postedness. We again have a spreading vanishing dichotomy. These are parallel to the local diffusion case. For the spreading vanishing dichotomy to determine when spreading or vanishing happens, we already have some difference, but this case is a parallel to the local diffusion model. To the local diffusion model. So, this alpha is a new case. But I want to stress the biggest difference, of course, occurs when you look at the spread speed. For the spreading speed, in joint work with the family of Shen Ya-sen University in Guangzhou and Maolin Zhou, who is now at Nankai University. We proved that, well, for the free boundary problem, So, for the free boundary problem, a key condition for the kernel function used in the diffusion is this J1. This is equivalent to the thin-tail condition in the non-local model without a free boundary. So, this J1, if J1 is set forward, then the spherical speed is a finite. If J1 doesn't Funny. If J1 does not hold, then the speed is infinity. So this is what we call accelerated spreading. And this C0 is determined by looking for, again, for semi-wave solution or travel wave solutions. And this problem, we can show that if J1 holds, it has a unique solution pair, the C0 determines. Determines the spread speed here. And if J1 does not hold this problem, A doesn't have a solution at all. And then, of course, we want to know when this accelerated spring happens, how fast is the speed. And in joint work with Wen Jenny, who's my postdoc right now. Uh, my postdoc right now, and we look at the case: how about these kernel functions behaving like x to the minus alpha near infinity? And in that case, well, for the basic assumption, we need alpha greater than one. To have j1, we need alpha to be greater than two. When j1 holds, we have a finite spreading speed. When j1 does not hold, we have accelerated spreading, the new phenomenon. So we prove. Phenomena. So we proved that if alpha is greater than 3, so this hold, we have C0, and we can check the gap is bounded. When alpha equals 3, this gap, what we call the shift, is log t order. And when alpha is between 3 and 2, it's this order, t to the 3 minus alpha. The power is less than 1, but greater than 0. zero and when alpha equals two then j one does not hold we have we don't have c0 anymore because it's accelerated spreading and then the brown goes to infinity superlinearly like t log t and when alpha is between two and one and j is still satisfied but j one is not and then these superlinearly like this t to these power like this t to these power the power greater than one and this is a comparison between six without a free boundary non-local diffusion seven with a free boundary non-local diffusion and then the key condition for six is j thin tail for seven is j one j one and the j thin they are comparable so j thin implies So J 5 implies J1, but not the other way around. And also, we look at the case in hard dimension, but with radio symmetry. And it turns out this is rather complicated technically. It's not like the local diffusion case. You look for high-dimensional reduced symmetry, you get an extra term. But here, But here, because of the kernel function, I'll show you. So, you can write this as in one space dimension. Then you get your kernel function, J tilde, obtained in this way. And this makes the analysis rather complicated. You don't use J in a simple way, but in this way. But we wanted to show in half an To show in half dimension with a radio symmetry, the long-term dynamics is still similar to one space dimension. All these theorems are similar to one space dimension. And the difficulty occurs when you try to understand the spread speed. And then you need to use another function obtained from the original kernel function. And this just these properties. And then the sprint speed is determined by J da. J dar obtained from the original J in this way. All right. Because we are in a rigidly symmetric case, J dar actually can be expressed by J R in this way. You can say this weighting function makes it a bit complicated, difficult to analyze. But in any way, To analyze. But in any way, we can determine. So if J star says J1, the one we used in one space dimension, then we have bounded speed, finite speed, otherwise infinite speed. And also we can check the rate of spreading if JR behaves like R to the minus beta for large R. And that's our. So, in this accelerator sparring case, it's determined this way, depending on where is the orbit. And or beta in this range, we have a finest speed, but we can check the gap. It's of this order. And these remarks basically say we have not got the best result in this. Go to the best result in this case. But we believe we can remove this absolute value and change these into that similar order. But we can only do that in dimension three in a separate paper, but not for the general case. And you can see what dimension three is special because then this waiter function becomes one. That's the trick. That's the trick. I think my time is up. I'll just stop here. Thank you.
