Suppose uh the uh the pointer is something to work better. Okay, um this is it. I'm going to present to you the work we did with many people who are here actually, especially Stanislav. He presented his work actually last week at Evo Devo in a bit shorter version. And there's Sulein Song, who we already saw with Paul, who is now postdoc in the lab of Paul. There is Loreline, who is here too. Céline is unfortunately not here. Camille is here. Maté is here. Piotr is here. And Stéphane is here. And we are all here. We are very happy to be all here. So, this work is really. So, this work is really showing, I put all the cohorters or all the people that were involved in this thinking process. So, and I'm going to talk about the morphogenesis of the Gasco-Cadal system in this common user. And I look at variability and possible mechanisms that could generate this nice network that you see here of the Jetty tree. So, what are these going to use are? So, what are this combedusa? And I had a little paper that I forgot because I always forget the names. But, okay, this combedusa is a subclass of skiffomedusa, which are true jellyfish that swim. They can become big, and they swim with you like this. And so, this is one order of the family of the jellyfish that you saw before, which is Aurelia. And here is another family which Another family which is called Clina Dea or something like that, and there is a Riesosnoma medusa. So you see them here. So what you can see is that they have all quite different type of canal vascular system. So here it sprang in the rhizostoma, here it's very reticulated. In another stomach, In another species of the rhizostoma, here you see different species of the family to which belongs the Aurelia, and they have all very different connecting networks. And here you see that the branches are not at all connected. So you can see here more in detail. These are highly connecting brain systems and here they are reticulated. And here they are very reticulated, and here they are very simple. And here we have very different types of bodies. And what I'm going to try to tell you is how these, what kind of mechanisms could play a role, and that these vessels are growing into a field, in a mechanical field, actually. And if this mechanical field could explain the mechanisms of generating these patterns. So So just to say that here Jellyfish has a circular geometry and us bilateria, we mice, flies, frogs, worms, they have an elongated and we have a vertebrate. And the so the jellyfish branched off from the Bilataknia very early in Very early in the evolution. And here, just less than one hour drive away from here in the Rocky Mountains, you can find this fossil. And this fossa, and so this site, is very nice because it's a site which is at the mid-country. And this jellyfish is 20 centimeters big. So what we argue is that if it's 20 centimeters big, then this jellyfish must already have This jellyfish must already have a transport canal system. And so, already very early in the evolution, transport canal networks in animals evolved already. So, probably already before the big animal explosion in the public. So, now back to the physics or mathematics, theory. Turing. Turing, he had a really groundbreaking paper in 1951, and I think we heard Turing already earlier before, which is based on reaction diffusion in a field of cells that is diffusing. And he showed that it's dynamical systems. He showed that if you have this kind of reaction diffusion, you can have different states. States of how these cells are dynamically distributed over the tissue. And there's one state, that is the stationary waves, which is called now the Turing pattern. And I'm going to show you his first, basically, in his paper, he shows the first mechanism where he puts 20 cells in a circle and he applies this reaction diffusion. This reaction diffusion mechanism, where there's one molecule that is blocking the other molecule, it's up-regulating itself, and it's up-regulating the other molecule. If you have this, you get this state of the Turing mechanism, and you get this static wave. But what you see is what he does. He starts out with a homogeneous distribution of molecule X and Y. Of molecule X and Y. And then what he does is he puts a little bit of noise, an instability, or it becomes an instability. Because when you put a bit of noise, this noise is amplified. And he calculates this nicely by hand, which is very impressive. But this noise is then amplified. And then some of the cells have a high molecule of X. Molecule of x and a low molecule of x, and it's distributed over this circle. And then we said, well, I find very funny myself, so we can explain this way how hydra might have had tentacles, because the cells on the circle they differentiate and they grow tentacles, so that could be a signal to grow tentacles, or it could explain phyllopters in youth. And that's really the first. And that's really the first, in his paper, the first example that he shows. It's the most simple example also. You know probably the work with the patches on the animals, but this is his first example. So we have a king, Philmove actually, who visited my lab. And we are studying the Alveredia Aurvitas. So we are growing ourselves into them and we are looking. The map, and we are looking how the gastrovascular system, which you see, that are the canals that you see if it gets on the circumvella, you see very nicely the canals of the gastrovascular system. The orange stuff is the food inside, so they got the shrimps that we feed them with the shrimps, and this food is distributed over the umbrella, over the supper. Over the umbrella, over the sub-umbrella in the canal systems to get it everywhere in the body, and then it gets expelled. So it's an open circuit issue. Who is working on the jellyfish? My first student was Camilla, then Solen came, now Stanislav is still working on the jellyfish, and Lori just started her postdoc with me. So, and then there is Rena Si, she's really incredible, she's taking care of the jellyfish. She's taking care of the jellyfish. So, without her, nothing happens. But this is our system: the jellyfish are really alright. Like I said, the food is grabbed by the arms, basically, and then it's transported to the central parts of the jellyfish, which are the stomachs. And then it's distributed by these non-branched canals, and then it goes back via these branched canals into the canal. Into the stomachs, and then it, or into the arms, actually, and then it's released back to the sea. So, that's the circulation, and Loreline is going to tell you more about it. But how does this grow, this network? So, we have these unbranched vessels and we have a triangular vessel. This is actually the first stage when the the television surrounds. I we will tell you I can tell you more about it how it grows, because it grows It's how it grows because it grows stomach from polyps. But this is when it's at the first stage when it comes around, and we can trace the vessels and we can see day by day, so it's growing slowly, slow enough to follow that from the ring canal new sprouts branch off and they get reconnected to the side branches. So it's not like a tree growing like this, but it's Going like this, but it's really like from the circular canal, sprouts are sprouting off from the ring canal and they connect to the tissue. And to show that this is a spatially homogeneous growth, I superimposed day two on day three by increasing just perfectly the traces of the vessel by day. The traces of the vessel by 18%, then they perfectly superimpose on each other, except the little sprouts. They grow faster. So we have a homogeneously, spatially homogeneously distributed growth with sprouts that are growing faster than the last. So they are invading. So this is the close thing. So if we now uh idealise the growth rules, this picture was taken with Sven Song, and I started this study my postdoc, Wies Ven Song. My postdoc, Luis Venson, many, many years ago. We took this picture together, I think. But if you look at this jellyfish, now you can trace back the history of how this network was generated. So if you go, so this is the first stage, we have a straight vessel and a branched vessel, and new sprouts appear from the rim. Then they connect to what we define. Two, what we uh what we see is the most youngest vessel. And then a new generation appears, and again it reconnects to the younger vessel. That's why you get this fractal-like pattern in the changes. But in real life, this doesn't happen always like that. It's an animal and And we have a lot of variability. So here you see in the open circles, you see all the correct events, if you like. So when the new sprout connects to the hormone. But there are also failures. Like here, you see one that went all the way up to the stomach and connected to the stomach ring canal. The stomach ring canal, which is there, which is surrounding the stomach. It's not very clear, but it's there. And another canal connects to it, which should not be that dead. It should be very faint. Another failure. Here, there's another failure. Here, it should have gone to the green canal and not went to the blue canal. Did they ever connect to the red canal? Uh yeah, that happens, but that's really the most rare cases. Most rare cases. So it happens, we see it, but very rarely it connects to the ring, to the red connectors. They remain untrunged, more or less, which is good because it's bringing the food to the rim. So that's the growth mechanism. This variability, we want to put this variability to be a trace of the instability that we think is happening. That we think is happening, creating this variabilities in the networks that we see. So then we do some statistics, we look if it's really true that it really connects preferentially to the Yopa panel, and then we count how many false corrections we have per octant. So an octant is this part of the Javik because it is an octant, so it has eight octants. That has eight options. And for optants, we look how many failures we have, and you see that approximately 20% of the 20% in one option has false connections. So this is the statistics, and this is not normally distributed. So how do you define false connection, like not the ideal fractal one? Yeah, exactly. Fractal one? Yeah, exactly. So you can trace back the growth, and like we did here before. So ideal is so we have the straight vessels and we define the blue vessels which are the initial branches and then it branches off and it connects to the younger canal. It branches off and connects to the younger canal. So these are hoods. These are okay. Yeah. Then the yellow come in and they connect to Yellow come in and they connect to the green canal. This one did not enter that. This one connects nicely to the green canal, but here there's a failure. It should have connected to a green canal, but it connected to a blue canal, and the green canal got all the way up. So there is a problem there. So that's how I define the false connections. Ah, so the transport of food goals. So the transport of food goes from the stomachs, but this is very characteristic. I mean Loreline will tell you that it's complicated, it's really a complicated flow. But typically, food goes from here to here, then it's distributed along the ring canal, and via the brain canals, it's going back to the stomach, back to the sea. So now I So now I give you an analogy with crack propagation because I was in the lab with Stéphane and Yves Gouder and also Vincent who proposed, ah, you should look at crack propagation to understand what is going on with jellyfish because when you want reconnections, a tensor field where you can have could guide your vessels basically. So I'm going to show you this more field of. I'm trying to show you this actually movie also quite quite a bit. So as it probably oh it's yeah it's working. So let's stop it. Ah, I stopped it. So it's growing. So this is this is a this is mud, a layer of clay basically, which is wet, which is drying and generates a nice crack pattern. So and what happens in a crack pattern, also like Mati explained it already before, there's an instability in the field. There's an instability in the field. This instability grows. It's like if I would cut a paper, this instability makes a little crack and it releases the tension locally. So it releases the tension in the field. And when there's a new crack coming, it wants to release the tension in the other direction. So typically, a new crack will connect perpendicularly to an old. Old an already existing track, a bit like we see in the jellyfish. So, how is this? How do we see this analogy? And to show you a little bit of the anatomy, the anatomy here you have the jellyfish in a cross-section, you see the ring canal, here you see a radial canal that goes towards you, and on it the jellyfish, the canals are growing into abundant endodermal seeds. These endodermal seeds are based. Sheets. These endodermal sheets are basically the stem cells, and you can see here a cross-section. So you see here the endodermal sheet, and below you have the muscles, which are shown here. So you have a topmost layer, so you have muscles that makes the jellyfish swim, which is a unicellular layer. There is an endodermal layer, which is also a unicellular layer, with some gel in between. And the canals are spent in this endodermal. Are spent in this endodermal label. And now, what happens when the jellyfish contracts, the canals, they are there to release the tension or the compression, if you like. So that's the analogy. And how could we imagine any growth? So this compression in the tissue could lead to a higher tension in the tissue, leading to a higher tension in the end. In the endodermal cells, and that could be a signal for the tips in the jellyfish or the endodermal cells around to differentiate and let the canals grow. So, that is our crack analogy. So, how did we look at that? But we have a problem because cracks, and here Yves Goudier, he tried to mimic a leaf and he had a crack pattern, and you probably know which leaf he tried. And you probably know which leaf you try to mimic, but I don't know as the crumb nodes. But here there's gel drying on a slope, and here you have the cracks, they propagate and they can go in either direction, left or right. But in the jellyfish, they always go to beyond. So why is that? So that's what we wondered. And then, Camille Kamini, she measured the deformation of what I defined before as the Jungha Canal and the Before, as the younger canal and the older canal. And clearly, when the jellyfish is contracting, you see that the younger canal deforms more, less, sorry, deforms less than the older canals. So the older canals deform more. So the boundary conditions in which this sprout is growing is not symmetric. There is a stiff young canal and a soft old canal. And if you then And if you then imply a deformation, which we do on the circular disk, basically we push the tissue into the circular disk, you can calculate the stress field load. And what you see is that the stress around the tip, and that's typically for cracks actually, the stress around the tip of the sprout is much higher, so that could well be the signal for a new cannon sprout. New cannot sprouts to grow. And if you look very carefully what happens at the tip, you see you can trace the stress field around the tip and you can see that there are two bumps. It can either go right or it can go left and now it goes the higher bump, and it's really tiny little bit higher in our simulations, but it can be enough. The higher bump, which is traced here. Traced here with the line, and the second bump is traced here. So the higher bump goes towards the direction of the stiff canal. But thinking of instabilities, you can think that it also easily could jump to the other side. So that's why we think it can, there are some mechanical feedback. So there's a mechanical instability which is controlled by the feedback of an asymmetric festival. I'm very stressed. I have two more minutes right. Stressed. I have two more minutes, five more minutes, one, two, okay. Then, this is very good because Stanislav told me, don't say anything. So, I'm going to say just a little bit that there's a breakthrough, and this, so we see a breakthrough and we're going to see. So we see a breakthrough and we see a connection, a reconnection. And this, believe me now, this is a signature not of a cracking field, but probably of a diffusive deplacient field, like we like to simulate in software. So I'm not supposed to say more. If you don't believe me, you should listen tomorrow to sell stuff. So how do we see that? We have, so what could the single here be? The sine of VRB, not tension, but it could be either cells that are proliferating, generating a flow of cells in a surrounding tissue. That could be the hydrodynamics or the laptop that could be the generated laptation field. That can be any diffusive morphogen, or it can be simply the hypodynamics of the channels. So we don't know what it is, but just to say, This, but just to say that this network can be generated. So, both mechanisms probably playable: tension fields and Laplacian fields to make this pattern. And then, to go very quick, I will skip this one, but just to go very quick, so if we go now back to these different jellyfish, knowing or I'm suggesting that these mechanical fields play a role. Now, all these jellyfish come from a little avirule, which is the larvae jellyfish, they look pretty much the same. They grow out and they can have different gastrovascular systems. This one, only straight vessels, this one looks like the submontanor, this one looks like a complete reticulated network, and this one I just told you all about it, and also about how it's growing. So, we don't know precisely. So we don't know precisely how these guys grow, which would be interesting to study. But what we know, what we know from the literature, and all these pictures are taken from a book, Russell, who did all this work, who fished our jellyfish in the British ISIL. And all these jellyfish, they have muscles to swim. And here the muscles are distributed nicely over the canals. Here the muscles are distributed in the porelia, nicely distributed over the canals. Borrellia nicely distributed over the canals. Also, in the reticulated part, it's perfectly on the canals, but in the sienada, which I call the safmontevis, the muscles are around the vessels. So thinking of it it for me an analogy with this border growth or growth at the uh at the border and uh leaves that uh rhythmically. So And this variability we can see also in Arabia when you do very bad feeding of the jellyfish, or these were fished out of the sea by a museum in Shabur. They get the polygon, so they don't have a specific species. And they sent them to us, we grew them, so they were by post, they were two days in a plastic bag, were not fed, so they were really in a in a bad state. In a bad state, but you see, there's a big variability you can get in one species. To end, I think the chair has a conflict of interest, but you are away over you. I'm ashamed. But this is the result. And this is to acknowledge all the people with you we are working. So, Selene did a lot of work. Selene did work so. Celine did the work on the crack. He worked a lot with Piotfoste, obviously, Snap and Mate and Stefan on the theory. And then all the people involved in the jellyfish who are working hard to keep these jellyfish alive, look at them, observe how they grow with Camille, Solen, Stanislava Fusier and Sorry. Yeah. John Snow is younger. I'm not sure. But no, maybe. I'm not sure. No, like come on. No, no, no. I have a curious because maybe I miss it. But now, sir, the growth of the kids is not related actually in your model to the traderana. Factoring your model to the dynamic in the channels. So I don't have a model yet. So Stanislaf is working hard on a model, but in my hypothesis. So it's related to the dynamic field inside the vessels? So it's either the tension field which is imposed by the contraction or it's the hydrodynamic field inside the vessels. But it could also be because if you say it's Also, be because if you say it's Laplacian, it could also be a morphogen which is released and that could generate a field as well. Everything that could create a Laplacian field could be valid. We cannot say at this moment, we cannot say more than this. But essentially the flow inside that vessel is related to the pulse, to the contraction of this kind of validity. So it's like So it's like nobody is going to talk about it. And it's not an easy problem. But it's a very challenging problem and we are working on that with Eleni for whom we got a project together. And Eleni is doing a theory and it's going to be hard but fun. We have a couple of years to work on this. I was super curious about how it's radio, let's say. Let's say I'm looking at the branch numbers radially. So if I like, is there like a do they collapse? Like, there's like a lot of variables, but let's say I have 100 branches at the very beginning, but at a certain hour, they all collapse, they all have, but yeah, so they, so, so, I don't know what you mean by collapse, but when they join, these are these booking events. Are these like grouping events? Somehow, how is it radially? Is it radially coordinated? Yeah, because I think that the stress field is due to the swimming and also Lorny will also, she does everything, all the questions that are open, she's going to look at it. But so, this, this, when you see the swimming geometry, it's actually the stress field is rather complicated because you. Field is rather complicated because you see at the border you see compression, and in the middle of the umbrella, you see elongation, and very close to the stomach, you see actually stretch when it's contracting. So this is dynamics. So this stress field, depending where you are in this radial field, is very different. And we think if you think of the cracking analogy, then Cracking an allergy, then you want to release the stress. So that also could guide the vessels. So if you change the stress field all the time, if you push, then the vessel will go forward. But if you are in a region where there is just homogeneous compression, then it might be able to turn. And we have the impression that it's always turning at the same region in the jellyfish because the jellyfish is growing and this. Because the check is growing and this typical typical distance from the rim, I think it it remains rather constant. I'm just confusing if I understand well that it's like a food grid, right? Yeah, it's actually a system that is also digesting through the base definitely. And you said something like the And you said something like the flow is from the center to the ends and then goes back from the ends to the center. So I am just wondering if the digestion performs at the the ends of the circle? No, I think, but we don't know. There's many things that we can there are very few people where people change, so yeah. People working with me. So there's a lot of work done in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s. And then there's a lot of work done right now on locomotion that they're trying to build jellyfish in the ocean to be very silent, very little energy consuming boats that propel like this. But there's very little known what is happening and where the digestion takes place. But I would suggest or would think I would suggest or would think that the digestion takes place mostly in the branched canals. So I think the straight canals are really too distributed to the end. And the branched canals, there the digestion takes place because there it's also mostly spread and it can go to the muscles. And then if you think of what Timothy taught us, you need one hair, it's a diffusion distance. And in Jerry Fish, I'm very puzzled by that. By that, because it's not at all a dense network. So we don't know how this food is distributed to all the cells in the Tenni fees. That's really an open question. You can discuss. You already got a discussion. You can even have two minutes for all the morning. If you want to open the questions. Okay, if you want to open the questions and discussion from the rest of the session,
