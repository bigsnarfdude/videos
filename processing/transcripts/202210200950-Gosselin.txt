He's a professor of mechanical engineering at Polytechnic Morion and is mainly interested in splendid structure and mechanics and the free structure interactions. And Federic Chang, I think he changed this title and the new talk will be about can win-leaning instability play a role in the morphogenesis of the In the morphogenesis of the curve plates. Thank you. So thank you for having me. So Anya, thank you for the organization. And I took your requirements for having some work in progress presentation. And so I changed my title. So I won't be talking about corals. If you want to hear about it, there's a video on YouTube. So you can use the QR code or ask me for the link for later. So this is work that was done. There's some simulation work done by a former postdoc, Kurian Parel. The work was done in collaboration with Prof and Lise Muti. And Lise would see, and the whole idea came about when I was on sabbatical in Prof. Patrick Marton's lab at UBC in Vancouver. So it's really, really preliminary work. I'm more here for your ideas than to provide you with answers. But so when I was in Patrick's lab at UBC, he took me to Banfield, a field station out on Vancouver Island. And the first thing that hit me is like the first thing that hit me is like the diversity of seaweeds algae like the shapes the textures and so that this is a giant kelp so it's it's got this undulated wrinkled ruffled blade shape uh this is uh like the five ribbon kelp so it's got these ribs that bring it structures and you can see all these undulations on on the blades and if you zoom here you can see You zoom here, you can see all these little details of what looks like wrinkles. So, this is sea palm. This guy grows on the very exposed coast where it's getting battered by the biggest waves. And it looks like a little sea palm. And it's got these textured blades like this. And so, all of these, they're brown algae or kelp. Or kelp, and so here you have a laminaria saccharina, which is grown for food and for other applications. But I'm not a biologist, I'm a mechanical engineer, so I had to do some learning about how these things grow. But basically, all these calc plates all grow in a similar fashion. And so basically, they have the meristem. The meristem at the link here between the stipe and the blade, and so they grow like a conveyor belt. So it's not like a tip mirror stem. It's really growing from the junction between the blade and the stipe. And so at the tip here, you have the old material, and here at the junction between the stipe is the new material. Is the new material. And so there was some previous work, notably by Minnie Cole, where they looked at the bull kelp. And there's some very interesting morphological plasticity that goes on. So if the bull kelp grows in calm water, like on the left, it grows this ruffled shape that you see in figure B. But if it grows like the very same Like the very same specimen. You take it, you transplant it, and you make it grow in agitated water, and then it's really slender and it loses these ruffles. So it's really morphological plasticity. And so it was shown that basically there's a growth differential along the width of the blade. So basically, the size of the blade growth. The sides of the blade grow faster than in the middle. But if it's constantly growing in tension due to the drag of the water, then this drag makes it basically grow slender and uniform. But if it doesn't have this drag, then the fact that it grows faster on the sides makes it grow incompatible and provokes these ruffles. But so all these. But so, all these brown seaweeds, these brown algae, they grow if you cut the meristem close to the stite. They have the medulla and the cortex in the middle, which are these big cells. And at the surface, you have what's called the meristoderm. So these are the small cells that actively grow and divide. And they're much, much smaller. So typically, you can infer that there's much more cell walls. Cell walls near the surfaces, and that's also where they grow. So, basically, in the mod in the middle, you can think about it as passive big cells, whereas on the edges, on the surfaces, it's a very fast-growing, stiffer material. And so, in physics, if you have something like if you take PDMS, so just a soft polymer. So, just a soft polymer, like the jelly we had for dinner last night. And you heat it, it will expand. And if you deposit a thin layer of gold on top, and then you let the whole thing cool, so the PDMS will shrink. And what happens is the PDMS will shrink, but not the gold. And the gold is stiffer. And so the gold will seek to keep its long shape, but the PDMS will want to shrink. And so Shrink and so basically the gold will form a wave. So it's like a Euler beam that buckles, but because it's supported by the PDMS, it will have this wrinkled shape. And so you can get all kinds of crazy different patterns due to wrinkling. You can make this at room temperature also. So if you have a silicone or an elastomer and you mold at first. You mold a first strip of polymer. So, this was in the lab of Pierre Madhara at Princeton. So, you mold the first layer of polymer and then you stretch it and then you cast a second layer of polymer on top and then you incline it. So the polymer drips and it forms a second layer of varying thickness and it has time to cure and set. Time to cure and set, and then you release the bottom layer. So, what happens is you form these wrinkles because that top layer has been they have different rest configurations, right? And because there's a different thickness at the top and at the bottom, then you have different wavelengths of wrinkles. And so, back in the lab, we got some different specimens. So, this is the sea palm. And if you take it, And if you take it close to where it's attached, it's all right. So here, this is close to where it attaches to the stipend. So it's very soft. And then you cut it more and more. And then you see that it starts maybe at that specimen here. You can see it kind of undulating. And then these undulations grow more and more the further down. Grow more and more the further down you go along the blade. And this is macrocystis. And so to get wrinkling, you need residual stresses. So you need layers that want to stretch while others want to contract. And so this is at the meristem. And so it's hard to see a bit on the projector, but so what I did here is I cut the blade and then I cut. And then I cut that little piece of meristem in the middle. And so, what happens? As soon as you cut it, it just pops. So, basically, it's highly loaded with residual stress. And if you look at the blade at the microscope, you see it has a lot more material on the surface and the middle is much more empty. You have these nice undulations. And so, we made a very basic finite element model. A very basic finite element model. So it's a tri-layer. So we have a middle layer which is passive and soft, and we have surface layers which are a little stiffer and which we make them grow. So how we do it, we model it with just a thermal expansion. So basically, it's like changing the REST configuration. So it's only the top and bottom layers that are active, that are actively growing. Active that are actively growing while the middle is just passive. And we have some boundary conditions at the edges so that the total displacement is the whole thing can expand, but it has to expand together. And so what we find is we find two instability modes of ringing. So an in-phase or anti-symmetric mode, and we have anti-symmetric mode and we have an out of phase symmetric mode look like this and if we plot them on the graph so we have the the wavelength on the x-axis and then on the y-axis it's basically how much stress needs to be induced by the growth to to obtain the wrinkling and so if we have less growth or less stresses we're we're at the bottom in the graph and so there's nothing that happens In the graph, and so there's nothing that happens. And as soon, and when we increase the stress, we go up. And when we cross the curve that's traced by these points, that's when wrinkling happens. And where does it happen? Well, it happens at the bottommost point, at the most unstable wavelength. And so what we see is that it's the in-phase, the in-phase mode, which is the anti-symmetric mode, which tends to be most unstable. Which tends to be most unstable. So I don't have much answers yet, but I have a lot of questions. So basically, does wrinkling seem relevant to these issues? And then where should we take it from there? I have some ideas, but there's all kinds of possibilities. So this was just a 1D infinite model. Infinite model and in the linear regime. So that means as soon as we have wrinkling, the simulation stops, we just look at that critical point. So we can keep loading the things. What happens if we keep growing? So look at the post-buckling instabilities. We did the basically in-plane simulation. So we can do it on a 2D semi-infinite system like this, like a sand. System like this, like a sandwich. We have that stype that had all these nice wrinkles, also. So we can do it on a circular geometry. Then we can perhaps try ideas where we try to have the growth, so both the elongation of the blade, but also the widening. And then there's more complicated factors, so growth and isotropy, stiffness and isotropy. Yeah, lots of ingredients. Yeah, lots of ingredients okay now. So I'd be happy to get your feedback. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We have time for questions. So thank you very much. It was really nice to see that. I have one question about the quick beginning of your thoughts. You're talking about speeches that sensitive to mechanical loading some sense and with loads and do you think you can resume this with just a simple mechanic? Doing this with just simple mechanics, or do you need some feedback because it is stress now? You are putting stress on the outside, so on the wrinkled part, but you have some sense to also adapt inside in the center. So, in mini calls, I'll repeat the question. So, well, how does the stress feed back into the growth? And so, Grow. And so in Minnico's lab, what they did is they took these samples and they had them grow in calm water buckets, but they added weights to them. So to just passively pull on them and it made the ruffles go away. So the new growth was smooth. And in Patrick Martone's lab, there's Liam Coleman who looked basically at various Who looked basically at varying that growth and varying that load and also making it 2D loads? So looking at how much growth there is in one axis and the other axis. But so it's not clear if it's sensing the load itself or if it's releasing some growth agent or. I mean probably outside. I mean probably outside it seems not, at least in my mind, sufficient to reconcile the two layers in some sense. It still has difference. But maybe you can ask the question as to what the external one is just expanding or ranking in some sense. Adding load doesn't make much stress on it in some sense, but while at the inner part, it's it could lead to more tension in some sense. So maybe is that mechanics enough? Do you make it or? Mechanics enough to make it, or then you have okay, I'm sensing, so I have to grow inside. I don't know. You see my point? Maybe it's not so. You can see the growth as a non-elastic deformation or strain. And then you can have the elastic strain that you induce by applying a load. So, my guess is that when the elastic strain gets larger than the growth differential between the middle and the side, then Differential between the middle and the side, then everything is in tension again. It can't be but conflict. Richard? Yeah, I'm a big fan of form being following function. So then maybe I missed this at the beginning. I'm always interrupted by my own thoughts. But what is the purpose of the wrinkles? So good question. Okay, so Okay, so on the right, you can see it's easy, right? On the right, it reduces drag, so they pull on them on the boat, so it makes sense. On the left, the water is a little more muddier, I would say. But basically, what they say is that with the ruffles, it makes them spread out more as soon as you have a little bit of current on the water. So they spread out more and you can intercept more light. Intercept more light. It also promotes mass exchange with the water. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I was thinking it's like a heat exchanger. You know, you can have a copper tube heat exchanger, and then if you make it, you know, if you make it corrugated, then you have much greater transfer from inside to outside. So I guess you get, because it creates turbulence. So I guess you get the same. If you had slow water, then you can imagine that if you have ripples or wrinkles, then this creates turbulence. Then, this creates turbulence around the wrinkles that would then facilitate some kind of exchange with the outside. And then, do you think that could in itself trigger the marcogenesis, right? Because if it knows, oh, I'm starving for something, I better make some wrinkles to sort of help things along. Maybe it's a crazy idea, but I don't know. That's the main idea, basically. It promotes mixing and mass exchange. And mass exchange. Then, what happens with these? So, these were for the big ruffles, but then what happens with these, let's say, these guys. So, these are more like on the surface. So, do they play with the boundary layer, but it's something that's so soft that's always moving. So, decoupling the boundary layer from the large-scale flow is from the fluid point of view, it's a very complicated problem. Point of view, it's a very complicated problem. I mean, this just to be there with that, okay? Is it possible that these are just material, I mean, consequences of the material that is there because it has to support that size and shape of structure in the water. And then, you know, you get all these apparent changes, but they're not actually physiologically signated. And I don't have that. Is that an idea? I don't have that an idea rather than that. It's always possible that it's just a consequence of how it grows. But at least for both calc, it looks as there's a real trade-off and there's morphological plasticity. I mean, sure, I can see there's plasticity, but the question is easily, you know, how strong is the evidence that that's fun, or is it an exhaustation to take it over? No, expand it, so expand it to use that terminology. I mean, you just something that happens, and you don't tend to want to fit it in a narrative, but it's just a consequence of the shape and material property in the world. I don't know. Okay, it's a good question. I think the evidence in terms of drag and Of drag and living in such a harsh environment is pretty strong. You take these ruffled blades and you bring them in agitated water and they get damaged. And so the evidence is pretty straightforward for this one. Okay. So for the small rock, the small undulations, that's my question. Yeah, I mean, that's what I mean. I mean, that's what I mean. That's an open question. I mean, there could be multiple optima, so to speak, for this organism. Some of them have anti-data and some don't. Okay, I think we should stop here. Thank you again. So the next speaker is Sarah Robinson. Actually, Sarah was very kind to me. Was very kind to be flexible enough to change the day of the presentation. Thank you, Sarah.
