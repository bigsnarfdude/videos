Talk a lunch break today and it's given by Albert Giernu who is speaking about the dynamics of fluids cohomology. Thank you for introduction. Thank you for inviting me. I'm going to talk about fluid cohomology. This is a wrong button. This is joint work with my students and postdoc. So our goal is to characterize work. To characterize vortex dynamics in fluid, so that we can have decent simulation for fluid dynamics. And just to also work on general domain with general topology. And so first I'm going to talk about that the conventional vortex equation is not adequate enough to govern dynamics on the domain with general topology in order to kind of And in order to kind of repair that, we have to kind of dive a little bit into algebraic topology diagrams so that we can get equations of motion, which can also be interpreted as some kind of a conservation law. And then we can use that to build some special solution. It turns out that that reveals an interesting connection between Euler equation and the Hilbert transform in complex analysis and signal processing. No process. Okay, so let's begin with what is the Euler equation on a general Riemannian manifold. So first consider the space, the group of all volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. And what that means is that any point on this group corresponds to a volume-preserving deformation. And if you have like a tangent vector on this space as an infinitesimal, Space as an infinitesimal volume-preserving diffeomorphism that just corresponds with velocity flow. And by right translation, you can identify that as an element of the V algebra, which is the space of divergent free vector field. Right. And now for every such velocity field, you can measure its kinetic energy, and that kind of involves a Riemannian metric on the entire diffeomorphism. Riemannian metric on the entire diffeomorphism group, and therefore you can talk about geodesics. So, this is like a geodesic motion. And geodesic motion is actually an Euler fluid flow. And if you write down the governing equation for the velocity, the tangent vectors, you get the traditional way of writing down Euler equation. And a popular reformulation, alternative formulation of Euler equation is the vorticity formulation. The vorticity formulation. So first define vorticity as the curl of velocity, and then I'll take the curl of the entire equation, and that gives rise to a vorticity equation. And divergence-free condition kind of ensures that there's velocity can be written as a curl of some string function. And together you see this double curl relation, so you can write that as a Poisson solve, and that is the vorticity string function formulation. Hopefully, you didn't get motion sickness from that. Okay, so this is particularly nice because it gives rise to a very geometric intuition that vortex lines are transported by the flow and the flow is generated by the vortex lines. And that's why vorticity function is used everywhere, such as analysis or geometric fluid mechanics. And it's also used in numerics a lot. For example, you can restore vorticity using vorticity equation. Vorticity using vorticity equation if you have too much numerical dissipation. It's particularly advantageous on simulating fluids on surfaces because vorticity is just a scalar function and it's being advected as a scalar function, which is much easier if you want to do like covariant transport, parallel transport for velocity vector fields, if you use the traditional Euler equation. And it's also used in some kind of new algorithms, for example, like Monte Carlo synthetic. For example, like multi-carnal simulation for Euler equation, they started with vorticity equation as the starting point. There's just one problem with vorticity equation that is actually wrong. So it's all based on the assumption that divergent vector fields in one term corresponding to a vorticity field, that you can recover divergent vector field from the vorticity data, but that's only true if you're on a simplic connector. On a simply connected domain. So on a non-simply connected domain, so first of all, non-simply connected domains are everywhere. So on non-simply connected domain, you can have these harmonic fields adding to the fluid that is irrotational everywhere, so it's not captured by the vorticity variable. And actually, if you just use a vorticity string function solver and a traditional Euler equation solver, you just compare side by side, you actually get different results. Get different results. And of course, people observed it, but they say, oh, it's probably like boundary condition because of boundary condition of string function is not understood. And to their credit, it's actually true that if you have viscosity, actually, you need additional information on boundary condition. And then that was the main focus back in the days. And the similar thing was also discussed in oceanography with the keyword being. Oceanography, with the keyword being island ruled. But actually, the issue is deeper because, for example, on this domain, this is the string lines of a divergent vector field. And this string lines supposedly, if this is written as a string function, then this should be the level set of string function. But this is not going to be the level set of any real value function. And therefore, the problem is not about boundary condition to start with. And recently, there are these papers with titles. And recently there are these papers with titles saying that resisting functions shouldn't be used for solving Euler equation, a neighbor-Stokes equation on a torus. But I think we should be able to repair that because we know that there's just like the harmonic part that is actually independent from the vorticity. And so let's just kind of add these harmonic parts back into the Euler equation. And so what are the dynamics for these harmonic parts? And so one intuition is that the harmonic Intuition is that the harmonic modes are conserved over time because if you just set these as initial conditions without vorticity, they are actually conserved over time. So these are kind of good guesses. And also they are like Kelvin circulation theorem. Circulation sounds like it's kind of going around these obstacles and they are actually conserved. So these are actually like intuition and then people actually use these in some like numerical methods. But we can look at these questions in the leap group picture again. So back to this volume preserving diffomorphism group. And actually, starting with any group, we can consider this commutator subgroup. This is like a very prominent normal subgroup of any group. So if you feel like we have seen this before, this is exactly a normal subgroup that you will take quotient over if you want to abide onize a group. Nice group. So, this is like a very fundamental concept. And you can do the same thing at the Lie algebra level, if this is a Lie group. And so, at the Lie algebra level, the tangent space of this commutator subgroup as a submanifold is the commutator Lie sub-algebra, which is the collection of all Lie brackets. And so, it turns out that this decomposition of the tangent space to The position of the tangent space to this commutator and its normal component is exactly a hot decomposition of velocity fields. So if this is, this ambient space is divergent vector field, then G prime, the common hero sub-algebra, is those velocity that's written in terms of string functions. And the normal space using our kinetic energy as the metric are the harmonic fields. So, this is exactly what we want to capture: this decomposition of harmonic part in the vorticity part. So, the earlier question of what is the dynamics of the harmonic part is actually just asking what's the interaction between geodesics, which is Euler equation, and this sub-manifold. So, it's basically just asking what is the geometry of this coming result. For example, it might be the case. Example, might be the case that geodesic stays on this carbon-hat subgroup. So the earlier hypothesis that harmonic components are conserved over time is equivalent to saying that this combinatorial subgroup is totally geodesic or is extrinsically flat or that it has vanishing second fundamental form. But we can test this hypothesis by just kind of doing some numerical experiments. So on the left, we designed. Experiment. So on the left, we design an algorithm that will really conserve the harmonic part, and the right-hand side is supposed to be the true Euler equation. And so in the beginning, it looks kind of the same. But then it actually starts to be very different from each other. And it's like different, more than the tolerance of numerical errors. So this means several things. First of all, if the algorithm is actually based on this hypothesis, completely incorrect. And also, this picture that if you have this volume. Picture that if you have this volume-preserving diffeomorphism with this kinetic energy as your metric, you'll see that this prominent subgroup, commentary subgroup, is actually curved. So that geodesics can fly off. So are these modes conserved over time? No. What are the equations? It's not really written down explicitly to my knowledge. And so in terms of And so, when the textbooks say, oh, this is the vorticity function formulation, it's not even like finished writing down the equation. And then now you feel in the equation, there are so many interesting questions you can ask. What is the physical interpretation of these last line of the equation? Are there a special solution? Are they corresponding to some kind of a conservation law? What is numerics and so on? So, to do that, let's use the more comfortable notation. The more comfortable notation of differential forms. So instead of using velocity vector, I'm going to talk about one forms. And we are going to use these differential forms quite literally as geometric objects. So vectors are arrows and one forms are hyperplane fields. And in general, k-forms are co-dimension geometry. And if you actually just stick with this interpretation, exterior calculus becomes super easy. For example, in Easy. For example, integration just becomes like counting the intersection between your integration domain and your differential form. West product is just the intersection between your co-dimension k geometries. Interior product between a differential form and a vector field just corresponds to extrusion along the vector field. And D is just taking boundary, and closeness is just the integral. And closeness is just the integrability of these coordination of geometry. And lead derivative is just measuring how much this is deviating from purely the vector by the velocity field. And then if you do that, like Carton magic formula becomes kind of trivial. Carton magic formula, so back to fluids. Right. So this is our Euler equation. And if we introduce Equation, and if we introduce velocity one form by taking it flat, and you can view that as like integral line integral element of velocity, then you get this equation that one form are purely advected up to the exact form, so that the line integral is conserved up to the difference of the end. So, if you mod out all the exact forms, then it's actually being purely elected, but there's only one Being purely elected, but it's only well defined if you measure one forms of closed loops. And therefore, you can view this coset as circulation data. And then this is Kelvin circulation theorem. So it turns out that one form model exact form is exactly a dual space of the diversity vector fields. So that's actually just two star. So what we have just done here. What we have just done here is just replacing velocity in D algebra to the duality algebra of circulations. All right, and then vorticity is taking D, which is well defined on these cosets. And the vortex two form, and then what you arrive at is a vorticity equation. And so diagrammatically, you have this by taking D and go to vorticity, which loses some information, leaving out the kernel of the. Leaving out the kernel of D. And so the best thing you can do to repair velocity or circulation from vorticity is to take the pseudo-inverse. The pseudo-inverse is going to be metric dependent, it's going to be orthogonal complementary to the kernel. And it turns out this kernel, well, this is kernel of D divided by image of D, so that's just the Dirac homology, first Dirac homology. And if you also consider it's an orthogonal projection to that space, you just completed a short exact sequence. A short exact sequence. So it's just a fancy way of talking about Hausdorff decomposition. So far, what we have done is that velocity, you can kind of draw this diagram to clarify what's missing in the vorticity equation. Well, the cohomology, usually the natural reflexes, learning about the run cohomology, is that if I want to parametrize cohomology, we just consider some kind of loops around these. Around these as generators, and then consider its circulation integral around these loops. So, this is typically what is done in the literature. But I'll claim that this is slightly unnatural for our purposes because these circulation depends on the choice of loop. If I choose a bigger loop, and it encompasses more vorticity, it's going to give us a little bit more vorticity. And also, so there's no So, there's no canonical choice of loops. In oceanography, one would actually just take these islands boundary as the loop, and that's canonical. But of course, you also have these kind of genus where you don't really have a boundary to kind of do that. And also, these loops are fixed over time, if you want to use that as a parametrization of the harmonic field. And so, it's a little bit confusing because this looks too close to Kelvin circulation theorem, where the loops are actually advected by the flow. Loops are actually advected by the flow, and these loops should be fixed over time. So, another alternative is to take cross-sections and measure the fluxes across the cross-sections. And so cross-sectional surfaces are just all the co-dimensional Y surfaces with boundaries also lying in the boundary of the domain. And if one doesn't like hop star, you can also write it in terms of the interior product. In terms of the interior product into the volume form, so these fluxes will be independent of the choice of cross-sectional surfaces. Up to homology. So if S and S prime, two cross-sections, co-borders a volumetric region, they will give rise to the same flux. And therefore, the equivalence test is this relative homology. And each element of this, we'll just call it a cross-section. So cross-section, you know. So, cross-section, in the end, it doesn't matter which representative you're using. Right? So, these fluxes, you can view that as evaluation through a bilinear form that takes, called flux, takes in a vector field and a cross-section and gives rise to the value of the flux. And then, by just curving it, you can view flux as taking the vector and then split out a covector on out a covector on cross-section. And that can be viewed as the space of flux data. But also by using left-hatch duality, this is canonically identified as just the first homology with real coefficient. So this is just the space of flux data. And here's the theorem that this is. Remember there was this commutator lease of algebra. This is actually forming a short exact sequence. Short exact sequence. So this is a short exact sequence that the commutary subgroup, a sub-Li algebra, is just the kernel of the flux. M is compact. Oh yeah, it is compact. Right. And the following, what we just built earlier in the covector space, this decomposition is actually equivalent, that the vertical lines are just isomorphism. It depends on metric though. So it's pretty clear that traditional vorticity equation is just written on the left. And so all we have to do is to write an equation of motion for the flux data. So once we know what we want to write down, it's pretty clear what is it's pretty straightforward to write down the equation by just projecting your Euler equation to the flux data. And let me explain what is lambda and C. What is lambda and c. So, lambda is called the lambda one form. It's by inserting velocity into the vorticity. Or in vector calculus, it's called u cross w, like velocity cross vorticity called the length vector. But earlier, we mentioned that interior product is just extrusion. So, this is kind of like you are extruding the vortex ring by the velocity, and that gives you this kind of motion blur of a vortex line or the trailing surface. Vortex line or the trailing surface of vortex line as it's put in motion. And disk C is something we call the harmonic stream line associated with a cross-section. So remember this diagram, and I'm going to claim that this C is already there in this diagram. So just take this part of the diagram where you can have this map that maps circulation data to flux data. And just take the canonical due. And just take the canonical dual adjoint of this operator. So it's going to map the dual space of flux data to the dual space of circulation. The dual space of flux data is actually just the space of cross-section. So take a cross-section, it's going to spit out another divergent vector field, and just insert that divergent vector field into a volume form to turn that into a flux form. Then you get this C. So the takeaway is that whenever you see a cross-section, such as this hole in this bunny, then you'll see. In this bunny, then you'll see that there is already giving us a canonical harmonic field. And now that is actually the equation, the right-hand side of the flux. And recall what is, oh yeah, this is Xi, and the lambda is just like you have some vortex filament or vortex line somewhere else as moving. And recall what is wedge product? The wedge product is just the intersection. The wave product is just the intersection between these geometry, and therefore, what this actually means is that the rate of change of flux, the cross-sectional flux, is changing at the rate of vortex light cutting through harmonic streamline. Right? So, please remind us again, so Qi are just the basis in harmonic fields. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I is the index for all the crosses. I use the index for all the cross sections. And each cross section, if you set an impulse on cross-section, so turn that into like as an integral current, so it's a one-form algebraically, and then do a pressure protection. But there is no canonical choice here, right? And you have to kind of fix the basis somehow. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. For each flux across. Yeah, for each flux of a cross-section, then that is the right hand side. And cross-section, you can just take any element in the cross-section is a H sub one. So homology, first homology with real coefficient, and then you can also write that. So I can replace I by just bracket of A14. Yeah. Of a one form. Yeah. Yeah, so this is like how vortex are cutting through streamlines. But what is the rate of two curves crossing each other in three dimension? That is actually the rate of change of linking number between these two curves. And so this is a rate of change of flux, and this rate of change of linking number. And therefore, you can remove the two rate of change and then say that there's a Change and they say that there's a conservation law going on at the rate, the flux minus the linking number between vortex line and these of C is a constant of motion. Okay, so we kind of have like a little bit more complete picture of vorticity, vortex dynamics. Vortex dynamics is just a Hemhausi theorem or like Kelvin's theorem that the vortex lines are transported by the flow. And there's a second equation that needs to be accompanied. Equation that needs to be accompanied with the vortex dynamics: that the flux, cross-sectional flux, and the linking number between vortex lights and harmonic streamlines should be a closed approach. And a corollary of reading these off is that we actually have an explicit formula for the second fundamental form of the community subgroup of the volume-preserving mortgage algorithm. And in fact, earlier we showed this example that string function solver is not giving you the same result. Actually, if you just put the harmonic equation back in, and then you actually fix the problem. So it's really not about boundary condition. Same picture, but visualizing the vorticity. And we claim that this is the first L. And we claim that this is the first algorithm that actually correctly simulates vortex dynamics on a general surface. Right, so we mentioned something about this conservation law, so I'm going to dive a little bit into that. Recall this is a constant motion. What do I actually mean? So, in fact, so if you think of like fluid state as So if you think of fluid state as just a point in this duality algebra, like the circulation data, which can be written as vorticity and the flux data. So as long as this eta satisfies Kelvin's aggression theorem, that is actually moving on the cohesion orbit, or it is just being B avected, vorticity is also being B avected, and flux should actually just modify in this way. So this is. So, this is sounds like this is a casimir. But this invariant exists only when this linking number is well defined. What do I mean by that? So let me give you a definition that looks like coming from probably somewhere else. So a closed k-form only got, I call it momentum complete, if any infinitesimal symmetry, so if you find like a vector field, so that the So that the vection of that is zero, B derivative of this is zero, then it implies that you have a nozzle current. So like Ix omega is exact. It's the D of some J of a previous form. So this is of course like the typically omega is like a syntactic form, and X is infinite symmetry, and then whether you actually get like global interface. And then whether you actually get a globally defined lower curve, or that you have a momentum map for every infinitesimal symmetry. So, example is that, and I don't need this to be actual syntactic, it doesn't need to be non-degenerate, it doesn't need to be two-fold. And actually, omega is going to be our vorticity field. For example, vorticity with simple support like vortex patch, vortex point vortices, or vortex tubes, these kind of situations. These kinds of situations, even if the underlying geometry is kind of complicated, this is an example of momentum complete. So any redistribution, rearrangement of these vorticities that are leaving the vorticity field the same, they can be written as of some kind of a string function. String box. And another example would be this: when the patch is too big so that it can start supporting these kinds of fields of rearrangement of vorticity, then these kind of vector field inserting into vorticity field cannot be written as a TLA function. And then by the way, if you are just doing kind of co-adjoint action on this vorticity field, like being a lack these around, it actually It actually stays a momentum complete while it stays momentum complete, so it's well defined over these orbits. And turns out the linking number is defined if and only if this vorticity is momentum complete. So for example, for this down example, if there's any reasonable linking number between the vorticity and C, you can actually just rearrange vorticity in such a way that a vorticity field is still the same data. The same data, so as a function, it's still inputting the same thing, but your vorticity is keep crossing this thing, so your linking number should keep changing. So it's like the function is not the same. And so as long as you are having the linking number is defined on the domain of linking number, this quantity is always a Casimir. I don't know whether I can call it a Casimir because the domain is not everywhere. So when it's defined, it's actually a concrete function. Actually, a concrete function. When it's not defined, it's actually losing an invariant. And this is actually just a special case where this red Z is the Harbor News Tree function. Here's a corollary of this. So suppose your vorticity is momentum complete. So this is in the case where you have this conservation law because linking number is defined. So suppose the linking number is well defined, so you have this kind of this invariant. This invariant. So then, under the Euler equation, if vorticity is stationary, then the velocity is steady because vorticity is stationary. So the only other variable is the flux or the harmonic part, but that is also locked in place because vorticity is not moving. And so link number is not moving, and so the flux is not moving because of this comparing. And this is also when the lamp form is exact, and it's D of the Bernoulli pressure. And this is actually. Bernoulli pressure, and this is actually the Bernoulli law. So, what if we are actually not in the case when the vorticity is momentum complete? Then link number and our casemirs are lost. And so, under Euler equation, you can have a vorticity that's stationary, but the land form is only close but not exact, and the velocity can be unsteady. So, you can have like vortices. Be unsteady. So I can have my vorticity completely fixed, but velocity is still moving around. And here's an example. So this is a domain where constant vorticity spread out everywhere is actually not momentum complete. This is genus 1, and I need to have a boundary, otherwise I can't have constant vorticity everywhere with complex areas. So this is the velocities are going to be like w times the corresponding string function, velocity, and then linear combination of the harmonic. And then a linear combination of the harmonic fields. And then the motion looks like this: the vorticity stay constant, the C1 and C2 move over time. And actually, you can build the exact solution for this. I'm almost done. So it turns out this K is only this frequency of W depends only on the conformal cast of its geometry. And you can actually compare, if you actually assume that the velocity is steady. That the velocity is steady, this looks kind of reasonable until you actually see the better one. That looks more like solid. And it turns out that this is related to the Hilbert transform. Let me just quickly say what the definition of Hilbert transform. If you have any like remap surface with boundary, if an elect function is restricted to the boundary, the read of the real part and imaginary part. So this mapping from real part to imaginary part is the Hilbert transform. So just kind of take a real part and then it. Just kind of take a real part and let it continue over the surface and then read off the imagined part. It's actually a fundamental operator. You'll see that in like the classical one is like the real line. And then you'll see these in Wikipedia pages. It's a bounded skill self-adjoint operator. It's used in signal processing a lot. And when n is compact with genus, actually the eigenvalues are going to be i and between I and between minus 1 and 1, and those are called a Poincaré duality angle. The theorem in 2D Euler equation, if the vorticity is constant, then the Euler equation actually reduce to this ODE, that F is just the tendential component of velocity. See, this is kind of moving back and forth. Actually, it does satisfy this ODE that F dot equals to Hilbert transform of itself. It's a very fundamental operator from somewhere else, signal processing. And then once you just consider this OD, it turns out this OD is just an Euler equation. And so that's the summary we have just kind of go through these items. So thank you. Thanks a lot for this nice talk. Steve? I'm not thinking special. And secondly, is this situation you described at the end with constant vorticity but still moving velocity fields, is that somewhat generic? Like you can construct it on other surfaces or it's very special to this. Oh, you can generate on any at least orientable surfaces. When you do that, you get a finite-dimensional ODE system like the System like does that lead to periodic solutions or like nice? Oh, it depends on those eigenvalues, those coverage you are the encode. So the eigenvalues of the solution you had was periodic, but I'm not sure if it is. Yeah, it's like, I guess people call it quasi-periodic. It's like if they are like rationally related to each other, then of course it's actually periodic, but it's like But it's like integral flowing or something. What kind of initial conditions do you need for this urine state? I think if you happen to not add the eigenvectors corresponding to those eigenvalues, that makes it not periodic. Like if they're like. Not periodic. Like if there are like ten eigenvalues, two of them are like rationally related to each other. And you just set those other eigenvectors to be zero initially, of course. But what happens on the boundary? You have to kind of keep periodic boundary conditions here? I mean periodic in time. No, you don't need to. I mean time time is really just real. Real line. So there's no, I mean, there's no So there's no I mean there's not a periodic function for this. I mean the domain domain just view this like whatever topology you have. And for 2D order in uphop space what will you get? Sorry. For 2D order in uphop space. So 2D Euler? Yeah in uphop space. Uh-huh. So what's your equation at the end? Oh you mean the you mean upper half space? Yeah. Oh it's non-compact. Yeah. Oh, it's non-compact, so I'm not sure. I mean. Yeah, because there's many model problems they improve that try to relate 1D and 2D. In 1D usually we have the Hiberchus call. But none of that can go to 2D. So we haven't seen any. Yeah, when it's upper half space, the eigenvalues are all just I. And if you square it, it becomes minus of itself. It's like actually a complex structure for functions. So I don't think the OD. So I don't think the ODE looks that interesting anymore. But when it's like compact and suddenly you get angles between them. What would you get for the disk? Into the. What would you get for the disk? Let's say the unit disk. Oh, unit disk. Oh, because unit disk doesn't have any genus, so you actually just get zero. So H Hilbert transform, I mean, I want to say that if one just consider Euler equation, then The Euler equation, then constant vorticity will imply velocity steady. So it's just no motion. So even if you take a planar domain and you cut holes out of it, it's still momentum complete. So link number is still defined. You actually need some genus to start with. So for any 2D domain that is a disk removing a few disks, any divergent vector. Any divergent vector field can be written as 90-degree rotation of gradient of some string function just with like non-zero boundary compensations. So in that case, there will still be like the link number is still defined locally and therefore you get Bernoulli law. I want to advertise all the paper of Steppenhader. Of Steppan Haller and Joseph Teichmann and mine, where we studied on which manifolds we have total geodesic. The derived group is totally geodesic. Oh, you mean that computer subgroup is totally geodesic? When it is totally geodesic, so in the book of bodies, with apart this? And there are some more, not many more, just um that's uh my workouts of thought. So it's exactly the opposite, the complement to what you are presenting. When it's actually flat. Right, right. Yes. Any other comment? Any other comments or questions? If not, let's thank our SPN. So we have a relatively long lunch break, but I would ask everyone to be maybe over punctual there for the picture because the program in the afternoon is rather tight, so we really want to be done with the picture sometime. So if you could be maybe like 10 minutes before the picture time here, so that you can really do. Picture time here so that you can really do this on time and start again on time with the talk. The pictures is supposed to be at two o'clock, maybe ten minutes before two. Appreciate it. Thanks, everyone. I don't have to give any data. I would say yes, but I don't have to give any data. Yeah.  I also think that we have quite a bit of a little bit of a camera. I should actually make those behavioral forms, like bases. Yeah, so like maybe I'm a label.
