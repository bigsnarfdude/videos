Thank you. And before I get started, I wanted to thank the organizers for the chance to speak in the conference. And then also, since I'm the last talk, I think I'm supposed to also say we should all take a chance to thank the organizers for such a great conference this whole week. Never had to do that before, so I'm glad I remember. So I am going to talk about these three things in the title of my talk. And so maybe just to start off with, I can just tell you all what annular links are. Just as a reminder, I mean, you know, and I'll try and mostly write on the Blackboard because I know that is. Blackboard because I know that is slightly easier to see, and I'll try to make my writing nice and legible. But if you're having trouble reading something, please let me know. So, I mean, here the definition of an annular link is: you're just embedding some copies of a circle into a thickened annulus. And if you read And if you really only like thinking about links in S3 for some reason instead of thinking about links inside of other manifolds, you can also give a definition for annular links in terms of links in S3. So you could also say that it's going to be a link in S3 where you have a special unknotted component that you've kind of distinguished from the rest of the link. From the rest of the link. So it would be, you know, a link where you have a special annotated component in S3, or you can just think about it as some embedding a link into a thickened annulus. And obviously, you can go back and forth by just remembering that the complement of the unknot in S3 would be a thickened annulus. So that's how you're going to get CB between these. But I wanted to say this just because both perspectives can be helpful depending on what you're thinking about. What you're thinking about. Sometimes, like, definitions aren't that informative, though. So, I've drawn some nice examples over here that you can keep in mind if you haven't seen annular links. So, there's three up here. And I just want to, and for all of them, I've kind of indicated where the center of the annulus would be with this red dot. And maybe just to point out, for example, this example, in this example, if instead it was just an S3 instead of a thickened amnio. Just in S3 instead of a thickened annulus, obviously, these would both represent the unknot, but because we're working in a thickened annulus, these are like non-trivial knots because you can't kind of undo these crossings while staying inside of your thickened annulus. And I think you might ask yourself, like, why might you care about annular links? And there's like a few reasons. So I think annular Annular links would naturally come up if you're thinking about patterns and satellite operations. But another very natural class of annular links, I think, is just closures of braids. Braids are a really nice object, and their closures are really nice objects as a nice way to study knots and links. And so, you know, here's one example of a braid closure that's naturally sitting, and all braid closures naturally sit in a thickened annulus. And maybe now I'll tell you a little bit about how annular links connect with branch double covers, or how I like to think about annular links connecting with branch double covers. And I really think that this is, if you take anything away from the talk, I would hope you take this away. I would hope you take this away from the talk because I think it's something that's pretty cool and also maybe underexplored, and something that people could do a lot with if they cared to. So I've told you about the first thing in my title, so let me tell you about the second thing. So just as a very brief reminder, if we just had a link inside of S3, Then, taking a branch double cover now builds us a three-manifold that we'd call the branch double cover of our link. But if instead we're working with an annular link, so we're working with, say, a link inside of the thickened annulus. Now, what we actually would get is a three-manifold with a link sitting inside of that three-manifold. So, how can you see that? There's a few ways you could see that. So, obviously, we still have just the branch double cover of L as our three-manifold, but how are we gonna pick out a link? Manifold, but how are we going to pick out a link inside of this three-manifold? And, you know, we want this to somehow relate to the fact that we're sitting in a second annihilate. I probably shouldn't have picked A for the name of this unknown since I was already using A here. I'm just noticing. So maybe I'll call this unknown U instead. So if we remember thinking of L as instead L as instead this larger link inside of S3, what we can think about is: well, what's the lift of U inside of our branch double cover? And that's going to give us either a not or a link inside of this three-manifold. And so now, just like before in S3, you could take a link, build a three-manifold associated with the link, and now you have all. Associated to the link, and now you have all these tools at your disposal from people who like to think about three-manifolds. Now you've taken your annular link and you've built a three-manifold with a link inside of it. And so all of a sudden you have all these tools at your disposal from people who love to think about links and three manifolds. And maybe I'll just say a little bit more here because I said I think this is really the cool part, or a very cool thing, is say specific. Is say specifically you're working with a braid closure, then actually you get a fibered link over here. And I'll maybe even draw a picture of how that works just to make sure everyone feels convinced by that fact instead of me just telling you this fact. Just telling you this fact. Unfortunately, I can't draw. Yeah, yeah. Bless you. Here, you pop it out as a already and then the link is going to be. Maybe this will probably be using my end. Yes, that's exactly right. So, just to repeat the question for people online, the question was about this identification. And so, like the question was saying, if we have an annular link, we're thinking about L inside of S3, so we can build our three manifold. And then to find this link, we're taking the lift of the meridian of our annulus inside of that preemptible cover. Table cover. Yes. So the question again was: is the complement of U tilde the branch double cover of L of the thickened annulus along L? And the answer is yes. Okay, cool. Thank you for the clarifying question. The clarifying question. So, I was going to draw you a picture just so you don't have to just take my word for the fact that if we have a braid closure, we actually get a fibered length. So, I can't draw in three dimensions that well, but I can draw you a picture in two dimensions. And then I can just ask you to do some mental work in your head. So, here's a picture of a disc with three marked points. And if you took this cross, And if you took this crossed with S1, you would get a three-braid. And then the branched double cover of this disc along three points is a once-punctured torus, where the involution is really just rotation by 180 degrees along this. Degrees along this red axis, so we can see our three marked points. So then, if I wanted to understand the branch double cover of the three-braid, I can just take this crossed with S1. And then if I want to see my link inside of this three-manifold that we've built, well, I'm taking the pre-image of the meridian of my the meridian of. The meridian of my second annualist, which is lifting up to the binding of this open book that we've just built for our three-manifold. And so we can see that our pre-image is really a fibrid link in our three-manifold. And so in this case, it's really a knot. And if I had like an not and if I had like an even braid index it would be a two component link instead. Maybe I'll leave that just like so you can think about. It's nice to draw this picture because I remember Melissa drawing a picture for me like this many, many years ago. So maybe before I move on to annular chromato chromology, I'll just like reiterate that I think that this perspective of studying annular links or maybe even specifically brave closures by trying to study these associated links in three manifolds is something that's underexplored, like just kind of Underexplored, like just kind of using an analogy. Lots of knot theorists have proven lots of things about knots and links by studying branch double covers. But I don't think that that perspective has been used to study braid closures. Obviously, this perspective of this branch double cover has been used maybe more by a geometric group theorist studying two-dimensional topology or geometry, but I don't think that, as far as I know, it's not like a very common technology. I know it's not like a very common technique in three or 3.5 dimensional topology. And I think it would be, I think it's something that you should keep in mind as a tool you could think about if you're ever asking yourself a question about a braid closure. With that being said, maybe I'll say a little bit about the third part of my title, which is annular cavanophthomology. I'm going to erase my beautiful picture over here and say some words about annular clonophomology. So, annular Kavanophomology is just like an extension of Kavanophthomology to the setting of the thickened annulus, and it was defined. By Aseida Shizitsky and Shakura in 2004. So, this is something where I do really prefer slide talks to chalk talks is the names just come up when you press a button on a slide talk. But here I have to like stare at my notes to make sure that I spell everyone's name correctly instead. Directly instead. Let me tell you some things about annular common ophthalmology. So, like I said, it's like vonophthomology in the thicken annulus. And I guess I should say, like in this paper, they really define vonophomology in any eye bundle over a surface, but this is maybe the most studied. This is maybe the most studied example that they've defined. And specifically, what do I mean by like Kavanophomology? So if you wanted to compute this, you can follow the same process as Kavanophomology, where you're building yourself a cube of resolutions. Yeah. No, no. For every five or senior students, you can define the greater than the online so that they can actually be a class. Oh, yeah, that's a great question. So, just to repeat the question again for people in the audience, the question was, because I have this arrow I've drawn here from braids to fibered links, if I think of my favorite fibered link in S3, could I find some braid that represents the unknot where I would get my fibered link out of this construction? And the answer is actually no. And the answer is actually no. So, one thing that you could see is, if you have sat down to try and think about this a little bit more, is actually that the mapping class group element of the breed will kind of determine the monodromy of the fibrid link. And then the fact that it's arising as a branch double cover will force some sort of symmetry about the monodromy of the fibrid. Of symmetry about the monodromy of the fibrin link that it should respect that or commute with that involution that I've drawn on my surface. And for in a general surface, you won't always have that. I guess also I should say, like, you know, we only get one or two component links here. So obviously, if your favorite fiber link has more components than that, you can't get it. But even amongst fiber knots in S3, not all of their monodromies. All of their monodromies have this sort of symmetry condition that you naturally get from this construction. But besides those two obstructions, you can get all of them. So if you pick your favorite fiber knot and its monodromy does look like it's symmetric with respect to this involution, then you could find a braid. And not just in S3, but in any 3-manifold. Does that answer your question enough? Okay. Sorry, so I was saying about Kavanaugh homology. So you take your diagram, build yourself a cube of resolutions, and then the only thing that's a little bit different is now you actually have two different types of circles, just depending on if your circle is non-trivial in the homology of the annulus. Some of the circles might wrap around the annulus, and some are. Around the annulus, and some are still down the disk. And so you just treat those two circles differently, and you get a third grading, usually called the annular grading. And I've come over here. I mean, you all know what annular commonophomology might look like. So you don't really need examples. This is maybe more for people who, in other talks I give, where they might even just get scared at the words kabonophomology, which is not the audience here. But you just now have a third grading, so not just the human. Now, have a third grading. So, not just the homological and quantum gradings, but also this third grading called the annular grading as well. And, like I said, that annular grading is somehow keeping track of in your resolution if your circle went around the annulus or not. And just like cabanochomology, this is categorifying a more classical invariant called Invariant called the Kaufman-Skein bracket or the Kaufman-Skein bracket module. Maybe just for the sake of writing something, I'll say that it categorifies an annular version of the Jones polynomial. Um And there's also things that are nice to know about it, like you have a spectral sequence from annular cabanophthomology to cabanophomology that's given by instead of That's given by instead of treating this annular grading as a grading, treating it as a filtration. And sorry, Lucas, I don't know if there's a nice way to define it in terms of a module structure instead. I'm just trying to remember if there's anything else that's very important to tell you about annular quantophology before I just kind of keep talking. Of course, if I forget anything, I could just bring it up later, but it's kind. Anything, I could just bring it up later, but it's kind of in, you know, it's good form if I'd mention it all now instead of being like, oh, I forgot to tell you this really important thing right when we get to it. I guess just because some people always ask, it's not like it will be super important for the talk, but people are often curious. And so annular quantum opsomology is symmetric with respect to the K grading in some way. So you can check, for example, that like here there's two things with K grading two. There's two things with k grading two, so there's also two things with k grading negative two in this example here. Yeah. Oh, well, right. So, yeah, so the question was: how do you recover Kavanophthalmology from annular Kavanophthalmology? So, the one answer is yes. So, the one answer is: yes, if you include your link, so it's like inside of a ball, inside of your thickened amulus, you would just get Kavanaugh homology back on the nose. But for something more complicated like this, this is non-trivial in the thing in annulus, but it's the unknown in S3, so we should see some spectral sequence. And what's going on is you just have, if you'd computed not just the Not just the annular maps, but like the normal quantum maps, you would just see some of the maps didn't respect the annular grading. And so they'll give you treating that as a filtration, they'll give you induced differentials here. So in this case, those differentials would be something like a map from here to this generator to this generator, a map from this generator to this generator, and a map from this generator to this generator. Generator to this generator, and you can see all those decrease the annular grading. Sorry, I know that maybe I'll try it in red. I know that's hard to see on this board. But I think the red shows up better than the blue at least. And then also, you can check if you computed the homology with these differentials, your final result would have, in this case, two dimensions, which is. Case two dimensions, which is because if we forgot this was in the annulus, this is a braid that represents the unknown. Does that answer your question? Or the house should be a brave house. Ah, so if I wanted to like, yeah, yeah, so if I wanted something where the annular kphonophthomology was exactly the same as the kphonophomology, I'd want to take my link and include it in a ball inside of my thickened annulus. So it's like not wrapping around the annulus at all. Okay. So, you know, I think that's all that I really needed to say about annular quantophomology. And if it isn't, then I'll say more later. But I don't know. I think as a low-dimensional topologist, I can see something like this and ask, like, you know. Like, you know, why should I care about annular cabinophomology? Like, what does it tell us? Um, you know, I guess there's um, you know, the joke, which I think I heard first from Mike Wong, but I don't think he came up with it that, like, three. It that like three is a non-invariant, um, but nobody studies three as a non-invariant. So, why should somebody study annular chromonophomology as a non-invariant? Hopefully, it tells us more than three. And in fact, it tells us things about the topology of our annular links, which is great to know. So, the first is it actually can tell you if that annular link you're looking at. That annular link you're looking at is a braid closure, so it detects braid closures and even will tell you the braid index. And there's maybe a few names to say here. Maybe the first would be just Rigsby and Yini in 2013. But then also, I should probably say there's work of Yiji. There's work of Yi Ji and Boy Yu Zhang in 2019 as well. And how does it tell you about if your thing is a braid closure? So let's come look at our braid closure over here. So if I look at the highest non-zero annular grading, in this case, that's four, I'd see that annular coupon of homology is actually one dimension. Annular Kavanaugh homology is actually one-dimensional in this highest non-zero annular gradient. And that's exactly what tells us that it's a braid and also that the braid index is four. You should think of this as really like how knot polyhomology tells you if your knot is a fiber knot or not. And also, if it's a fiber knot, it's telling you the genus as well. And you know, you're like, so what? We already drew this as a brain closure. But let's look at this one. But let's look at this one. So, the way I drew it, it doesn't look like a braid closure, but you know, maybe there's some really clever way I could isotope this picture in the thickened annulus so that it is a braid closure. So let's look at its annular quantum opsomology. And in this case, the highest non-zero annular grading is two, but we see that it's two-dimensional in this top annular grading. So that ensures that it's not a braid closure. So now if you have a random picture of an annular link and you A random picture of an annular link, and you wanted to know could I find a braid that's the same as it? You can just ask a computer to compute its annular quantophomology. There's some other things that it tells us, and I think I'll list at least a few things. And I'm also realizing there is something I forgot to say, not about annealer covonophomology, but even earlier in the talk. So I'll make sure to be very clear about it when I get there. So we also know that annular quantophomology detects the trivial braid. And that also means it gives you a solution to the word problem in the braid group, though it's not as quick as like previous known solutions to the word problem in the braid group. This is due to Baldwin and Grigsby and In twenty twelve. Um and then we also know that, in fact, annular quantophomology detects every two-braid closure. And that appears in a paper of In the paper of Ellie Anthony Licata and Stefan Verley from 2015. Now, how does that work? Well, so we already know that annular Cavanohomology detects braid closures and tells us the braid index. Braid closures and tells us the braid index, so it can certainly tell us if our thing is a closure of a two-braid or not. And then, I don't know, there's not many two braids. Like, you're just asking, like, how many times can I twist, can I twist these two strands around? And so they're actually able just to compute the annular quantum homology of all the two braids, and they're all different. So you know you're a two braid, and then you just like check your list of two braid annular quantum homologies to figure out which ones you are. And that's kind of some things that were known. And then maybe I'll tell you some more things that we know. I write big, so I keep needing to erase stuff on the boards. So oh, yeah, sorry. Well, among all annular links. Sorry, so the question was if it detects two-braid closures among braid closures or among all annular links. And the answer is just among all annular links. But the first step is if you have the same annular chronophomology as a two-braid closure, the fact that it detects braid closures tells you that you're already a braid closure. So if you're not a braid closure, it's like easy to check that your aneurylic phonophology is different. And your quantophology is different. So, maybe some other things that are known is that it detects the braid closure, the three-braid closure, sigma one, sigma two, along with the three-braid closure, sigma one, sigma two inverse, the four-braid closure, sigma one, sigma two. Sigma two, sigma three. And the sixth grade floor here, sigma one, sigma two, sigma three, sigma four, sigma five. And this is work of both myself and Fraser Binn. So, this is the thing I forgot to say at the beginning: is some of what I'll be talking about today is partially joint work with Fraser Bin. So, I wanted to stop and say it now. Fraser Bin. So I wanted to stop and say it now. He's currently a Grabson FC. He's also on the job market right now. So I really wanted to say that this is partially joint work with Fraser Binns. He's really awesome. And so this is something we proved in 2020. And since we've proven that annular homology detects these Homology detects these braids. There's been some other work. So it also is now known to detect sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, sigma 4. This is due to Ethan Farber, Braden Reynoso, and Lu Ya Wong. Luya Wong. I think Braden is also applying for jobs now. I'm not sure if Luya is applying for jobs currently, but she's definitely applying for jobs in the she's applying for jobs now. I was going to say at least in the near future, but she's applying for jobs now. Ethan's applying for non-academic jobs. So Ethan's great too, but I don't think you'll see his name in a postdoc application, I guess. And that, I think they proved this in. This is in 21. And then I'm not going to write down the actual braids for these ones just because it gets a little bit repetitive. But Fraser, along with Subankarde, showed that this, that annular Kavanophomology also detects the eight and ten braids that kind of fit this sentence. That kind of fits the same pattern, but I'm going to save you from watching me write out the eight braid and then also the 10 braid up at the board. That's another nice thing about slide talks is I can just press a button and those braids show up. And I should say that kind of the proofs here and here follow the exact same strategy as kind of what Fraser and I do. And I think when I give a sketch of the proof, it should be clear kind of what the new work that. What the new work that both of these people do are, which is hard new work, but maybe orthogonal to what I'm talking about in this talk. But if I get to that sketch and it's not clear where their new work is, please ask me so I can talk about how great their work is too. So I'm actually just going to, I think, give a sketch that. I think give a sketch that annular quantophomology detects this forebridge here next, but I wanted to pause first just to see if there were questions before I jump into a sketch of the proof. Okay, so then if there aren't Ah, I see. I need to say something before I prove that. Which is like, I didn't include it in my handwritten notes here, which is why I forgot. But I don't know. So far, I've kind of told you about the three parts in my title, which is a good start. I also told you about how annular links and double branch covers are related, but I Related, but I haven't said anything about annulic. Like, if I'm talking about annulic phonophomology, why did I spend all this time telling you about branch double covers and annular links? And it's because, as you might expect, there actually is a nice relationship. There actually is a nice relationship between annular commono homology and branch double covers. So remember, just before, if we had an annular link, we were building this pair that was the branch double cover of L with this lift of the braid axis inside of it. And so if we have instead, if we're thinking. Instead, if we're thinking about the annular covonophomology of that link, it turns out that this is related to the knot floor homology of this knot inside of the branch double cover bell. Maybe I need to put. Maybe I need to put like, you know, a mirror of L here, or, you know, put like minus signs all over here or something. This is like an annular version of the Adroat Sabo spectral sequence to the branch that we'll cover. So I think this first appears in work of Lawrence Roberts. And so because there's And so, because this isn't in my notes, I'm actually guessing here, but I think it's in 2008. And then it also shows up in a paper of Grigsby and Bailey in 2009 as well. And so, I guess if the observant So, I guess if the observant audience members might worry a little bit, because if you're remembering what goes on just in Kavanophomology, we actually needed to take like a reduced version of Kavanophomology here to get like the dimensions to match up with the Hagar floor homology over here. And you don't need to do this in annular Kibano homology, in fact. There's like a few reasons for why this is true, but maybe the best reason I could actually give you is that people think about the wrong thing in S3, which is really you should have something going from the Kavana hospitalology to the Hagard floor hospitology where you have two base points in your manifold, because you're really thinking about a branchable cover. a branch that we'll cover. But maybe a slightly better answer is like here, you can think about your thickened annulus as a sutured manifold. And so then your branch double cover is also naturally a sutured manifold as well, just by like lifting everything up. And you're really getting a spectral sequence from the annular clonal homology here to the sutured fluoro homology there. And so then in the case where you have a link, you'll have one pair. Where you have a link, you'll have one pair of sutures on each component of your link, and it just works out. But in the case where this is actually a knot, you'll have two pairs of sutures on that knot. So you could think about it as instead of having one pair of base points, having two pairs of base points. And so that's doubling the rank of your knot plephomology. And so that's why you don't need to take anything reduced here. It's really like you take sometimes extra base points up here. But like that feels natural in some way because this is. Like that feels natural in some way because this is a branch double cover. So you want your base points to, you know, to me, it seems like if you have this involution, you'd want your base points to be permuted by that involution. So you should have extra base points floating around compared to compared to if you didn't have the involution. All right, so. All right, so now I can give you a nice sketch of how to prove that annular chromatophomology detects the braid sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3. Sorry if I wasn't super clear about that point. I normally don't bother saying it, but I felt like I should say it since I was actually in a room full of experts on the subject. On the subject who might otherwise be confused or unhappy or ask me questions. You know, most people like just zone out as soon as you say spectral sequencing, you can just be like, just think of it as a rank inequality. But this audience is a little bit different, I think. So we're proving this theorem of Of Fraser and myself, we're saying if the annular common ophthalmology of L is actually isomorphic to the annular common ophthalmology of sigma one, sigma two, sigma three, then L is actually the same. Actually, the same inside of the thickened annulus as the barrier closure signal in signal two, signal three. Okay, so I'll give a nice sketch of this proof. So the first thing we know is that L is represented by some braid closure, just because we know that annular clonophomology detects braid closure. Annular clonophomology detects braid closures. And in fact, we know that it's some four-braid just because the highest non-zero annular degree of the annular common homology is four and that it's one-dimensional in that annular grading. And then we can actually learn a little bit more, which is that. A little bit more, which is that beta closure beta is not in S3. And that's just using the fact that the annular Kavanaugh mmology is actually very simple. So the differentials I drew here earlier are actually the only possible spectral sequence you could have to Kavanophomology if this was your annular Kavanaugh. And so then, you know, your clonophology is ringed two. So by Kronheimer and Merfka as a result, we know that, in fact, you're an unknown. That's pretty good, but there's a lot of four brains that represent the unknown. So we haven't quite learned enough yet. So this is where we're going to go to the next. They use this idea about not phlehomology because people know a lot about not phlehermology. So, if I use tools from not phlehormology, it would be great. And so, we'll actually be able to check termology of the lift. Of the lift of the braid axis in the branch double cover of L, which we know is S3, is actually the same as the not plemology of the Taurus link T24, which is what Um, which is what you'd get if you take a branched cover construction with this braid here. Um, that might not be obvious, but if you wanted to sit down and like check it, it wouldn't be hard for you to check either. But don't feel bad if it's not like you look at it and you're like, oh, of course, naturally. But then something that Fraser and I had also proved, which I probably should write. I probably should write somewhere else, but maybe I'll just write here because I don't want to write on that green board. Is that in fact not floor homology detects T24 And so that means that in fact, if I look at the lift of my braid axis inside of the branch double cover bell, it is actually the Taurus link T24. And this is the part of the proof that people did. That people did other work on when I listed those later names. So, Luia, Ethan, and Brayden showed that not philhermology detects T25. So, they were able to then write this sketch of a proof where they use a five-braid that gives you T25. And then Braden and Subankar did this for like the corresponding T28 and T210. So, that's kind of the cool new stuff that they did was these detection results with. Did these detection results with not polar homology, which is maybe orthogonal to the top there, the stuff that I'm telling you about now? And that's pretty good. But it's not quite enough because we really wanted to know something about L. Now we just know something in like a branch double cover. And if I'm thinking back to links in S3, I know, oh, well, I can think of different links that are different, but give me the same branch double cover. That are different, but give me the same brand scope of cover. So I really need to argue a little bit more to actually know that my link L is the same as the Taurus link, or sorry, as this link that was giving me the link sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3. And here Here, one thing you can say is, like I actually mentioned earlier, is that the monodromy of your fibered link is determined by By the braid, and of course, the monodrome of your fibrid link is only well-defined up to conjugation. So, and how it's determined is I mentioned that people who study mapping class groups have thought about this branch double cover construction a lot. And in fact, Berman and Hilden give this nice map called the Berman and Hilden. Give this nice map called the Berman-Hilding correspondence from braid groups into mapping plus groups of surfaces. So, what we're saying is that the image of beta, where beta was our braid that we picked where the closure represents L, under this Berman-Hilden correspondence is actually conjugate to the image of the braid sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3 under this same map. And that's pretty good because what we really would love is showing that beta is conjugate to sigma one, sigma two, sigma three. Because if they're conjugate, then their closure should be isotopic in the thickened annulus. But the problem is, and this is a pretty nice map, it's injective, it's an isomorphism onto its image. I guess that's the same as being injective, but it's an isomorphism onto like the symmetric mapping class group, the mapping classes that Mapping classes that respect the symmetry of the involution. But the problem is, you can come up with lots of injective group homomorphisms that send non-conjugate elements to conjugate elements. So you need to think a little bit more. And at this point, I asked friends who understood the Berman-Hildman correspondence better, and I was like, can you have non-conjugate braids be sent to conjugate braids? And at first, they didn't think so. And then they thought about it more, tried to come up with conjugate. They thought about it more, tried to come up with counterexamples, started to believe it, but haven't ever written a full proof of it. But something they communicated to me was that it was true for definitely true for periodic braids, which is what sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3 are. But it wasn't citable. So Fraser and I spent a long time thinking about like other ways we could come up with this argument and then, or come up with like some argument that's saying that what we want is true. That's what we want is true. And then eventually, I actually realized that there was a way that we could just prove this proposition that if you have braids that are periodic, which has to do with the dynamics of the braid as a mapping class group. Then there are images under this map. Images under this map are conjugate if and only if the braids themselves are conjugate. And so I should say the people I'd asked who did communicate some version of a proof of that to me were Marissa Loving and Dan Margalit. I didn't understand their proof just because I'm not. Understand their proof just because I'm not an expert on mapping classes and it included lots of things I didn't understand. But I think their proof is in like some way morally similar to our proof. Our proof uses like the fractional gain twist coefficient, along with a fact that the roots of rays are unique. If there is like an nth root, then it's unique up to conjugation. But it would be really nice to know if there's a unique unit. It would be really nice to know if this was true for not just periodic braids, but also for pseudonasov and reducible braids as well. So I just want to say, like, that's something people believe is true, or at least the experts that I've asked seem to believe is true, but there isn't a proof in the literature. So I like to tell people that so that maybe somebody will prove it, or maybe they'll tell somebody who will prove it. That's your, if I get to assign homework, that's your homework problem is telling somebody. Homework problem is telling somebody else to prove it. Telling your favorite friend who likes mapping class groups. So that actually completes our proof then, because these are periodic. So that means that beta is conjugate to sigma one, sigma two, sigma three. And so then we know that. Then we know that, in fact, our link L has to be isotopic to the closure of sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3. So I'll pause here. I think it's like, am I almost out of time? Is that right? Cool. That's what I, then I had more I could say, but I'll just stop here and thank you all for your time. I wasn't sure if the clock was right or not. Oh, yeah. Okay, great. Questions for Gage? Do you have an expectation one way or the other what happens when you continue? Other, what happens when you continue? I guess this is like called like this, I don't know, one over one over braid index twist, the Gar side element or something. Like, what happens for higher ones, like past 10? Do you have an example where it's not detected at a certain grade index? Sorry, I should have been more clear about this, but the sketch of a group I gave works just as well for any grade index for like this sort of element. And like the only thing that missed. And like the only thing that's missing is if not flood molecule detects the appropriate words not so I guess boils down to a question of if you believe not floating hole detects appropriate towards models and so if the answer to that is yeah then any other quantum meetings and if it doesn't or at least can't use this sort of tool of it well okay given that I'm asking the in Okay, given that I'm asking the in-house expert on this, so what do you expect of the two and fluoresce links? Oh, well, I don't think I'm an expert on not fluorescent. Maybe what I'll say is that for you, and I showed that link fluoromology affects all of those, which is maybe much easier because link fluoromology kind of sets a balance because annulus between the two that's like But I don't know. These seems in one of like it seems pretty like, it would be a little bit weird in like it detects, you know, T210, but not T210. Like, I can't think of a good reason why it's off. But that's not like an argument that it doesn't. And also, it's not a necessary condition that this detection is. Can you find some other arguments? Like maybe you could find some other arguments, but it's yeah, this argument works if it's a different kind of game response. Just because all of them have these very simple things, but kind of just reported on grades, just like two irreducible echoes like 10 and 80. Sorry, maybe this was clear. Was it you mentioned that, yeah, like you know, in here, you could say something like, well, there's only one spectral sequence available. Like, and I can see that you're just like preserving quantum grading or something. But how do you know those maps aren't zero? Like those extra? But something that was true is that it's so this element here represents the transcript element and bottom poly. And if it's non-zero monopolology, you're creating with right. Meanwhile, this element here represents the transverse element of here in like the dual complex. And so if it's non-zero in the holiday, it's the dual complex. In the holiday, it's the dual complex. The mirror is right. But the only grade where it's right hearing and its narrative right hearing is the trivial grade. This isn't the trivial braid. So at the very least, you need this differential. And then it turns out that something that Ellie and Stefan and Anthony showed was that there is like not just an ethical CGX, but like actions through the algebra that includes those. That includes both the anthropologists and things like the induced difference on the cost molecules. So you're able to use that to show that these other differences. Sorry, so these other actions kind of yeah, like because basically like the differential needs the lowering accent of the lowering act here to hear and here to hear so that the differential. Okay, great. Thank you. No further questions or chat. Okay, then let's thank Gage once again.
