Good morning is Ken Tosato, who will speak on arithmetic deformations of F singularities. Thank you very much. So, thank you very much for your introduction. And thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to talk today. Okay, so let me start my talk. Okay, so today's talk is about arithmetic deformation. arithmetic deformation with singularities. Okay, so we consider some deformation problems in mixed characteristic. So before starting my talk, I will recall some notions about deformation problems. So let us consider T via so something like Smith variety over K or K or some regular scheme or finite type of Z but for simplicity we first consider this case okay so and let zero we fix some closed point and we denote it by zero and let consider some variety over k Variety over K and consider propomorphism. Okay, so the important philosophy is that, so if we assume that the special fiber, which is a fiber of this morphism. This morphism over the fixed cross point, we call this as special fiber. And so, okay, the philosophy says that if the special fiber has mild singularities, then so does the generic fiber chieta, which is a provocative geometric generic point, where eta is a where data is a generic point okay so first philosophy is that if the fixed cross point is has mild singularities then so it's the generic fiber or geometric generic fiber okay and second philosophy is that if geometric genetic fiber Geometric genetic fiber has mild singularities if and only if general crossed fibers have also mild singularities, where general closed fiber is a fiber over general closed point. Okay, such a phenomenon happens in for many classes of singularities in algebraic. Classes of singularities in algebraic geometry. Okay, and it's very important. Okay, so today we consider four classes of singularities, the formation problem for four classes of singularities, which are KLT, LC, or strongly equal or equipment. Or I view. Okay. And of course, many people here may know these singularities, the definition of these singularities, but we quickly recall some properties of these singularities. Okay, so KRT or IRC singularity is mainly considered in characteristic 0, 0 and And these classes of singularities are defined by in terms of resolution of singularities. And the rata2 strongly regular is considered in positive characteristic and defined by Robenius morphisms. And Mauvazea. And moreover, there are very important connections. So first is that KLT is a little stronger than L C and the strongly equilibria is a little stronger than FPA. And for here, KLT and strong require. So they are very deep connection. So this is the relation between these four classes of singularities. And I will explain what is a deep connection. So of course, many people may know, but it is first considered by them, which says that. Which says that not T, but here we consider deformation in mixed characteristic that is. So, for example, let us consider deformation of a spec Z and so if the geometric generic fiber is K T if and only if If and only if genera closed five as a strong regular in five three many p okay and uh for every C case, so we also have this implication and Have this implication, and the compass is conjectured. But so similar thing happens in finite remaining p. Okay, so so very roughly speaking, uh, over Over spec z, or something like spec z. So, if we consider some deformation over a mixed characteristic base, then the KRT or IRC on generic fiber is equivalent to strongly regular or pure on general fibers. Okay, so this is approved by in them and so. In them. And so, in this philosophy, so this factor is just here. Maybe very well-known fact. But so today we consider this part. Part okay, so so this is somewhat so different problem. Okay, so our main question is says that so if a closed fiber is strongly regular or pure for single P, then the generic fiber Fiber is K T or L C so does it does it do? Is it true so this is our main question? Okay, so this is an explanation of our main question. Okay, so in the next section, I will give In the next section, I will give some main results about this question. Okay. Before, I state some results, so I will quickly recall the definition of singularities. So, but the definition is not so important. So, if you don't know the definition, so either. Know the definition, so you don't have to care. Okay, so we first recall the definition of KLT or LC. So, for simplicity, let us consider normal variety. And the important point is we assume that Q or Einstein that is a canonical divisor is Q currently. Okay, so. Carity. Okay, so fast. So for all proper virational morphism from normal variety y, we define the QBA divisor kyx on y by the difference of canonical divisor. Of canonical devices. Sorry, this is BCX. Okay, so this is the definition of KYX. And by using this QBAU divisor, we can define KLT singularities, YDC singularities as follows. So that is, so the variety X has only KLT singularity if and only if. So for all such X, every coefficient of every coefficient of q value divided by kyx is larger than minus one or we say that this x is elsey singularities if this inequality holds for all coefficients okay so this is a definition of klt or lc singularities okay Okay, so we also recall the definition of strong regular singularities or FQR singularities. Okay, so let us consider normal variety of a perfect field of characteristic P okay so Okay, so first we consider so we define k to be the rotational field of k and k bar is a algebraic closure of k. Okay, so we will define this link by sub algebra. Okay, bar defined by this form. Okay, so this is very natural definition. And okay, so in this case, so we say that the variety X has only X plus singularities if the natural R morphism, which is just identity morphism to Some other algebra. So let us consider this morphism, and we say that X is expure if this morphism splits as are modular. Okay, so this is the definition of expiry singularities. Okay, and similarly, so we say that X is only, X has only strongly regular singularities. X has only strong regular singularities or I say who are shortly. So if one only, so for all elements, there exists some integer E such that so are morphisms defying by this point splits. So this is the definition of strong regularity. Okay, so Okay, so okay, so this is the definition for singularities which we consider today. Okay, so before going to our main results, so I will give some example. So for example, so I find that I define the definition of I define some expingt, but so the natural question is that so how difficult to check the some given variety is X pure or not so for X purity so this there is very uh important criterion which is called Feder's criterion so I will explain about that so let regular So let's make it a local ring AM of characteristic P and consider some elements F. In this case, Feder's criterion says that the hyperplane A over F is pure if and only this element is contained in this area, which is generated by Generated by all p powers of all elements in m. Okay, so so this is called the Federal criterion. So and this is very powerful because so for example, let us consider the hyperplane defined by this By this polynomial. Okay, so in this case, so for example, if P is 2, the characteristic is 2, then R is not pure. Okay, this is because this element, this polynomial is just Does not contain the bracket of M is contained in is contained in here. So by Fedas criterion, so we can say that R is not F pure. And similarly, in this case, In this case, this is not EFPR, but the computation is very similar. And in EFP is 7, we conclude that R is pure. Okay, this is because P minus 1 is 6 in this case. So this is just. Like this, okay, and this contains the term over x3 square times y three square times that three square which is x six y six that square square square s Y6Z6 not contained in seven brackets of the maximal radial. Okay, so by Freda's criterion, so we can say that this R is F pure in this case. Okay. So in the final case, So in the final case, so the important point is that so this index is divided by three. So the important point is this index is divided by three. So similarly, we can say that if p is uh p is uh uh more p is one mode three. P is one mod three, then we can set R is F pure and otherwise R is not F pure. Okay, so this is very elementary example. So the most important point here is that Feda's criterion is very easy to use and also. Is very easy to use, and at least for computers, so it's very easy to compute to use criterion. Okay, so this is important point. Okay, so this is about some example for FPD. And we also consider quickly about the logocanonicity. Okay, so for example, let us For example, let us consider the similar polynomial of C. Okay, so in characteristic zero, then this is row canonical. Okay, and so this there are three proofs or here over three proofs over local HD. So first is that so use use of Of the fact that this R is graded ring. So I don't explain the details, but so let us consider E, which is elliptic surface, elliptic curve defined by this polynomial. Then this R is just a fine con of this elliptic curve, which is of course. Which is, of course, carbia variety, so this is row canonical. Okay, so this is first proof. And the second proof is that also which is go back to the definition. So let us consider the blowing up of spec R along the maximum area. Then this case is very simple. So this F is actually the logo. This ech is actually the log resolution. That is, so the exceptional divisor is prime divisor, and the pair is simply normal crossing, which says that this is the local resolution. And we can also compute the relative canonical divisor kyx to be this divisor. So by So by definition, go back to definition. So the definition of log analysis says that the coefficient of this divisor is larger than or equal to minus one. So this is canonical. Okay, so the important point is that in the definition, so we need to consider every proper birational model, but if we Model, but if we get some local resolution, then we can only consider local resolution. Okay, so this is the second proof. And the third proof is that, so considering model P reduction, so let us consider this model P reduction. Then, as I saw, this is. This is FPR for infinitely many p, so r is r canonical by the previous fact. Okay, so this fact is fact. Okay, so this is a third proof. Okay, so there are many proofs for LC, but Proof so LC, but the search proof is very good because accurate is easy to check by computers. So this method may be good for computers for computing. Okay, but the difficulty for computer is that so this part, this is part for computers. So this is one of the motivation of the main question. So if main question is true, so main question says that we can take K of T or canonical by a single P. So if this is true, so we don't have to consider infinitely many P. So it So, which is very good for computing. So, this is one of practical motivation for this main question. Okay, so I will go to our main results. Before that, let us consider some known results. Okay, so the basic setting is that so let us consider some zero zebra of finite type and consider the spectrum of A which is regular okay and let chi be a T scheme rat property scheme and And we denote pi to be the structure morphismorphis and we fix a closed point. Okay, and so let us assume normality for fibers. Okay, okay, so this is a of course, so many people here may know, but so in this setting, so the characteristic of received field at closed point is positive, and the characteristic of The characteristic of a generic point is where eta is generic point of t is zero. And this is also well known that if we assume the normality of special fiber, then the total space is also normal around the closed fiber. And of course, genetic fiber is also normal. Genetic fiber is also normal. So we can consider everything is normal. Okay, this is a very small remark. Okay, and the non-result is given by Ma and Swiss, which says that in setting one, let's assume so the total space chi is Q Einstein around And the special fiber. Okay. So, and this assumption implies that automatically, so the gross fiber and generic fiber are also Quinstein by this assumption. Okay, so in this situation, if we this situation if we assume that we further assume that the cross fiber is strongly regular then the genetic fiber is kd okay so this is uh uh uh known results about our main question so in strongly negative case so it is So it is true that the main question is true for strongly regular case. Okay, so our first main result is very similar to this fact. So which says that we assume the same assumption. I sorry, I P and if we assume that the special fiber is pure, then the general fiber is canonical, L C okay, so this is our first main result. So that that is so. So that is this fact and this theorem gives an affirmative answer for this main question. Okay, so this is our first main theorem. Okay, so next, so I will explain the second main result. Second main result. So the second main result is about strongly regular case. So which is some definement of match with factor. Okay, so we focus on this assumption. Okay, so the motivation is that, so in this In this fact, so okay, so this says that so if we assume some mild singularities on special fibers, then generic fiber has also mild singularities. So this this is the this is the structure of this. Is the structure of this fact, but this assumption is not for fiber but for total space. Okay, so we need to use this factor, this theorem. So we need to check the singularity of total space. So it is not so reasonable. So I will so we will. So we will explain how to relax this assumption. So which is the CRMP. So our serum P says that, so if we assume the fibers are Q-Renstein, then the similar results false. Okay, so okay, this is a if the base field base scheme is one-dimensional, then this is proved here. And by using recent results, so we can also prove this case. Okay, so anyway, so we can relax the condition for total space, but so assuming some. But so assuming some reasonable assumption for fibers. Okay, so this is our CRM B. And the good point of CRMB is not for concept, but also have explicit application. So which is correlation C. Which is corollary C. So let us consider two-dimensional deformation. Then we don't have to assume some Q-Grange condition. So, okay, so in two-dimensional case, so we don't have to check the Q-Voinstein. Okay, so this is our correlation. Okay, so this is our choral C. So the key point of corollary C is that if the dimension of fiber is two and we assume strongly irregular, then we can say that all fibers are automatically Q Reinstein. So we can press LM B. So this is the y-corral C. Is a bicor RC also okay. Okay, so this is our three main results. And from now on, so I will consider a strategy for CRMA. So we focus on CRMA. So for the proof of theorem A, so the most important point is the following theorem, which is just said by, just called by in Bajava junction. Okay. So let us consider metanormal complete rocker ring over. Complete recurring of mixed characteristics. Okay. And let us also consider regular sequence. Okay, so we assume that the quotient of R by this regular sequence to be normal and positive characteristic and exp okay, in this case. Okay, in this case, so we can say that R is log canonical. So, this is our CRM D okay so such yeah so it's very well known strategy why CRM D implies CRM A, but I will give some sketch. I will give some sketch for this point. Okay, so let us consider the situation in cell MA and take some point of generic fiber. So, since chi is proper over T, we can find some point of the special fiber such that such is that why is a specialization of X okay okay so in this case we apply CO remedy for the completion of the stock at Y okay so since in CLMA we assume that the fiber special A we assume that the fiber special fiber is expira, we can use this CRM D because this assumption is okay. So we conclude that R is row canonical by CRM D, but R is this ring. So we can conclude that the total space is row canonical at Y. And since Y is a specialization of X, Of x because the total space is also canonical at x. Okay, and total space and generic five bytes has the same stokes. So the generic quives also LC at the point. Okay, so this is proof. So which says that so CRMD is the key point of the CRM A. CRMA. Okay, so I will focus on the strategy of the proof of CLMD. So okay. For the proof of CRMD, we use three areas which plays an important role in the proof. So the first key item is the multiplier. Okay, so I don't recall the definition of multiplayer idea, but the important point is that so multi-player idea is an idea which characterizes the KLT singularities. Okay, so that is so normal variety X is KLT if and only if the multiplier is trivial. So, this is called multiple idea. So, this is one of the important points of multiple ideas. And the second key item is defined in positive characteristic, which is test OEDR, which characterizes strong regularity. Regregularity that is so X is a strong rehregularity, strong rehregular if and only if D C D R is trivial. And the third one is the grass test area which characterizes. Which characterizes Sprinter. Okay, so because of time, so I can't record the definition of GZDRs, but so I will explain how to use GZDRs. Okay, so. Okay, so okay, so in order to prove CRMD, so there are several key properties for GZDRS, which I will explain from now. Okay, so the first key properties is about Last key properties is about a marriage program. Okay, which sets that the multiplier here is larger than y equal to the process to Elijah. The process to here. Okay, so this is the first key property. Okay, so more precisely, let us consider some neta normal complete local ring with received characteristic P, and we assume that R is Q Einstein. In this case, so Still, in this case, so we can say that the first test idea is contained in multiplayer ideas. Okay, so this is essentially proving this paper, but so one of the So one of the important points is that the accelerated integral closure is BCM in this situation, B co-McORER algebra. So BCM implies some function of local cohomologies. Anything called homologies so we can prove this containment. Okay, so this is proved by this paper. And the second key property says that which is called distribution theorem, which says that so tau plus over some hypersurface is contained in the tau plus over original space. More precisely, let the as Precisely, data as consider RM as a bug and consider some hyper surface R over H. Then we have containment like this. So, the image of the processed layer of total space contains Space contains the procedure of prostidial hypersurface. So, this is the proof is also essentially proved in here. And one more important thing is the fact that R plus is BCM. Okay, so this is important. important point and actually so mashu is fact which proves that so uh so this fact like this this fact is actually proved combined proved by the combination of these two properties because multiplier ideal characterizes kissing realities. KRT singularities and cluster characterizes strongly Heregra. So if characteristic of X is P okay, so this is also defined in positive characteristic, but in this case, so it corresponds to that classical test radio. Crash character studio. So, this also classifies, this also characterizes strong irregularity. Okay, so this is a strategy of mass read. But so, our CRMA or CRMD, so this is so we need one more ideas because so this area results. This area result does not characterize LC or HPR. So we need some idea which is this three and four. Okay, so the third property says that if X is expure. If X is expure, then the test area is not so small. So this is the third point of the proof. And the fourth point of the important point of proof is if X is not local canonical, then the multiple area is sufficiently small. More okay, so this is the first point of the proof. Okay, so very uh rough sketch of Cell Ramad So in Cell Ramadi, So, in CRMD, we assume that S is HPR. So, by using the third property, which says that if X is HPR, then the test leader is not so small. So, this is not so small. Okay, but in positive characteristics, the test area is just a first test idea. So, by using the second property, which says that tau paras of a hyper surface is contained in the tauplas of original space. So, by applying this, so we can say that this EDR is larger than I called this EDR in some sense. In some sense. So, which very roughly speaking, this cluster CDL is also not so small. Okay. And then we use a containment of cluster and multiplier area, which says that this is larger than this area. So, of course, multiplier area is also not so small. But we But which is a contradiction to this if we assume X is not log canonical. So, which concludes that R should be log canonical. Okay, so this is very large sketch of our CRMT. Okay, so in the last of our talk, my talk, so I will give more concrete statement of these properties. So I will explain what is not so small and what is sufficiently small. So the key point is the iteration of The iteration of test ideas. Okay, so let us consider some net anomal recurring of positive characteristic. Okay, so okay, so our demo says that if R is F pure, then J exists some area J which satisfies this property. Satisfies this property. Okay, so I don't define the test area today, but the test area is also defined for pairs. So this is just pairs of dingon. Here's our link and ER with some index. Okay. So this is our lemma three. So why this condition? So we say that test area is not so small by this condition. So I will explain about this. So, if we use this lemma, so we can observe this phenomenon. So, by this lemma, so for any such sequence of their numbers, and let us consider the sequence of ideas by so defined by this formula. So, J0 is defined by is defined by tau test radial over R and J one is test radial over the pair like this and J is this are like this okay and we are inductively define the sequence of EDR J0 J1 J0 okay so in this case so it is easy to check that this is a descending Check that this is a descending sequence of videos. Okay, but by using lemma 3, so we can say that if R is X pure, then this J n always contains the EDR defined in demos 3. Okay, so actually so. So, actually, so in particular, so in this case, this intersection of this sequence is not zero. So, this is why I said that stadium is not so small. So, this is our number three. Okay, and finally, I will explain about lemma four. So it explains that if x is not loganonical, then multiplier ideal is sufficiently small. Okay. So which says that? So if x is not or canonical, then there is a sequence of real numbers such as that. That the intersection of I n is zero, where i n is defined by the following sequence. So I0 is the multiplier area and I one is the pair of is a pair of multiply multiply ideas pair and inductively we define like this okay and similarly we obtain we obtain some descending chain But if x is not canonical, then this sequence goes to zero. So this is why I said y the multiple idea is sufficiently small. Okay, so this is our MFO. Okay, so actually, so by combining these results, so we can do something. We can do something like this, and then theorem D is okay. Okay, so this is a strategy to prove our theorem A. And because of time, so I don't explain the strategy of theorem B, but so okay, so this is also as a fruitful. This is also as a proof of this is also maybe interesting, but so okay, so I finish my talk at all here. So thank you very much for your listening. Okay, thank you. Yes, why did I watch that? Hi, so I have a can you hear me? Yes. Okay, great. So if I remember correctly, you have some assumption that your base T. Some assumption that your base T is regular? Yes. So I wonder how crucial is this? And like what I'm thinking is if I want to apply your algorithm and my equations have, for example, all the coefficients are integers, but there's some like square root of five. The natural choice for t is the adjoint square. Ah sorry adjoint square sorry so you you said t yeah some sometimes the natural choice for t is like z adjoint square root of five aha ha ha ah sorry yes how how do you get around this situation uh so actually so Actually, so the regularities are essential in our proof, but but of course, so for example, so we can we can say that, so for example, maybe this. Maybe this is conjecture, but so for example, so I think if how to say, so actually, so I don't think in this case, so this is not this is not normal. This is not normal, so because this is the one-dimensional, so in such situation it's difficult to treat. So but so it is also natural to so another philosophy is that so So, the base scheme has mild singularities, and the F is the similar singularities, then the total space has also the similar property. So So, so such a situation sometimes occurs. So, some natural assumptions for T is something like strong irregularity was such mild singularity. So, sorry. So, okay, yeah, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Are there any other questions? Does anybody on Zoom have questions? If you do, just unmute yourself. There's no further questions. Okay, then let's. Okay, then let's thank the speaker again.
