Is this good? So this project started out in 2019 before COVID when I first started as a graduate student at Los Alamos National Lab working on my PhD in computational biology. And so this project started out led by Hershini Mukandun and Jean Fair at the lab. And it was a clinical study. And it was a clinical study where I actually helped with the swabbing patients. So, patients would walk into the walking clinic feeling terrible and having symptoms of the influenza-like illness. And we would say, would you like to participate in a study while they were feeling bad? And some of them said yes, and then we could swab their noses. And the clinical part of the study was that they were sequencing. They were sequencing to find out what was present when the people had symptoms of influenza-like illness. And thank goodness, I was asked to lead the modeling part of the study, which confirmed that I made a really good decision to go into research and not to become a medical doctor. So let's see. Let's go to the next. The next slide. So, this Venn diagram illustrates how the symptoms of three example ILI viruses overlap, and from their symptoms, they can be difficult to distinguish. Influenza-like illness is defined by the CDC as a fever of at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 37.8 Celsius. 7.8 Celsius and a cough and/or a sore throat, but it can involve other symptoms. ILINET monitors visits for this ILI cluster of symptoms, so it captures visits due to any respiratory pathogen that presents with these symptoms. In the United States alone, pre-COVID ILI affected 9 to 49 million people a year. However, there have been only However, there have been only about 400 labs dedicated to culturing the clinical samples. So, a relatively small sample of total ILI is traditionally identified as specific pathogens. So during the last 20 years, 23% to 43% of reported ILI has been some strain of influenza virus. Some strain of influenza virus, yet ILI is often equated with influenza and the flu, as probably you've found out if you talk to your non-scientific family members. So why is this a problem? I developed a list of why this is a problem. Public lack of awareness of the many viruses that cause flu-like symptoms can lead to insufficient healthcare seeking behavior, lack of systematic sampling of a broad Of systematic sampling of a broad range of viral pathogens can obscure health care provider awareness, leading to potential misdiagnoses. And we saw that, we actually saw this when the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was first starting up, that people came in with influenza-like illness symptoms, and it was difficult to tell what they had. So, also the widespread incorrect Widespread incorrect impression. I surveyed all of my family members and they all said this: that the flu shot was effective against most or all influenza-like illness. This can create confusion, public confusion about vaccine effectiveness. So this is kind of a, has been a thread during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic that there's There's kind of a gap between what the scientists are doing and public messaging and public trust in science. So not everyone, but in some cases, public trust in science. So I do think it's important to address these things. So a perceived lack of need to differentiate ILI results in decreased accuracy of mechanistic and statistical modeling and pay and And Pei and Shaman 2020 just recently came out with a really nice paper demonstrating that they can increase their forecasting accuracy by disaggregating ILI. So, and then treating ILI as a cluster of symptoms without identifying underlying pathogens can, as we've seen, historically contribute to over-prescription of antibiotics. Of antibiotics. So there are a lot of problems, and I think I am singing to the choir here in trying to motivate increased testing and increased surveillance and increased granularity of knowledge of what is going on with influenza-like illness. So, one example of this problem is Of this problem is you have an infant under two months of age who's irritable, decreased feeding, possibly breathing more rapidly. And what do the parents do? Do you assume that it's a cold or a flu and keep them home to recover at home and let it run its course, as people often say? Or do you consider that it may be something more serious? That it may be something more serious that needs a visit to the doctor to at least find out what it is and possible hospitalization. So, those symptoms and an infant under two months could easily be rhinovirus, which wouldn't be that dangerous, or it could easily be RSP, which could require hospitalization. So, that's just one example of why it's important to distinguish what's going on. It's important to distinguish what's going on with ILI, and it's really just the tip of the iceberg. So we chose the pathogens to model on the basis of the available literature and the outcomes of the parallel clinical study in Los Alamos. The first five were the ones that were sequenced. were the ones that were sequenced. And then we added SARS and MERS considered as a group, just to provide a contrast between seasonal viruses and things that historically had emerged as novel zoonoses. So this is a standard mechanistic SEI. Standard mechanistic SEIR system of ordinary differential equations, exactly the type of mechanistic model that Odo referred to yesterday. And our intention was to use the simplest possible model that could apply generally to many respiratory pathogens. So the only things to really point out here, everyone here is familiar with these models, is that I1 is a pre-symptomatic compartment. Compartment. And then there's a split where some people develop mild symptoms, they go into I2 and then recover from there. And then some people develop more serious symptoms, become hospitalized, and then either recover or die. And then we're assuming that all the people with mild symptoms recover, and we're assuming that the people who are hospitalized either recover or die. To either recover or die. So we applied this model separately to the individual viruses and then parameterized for our numerical simulations. We parameterized each virus from the published studies and simulated separate epidemics during a hypothetical flu season. And I'll talk more about that in. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And then everyone here will be familiar with this type of system of ordinary differential equations. And I just wanted to point out that it's the pre-symptomatic and the mildly symptomatic and hospitalized categories that are interacting with a susceptible population to produce infections. And then that little C is a reduction in transmission of 25% that we assumed for people who are hospitalized. And then, but given our recent experience with the nosocomial infections in institutional settings, I'm not sure that's a good assumption. Now, so. We derived our not using the next generation method. And then the algebraic rearrangement below shows that RNOT for this symptom, this system is a combination of the transmission that takes place in the pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and hospitalized compartments, which is what we expect. But it's nice just to see that that intuitively bears out. And I should point out that we solved for beta and then plugged in the mean parameter values from the literature in order to back out the beta values using this derived equation for R naught. And then I should also say that this really should be R effective, but But given that R0 is what was reported in most of the literature that we surveyed, we stuck with R0, even though for these diseases, it is not a naive population and there is background immunity going on. So, and then this is just A graphic representation of the parameter values that we found in the literature. And a couple of things: so, caveats for these values are that these 104 studies all took place in different geographic regions of the world. They took place in different settings. For example, some of them were in prison, some of them were. Some of them were in prison, some of them were in hospitals, some of them were in clinical settings, and they had different study designs, they took place at different times of year, and then all of these pathogens are continuously evolving, which goes without saying. So a couple of things that stand out is that the incubation periods of Adenovirus and SARS-MERS considered as a group are pretty low. Considered as a group, are pretty long compared to the other viruses that we looked at. And then the infectious period of the SARS-MERS group is 28 days. The mean is 28 days, more than double the mean infectious period of any of the other viruses we looked at. And this is just, this table highlights the contrast in the It's the contrast in the historic parameter values between the seasonal coronaviruses, OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63 on the one hand. Those are the seasonal ones, and SARS-MERS considered as a group. And you can refer to the paper to look more closely at this. So here. So, here is our simulation of these five. So, on the left-hand side, five common seasonal ILI viruses. And so what we did is we decided to simulate a hypothetical flu season. We started everyone at October 1st with one infection, and then all the viruses act independently. And so, And so in this sort of virtual world, RSV in yellow peaks first in December, influenza in blue peaks last in March. And below that, the stacked bar chart shows the relative proportional contributions to influenza-like illness. So noting that the total contributions represent a subset of ILI and not like And not like all ILI. So you can see that it's just the main point is this changes a lot during the season. And it would be great to be aware of exactly what is going on under the hood here. RSV in yellow dominates in December in this example, and influenza in blue dominates in March. And then on the right-hand side, for contrast, We added the SARS-MERS group, and as you can see, it's looking like a pretty big peak compared to the other seasonal viruses. And then in the proportions below, you can see that in February and March, SARSMERS would have, in this simulation, dominated the mix. So, we did a global sensitivity analysis, and there are a million plots, but these sample plots show that the epidemic peak timing is sensitive to transmission rates. And please note the y-axis are on different scales for seasonal coronaviruses on the left and the SARS-MERS group on the right. And this is what we expect: transmission rates are tightly constrained for all. Are tightly constrained for all the respiratory viruses we modeled. And it does confirm, although it's stating the obvious, that mitigations like masks and distancing, which directly affect the transmission rate, are likely to succeed to flatten the curve of almost any respiratory virus. So, the implications for pandemic and outbreak preparedness are that more systematic, standardized surveillance of individual viruses underlying influenza-like illness would enable earlier detection of zoonotic spillover events. So, if we had just more data, more testing, I've talked mostly about I've talked mostly about clinical testing, but wastewater surveillance is a thing that's happening widely all over the world and would be wonderful to have in place so that we can get a metagenomic baseline. We can understand basically, oops, sorry, hitting the microphone. We can have an understanding of what is basically there. And so it's a lot easier to notice an anomaly and when something new shows up. And when something new shows up, and we can notice it more quickly. More systematic, standardized surveillance of individual viruses underlying ILI would enable earlier detection of expanding ranges of pathogens. So it's not only new zoonotic spillovers that we need to have awareness of, it's also with climate change, pathogens, many different types of pathogens are changing. Are changing their traditional areas where they're endemic. And that is, I'm participating in a giant review of climate and infectious diseases, which is very interesting because everything is just changing so much right now. And if we had a better awareness of what's going on right now, then we can. Then we could see, for example, what the risk is of diseases that have traditionally been tropical expanding into the southern United States, just as one example. So more data on differences between key epidemiological parameters of pathogens underlying ILI would support early decisions on what to measure in an outbreak. On what to measure in an outbreak of disease X. So, for example, those early days when we knew that we had a virus that had never been seen before by the human immune system and we weren't sure how to model it, we can, with better knowledge of what's going on and the mix, we can zoom in on. Well, I guess people really did, and we already knew this, but um. Knew this, but we can have better resolution on what to measure since every day counts. So, and then the last point, disaggregation of ILI would inform more accurate mechanistic and statistic modeling, which I guess kind of is also stating the obvious.
