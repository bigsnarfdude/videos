And getting lovely weather for us. So, this is work that I've done with Robert Juan and with James Jay, and it's on the archive. And so, as James kind of indicated, he likes numbers, numbers that will tell you things about various objects. And so, these are numbers associated to complexes of modules. And so, and I'll be talking. And so, and I'll be talking briefly about all five of them. The first two, Tora regularity and Casanova-Mumford regularity, were studied for commutative rings that have proved useful there. The last three are ones that we have defined in the context of non-commutative rings, but of course they can also be used for commutative rings. So, the idea, so first of all, the context. So, we have a field and a connected integrated in the theory of k. Connected and graded in the theory of K algebra. And throughout, we're assuming, and this is an important assumption, the existence of a balanced dualizing complex that makes a lot of the things possible. So then the idea is when you have a complex of modules, there are two gratings on it. There's an internal grading of the modules themselves, but then there are also various homological gradings. And so the interplay between these two gratings often is reflected. Often is reflected in the properties of the algebra. And that's the idea that we're trying to capture. So, kind of the canonical example is the Kazool property. So, an algebra is Kazul exactly if the trivial module has a minimum pre-graded resolution of the following form, where basically the degree of each of those modules is the same as the homological degree. homological degree. So the internal degree, so that would be the, in this case, it's the degree of the module coming from the grading on the algebra. That's the J. And in this case, the homological degree is the degree of the Tor that you're looking at. And the Kuzul property is exactly equivalent to those degrees being equal. So from that, and again, this was the definition in the commutative case, but both Jorgen said. Case, but both Jorgensen and then later Deng and Wu considered this in the non-community case. And so they define the torregularity of a complex, or you could just think of a module as being a complex, as the supremum of the difference of those two degrees. So that turns out always to be bigger than or equal to zero, and it's equal to zero exactly when it's Kazul. So here we have a number telling us some property of the algebra. Property of the algebra. And so, what it's measuring is measuring the growth of the degrees of the generators in that minimal free graded resolution of the module, of the trivial module, in general, of the resolution of the complex. So, in the commutative case, so if you're looking at the trivial module, that core regularity has only two values. It's either zero or it's infinite. So, this number is only telling you one thing, whether it's Kazool or not. But what I'm about to show by an example is in the non-computative case, it can take on any value, any integer value. And so, in some sense, you're getting more information about how close this algebra is to being Kazul. So, my example is, and so this is sort of where some of the examples come. Where some of the examples come. I mean, in the commutative case, you just have a Kazoolet Scheltzer regular algebra. You just have the polynomial ring. But in the non-commutative world, we have non-Kazoole algebras, and they start to have different values of these numbers. So if I take one of dimension 3 that's not Kazoole, like a graded down hub algebra, so these are all the values of tor, each torr, and so on. And so then if you subtract, 0 minus. If you subtract 0 minus 0, 1 minus 1, 3 minus 2, 4 minus 1, minus infinity minus 3, and take the max, it's 1. So now I have a value of torr that's not 0 or infinity, it's 1. This is maybe indicating it's close to being Kazul. In fact, this is 3 Kazul. But then I can get an arbitrary number by tensoring this with any algebra A that's finitely generated commutative. Finally generated commutative Kazoole, but not regular. So that allows me to get any n. So now this invariant that in the commutative case could only be 0 or infinity has other values. So that's the first, the tor irregularity. So then you can look at other derived functors as well and look at what's happening to their homological degree and internal degree. So this deals with the local coherence. So, this deals with the local cohomology, which is defined like this. Again, this was done in the commutative case. Jergenson Dong Wu extended it, looked at what happens in the non-commutative case. Here you're taking the sum of the, again, the internal degree and this homological degree, this time coming from the local cohomology module. So, this is maybe not as easy to compute in general, but this local cohomology is. In general, but this local cohomology is not always that easy to compute. But one example is if you have a finite-dimensional module, this local cohomology of the module, I should say, the C of regularity of the module is actually the degree of the module, if you have a finite dimensional module. So maybe that gives you some idea of a value of it. Moreover, if I have something that's, again, Artenschelta regular of type, so D is the global dimension and L is the The global dimension and L is this shift of K in this last X that's not zero. The local cohomology has been computed at zero for every I that's not at the global dimension. And at the last one, it's the dual shifted by L. And so that if you compute this max, most things are zero, it's just going to be this d minus L. And the D is the global dimension, and the L. The global dimension and the L, which is the shift of the last x, but you can also think of it as the degree of the Hilbert series. And so, for example, if I've got a commutative polynomial ring and d indeterminates, the global dimension is d, this is the Hilbert series, and its degree is minus d. And so the C im regularity is zero of a commutative power homelog. But if I take my non-Kazoole AS regular, Non-Kazoole AS regular algebra of dimension 3, the L there is 4. And by the shift, it's going to be in a negative degree. And so now the C irregularity of, again, a regular ring, but not Kazul, is minus 1. We get some different values than you get for commuted polynomial rings. So why do we care about this? I mean, as I said, James likes numbers, but we were also trying to find bounds. We were also trying to find bounds on degrees of the minimal set of generators in an invariant ring. And so we were looking at some work of Simons, who about 10 years ago actually solved the problem for characteristic P in the modular case. And so he made heavy use of this Casa-Nuova mumford regularity. And so that's how we got interested in it. And so with it, In it. And so, with it, we were able to get some bound, but not always. I mean, we were missing an ingredient that the commutative case always has. So that's a finite map. So if I'm looking at F, if I have a gradient algebra map from T to F, we say it's finite if F is a finitely generated module on either side. So what we suppose, again, So, what we suppose, again, we're trying to say something about this ring of invariance in our context. If we have a finite map from an Ethereum AS regular algebra, then we get bounds on these degrees coming from the difference of these two CM regularities. Now, as I say, in the commutative case, the invariants are commutative, so you always have a commutative algebra mapping onto it. Mapping onto it. And you also, by nerdonormalization, have a subarray over which it's finitely generated. So the community, they have these actual finite maps and these S's. But of course, we don't know that we have these all the time. But when we do, we can use this bound. And a lot of times, I mean, for example, if the invariants are commutative, we have such a bound. And then this customer of the Mufford regularity gives us. Mump for regularity gives us some idea of a bound on the ring of generators. So that's what sort of motivated this trip. Did you go back with your page? Yeah, I didn't go into detail. It's our usual context where A is an Art and Shelter regular algebra and H is a semi-simple opt algebra. I'm just looking at the invariance. Okay, so Okay, so in the commutative case, which, as I'm saying, is nicer when you've got polynomial rings, you have these two regularities, this Tor regularity and the CM regularity. And the nice thing is that they are related. And so in particular, they're the same for any finitely generated T module. So that's a lovely result because it gives you two different ways of looking at the same number. You know, sometimes it's a tor. You know, sometimes the Tor way is easier to look at, sometimes the other way was easier for them to look at. So that gives them a lot of properties, which unfortunately we don't have. So just again, if I go back to my non-Kazoole AS regular ring of dimension 3, kind of the first regular ring that's not Kazoole. So the Tor regularity, which we showed back on the other slide, was one. This is a finite dimension. One, this is a finite-dimensional module in degree zero, so its CM regularity is going to be zero. So it's not the same anymore. So we don't have these, it's actually measuring slightly different things. And in fact, what Jorgensen and Deng Wu basically show, so again, if you have a balanced dualizing complex, a connected, graded algebra, and so first of all, if it's Kazoole-AS regular, like Kazool AS regular, like the polynomial ring is, then you get this equality. But kind of even more surprisingly, this actually characterizes it. If these are equal for all finitely generated modules, the algebra has to be Kazool and has to be A is regular. So it actually, that's the only time it's going to work. In the commutative case, another nice property is that the CM regularity is always. That the CM regularity is always finite for finitely generated modules. And that's not the case if you don't have a balanced dualizing complex. And so, for example, in this ring that has lots of other properties that Rogowski and Susiera created. So it's actually an Ethereum syllable. Okay, so we have these things both in the community. Things both in the commutative case that were defined before, the C im regularity and the torr regularity. And I just computed it for the C irregularity. I did an example with the Tor regularity where it was the opposite, but in fact it's always the opposite. So these are negatives of each other. And so what that suggested, that I'm sorry, when I have an Art and Schultz regular algebra, they're negatives of each other. So that suggested. Each other. So that suggested adding them together and getting a new invariant, which we call the Art and Schelta regularity. We called it that because when the algebra is Art and Schelta regular, this invariant is zero. And so in fact, we are able to show the opposite. So first of all, this Art and Schelter regular rarity can be any value, again, an integer value. Again, an integer value. And then extending this very nice result of Juergensen and Deng Wu that sort of characterizes the Art-Schelta regular Kazul algebras to the non-Kazul case. We were able to show, again, when we have a balanced dualizing complex, this ring is Art and Schelter regular exactly when this A S regularity is zero. So this A S regularity is measuring how close you are. Is like measuring how close you are to being Hart and Shelton regulars, sort of the way we think of it. Just like the Torah regularities tell you how close you are to being Sewell. So, Ellen, so I guess the balance dualized and complex conditions sort of come into play in terms of replacing the regularity? No, it's being able to sort of use some of the commutative techniques. I mean, it's a technical. But earlier, you had already someone. An earlier satellite, you have that if it's AS regular, then the AS regularity is zero, right? And then he has a. Oh, that I see. So that is true. That is true. Yeah. So that. Yeah, it's per negative. Okay, okay, good. So it'll have a balanced dualizing complex. But if I just have a graded algebra, if I don't know it has a balanced dualizing complex, we don't know whether this will be. We don't know whether this would be true. I see, I see. And we know, just like from the example I had earlier, that things can start to fail when I don't have it. Okay, so this is the AS regularity. And so now down my list, the next thing is something we call concavity. And so I mentioned this idea of finite maps. I mean, as we look at the commutative cases, they often Look at the commutative cases, they often use the fact that you have a commutative ring mapping onto it, or a commutative subring, or polynomial ring, I should say, not just a commutative ring, a nice regular ring, which we don't always know we have. But sometimes we do, and sometimes we have many choices for what that might be. So what we do is we define this set of all of these connected, gradient, Ethereum, and Art and Schelter regular rings, you know, that are sort of replacing the commutative polynomial ring. Commutative polynomial ring when you have it, where there is a finite map from G to A. So look at the set of all such things and then work over that. So then the concavity, and this is related to this C regularity, but in fact you can do it for any of our regularities and you can just say, look at it over all of the finite, this set of finite maps. But this is the one we looked most at, so just the concavity where you where you Where you look at the CM regularity, actually the negative of it, since it's usually negative. In fact, this will be positive when I've got our Schultz irregular algebra. So look at the inf of that. And so then if you're looking at just the irregular algebra itself, this concavity will be zero exactly what it's Kazul. So, why do we call it concavity? So, we've sort of imagined spec to be some kind of non-commutative space associated to the algebra, and which is flat, or sort of linear, when T is Kazura. And so, then if you have a finite map going from T1 to T2, you'd expect the specs to go the other way. And so, then the And so then the concavity does go the other way. So when I have a finite map from T1 to T2, the concavity goes this way. So that, and this is in fact true, when this T1 is Kazul, then this is Kazool. And so in some sense, the concavity is measuring how far this non-commutative space is from being flat or Kazoole. That's sort of the reason we use the word concavity. That's sort of the reason we use the word control. So one application of this idea is the following. So here my setting is kind of our usual setting, semi-simple Huff algebra acting on Ethereum AS regular algebra T homogeneously and looking at the invariant rate. So then we were able to show that this concavity is an upper bound on this. Is an upper bound on this beta of r, which is again this maximal set of minimal generators. How far out you have to get in degree in order to get a set of generators minus one. And so then you can create examples like this one where we can show this cannot be a fixed ring. That's the idea. So if I take A to B, this is just a commutative polynomial ring where the Xi's have degree 1, the T is a bigger degree, bigger than or equal to 2, so that this is a graded alpha. So that this is a graded algebra, and f is an irreducible polynomial. So then this concavity is 0 because A is actually commutative. So there wouldn't be a commutative thing mapping onto it. 0 is less than 1, which will be less than or equal to this degree of t minus 1, which is this beta of a minus 1. And so that contradicts this inequality that holds if it is a fixed tree. If it is a fixed tree. So, again, sort of computing a number tells us that this cannot be a fixed tree. Again, an Art and Schelter algebra acted upon by a finite-dimensional semi-simple alpha. So, in more recent work, so this paper is also on the archive. So, these invariants that I've looked at, they're linear combinations of these two degrees, but they're like Degrees, but they're like you know, the sum of them or the difference of them. But there's sort of no reason you can't take any linear combination. And that's what we've done here. So, to start with, you need a notion of degree that by psi actually weights each one of these degrees. And this is in the prohomology of this complex. And so, for example, if you have one zero. And so, for example, if you have one, zero, that's just the degree of the complex, and zero, one is what's the soup of the complex. And so then we can look at these weighted degrees for any one of these derived functors, for the greater tensor product or for the derived functor of the torsion functor. And just again, when this is not, when it's zero, you have to be a little more careful. You have to be a little more careful. When it's not zero, it's just, again, instead of just looking at the difference, the torregularity was where both of those were one. But now you can look at any weights on them. So these are like weighted linear combinations of these homological and internal degrees. And we could do this in either case. And so, one of the things we were able to show is. Things we were able to show is again: if we have a finite map, then there is actually a constant such that for all C's bigger than that constant, this weight 1C, the tor regularity is finite for any bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology of graded A modules. And so, if A is a commutative graded algebra, Commutative graded algebra, there actually always exists some weight such as this torr, this weighted tor is finite. Remember, I said in the commutative case, it's either one or infinity, but now we're showing that there actually is some weight where it has to be finite. And so from that, we were able to show actually give another proof of a result of Mumford that says if you've got something generated in degree one, Something generated in degree one, and you have a finite map where T is an Ethereum connected grade at a finite global dimension, then for some D sufficiently large, the Ferenese is casual, using the fact that you have some weight so that it's finite. Thank you. Any questions? Yes. So, what is you said that the AS regularity is A for AS regular algebra, but and for, I guess Kazoole AS regular algebra chart, that's what you I'm wondering. Yeah, so no, the AS regularity is zero exactly when it's A S regular. Right. A is regular. Right. Do you need do you need to? You don't need to it's a okay. Okay. Um but then you mentioned for Eisenberg-GoTotal like um to work, you just haven't established the theorem for like um a commutative polynomial ring. Right. I guess what I'm wondering is, do you know what the AS regular ring looks like for not AS regular commutative rings? Like, is that like something that is studying for? Yeah, no, I don't. Yeah. I mean, and there's all kinds of questions. I mean, and there's all kinds of questions that you could ask. I mean, one time I gave this talk, and Jason asked, what about, so if, so, what does the AS regularity do to or extensions? Like polynomial ring over a ring? Does it go up by one? I mean, we don't know. Kind of shouldn't change how it gets ringed. I mean, so there's all kinds of things you could ask. I mean, in theater or not, Yes. So a lot of your measured to measure how far a ring is from being best measurements of how far a ring is from being. Other Kazoo properties? So I guess I don't know off the top of my head. I mean the one example I have is three Kazoo and it's one. Yeah, because I guess are there other questions? Are there questions online in Zoom? Art and shelter invariant is always non-negative in nature? Um I yeah, I believe I said it's always got to be bigger than or equal to zero. Is there an obvious way to see that or is it uh good about that? So I mean I think it's well I guess that maybe it's not totally obvious. All right, so it's not an easy path, let's just say. Yeah, I don't think so. And I should say, we're, I mean, some of what we did was look at, as I said, this very nice result of Jorgensen and Dung Wu and try to look at it in a slightly more general context. But there are some nice ideas in that those papers. That Dung was, I think, have two papers several related to this. A several related to this. Uh anything else or? Well, let's think element again. So we have a coffee break and then we come back.
