Here is you can construct the three-manifold. And what you basically do is you just take the mapping for us of the diffimorphism. So you take the product of the surface with 0, 1, that's some free manifold, and you want to turn it into something closed. So you glue a point on the fiber over 1 with its image on the fiber of a 0. So once you do this, well you have a manifold boundary. You have one torus boundary component for each component of the boundary of S. You have all these fibers that are copies of your surface S. These are called the pages of the open book. You're starting to see the picture. And then what to do to turn it into a closed manifold is you just collapse that boundary. Collapse that boundary. One way to think about this is you gain-filled that boundary with the curve that goes around, well, it looks to be a meridian. But here's another way to say it: you move ys to yt for all s and t in 0, 1, where y is a point in the boundary of the surface. So you're just collapsing this porous down to some. Porus down to some curve or some union of curves in your three manifold. And this union of curves is a non-curve. We call it K. And so not only do you get a closed three-manifold, but you also get a fibered link. And the number of components of the link is the same as the number of boundary components of the surface. And you also get a context. Get a context structure. So, what is a context structure? I won't say too much about this, actually. I'll use the word a lot. But a context structure is a two-plane field, it's a two-plane distribution on the three-manifold, which is totally non-integrable. And what that means is that And what that means is that this two-plane field is not equal to the tangent planes of any embedded surface, not even locally. So it's sort of the opposite of the two-plane field you get coming from a foliation. Nevertheless, context structures are an interesting study on three manifolds. They tell you lots of interesting things about embedded surfaces in three manifolds and other geometric properties of the three manifolds. So you might have heard. So, you might have heard of the Juru correspondence. That's the correspondence between open books and context structures on three manifolds, and one can make that precise. I won't really need that today. But there's a nice paper that appeared on the archive exposing, I guess, this, or expositing this Jew correspondence and proving it. It's not the first paper to do so, but it might be the nicest by the production, if you're interested. So, the reason I like these things is because they give you a way of thinking about three manifolds, knots, context structures, just in terms of a surface and a diffeomorphism of the surface. And it's natural to ask: how are properties of the three-manifold or link or context structure reflected in properties of this surface diffimorphism? This surface diffimorphism. And this is the sort of thinking that I've been doing for a lot of years, and it's been really productive for many different applications. So I want to try to describe some of those. Okay, so let me maybe first elaborate on this sort of dictionary between context structures, for example, and open books. So in contact geometry, there's this fundamental dichotomy between contact structures and over-twisted context structures. I won't really say what that is beyond that context structure is overtwisted if it has a certain Structure is overtwed if it has a certain embedding of the disk. Alright, and these are the more flexible objects. Today contact structures are the more sort of geometrically interesting rigid objects. So the basic question, which I received a lot of interest in the 2010s and earlier, especially, was to understand when a context structure is tight, it's overtwisted. You know, whether there are three manifolds of no-type context structures, that sort of thing. And one property, so one important theorem in this area behind Kazazimadic tells you that, let's say, that a context structure, so a context structure is height if and only if every If and only if every corresponding, every compatible open book is what's called right bearing. So you can sort of think about tightness, this geometric property, in terms of some property of this diffimorism, right-varyingness. So, what does that mean? So, what that means is that, well, we have this surface. My favorite surface. You have some diffeomorphism on the surface. Maybe it's a product of dating twists. Let's take these two curves, call them x and y. So let's let h be dating twist around x followed by a ding twist around y. And given any arc in the surface, you can ask, You can ask, you know, what's its image under the monogram? And in this case, well, if you apply a Dane twist around, say you do a Dane twist around X first, that doesn't affect this part. But then if I look at the image of the sark under the Dane twist about Y, it's moved to the right, so at each end point. So it looks like this. So it starts out as. So it starts out as normal, and then it goes around Y, like this, and comes back to where it started. And if you compare that, if you compare the image to the original arc, what you find is that the image is to the right of the original arc at each endpoint on the boundary. So that's what it means for an open book or a monograph to be right-viewing. It moves each properly embedded arc to the right at every endpoint. That's an important property of diffeomorphism, which is reflected in this property of. In this property of the context structure. So one thing that you can show is that, you know, I should say right gearing means that either each arc is moved to the right at every endpoint, or the arc is fixed by the monitoring. So the identity is actually considered to be right gearing. So every mapping class or its invest is right now. Is that correct? Is that correct? That's no, that's not true. Okay. Right, because if I looked at, for example, do a right-handed dang just here, a left-handed dangerous here, you can show that some marks are moved to the right, some marks move to the left. But you sort of got ahead of me by a little bit. What I wanted to say is that, you know, in this way, well, this provides a solution to the A solution to the word problem in the mapping class script. It's a sort of funny solution to the word problem, which says that, so you know, if you're given the word problem, say you're given some diffimorphism of a surface, maybe written as a product contained to us, you want to tell whether it's the identity, like the trivial element of the group. And so age is the identity. H is the identity if and only if both SH and SH inverse are right here. Which is true if and only if, well, okay. Another way of saying this, actually, given this theorem, is that H is the identity if and only if both of these contact structures are tight. On the one hand, if H is the identity, both of these are tight. On the other hand, if both of these are tight, then both these monotromes are right-hearing, but the only way H and this inverse can be right-hearing is if H is the identity. So this provides some sort of contact geometric solution to the. So, this provides some sort of contact-geometric solution to the word problem. And a question I've wondered about for a while is whether something similar is true in higher dimensions. So, if you take some symphlectic manifold, some symphlectomorphism of that, with some technical conditions, you can define a higher-dimensional open book, which describes a higher-dimensional contact manifold. And you can ask, well, let's suppose that some analog of this criterion you Analog of this criterion, you take some inverse of this sublictomorphism and suppose the associated contact manifolds are both tight in the correct sense. Maybe that means they don't have any over-twisted oranges, whatever those are. The analog of an over-twisted disk. Does that imply that the diffeomorphism or the symplectomorphism is symplectic isotopic to be identical? So, that would be something interesting to think about. Maybe the answer is just obviously no for some. Okay. So. Okay, so I want to say some more about this kind of dictionary, but I need to tell you a little bit more about surface diffeomorphisms. By the way, I said that open books correspond to fibromygm links. This is the open book corresponding to the right-handed trefoil. If I look for the positive data stround X and the negative dust around Y, that would be the grade. Right, so they got raised this. All right, so there is the so-called Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. I'm just part of the notation above, and what it says. And I'll just par with the notation above. And what it says is that any surface homeomorphism H is freely isotopic to one that's either periodic. So, when I say freely isotopic, I mean by an isotopic that's allowed to move points on the boundary. So, in studying monodermies of open books, right, we required that. We required that it's the identity on the boundary. But in free isotopy, you're allowed to move the isotopies which aren't the identity on the boundary. So it's freely isotopic, the one that's either periodic, which means it's some power of it's just the identity, or reducible, which means that it fixes some multi-curve on the surface. Or the only other option is to do an Alsov. Or PA for short. And these are, in some sense, the generic cases. So I'll say more about this. I wanted to quickly mention that if you're looking at fibered knots in the three-sphere, those are the periodic monitor means these are exactly the torus knots. Knots. These are exactly the satellite knots. And these, by Ethereum of Thurston, are precisely the hyperbolic knots. Okay, so that's the dictionary between knots and these kinds of classification of surface homeomorphisms. Right. So let me say a little bit more about what pseudo-NOTs of maps. What Pseudo-Nasov maps are. They're the ones with the most interesting structure in some sense. So, a pseudonym map, it fixes a pair of transverse singular foliations on the surface. Yes. And I'm going to draw a picture of what the foliations look like near a singularity. So there are points. So there are these singular leaves, which mean at some point. And nearby, the rest of the foliation looks sort of like this. So this is maybe what one of the foliations looks like. And I said it fixes up here. And I said it fixes a pair of foliations. The other foliation is transverse to it and looks something like this. And we call these singular leaves, which meet at a singularity, prongs. And so this is a three-prong singularity. Each of the singular filations has three prongs. And in general, in the interior of the surface, singularities will have three or more prongs. Something with only Three or more prongs. Something with only two prongs does not really equal singularity, if you think about it, just a smooth point. And near the boundary of the surface, so if this is the boundary of S, you have this prong behavior as well. And it looks basically the same. So I'll draw maybe a, but there you can have a different phenomenon. You can have also one prong boundary components. So boundary components where the two foliations. The two foliations look something like this. Okay? Are you saying that there exists a pair of transversing linear foliations? Yes. And there's more structure to them as well. I mean, we can make them geodesic. They have transverse measures. And really what the map does is it stretches the transverse measure by some factor in one direction along one of the foliations, it contracts it by the same factor in the other direction. So outside of the singularities, So, outside of the singularities, you have these sort of square-like regions, sort of atlas of squares, and what it does is it just stretches these squares by some number bigger than one in one direction and by one over that number in the other direction. So it's a very nice behavior, which is a little weird near the singular points. Okay? So this gives a nice way of thinking about this right-varyingness of non-atributes. This right varyingness of one attributes. Yeah. Sorry. They just don't look transverse, too. Oh, yeah, maybe I didn't draw them quite transversely in this picture, but yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what? I should have just tried to make the colours. Like it feels like. Can you convince me for a second that it can make them? Like when the method goes out, it feels like it would tend to draw three track things that are true. Can I draw three things that are transverse? Maybe. Is that better? I like that trade. Okay, so if you have a pseudonym of monotromy of an open book, it's freely isotopic to something like this. Okay? And but the actual monodromy fixes the boundary pointwise. So, what you can do is you can look at Is you can look at what happens along the boundary in the free isotopy from your boundary fixing monodromy to a pseudonosov representative. And what's going to have to happen is it's going to have to, well the pseudonosov map sends prongs to prongs, okay? And your monogram refixes the boundary identically. And so what's going to happen in the free isotopy is that Happen in the free isotopy is that there's some rotation around along the boundary. If you have n prongs on the boundary, the free isotopy is going to move the boundary by some k over n. And this is what's called the fractional dangerous coefficient. One of Diana Hubbard's favorite notions. So we'll just think of the, you know, we'll consider the case where there's only one boundary. And so if there are n prongs, so this is denoted maybe C of H, and it's of the form K over M, where N equals the number of boundary prongs. Okay, so some fraction measures the amount of twisting around Of twisting along this boundary component in the free isotopy between the monodromy and its geometric representative, the pseudonosa representative. And H is right-veering if and only if K is bigger than zero, if and only if the fractional dangerous coefficient is a positive fraction. So the twink-daint fractional dangerous coefficient is some sort of quantitative refinement of the notion of right varying. So, the other thing I want to say by way of background is that the number of boundary prongs, so let's say that the boundary of S is connected. Does it mean that boundary prongs here? I'm saying, suppose n is the number of boundary prongs. Oh, if you have to talk about some k over n click. Yeah. K over n click. Yeah. Not necessarily relatively prompt. Not necessarily relatively prompt. It could be, it doesn't have to be. I mean, it could be a full rotation, in which case it's n over n, which is one. Okay, so if you have one, let's say that you have one boundary component, and then what you can show is that n, which is the number of boundary prongs, that's what n will always mean for us, is less than or equal to four times the genus. To four times the genus of s minus two. That's the most it can be. And this is an Euler characteristic argument. Sort of Euler characteristic argument. Okay, so these are the facts that we'll use going forward. And what I'd like to do next is describe some applications related to problems in Dean Surgery. Are there any questions so far? Just making sense. Definition of a Christian coefficient to be able more than one boundary component. Yeah, so then you have one for each boundary component. Yeah. So, you know, one interesting result, by the way, is that if you have one boundary component and the twist coefficient is bigger than one, let's say bigger than or equal to one, it's fine, I think, then your manifesto. It's fine, I think. Then your manifold admits a top foliation, for example. And the corresponding context structure, height, weakness, symplectic, and fillable, all the nice things. Well, some of the nice things. Not necessarily snackable. All right. Okay. So first application that I want to think about is Burke conjecture. Is that what that means from it? Is there like a Git-Stein probable if you have some? Like, can you get sine flowable if you have some sufficiently large fractional? Um, the sufficiently large guarantees sign flowable, not that I know of. So the Bricke conjecture concerns the question of given a not K in the three-sphere, so I'll do it by K of R, R surgery, along K, like Josh did. Um, when is this lens space? When is this a lens space? Or let me just write the question like so. When is surgery I'm not a lens space? So for which dots, for which are? There's this slightly weaker version of this question you can ask, which is: what are This question you can ask, which is what are all the lens spaces you get via surgery on knots? And this is a problem that Josh solved, the so-called lens space realization problem. But it's still open, the question of which knots admit lens-based surgeries. And Berge has a conjecture. Oh, so Berge had a really nice observation. He observed that all W primitive knots Be primitive, not admit one space retrieves. So what the NOT is doubly primitive, what that means, I won't write it down because it's not really going to be important for us, but it means that the NOT lives on the genus 2 Hagert surface in a 3-sphere, so that it represents a primitive element in each handle item. And it's a really And it's a really nice and easy exercise to show in that case that if you do surface frame surgery on that knot, you get a lens space. And then he conjectured that, well, these are exactly monopsical lens space surgeries. That's the very conjecture. These are all. And it's still open. It's one of the And it's still open. It's one of the maybe biggest problems in dainten surgery in three medicals. Okay. So another thing he did is he gave a list, gave an explicit list of W primitive knots classified into form. Classified into 12 families, 12 sort of natural families. It wasn't clear that he listed all W primitive knots. But the list was nice because it's just sort of more explicit. W primitive is a sort of abstract condition. He gives a more explicit way of thinking about the knots. And part of what Josh did in his work is he proved that actually it contains all the doubly primitive knots. So his list is exactly the list of doubly primitive knots. Okay, and so then you know you can sort of look at that list and come up with conjectures. And this is what, for example, Grota and Terragaida did in 2000s. So, you know, there's this question of like, let's say you're not K. There's this question of like, let's say you're not K admit to lens-based surgery. What are the lens-based surgery slopes? And what they did is they noticed that, well, so if you take one of the knots in Brady's list and it's hyperbolic, then there's this bound of R. And that led them to this conjecture. So, if you have a hyperbolic knot and R surgery is a lens space, then R is less than or equal to 4G of K minus 1. Just by looking at the hyperbolic knots on Bergie's list and observing that this is true for those. Okay. And there's a lower bound, too, that was conjectured. And And this is a theorem or this is a conjecture. Oh, sorry, this is conjecture. The GT conjecture. So the GT conjecture is this. And some of the first substantial progress made on this conjecture was by Rasmussen, who proved in a GT paper. GT paper, that you always have this upper bound on R. So this is J. Prassmus, like 2003 or something. And there are lower bounds as well, some of which may be very familiar with floor homology, like R has to be bigger than or equal to 2g minus 1, at least if it's positive. There's a better conjecture than that, but I go to Intergairo, which still Um, but I go to interrogator, which still is open, although Josh has made progress. So, one thing I'll say about this is actually now it is a theorem. The original conjecture about 4g minus 1, this is a theorem, and it follows from work by Ken Baker and Josh and his resolution of the space realization problem. But it takes a lot of work. I mean, that, I don't know, how you measure the difficulty. Know how you measure the difficulty of a proof of making the terms of the number of pages. It's a lot of pages. And what I'd like to show is a simpler proof, just using techniques that were available at the time that Jake Rogers came with. So quickly memorize everything on this. Quickly memorize everything on this and the proof contains several ideas that have been of use in other settings as well. That's why I wanted to sort of demonstrate it. So So let's assume K is hyperbolic. And this is not really due to me. I mean, Steve knows this well. E and Yi has used these things in various papers, but I don't think anyone's actually written down this application, perhaps. So pseudo-K is hydrabolic and R-surgery on K is. Is hyperbolic and R surgery on K is a length space. Then, so one thing we know from fluoromology, so we'll use some input from fluoromology, okay? So maybe it wasn't available at the time of rest. So floromology implies that case fiber. And so K corresponds to some, well, we can think of K in terms of symbol from book, right, where the genus of S is equal to the genus of K. S is a fiber of the vibration. And furthermore, we actually also know that the corresponding context structure, so this corresponds to a context structure, C, and C is type. Okay. So these results are a combination of lots of people, Matt among them, Peter and Zoltan, E.E., perhaps. Okay, and so this implies that H is right here. Right behind it, because that's permanent. Since K is hyperbolic, we know that. Since K is hyperbolic, we know that the monodromy has to be pseudo-NASA. And so it has some number of prongs on the boundary. Let's say that n is the number of boundary prongs. And so we know the refractional data is coefficient. We know the refractional data coefficient. Well, it's k over n, but because the monograph means right veering, k is bigger than zero. Okay? Great. And actually, we know something else. So and in fact, we know that In fact, we know that k is equal to 1. Why do we know that? So, this is a harder result due to Gabbai and Ortel. We didn't state it like this. But the idea is that you have these invariant foliations, singular foliations on the surface. Well, in the mapping torus, you sort of suspend. In the mapping torus, you sort of suspend these invariant foliations, and it turns out that, well, you can extend them to the closed three manifold as laminations, so foliations of some closed subset. And Gabay and Ortel proved that if, well, they showed that if k in this case is bigger than or equal to 2, these laminations are essential. And then they showed that you have essential laminations. And then they showed that you have essential eliminations, you have to have infinite pi 1, universal cover is R3, but that can't happen because this is supposed to be an open book for the 3-sphere. That was a mouthful. But the main thing, yeah. Otherwise, so otherwise, otherwise, because of essential eliminations, you know, why is not the the Y is not diffuser. Okay. Great. So this is some stuff we know off the bat. Now here's a useful proposition. Which is that if key is fiber If k is fibered, and let's say it corresponds to some open book, therefore, so this is an open book for S3, if K is an S3. Well, I can do R surgery on K, and then I can consider the R-fold cyclic cover of that manifold, which in this case is the universal. Which in this case is the universal abelian cover. So then the R-fold cyclic cover of R surgery on K. So let's say that R is some P over Q. It has open book. Does an open book decomposition given by, well, the same surface. And what I do is I take h to the pth power. I look at a boundary d into us, take that to the negative qth power. Okay. So here, delta is meant to be a curve on the surface. Jung. John, can you tell me what the over Q sickly cover it when Q is loaded? Ah, um, right. So I don't mean this, I guess. So keyfold. So usually I'm going to be dealing with integers, so it's not going to matter. But But sorry, integers. Yeah. I always think about integers. Okay. So it's given by just this open book where you've taken h to a power, the pth power, but you have to do negative date twists around the boundary. Now why is that? I mean, if you just think about the not complement, right? So the mapping torus of H. Torus of H. It's easy to understand the P-fold cyclic cover of that. That's given by the mapping torus of H to the P. That's where that comes from. So you just have to be a little bit concerned with what happens near the boundary, which you're Dane filling, right? You're doing p-dane surgery. And I'll leave it as an exercise to show that the covering map extends, but you have to fill the boundary in a way that corresponds to adding. Corresponds to having left-handed dance risks in Q of them. So, this is a nice sort of lemma proposition, whatever. And it's a really just nice elementary exercise in topology and thinking about surgeries and thinking about covers. Okay. So, good. So, we're assuming we're going to use this proposition as a proof. We're going to use this proposition in the proof. This is maybe a bit of an aside, and I will use it. We're assuming that P over Q surgery on K is a lens space. And so in that case, we know that it's the P fold cyclic cover, the P-fold cyclic cover of this lens space is just S3. Right? So in this case, we know that this open book. There's also an open book for S3. And we can think about its fractional dangerous coefficient. And so what happens when you raise the monodromy to a power in terms of the? When you raise the monotromy to a power in terms of the fractional danglist coefficient, if you raise the monotropy to the pth power, it just multiplies the twist coefficient by p. It's the free isotopy goes p times as many times as around. And so that modifies the fractional date twist coefficient. So that's p over n. So we're assuming the twist coefficient of h is 1 over n. So twist coefficient of h is a p is p over n. And then if you do q left, And then if you do Q left-handed gain twist around the boundary, well, you just subtract Q from this. So this is equal to, well, P minus Qn over N. And again, because we know that this open book presents the three-sphere, k can't be this numerous. k can't be, this numerator can't be bigger than 2 in absolute value. And so we have that can't be bigger than or equal to 2 in absolute value by Gabby and Ortell. So this numerator here is less than or equal to 1, which is the same thing as saying that, well, which in particular implies that The distance between well p over q minus n is less than or equal to 1, just by dividing by q. And then we're basically done. So this is our number r. So we have the distance between the surgery slope and n is less than or equal to 1. But remember that n, the number of boundary prongs, is at most 4g minus 2. is at most 4g minus 2. Okay, so the fact that n is less than or equal to 4 times the genus of k minus 2, well, what's the most r could possibly be? Tells you that r is less than or equal to 4 times the genus of k minus 1. That's the proof. Maybe someone followed that. That's the good interrogative conjecture. Is that the Baker Dream proof of the Baker-Dream proof? That's the Baker-Dream proof. Ken Baker proved some prove that if R is bigger than or equal to this, then the knot's gotta be primitive. Gosh, then, well. Then, well, wait, are you saying that that's your proof of the conjecture? The full conjecture? Yeah, that's the shorter proof of the full conjecture. Don't worry. Yeah, thanks. Okay. So you're just looking at properties of the monogramy and their relation to geometry, like essential foliations on the three-manifold and to tie context structures and things like that with the theorem. But it's underneath the hood there's all this relationship with floral fibre and stuff there. Yeah, I mean, you know, you actually don't need the part about the context structure being tight. That was just a shortcut for me in presenting that. You need to know the knot's fiber. And I thought about giving a talk where I I proved that L-space knots are fiber and, you know, via a trick that has nothing to do with the mapping cone formula. That has nothing to do with the mapping tone formula. Because I still fairly understand the mapping tone formula. But no, I went another way. Okay, so one thing I want to mention is the following. So, you know, if you have a Nottino-3-sphere and it's fibered, and you do surgery on it, you can look at the core of the surgery. Okay, so let's say I do an integer surgery and I look at this not K sub N in the N surgeries. This is the core of the surgery, the core of the solid torus that you're gluing in. And if K is fibrant, then this is rationally fibrant. So I won't say exactly what that means, but one thing that's true is if you have a rationally fibrant knot, you also have a contact structure. And so you can ask, is that. Structure. And so you can ask: is that context structure tight? Is it overtwisted? And one thing that Hedden and Clement Esky proved is that if end surgery under knot is, let's say, just for simplicity, lens space, then And the context structure, let's call it C of N, on J of N that corresponds to this rational vibration of the core is tight. So, if you have a knot with the lens space surgery, the natural context structure on that lens space is a tight context structure. But some context structures, some type context structures are better than others. So a context structure is called universally tight if its lift as a universal cover is also tight. And so you can ask, here's a question, when is this context structure universal type? Universal type. So in this case, the universal cover is the three-sphere. So we're asking when the context structure on the lens space lifted to the three-sphere is the unique type context structure in S3. And this has a really nice conjectural answer. Just by looking at what happens for the knots on Bergie's list. That leads you to conjecture what happens. Alright, I like this back part of the bell. What is universally tight? Universally tight means that the lift of the contract structure to the universal cover is tight. Oh. Yeah. In this case, the universal cover, if this is land space, it's just three sphere. Cornwell not answering the question. Cornwell. Okay. So Cornwall answered this question for the knots on Berg's list. The knots on Berge's list. Those may or may not be all knots with lens-based surgeries. So he said, you know, if the Berge conjecture is true, then this context structure you get is universally tight if and only if K is K is the PQ torus naught and N, the surgery, is PQ plus 1. Okay? So that's what I sometimes call the universally typed Riga conjecture. And I just want to show you a different phrasing, an equivalent phrasing of this universally typed RV conjecture in terms of open both. In terms of open books and contact geometry, and that'll end. And so, an equivalent conjecture. So, you know, Key showed that among Bergie knots, this is true. So you're asking, you know, the question is, is it true in general that if Cn is universally tight, then the knot had to be this torus knot, and n must be equals one. That's the universally tight conjecture. So the equivalent conjecture is the following. So, the equivalent conjecture is the following. So, suppose I have an open book, SH, and another open book, SH to the N, together with a negative boundary twist. So, remember, this is an open book for the N fold sticklick cover. Cover of N surgery and the knot, as we discussed in the proposition. And so if this is lens-based, this is S3. So suppose these both represent the tight context structure on S3. Then what the conjecture says is that H is actually equal to Is actually equal to h to the n together with this negative boundary twist. Or equivalently, h to the n minus 1 equals the standard post. So what this would say is that H is a periodic monodroming, right? The nth power is, well, it's a boundary to us, so it's freely isotopic to the identity. Well, it's a boundary to us, so it's freely isotopic to the identity. And this would tell you, you know, for instance, that the knot had to be a torus knot. And it'd have to be a torus knot whose period is n minus 1. So maybe it's not immediately clear why this is conjecturally equivalent, but it is. And so you can just study this conjecture, which is purely in terms of open books and tight context structures. I'll stop there. What's the relationship between type context structure and whether or not you're right-varying? Well, corrections. If the open book represents a tight context structure, then the monogram is right-varying. The converse isn't true, but what is true is that Is that if every open book compatible with the context structure has right-varying monotroming, then sorry, if every open book compatible with the context structure is right-varying, then the context structure is tight. So it's not really a condition you can check. You can't check whether every open book, there are infinitely many, for a given context structure, is right varying. Or two minus one certain thing, we get a lot of space. Yeah, I thought I just can't remember what I thought. This, um, yeah, let's see. If this happens, um, exactly, minus 237 pretzel. Um, go ahead. Your classification of these surgeries and the effort of which genome crash. FOR which genocide occur, the proper bound is plus 4g minus 1 with a quality of rate, so it matches at 19, I think. Let's play surgery on minus 237. But I think this is probably the only probably the only quality for hyperbolic moths. Might be a founder of Taurus moths where it matches as well. I knew that in my head, by the way, there was a paper on its way to it. Some of it was discussed this morning that I told you about at lunch. I don't understand this conjecture. I don't that then I don't know. What you want? I mean, you have this if you have this, then you have this if and only if, but can I make sense?  I'm happy to keep going.
