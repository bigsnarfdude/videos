So Thomas Bouquier from Universit√© Paris-Anclais is going to talk about something. The Northman of the TV for NOMAPS. Thank you very much. So thank you for the invitation. I'm very happy to be here and to see in person. You can do something better. You can do something backwards. Okay, so I will start with a motivation. And the motivation will be a combination of two results. One by Matt Becker, which is discussing dynamics of rational maths over functional tiers, and one by Laura de Marco, which is discussing dynamics of mood. Dynamics of movement points in the families of rational maths. So actually, they are the same result, but okay, this guy is in different forms. So the first one is you take a rational map to make P1 over a field. What would be the field? K will be the field of Meromorphic function on some smooth curve, smooth process curve. And you take F to be of degree at least two. So you don't want it to be an object which is a complex object that you've disguised as an object of a function field. So you have to impose some property. You say that f is isotriple. If so, one way to say it is that for all One way to say it is that for all pair of points in your curve, the specialization are conjugated. Linearly conjugated. Okay. And so the theorem, I met the curve accent, is the following. The following is that if f is non-isotrivial, then there exists a constant epsilon such that the set of points p1k with common height, I will define, recall what is the current height. What is the current? Through smaller than epsilon, it's finite. So here, the canonical height is the function field canonical height defined by Batek on Mondec. So if you take the height of a point, you will look at the limit of one over the head, the degree of else as n of x where you see um quote x okay you can i don't identify it with a meromorphic function see you can look at the corresponding function and you will get okay so imagine the let it smack uh yeah no you can apply the No? You can apply the term. The lattice snaps are okay. Flexible lattice snap is an example of a non-isotrivial family. Rigid lattice naps are isotriple. If you take a family of rigid lattice snaps, rigid, it's an isotriple. Okay, so in particular, one consequence is that the vanishing of this function characterizes the perpetration. So here's the first result. So the second one is a complex family version of this. So instead of looking at one map or a function field, you can look at the map. You can look at the map T1 of C and the curve T1 of C of this time we put it C naught curve C naught because C naught is a quasi projective curve It cannot be compact family of fresh remote cannot be compact without being a micro tree that's what you see and just to say it now. You have to say that the number. Okay? Again, the isotriality definition is the same. And what you are going to study is, so you take X from C not to T1, to be a morphism, and you say that X is stable if this the formula. If the following sequence of polymorphic functions is a number of habitats. So in some sense, you transpose in parameter spaces what you do in the phase space of a given dynamical system. And so this theorem I I do not go in this form, but there are inspired a lot by the theorem of Macquillain and by the theorem of Giard and Fab, which are concerned with the critical code. And it says that if f is known as a trivial, then x is stable. Stable if and only if there exists an n and n such that x of lambda is identical, f lambda m of x of lambda. So if the point x is persistently prepared. Okay, so on the way to prove that this is equivalent This is equivalent to canonical height equal zero when you look at the generic fiber actual family. Okay, so this is a first inspiration. The second one is the proof by Contag, Gauss, Aveger, and Shea of the geometric workbook of contexture. When in a more general setting, they relate the function field high. The function field heights with some vanity or some current. Here you can do some bifurcation measure. We discuss that in a couple of minutes. And these are the two inspirations for this work. So this proof is based on compactness properties, local compactness, the identification scheme. And this proof is based on the remaining evidence and remanuvit and competitive and you have subtle calculations around the generation of your family. So the idea is not to forget completely how they did that, but to build up a different approach where people relate more directly to the problems. So now let's pass to the case of nano mass. So I'm not going to study exactly anymore, but regular polymer automorphisms of the FXK. So here is the setting. So again, you take so to explain this. Again, K will be the field of Meromorphic function. The field of Meromorphic function of a projective curve. And you take f from A2 to A2 to find a fork. You come off this. Put it in the neuronal tomato. And you impose that F will be a regular so meaning that. So meaning that if you extend it as a paranational lab from P2 to P2, then the indeterminacy of F is disjoint. Quickly, as in Patrick's talk, you can define the forward and the height. As in the case of Rachel Max, the limit of 1 over d to pn of d3 of fn of x here is of x a2. So it's a function, let's see. So it took complex functions. And you look just at the degree. It's not And you look just at the degree of time. And you can define the backward canical height in the same way. Okay, and more speaking, what you expect is that again this defect, the proximity of being parallelic, not pre-parallelic, but parallelic. So theoret. There is a third version of this theorem for topwar and nomat, which is the one by fatigue with the Jacobian one. So here there is no focus on the Jacobian. So again you have to assume that F is not so trivial. Then you have the following equivalence. So h plus is 0, this is the same as h minus is 0. This is the same as state. The sum is 0. And this is the same as saying that x is directly for all x will be two of q. Head zero when you look at just the forward dynamic, head zero if you look at just the backward dynamic, head zero if you look at both at the same time, or per density, simple part. Same property. Okay. So this is one way to formulate the result. So actually, we don't work about the function field, but we rather adapt this approach, looking at what happens in families. To do that, we need a a better explanation at this forest format. Awesome. Question. So you're taking the if you're looking at that degree X is an element of what function the and so you're taking its degree and what I mean that was the thing that so you look at a point of the image of this map and you look at generic number of pre images or you're saying you're a point of the curve Curved. Oh, I'm sorry. The previous one. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just too curved. Next. Okay. Okay. So let's turn to five minutes of relax. So here, replace this. And um okay, so I'm studying mark points again. So again what about preperiodic points? Sorry? Pre-periodic points? No, actually it's an automorphism. So a pre-periodic point is necessarily periodic. Yeah, it took me also a while to not do this confusion. Okay. Okay, um so again we'll take P to be a math from C naught to C2 and we're gonna say that P is stable if okay it's Fp is stable if the sequence has before from time to P lambda then possibly and positive is the free continuous. So it's normal. And so one way to reformulate this theorem is to say that if f is non-azotrivial, then so f stable is equivalent to saying that f minus 1 equivalent to saying that f minus 1 of t is stable and it's equivalent to saying that t is persistently prepelled yeah so you see completely okay so yeah everything is complex everything is complex here about sea if you want to adapt the approach you will have to do If you want to adapt the approach, you will have to do some identification of currents. So you have to dig into John Barbara and the cross theory. I'm not sure it's really sufficiently evident. Okay. At least I'm not confident enough. Okay, so what is the key object? So, as in the last 10 years, So, as in the last ten years when I do mathematics, it's a bifurcation measure. I could say two bifurcation measures. So, now I'm going to spend some time explaining what I mean by that. And actually, that's the topic. We have have uh 25 amino s okay okay so now what is how do we relate those two theorems so we are going to cook up some measure which will be a positive or vanishing measure depending on uh stability or non-stability. Okay. And we are going to relate it directly to the current property. Directly to the canon path. So to your map f lambda, you can associate its green function, which is defined the following way. g lambda t is the limit when n turns to infinity of 1 d to the n plus of the norm of a component. Okay, I'll see it will be G plus. And of course, you will have also the J lambda minus T, which will be the green point or F lambda minus. Actually, the convergence is local uniform in Z and lambda. So you can consider it as a function of both lambda and Z. And so what is the relation between this win function and the Between this green function and the green current, it was pointed out by Eric that the forward green current of f lambda is the DDC of the green function plus and the backward green current. So it will be a D D C in C. C in C of the back one. Now what we are going to do is instead of considering it as a fixed parameter lambda, we are going to use it in family and input our marked point in it. So here we can define the current T hat plus which will be the D D C in lambda and C. E and T minus that flow B D C N Z G minus so you can define it in a more geometric way if you prefer. So to do so you look at the projection on C two on P two on P two times C not Sig not to P2 and with this projection you will pull back, so you get omega hat to be the pullback of this projection of the form. And you can define the t hat as the limit plus minus hat as the limit on n tends to phi 1 into the n, f plus or minus n sum of this kind. Start of this kind. So it really follows the line of what you can do for families of racial matter on those things. And then you can define your biification measure two ways with the same object. So you have P no B. So you can define So you can define it either if you prefer as a DTC in lambda of this function where you have plugged in the micros or as some measure that you cook up on the ambient space C two times C naught and that you project that so project onto uh C naught Okay so um So how to relate the third wave race to this one is the following. Actually this measure the mass of this measure is we can have me so you can equalize. So mechanical height plus or minus of P is exactly the integral of a curve of this metric version of males. So this is a direct relation between the complex analytic version of the problem and the function field version of the problem. Of the problem. And you can be a little more precise, actually. You can put the following: that it's 1 over d to the n times the degree of f plus minus n p plus a big O of 1. And the big O of 1 will depend on F and on the degree of fetishity. So this will be something which is of key importance. A key important because you get directly that h plus or minus of p is zero if and only if the sequence degree of p is bounded. It's a my point. Can you use the My point, capital P is the function from C naught to C2. It's a moving, it's almost equally moving one. It's almost equally moving one. Okay, so I'm not completely done with relating this with the quick continuity of the family of iterates, but now it's somehow classical that positivity of this measure detects the non-normality of the sequence. My transfer. So I have to remark that u of plus minus e zero is equivalent to thinking that the sequence is number on the whole curve. So it really is. It really is somehow a quantitative relation between the two represents. Okay, so maybe if I have time at the end, I should have to have time back to the idea of please. Which is quite simple, actually. The idea is quite simple. Okay. So now uh how do we use this to get uh the the The the the bridge theorem which tells you that if your sequence is equicontinuous then it has to be there. It's anticipated So the idea goes in two steps the first step is to which is the main step is to first assume that both That both h plus of p equals zero and h minus of t equals zero. We first made this assumption that in forward and backward direction, the point does not drastically change the perturbation. Okay, and then And then you can it implies that the sequence of degrees of those functions and z is bounded. So you can relate the degree with the degree of the graph as a a sub variety C not times C. So C naught times C and so this is equivalent to saying that the degrees of the graph of F n of P is bounded. And so you can look at the closure, the science key closure of this set of the set of Of the set of graphs in the appropriate choir of the private show variety of P2 times. So it induces an action. So the fact that you have taken the ground topic. So the fact that you have taken the round orbit of it, it induces an action of fs minus 1 on z to itself, which may be not defined everywhere, but roughly speaking will give you that. And you can look at some kind of incidence where I take this guy. So the idea is that, okay, what I'm trying to do now is to say that if it's not periodic, I'm going to cook up some foliation. I'm gonna cut some foliation of an algebraic curve of the full C2 type C naught, which would conjugate globally that I need. So I'm gonna force familiar to be absolute. So we look at the set of Z lambda gamma C two times C dot times Z such that this Such that this pair belongs to this sovereignty. So you if your Z is finite if Z is finite I will sorry, assume it's not the case assume C has the city dimension. The fact that NOMAPS don't have invariant curves, algebraic curves, implies that if you look at the projection from this guy to C2 times C naught, H2 lambda C lambda Lambda Z lambda curve associate Z lambda. This map has to be dominant. It has to be dominant in this case. Because no UI curve. So assuming it's not dominant, it will mean that for some parameter you will be able to produce. you will be able to produce a curve which is the curve of points where there is such a gap at which places through. It will be invariant by five essentially objects. So you will get a controlling. Okay, so now the idea is to show that this in fact is an isomorphism. If you manage to prove that this is an isomorphism, it will mean that this collection of curves will be a foliation and will be imbined by the dynamics. So you have a tribalization, if you want, of your family. So to do that, you can do the second only thing I know how to do I try to do in every of my paper is to use stainless similarity between parameter and dynamical space. Between parameter and dynamical space. Okay. So let's try to follow. Let's go ahead. Okay, let's take a picture to see what's going on. So now what you have is that you have a size here of a subset of your C2 and C9. Empty nut which is covered by curse from your family and so you pick up here a parameter lambda point Z naught so that Z naught is a saddle perdic point of Lambda. What I claim is that if Z naught is saddle The mat is saddle for x on the mat. Then the fiber over the fiber over the point z nut on the nut is a singular term. So this is why you use the singularity. The signal. The similarity. I'm going to explain in a minute. So, why is it almost sufficient? It's because you will have a map which is dominant, which is generally one-one. So you have to prove then that it's defined everywhere and that it's finite. And then you can use a Zaiski first-main theorem to say that it's an item. So essentially the whole part which has to be done is this. What sorts of the set of characterized but it's done that? Yes, because otherwise you can produce for some parameter or any parameter. For some parameter or an invariant. So now you know there are no invariants there. So it has to be them. Yeah, it's such an important point. Okay, so now what do we do? So through this point, there is one specific curve which goes which passes, which can be put in your collection. It's the fact that you can follow It's the fact that you can follow the pearly point. We take an irreducible component. We are not trying to be a reducible component of the set of Z lambda chat F lambda Z Z. So up to replacing F by iterate, you can assume that it's fixed point. So you have one specific curve that's and And if you take another curve which goes to this point not following locally this curve, you can look at, you can iterate this guy forward. If it's not following the curve, if it's not consistently in the stable manifold, then it will have to produce some bifurcation for the forward bifurcation. Bifurcation for the forward bifurcation. So the forward stability implies that it follows the stable manifold and the backward stability imposes that it follows the unstable manifold. So the only point which is persistently in the intersection of these guys is the parity point. So it forces the curve to be this one. So again, um essentially. It's just uh at the port. High pass through the port. Yeah, it passes through the port, so it cannot be. Okay, so there are couple of uh of comments. So um this book is not totally satisfacto oh, it's the first episode. So it's not totally satisfactory because uh but you don't get uh small idea. You don't get a small head gap that you have in one map makers between backup spaces. On the other hand, it's quite flexible so that you can adapt it to different situations. And the idea behind is really to reduce all the problems, complex analytic problems. I think you can just like to characterize the To characterize the height zero by this glycification measure, somehow reduces to a digital on that and the triangular inequality. Plus, the input of a very good idea of Dean and C-buny is to test, yeah, but it's important, to test the mass of the measure using TSH functions, which allows you to have a very low increase. Increasement of the number. And I think I don't have much science as to anything. So I'm going to stop.
