Okay, so thank you very much for the introduction and for the opportunity to speak here. I want to talk about some ongoing project where I joined with Thomas Manra about push forwards of intrinsic volumes. So, let me first remind you about evaluations on manifolds. Namely, let M be some oriented smooth melanomanifold of dimension n. Then there is this family of compact sub-manifolds with corners, which are denoted by Pm. And evaluation is a functional on this set of sub-manifolds with values in the reals given by two differential forms. The first one being The first one being an n minus 1 form on the co-sphere bundle of M and volume form on N. And then mu evaluated at P is just given by integrating omega against the normal cycle of P and phi against over P itself. Yeah, and as they are differential forms, what are they? Differential forms. What relations clearly are linear space, and this space we denote by this curly V of n. Okay, so let me give you some examples which we already heard today and also in previous talks by, for example, Jo Fu. So if the manifold is just the The manifold is just the real n-dimensional vector space, then one can define intrinsic volumes by considering R neighborhoods of convex bodies, so complex subsets. On the Euclidean plane space, the R neighborhood is just the addition of K with some plus Minkowski addition with a ball of radius R. With a ball of radius r. And then, so this is Steiner's formula, says that this volume, this value can be expressed as a polynomial in R with certain coefficients, and these coefficients are exactly the intrinsic volumes. And here, omega n just denotes the volume of the unit ball in. The unit ball in dimension n. So this formula can be used to define intrinsic volumes of convex and compact subsets. And one can then prove that this definition can be defined to all compact submanifolds with corners. And here one can also see that. Here one can also see that if we just plug in convex and compact subsets, μ0 is constant. If you extend it to the sub-manifolds, you get the Euler characteristic. On convex bodies, the code one coefficient is proportional to surface area, and the top coefficient is just the volume on. Just a volume on the Euclidean space. Okay, so we are mainly thinking about these intrinsic volumes and some variations of them. And we want to think about natural operations between this volume, these valuations. And they were considered by Alaska. Uh, considered by Alaska, namely, if we have a smooth map between two of these oriented smooth manifolds, then we can consider notions of pullback and push forward. Namely, if F is an immersion, then the pullback of evaluation is defined locally by this formula. That is, the pullback evaluated at a submanifold is just new evaluated f at the image of the submanifold. Image of the submanifold and why do I say locally? Because every immersion locally is an embedding. So if we restrict P to be contained in the neighborhood where F is an immersion, an embedding, then F of P is itself a submanifold and one can apply μ to it. And then by using the sheaf property of valuations, Property of valuations. This defines the valuation f, the pullback of μ globally by kind of gluing things together. And one can think of taking pullbacks just as restricting the valuation to some subnetrology, like if the immersion is just the inclusion. It's just the inclusion. And the dual operation to pull back is what I want to talk most about in this talk. It's the push forward. Instead of an immersion, you have to take a submersion. And the push forward then is just defined similar as a push forward of a measure. Namely, applied to P, it's just take the pre-image with respect to the map and then apply new. map and then apply new and here you also need that the submersion is proper because proper means pre-images of compact sets are compact and so this pre-image of the compact set manifold is again compact and because f is a submersion it's again a sub manifold so this makes sense for proper submersions and let me also note that And let me also note that there are further extensions of this concept if f is not an immersion or f is not a proper submersion. But we won't need this here. And a second note, as valuations are given by pairs of differential forms, it is a natural question to describe the Describe the push forward and the pullback of μ in terms of the level of the differential forms. And such a description was given by Alaska. Okay, so let me give an example of when bullbergs are very useful. Namely, let now be M Riemannian manifold. So we have a Riemannian structure, and then Structure. And then Nash's embedding theorem tells us that one can find an embedding of M into some big, possibly big Euclidean space, which is, and the embedding is isometric. And then one can just take the pullbacks with this embedding of the intrinsic volumes that you have on the remaining space. Riemannian space. And this gives you a family of valuations which are called Lipschitz-Killing valuations. And well, a priori, these depend on the choice of the isometric empadi. But as we heard already in this talk, in this workshop very often, they do not depend on the choice of E. And this is some instance of Haydn's principle. And again, one can consider one can identify special Lipschitz-Scaling evaluations when μ0 is just the Euler characteristic on the manifold and μn is the Riemannian volume measure. And so they are defined as using pullbacks, and as it turns out, they turned out they don't. Out they turned out they don't depend on the choice of the embedding as long as it's isometric. And it was shown by Fuh and Banner that this subspace generated by this Lipschitz-Killing valuation as a subspace of some natural subfamily of valuations is characterized among this family by its invariance. Family by its invariance under pullback. So pullback seems here to be a very natural concept with respect to Lipschitz killing valuations. So Lipschitz pullbacks of Lipschitz killing valuations are very nice. And now the question is: so what will be the question of this talk? What about push forwards? About push-forwards. And in this case, in the pullback case, we are considering isometric embeddings. So, what's the correct term for push-forwards? This is the notion of Riemannian submersion. So, we assume F to be a proper Riemannian submersion, and a Riemannian submersion is just a submersion. And then, because it's a submersion. It's a subversion, the differential is onto. And so the kernel has a kernel of this map. And you take the remaining structure to consider its orthogonal space. And then the assumption is that the differential restricted to this orthogonal space is an osymmetry. And then you call this method Riemann's opposition. So kind of Kind of the closest you can get to an isometry if you're in submission. And it was a question asked by Jofu to understand the push forwards of this Lipschitz killing valuations if F is a remaining submerger. And our project is kind of to we work with this question and we try to Question, and we try to find some general answers to Jovu's questions, and in particular to consider some special remaining submersion, namely the Hop vibration, and to give a complete answer in this setting. So, here the Hop vibration we consider as a map from the unit sphere in some Cn plus one. In some Cn plus one, which maps to complex projective space. And the vector C1 to Cn plus one is just mapped to the complex line spanned by this vector. So you just take, so this is just kind of the quotient map of the complex projective space if you restrict it to the sphere. And as a consequence, you And as a consequence, you factor out non-zero elements of C. If you have the sphere, you already have factored out the radial components. So what is left is just multiplying with complex scalars of norm one. So you see that the pre-image of a point, the fiber, is just some s. Just some S okay. So, in particular, we want to explicitly describe the push forwards of the intrinsic volumes on the sphere with respect to the Hopk vibration. And let me first show you some cases where one can. One can easily compute the push forwards. Namely, these are the extremal cases. In this case, if we assume additionally that n is connected, we have one can show, the proof is just the remainder of the slide, that the push forward of the Euler characteristic is a constant multiple of the Euler characteristic on the target space and the push forward. Target space and the push forward of the volume measure is just another constant multiple of the volume measure on n. And yeah, so let me give you a short proof of this. For the Euler characteristic, just remember we have a proper submersion. So Erisman's vibration theorem shows that F is a vibration. F is a fibration. This means it admits local trivializations, and in particular, there is some model fiber. And general theorem for the Euler characteristic states that the Euler characteristic of N can be computed as the product of the Euler characteristic of the fiber times the Euler characteristic of the base space. So if we now restrict, if we take a submit. If we take a sub-manifold, we can restrict f to a map from the pre-image of the sub-manifold to the sub-manifold, use again this computation and see that chi of the pre-image is a multiple of the Euler characteristics to get exactly this with c being the Euler characteristic of the model film. And in the second case, for the volumes, it's just some fiber integration of the differential forms. So you use the description by Alesska, you do the fiber integration that you have to do there, and you get to this result. Okay. Yeah. And let me also note that in the case of the hub vibration, Of the Hub fibration, we know that the fiber is just an S1. So the Euler characteristic of an S1 of the circuit is zero. So we see that the Euler characteristic is push-forwarded to zero and we get a factor of two pi in the volume. There's a question by Alexander. He's asking if the fiber might not have constant volume. So excuse me, so are you talking just about the hot fiber? Excuse me, so are you talking just about the HOP vibration or about general Riemannian submersions? So, because in general, the fiber, yeah, so the volume of the fiber may vary from point to point. Okay, actually so let me uh let me just say that it's for the hub vibration. Me, just say that it's for the hop vibration because I'm not sure now. Uh, but for the hop vibration, of course, it's uh it's just it's just this one, okay. Uh okay um yeah, so uh I hope this uh I hope that is true. Maybe uh it's uh part of the uh that's a Rumin and submersion. That's a remainder and submersion. But okay, just assume for one moment that this is true. So having this calculation, the next question is: can we use what we have here, this re-hop fabrication, can we use this to calculate a channel, a rotted channel? General general into Lipschitz killing valuations. And so a natural concept kind of if one has it for the volume, one can take variations. So one can take derivatives of the volume and see what happens then. And this leads to the notion of variation of valuation. Of variation of evaluation. And then, so the variation of evaluation was introduced by Bennett and Fu. And if the evaluation is given as with these two differential forms, then one can define the variation by this given formula for the differential form, namely, Namely, take the Roman differential of omega, add to it the pullback of phi, pullback as a differential form of phi, and then this is an n form or on m and then you plug in the red vector field to make it an n minus one form, and this gives a valuation. Yeah, let me note that panic and foop are Panig and Foop defined this to be actually a curvature measure. So, what I'm giving here is not the variation of the evaluation, but the globalization of the variation. But this won't make a difference, won't appear in the following. Georg, there is a question by Joseph in the chat. So, in general, if the fibers of Romanians. General, if the fibers of Riemannian submersion are minimal, will they have the same volume by the first variation formula? So I think this is just a square. Yeah, so I think I don't I don't know at the moment. I hope that's this, but I hope that's this, but yes, so that's that's something I need to check. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, okay, so we have here the variation of the variation of evaluation defined and why is it called evariation? Why is it called variation? This is actually just the following formula: namely, taking if we have a sub-manifold P, we can take its R neighborhood, so all points in M of distance less or equal R, apply mu to it, and then take the derivative with respect to R. And this gives another way to motivation why this is called the variation of evaluation. Code the variation of evaluation and also another way to calculate this variation without referring to the formula in the last slide. Namely, take for example again the Euclidean case where and take mu to be the volume. Then one can extend express the right-hand side using the Steiner formula as a polynomial and then you can just take And then you can just take the derivative of a polynomial, which you can compute easily, and see, for example, if you take the ith derivative, you just get the coefficient of r to the n minus i, which is a multiple of the intrinsic volume. And kind of here you see that you have the variations, they really have a Are they really have a relation with the intrinsic volumes? So kind of we want to use these variations and the first observation that we make is that taking variation and taking push forward that this commutes. So first taking the variation of mu and then pushing it forward is the same as The same as taking first the push forward and then the variation. And as a consequence, at least if F is the hop vibration, we get that the variations of the volume are pushed forward to the variations of the volume, whereas C prime is Is just the constant that you get here if you set k equals to zero. Okay. So having. Can I ask, so the theorem is true for any which has no remaining structure? Yes, so in the proof we need we use the remaining structure. Remaining structure. But actually, I think. Well, if you have just a proper submersion, one can think if one finds an auxiliary Riemannian structure on both sets to make it a Riemannian submersion, then you could use this. But for our proof, we just, I wouldn't say, heavily use the Riemann structure for our proof. Thank you. Okay. So what remains? So, kind of knowing this, what remains is to write the Lipschitz-Killing valuations in terms of the variations of the volume. And the problem here is that this is not possible in general. However, it's possible for the case of the Hop vibration. So let me restrict this case. Me restrict this case for the remainder of the talk and again use Steiner formula on the sphere of cube formulas to express the variations. So for the sphere, there is a Steiner formula by Klaus Hauer who proved that the volume of an R neighborhood of P can be expressed as the sum. As this sum with some valuations tau j here, with some coefficients being integrals of powers of sine and cosine. And these valuations here, they can form a natural basis of the valuations on the sphere, which are invariant with respect to rotations of the sphere. And they are kind of given by the property of being a base. of given by the property of being a basis and its values on subspheres of J-dimensional subspheres. And in particular, knowing that intrinsic volumes are invariant with respect to rotations, the restrictions to the sphere is as well invariant. And we see that the Lipschitz-Killing valuations are in fact really in the span of this. Of these elements with explicit formulas giving μk in terms of the tau basis. And the same thing on CPN. We have a Steiner formula per Bernick Fusulanis with again a basis with some valuations on CPN. And this tau k0, they are given by Are given by summing up so-called Hemesian intrinsic volumes. So if you don't know this notion, just think of this mu KQ as some basis of valuations, invariant valuations on complex projective space having some particularly nice properties. Okay, so with this So, with this two Steiner formulas, one can use, make the following, as I said. Just write mu k in the tau k basis. This is something that is known explicitly. Then you need to invert the Steiner formula to get from the tau k basis to variations on the volume. From there, you know that the push forward is The push forward is, you know how it works. And then you can write push forwards in the tau k basis. And by going this way, you get the push forward of the Lipschitz-Killing valuations in terms of the tau k-serum. And let me note that, in particular, from this calculation, you get that the push forward. Calculation: You get that the push forward cannot be of a Lipschitz-Killing valuation cannot be written as a linear combination of Lipschitz-Killing valuations on CPN. Yes. So, and another note here, a searcher said that you have to invert the Steiner formula on the sphere. This is actually something which is, let's say, at least tricky. But actually, But actually, you don't need to invert it because you have here the Steiner formula on CPN, which looks pretty much the same as the one on the sphere. And using this, we get the following explicit formula. Namely, here the volume is pushed forward to a multiple of the volume, and the push forward of the tau j's is just a linear combination. J's is just a linear combination of tau ch minus one zero and tau j plus one zero on on Cpn. Using here the convention that tau j minus one tau minus one is zero, so if j equals zero, and if j equals two n, then tau 2n plus 1 is 0, so this term vanishes. Yeah, and also let me check if you have the Euler characteristic besides. If you have the Euler characteristic, we said for that it must be pushed, the push forward must be zero. And actually, the Euler characteristic is given by this explicit formula of tau, of taus. And you see that if you plug in this here, you just get a telescope sum and everything vanishes. Okay, so kind of this was the result. We know for sure that variations and push forwards commute. Variations and push-forwards commute. And this gives, in particular, a complete answer in case of the Hop vibration. So, kind of what remains to be said is can we say something more general about the channel? More general. So, if you just have assume remain in subversion. And what's also kind of interesting is understand the image of the push-forward operation. The image of the push-forward operation in the light that the Litches killing evaluations are the kind of the image of the push, the pullback operation. Are there some intercal geometric interpretations of these formulas that we have? And yeah, related to the drag structures and valuations. Okay, that's all I wanted to say. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, Giorgi, for the nice job. Thank you for the nice talk. Any questions from the audience? Question from Jan. Please, Jan? Hi, Gerk. So in view of Jill's talk, does it make any sense to extend this question of Joe to this soda remains, I think? I mean, you have to think about what is a remaining submersion in this setting, right? So you kind of you probably need to think about submersions, which I think that what I I think that the what I don't I don't see right now how you would replace the notion of remaining submersion in this case. So this idea is an asymmetric maybe there is some topological reason why they don't exist but at least locally addresses they exist. Yeah. And is there some like some some like, you know Some, like, you know, so in this case, you consider the hop vibration as a simple example, like a prototype, let's say. So, is there something like this in the general for the general signature? Are you aware of something? I don't know. But I must say I haven't never thought about pseudo and then in case. Thank you. And there was questions from Joe. Joe, are you with us? Sorry, here I am. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, first of all, thanks for the nice talk. So first kind of a very trivial remark is like, you know, sometimes it can be fun to write down these formulas for series in different bases. You know, I don't know, presumably you've tried that or if not, it's just a linear algebra exercise. Linear algebra exercise. Second, maybe a more serious question. So I guess we know a little bit about invariant valuations on quaternionic projective spaces, right? So maybe even HP1, do we have classification, I think? So have you thought about what to do for the vibrations there, even say in low dimensions? So to the first question, yes, we have tried to write it in different places. Actually, if you take the Basis. Actually, if you take the phi basis on the sphere, it's really the push forward maps the phi basis to the sum of emission triggers volumes. But if you take the, for example, the monomial basis on the sphere, then this gives some formula that I don't see any, it's just not, it's just a big, big It's just a big sum. Yes, to the second question. I haven't really thought about quaternion spaces right now. I mean, you could, I don't know if there exists Steiner formulas on these spaces, but if there exists, one could probably use the same method. method method however it's um i wouldn't say uh i wouldn't say slack but uh in for the hop vibration you really uh you really use that the steiner formulas on sphere and cpn really look quite the same so you can uh you can do the you can kind of skip the inversion uh otherwise uh calculations are become very difficult. Are become very difficult. You don't use that. Okay, thank you, Joe, and thanks, Georgia, for the talk. We have robots now, and basically one video rate and move on. Joseph, is everything working? Yes, yes, yes. Please start sharing your site. And let's check that we can hear you.
