So this talk is a little bit at the opposite end of the spectrum relative to the first talk this morning, meaning it's much more differential geometric. But sometimes the extremes touch themselves, so maybe there will be something in common. It's some joint work that I'm working on with Working on with Ale Cabrera, who is in Rio Janeiro. And I think I'm going to do something that you should not do, which is I'm going to make a spoiler and tell you the end of the story. So the spoiler is that quantization may actually require to deal with partial algebra, so algebras where the multiplication is only partially defined. Multiplication is only partially defined, and so I'm going to try to tell this point and why I think this may be true. So I think everyone probably knows the work of Konsevich, and Koncevich basically told you everything you wanted to know, or maybe almost everything you wanted to know about deformation quantization, formal deformation quantization. But, you know, formal. But formal deformation quantization is a bit irrelevant to physics because it's formal. So it would be nice to have a theory of non-formal deformation quantization. And so that's what this talk will be dealing with. And there are various approaches to non-formal deformation quantization. So, one thing one can do is look at formal star products and look inside the algebra of formal power series, look for some sub-algebras where the star product is convergent. Because of Borel theorem, you cannot require the start product to be convergent for every pair of smooth functions. But this is very Of smooth functions, but this is very restrictive. There is a nice survey by Stefan Volman, you can google it and another option is strict deformation quantization. So this was proposed by Mark Riefel a long time ago, and it's basically doing considering H families of C star algebras, deforming the smooth functions. But not many examples of these are known. So it seems to be a bit. So it seems to be a bit restrictive too. A third option is through geometric quantization, what you do for simplic manifolds. So here, what you do is you assume that your possible manifold integrates to a symplectic group point, and assuming that the symplectic form on the group point is integral, you proceed with the geometric quantization program. With the geometric quantization program. And yeah, so this has been tried to by various people. And this is still not what I'm going to talk about. So the final thing here is something very old. It's that progressifying by integral operators. And this basically goes back to the work of Karazev and Maslov and also Einstein in the 80s. Also, Weinstein in the 80s. It's a very old approach. But it's an approach, but there is no general theory. So what we are going to talk a little bit about here is start products in this last category, but where the integral operators are given by some special kernels, which are semi-classical free integral distributions. Classical three-integral distributions. And I will try to explain a little bit of that, what is going on there. So, the idea is really to use semi-classical analysis to approach this problem. And it's very closely related to a sequence of papers, I think now there are four of them at least, by Catanio, Darren, and Weinstein about what's called a symplectic micro category. But the focus, the focus, our Our focus is a bit different, and the results I will tell you about are not contained in these papers. Okay, so what is a non-formal star product quantizing a possible manifold for us here? So that's going to be a bilinear product on the space of complex valued families of H functions. So let me start explaining my notations there. My notations there. So these are smooth families of functions depending on a parameter h. So, and they are defined for values of the parameter on some interval excluding zero. So, when h goes to zero, these things have singularities a priori. Priori. And then they have to satisfy cell bounds. So because of these singularities, you want to control them. So one way of saying it is that for any compactly supported function on m, there exists some natural number and some constant such that when you take When you take the semi-classical Fourier transform of a function over here, it's bounded, say, by some constant h to the minus n. Say, so this depends on psi, psi to the n. So the notation here, so this denotes the semi-classical Fourier transform. Semi-classical Fourier transform. So that's like the Fourier transform. There is a parameter. Let's say I'm doing this for Rn. There is an extension of this. So let's put here Rn. There is an extension of this to manifolds using Atlas pin. So the X and So what this means is that we are controlling the singularities of this family when age approaches zero and also in terms of its differentiability. Okay, so that's the the space that appears there. The space that appears there. There are eight families of functions depending on age that you are controlling in some way. Okay? And now they have to satisfy a bunch of axioms. So the first thing, so the spaces have natural topologies. And so the first thing is that, of course, this deforms the usual product of functions. Right, so here for this axiom, these are compactly supported functions on M that do not depend on age. So I can say that the difference between the start product and the product is of order h. So, okay. So this is the space of is like the constant, they are constant in age, they format it. So they lie inside. So these are just, don't depend on age, they lie inside the space, right? Constant thing. And similarly for the And similarly, for the correspondence principle, so if I have two functions and I compare the star commutator with the Poisson bracket, that's of order H. That should be familiar for anyone that has seen formal deformation contribution. Now, the next axiom is the associativity. The next axiom is the associativity, and that's a delicate thing. And so, let me explain again the notation there. So, it appears there's something called the semi-classical wavefront set. So, what is that? So, if you have some of the one of these families, age-dependent families, we are going to say that this is micro. We are going to say that this is micro-locally infinitesimally small if let's say add some covector alpha. If there exists some charts centered at this point and compactly supported functions, so let's say in u and phi in the tangent space at this point, such that when you multiple, so when you So, when you localize, so you take semi-classical Fourier transform of f times phi and multiply it by the other phi, this is of order age infinity. So that's micro-local infinitesimally small. And the wavefront set is the set of covectors where f is not micro-local infinitesimally small. So that's what the So that's what the wave fun set means. Semi-classical wavefront set alphas where f is not. Is not a microlocal slot. Okay. So maybe I think here, maybe I can give you maybe a little example. So let's say we take a function. A function of this form. So here, rho is compactly supported, doesn't depend on age. S is some smooth function. Then the wavefront set. So these are the type of functions that you can have in this space. So you see that when age goes to zero, this is a highly oscillating function. That's the kind of things you want to quantize. Oh. Oh. Got better? Okay. So the semi-classical wavefront set of this function is going to be the set the covectors obtained by taking the differential of s for any x in the support of rho. So you see, this thing is really telling you where the function. Okay, the wavefront set, if it is always Lagrangian. Yes, except that it can be like a, well, it can be a point. So model it is. Model it is. Okay. So that's the wavefront set there. So for any open in the cotangent bundle, if I have functions that have compact wavefront set containing this omega, associativity holds. And now the equality there has a new underneath. And that means equality microlocally equal. So I'm not going to define precisely what is micro-locally equal. Precisely, what is microlocally equal, but morally is like F1 minus F2 is micro-local infinitesimally small. But this I'm lying. But that's how you should think of it. The difference between F1 and F2 is like of the order H infinity. Okay, so that's associativity. The next thing is something that, so when we have a formal start product, we often deal with natural start products. And what that means is that when we look at the expansion of the start product and the coefficients of each power of h, it is a b differential operator. The start product being natural, it means those coefficients. Product being natural, it means those coefficients is a b-differential operator of order less or equal than the power of the coefficient. So that's natural. So that condition here is replaced by this condition that left and right multiplication, sorry, left and right multiplication by a compactly supported function is a single differential operator of order zero, a semi-classical semi-differential operator. Okay, so another technical thing, maybe, but and again, you see, we always work micro locally. So the left and right multiplication is micro locally and still a differential operator according to C. And the final thing is that we really want to control the kernels of this star product, and so this kernel should. And so, this kernel should be a semi-classical free intro distribution. So, let me explain a little bit what that is. Okay. So let's say it's okay is semi-classical free intro distribution on x in the in their x is m times m times m times m. C k depends on three variables, right? Right, and um, so what this means is that uh now I apologize because this x is a triple in the Cartesian product is not an element of m so it represents there x times x1 and x2. And so this will be something of the form h of some power and the integral I will explain what is this notation. What is this notation of some amplitudes and so underlying a semi-classical Fourier distribution, there is always a Lagrangian submanifold of the cotangent bundle of the. Manifolds of the cotangent bundle of X. Okay? So this S that appears there is a generating function for that Lagrange. Now, what does that mean? mean so the simplest way of getting a Lagrangian in a potential bundle is taking a function on x and taking it the graph of the differential but that will not produce all the Lagrangians that you are interested so you need some kind of generalized so that that that would be like a classical generating function but we want a something more sophisticated so what we have is the following so Following. So over x, we are going to have a vibration, and the function s is defined on the total space of this vibration. And the Lagrangian is obtained by looking at the vertical differential of these. So let's say of this S at the point Z. So this just means I take the differential. I take the differential of s and I restrict to the kernel of d pi. Okay, and we need to assume that this is transverse to the zero section. So I can take the prey image of the zero section and from the prey image, home vectors here, they are things that cannot be this differential that for which Can angulate this differential that for which this vertical differential is zero, so they are pullbacks of covectors on x. So that's how you obtain lambda. So say that again? No, it's just a vibration, locally trivial vibration. No, but this is on the on the on the on the tangent. So if you want this. So if you want this for, okay, forget about the zero section if you prefer. This D vertical S goes from the tangent to Z to the tangent to R. So that's the zero section of the tangent to R. Yeah. So if you want, it's just zero in R. Okay. So this sends alpha to alpha Z, where alpha Z is the unique covector that holds back. Covector that pulls back by pi to the differential of s. So this kind of, I mean, without the semi-classical, without age, this is the type of thing that was introduced by Hormander to generalize these Fourier integral operators. Fully integral operators and then I mean these things with the with the parameter age is the subject of study of micro local analysis okay so that's how you can define these semi-classical Fourier integral distributions or things of this form and my point is that they always come with a Lagrangian by definition there is a Lagrangian underlying the semi-classical that's what you should remember Classical. That's what you should remember from this story. So, maybe an example. So, it also justifies a little bit the name. So, suppose I take a map phi from X to R V. From x to d and let's say zero is a regular value. So I can look at the po-normal bundle with a sub-manifold, the plane image of zero. That's a Lagrangian sub-manifold. Pronormal just means the analytor of the tangent. And so, this Lagrangian can be described by such a generalized generating function as follows. You can take x times rv. So that's your vibration. And s of xp is just pi of x. Is just phi of x. Okay, so this vibration together with this function will recover this Lagrange. Okay, so you see that in this case, these things, these in the classical integral distributions, will be something of the form integral over Rv of A of X T. e to the i over h phi of x t it starts to look like the Fourier integral the Fourier transform and in fact if you take x to be rd and phi to be the identity becomes the Fourier transform so you'll see the name coming coming anyway so there you have so given a So given a Lagrangian on the cotangent bundle, locally you can always find generating functions like this. Globally not, but you can always cover by opens so that you have these local generating functions. And then playing some game with partitions of unity, you can define this for any Lagrange. Okay. So that's the definition. And that's how we generalize or how we go from formal start products to non-formal start products of semi-classical Fourier integral type. That's the name I'm going to be using. Okay? Questions? I'll come back to that exam. Okay? No, but I'll come back to that exam. If I don't, just no, it's in the plane. So here's the theorem, first theorem. Suppose you have such a non-formal star product containing non-formal star product containing some possible manifold then as we said underlying the kernel there is a lagrangian which lives in the contingent bundle of m times n times m so that lagrangian is the graph of multiplication of a not of a global groupoid as in the first lecture today but of a local group oid that integrates the possible men So, what is this saying? He's saying that the S that you are using in this kernel is not some arbitrary function. It's very much determined by the Poisson structure that you have. It's a generating function for the graph of multiplication of the local simplicity. So, now maybe I should explain that. Let me explain that a little bit. Let's see if I can do this. So many folds. So, what is a simplistic group point? Well, we had a group point this morning, so. Morning, so but now the group points here are Lie group points. So, this is the arrows, and I write them like this: M is the object, and all this is in the smooth category. So, G and M are manifolds, the source and the target map are submersions, and all the structure maps are smooth. Okay, this is a Lie groupoid and symplectic groupoid comes with. And symplectic group load comes with a symplectic form on the space of arrows, which is compatible with the multiplication. And one way to, there are different ways of expressing that. One way to express that is to look at the graph of multiplication. Well, they know the graph of multiplication like this. So there's GH times GH, where G source of G equals target of H. g equals target of h so this leaves in g times g times g this graph and so we have the symplectic form on g so we can put omega omega and we change the sign in the last one and the way to express that this is compatible with multiplication is to say that this manifold here is Lagrangian So, why is this relevant for Poisson manifolds? The base of a symplectic group point is a Poisson manifold in a unique way for which, say, the source map is a Poisson map. So, this implies there exists a unique some bracket such that Brackets such that source from the Poisson bracket associated with the symplectic form to the Poisson with M is Poisson. So any simpletic group, the basis is a natural or a unique Poisson structure. And the Poisson manifold is called integrable if it has a symplectic group point inducing it. It's okay now not every possible manifold is integral so not every M arises from the sympotical point But every possible manifold arises from a local simplicity point Okay, but yes if enlarge local Now, you may say that I'm talking about some weird objects. I'm not going to tell, so the obstructions to understand if a possible manifold is integral or not are very well understood now. I'm just going to give you an example. Yes. Yes. But that's not the theme of my talk, so I will skip that. But you can ask me afterwards and I'll go. You can ask me afterwards, and I'll go ahead and explain. So, let me just give you an example of a Poisson manifold which is not integral. In fact, a polynomial Poisson structure on R3, which is not integral. So, if you take M, so you see these things are not very weird. And we take the bracket of XY to be some function A times Z, and then cyclic permutation. And here, A, you can take the square of the radius times square of the radius minus one. So this is a polynomial Poisson structure, and it's not integral, but it's important to poly. And it's not input by simple typical point. Okay. So that's the first term. So, examples. Go ahead, go ahead. Right, so another thing is that, okay, that's a good point. So, why do I have there, I have t star of n. So, the point is that in this statement here, that's not the first one, you cannot get a simpleton, but you can get a local. In fact, you can get a local simpletic group point structure on the cotangent polymer. Okay, so here you can take G, no, inside. No inside the cotangent balloon of M and with the canonical sympletic form. The group white structure is very far from what it is. No, but it's not that. So the source and the target are not the projection on the base. They are different maps and the multiplication. Different maps and the multiplication. Thank you for the question. That's actually very relevant. It's the same story. There is not much difference here for integrability if you take holomorphic Poisson structures. You can also have holomorphic Poisson structures, but this one is going to be non-integral too if you take the corresponding C version of this. Is it again? No, the leaves here are not dense. The leaves here are just spheres central at the origin. What happens is that the so what happens is that at the sphere of radius one, because this vanishes, you get a bunch of points. And then you have the spheres are sympletic leaves. So there are like sphere of radius one and the origin. These are points which are zero dimensional. And then you have the other spheres. And then you have the other spheres, which are sympletic leaves. And what happens is that in between the origin and the sphere of radius one, the sympletic area has to attain a maximum because it starts at zero and gets to zero. So it has to have a critical point. And if the sympletic area, if you have a two-sphere whose sympletic area goes through a critical point, it's a non-integral possible. For what? No, any dual of any algebra is integral by the symplectic group point, cotangent bundle, viewed as an action group point for the conjoint argument. So any linear post-most particles. So the obstruction has to do with pipe two of the. abstraction has to do with pi two of the leads pi two meaning second homotopy group of the of the symplectic leads so if all leads of pi two trivial or if pi two is finite there is no structure you can integrate or yeah that's for real but for uh for the holomorphic case you can look at the underlying real plus of structure and play the game for that one and if the the holomorphic one is integrable even only if the underlying real one is integral so So, yeah. Any more questions? Or can I give a couple of examples? Let me give you a couple of examples. Okay, my first example seems a little bit chaotic. It's the zero pussy search. Of course, this is just a product. Just a product, but the point is that if I think of this as an integral, so let's say let's put here x using some delta functions. Let's say this is. Let's say this is well, actually, in our end. So I can rewrite this as actually here is 2n intervaling. Into p rho of x1 rho of x2 e to the i over h s p one x minus x one mine plus p two x minus x two. To x minus x two f of x So this is the form that I'm claiming. This is our K. Okay. This is our S. It depends on all the variables that you see there, X, X1, X2, P1, and P2. And of course, this Poisson structure is integrated, so the symplectic group point is the cottonization bundle viewed as a bundle. Views as a bundle of billion groups over Rn. Okay. And this is a generating function for this group. Maybe not very interesting, but I'm just explaining. Yeah. This interval is you know over all our end. That's why I. H? Yeah, H only needs to be defined up to some fixed H0 from 0 to up to some fixed H0. No, the thing is that the age disappears if you make a change of variables. So this age is faked. Any that you want, except for zero. So it can be zero. Yeah. Okay, now I understand your question. Understand your question. Sorry. Or any H0 would you want? Any. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. How am I doing in time? See if I jump to constant Poisson structure and jump to the linear one. What time do we finish? At 12, 20 minutes. Your minute. Okay, so I think I have time to say this. So, if you take a constant muscle structure in our end, you say, or in some manifold. Or in some manifold with a fine whatever fine connections. Then, oh yeah, is that okay? Oh, then I will just write down a formula for this. It's going to be not very different from that one. Very different from that one. So intervals in x1, x2, q1, q2. This should have been q1, sorry. I over h p one x minus x one plus p two x minus x two plus pi of p1 p2. Let me up here two integrals so I can so these are the kernel. So, this is our kernel now. And this is our generating function. So, again, this follows into this story. So, now let's go to Luce's question. Linear plus structure, maybe a bit more interesting. Now, you see that to write those integrals at some point, I have to introduce. I didn't say what these rows the row is. The row is just a compactly supported function, which at zero is one. But it's arbitrary, you can choose. This is really related with the fact that we have to work micro locally in this whole story. In this whole story. If I didn't put this, I would never be able to write this thing in this form. And so, this is really an essential point to work micro-local in this story. And we'll see that now again in the linear, in the case of a linear Poisson structure, maybe even more feasibly. So So linear i on dual of some Lie algebra. So let's take exponential map. Let's take first of all, let's do let's do it on G and well, maybe not. Let's look on U side G where this. G, where this exponential is a diffusion, okay, some neighborhood of zero, and the Lie algebra and now we're going to define the start product. By doing the following trick, I'm going to take the semi-classical Fourier transform of these functions. So these are functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. When I take their Fourier transform, they are functions on the Lie algebra G. So So now these are functions on the Lie algebra, and I have now a product there, right? So let's here maybe some space and I'm going to put here the convolution this convolution product using Using the product I have to. And then I do Fourier transform back. So there is only one problem with this formula, which is this is only defined on this u. So for this to make sense, I So, for this to make sense, I would need these Fourier transforms to have domain inside u or u squared, which is a problem. So, how do you solve that? Well, you multiply by cutoff again. So, I'll put a rule there and a rule there. Okay, so again, unless we are in the new potent case, as someone was asking, where the exponential is a global diffeomorphism. Is a global diffeomorphism, but if not, you are really forced to put the cutoffs here, otherwise, there is no star product formal start product. And then you can write the formula for this. I don't know if I should write it down. I'm going to have the form that we have, right? With S and and whatever some and the s is indeed the generating function so the s we want the expression is x dot p1 minus x1 dot two minus x2 dot e two inverse times Okay, maybe let me write this, otherwise, this becomes a bit confusing. What are dots and what are the maintenance? So, this is in the group operation, this group operation that we have. That's the S, and that's a generating function for this symplectic group. All the possible manifolds that I wrote are integral. All the possible manifolds that I wrote are integrable. If you want a non-integrable example, what you can do is this example of the dual of a Lie algebra generalizes to the dual of a Lie algebra. The dual of a Lie algebra has a Poisson structure. You can construct a start product the same way. If the algebra is non-integrable, the dual of the Lie algebra is a Poisson structure, which is nothing. Anyway, this didn't mean anything to anyone, or I know it means to someone, but you can. You can forget it. It's possible to construct examples with non-integral possible. Okay. So let's go back to the theorem. Hopefully, these examples convince you that there is something. Let's open this up. What about, I give you a possible manifolds, there exists, is there a non-formal start product of this type? We don't know, and I think that's a hard problem, and the reason is the second theory. If you take one of these start products, this non-formal start products, and you think of the function by varying the age, which is defined from here or two, you can take. You can take its formal power series expansion in H. That formal power series expansion in H is a formal star product. Always. So, if somehow you show that any possible manifold has such a non-formal star product, you will have a way of proving the existence of star products for any formal star product for any possible manifold without using formality. Manifold without using formality. I'll let you think whether you think that's an easy anyway. But just to point out that his existence, I don't think it's a trivial problem. If you prove it, you have another way of proving the existence of non-formal of formal star products without using conceptage formality. Okay. Now, if you start with a formal star product, by very definition, you have an algebra. By the very definition, you have an algebra, right? Our series with a star product becomes an algebra. So, are there an algebra here? My definition that I gave you doesn't give you an algebra. Is there an algebra here? The answer is yes, there is an algebra, or almost. There is a partial algebra. So, why is there a partial algebra? So, if we go to the beginning, to the definition, here, you see that there is this associativity, there is an open for which this associativity holds somehow micro-local. So, the way to define an algebra is you fix an open. An open, let's say, containing the zero section, and you define, you look at the set of semi-classical smooth functions for which the wavefront, the semi-classical wavefront set is containing those. Okay, and now we identify things. We identify things that are microlocally equal. So, equation by the equivalence relation of being micro-locally equal. And now I attempt to say that if I have two functions here, I will define, or two classes, I will define their product to be the star product. But to do this, I need to have I need to have that the wavefront set of the star product is contained. So if it's contained in dollar. So that's the domain of multiplication. So the domain of multiplication is the pairs. such that this condition faults not for every pair anyone of the package now when you have a partial algebra where the domain is only definite the the multiplication is only defined on some domain the fact that three associativity holds doesn't imply that four associativity holds Four associativity holds. This is a very general statement because this is a very simple thing. If you look at sociativity for four elements, for some product, you have this pentagon. So let's say I have four elements for some operation. So I can start moving using three associativity. Right? So uh each of these is just using three associativity. But now it's It can happen that this is definite, this is definite, but say this and this is not. So, you cannot conclude from three associativity that this and these are equal, even if they are definite. Okay? So, free associativity does not imply four associativity, four associativity does not imply five associativity, and so on. So go back. The next theorem says the following. This algebra, partial algebra, if it is globally associative, meaning that n associativity holds for any n, then the local simplicity group point that I get, right? Remember, if I have a non-formal star product. And no formal star product, I get a local sympletic group point. That local sympletic group point actually embeds in a global sympletic group point, and therefore your Poisson manifold is infinite. So this is suggesting that if I want to have no formal deformation quantization by an honest algebra, it implies the Poisson for this integral. And that was the slogan at the beginning of the talk that you may have to do quantization, you may need to go into partial algebra. So that's it. Thank you.
