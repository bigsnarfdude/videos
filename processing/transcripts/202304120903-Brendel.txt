Joel Steve is going to talk about toric reduction and applications. Thank you very much, and thanks to the organizers. I'm really happy to be here. This is supposed to be an introductory lecture to Jondl's talk that will happen later on in the morning. So please don't hesitate if you have questions. It should be somewhat elementary and accessible to people who are maybe not. To people who are maybe not experts on this topic. So I will try to sneak in some of my research at the end or some questions that I'm interested in. But up until now, please, or up until then, please feel free to ask questions. Alright, so the title is Tauric Reduction. So I will explain those two words in the first two paragraphs of my talk. And let me start with the second word, so with symplectic. So, with symplectic reduction. And here I'll be focusing on, so it's a much more general thing, but here I'll be focusing on the case where the Hamiltonian group action is just a circle action. But in a much more general context, you can look at symplectic reduction for general Hamiltonian group actions. So I start with a symplectic manifold equipped with a smooth autonomous Hamiltonian. Autonomous Hamiltonian. And if you have such a thing, you can build a vector field xh from it, which is called the Hamiltonian vector field. And this gives you a flow. You have to make sure that it's defined for all times, imposing some conditions, but I'll suppose that this is true. And I call such a triple A Hamiltonian circle action if after time one, so this is the time. If after time one, so this is the time one map of the flow, it's equal to the identity, meaning that you come back to the identity after time one. And this obviously induces a circle action. So if you just put the S1 component here into the time slot, this gives you a circle action. And the question for symplectic reduction is: can you make Can you make sense of taking a quotient by this action in some reasonable way? And you can sort of convince. So in the best and the best of all cases, you would like this quotient to be a symplectic manifold as well. So sort of, you cannot just take a quotient of the whole manifold because even the dimension will be wrong. If you just divide out x by s1, you'll end up with some. X by S1, you'll end up with something called dimension. So there's no way to get a syntactic manifold. And also Hamiltonian actions tend to have fixed points. Like if you look at Hamilton's equation, you see that if you have a critical point of h, then you get a fixed point of the action because the vector field will vanish at the point. And so, in particular, on compact manifolds, you expect fixed points. On compact manifolds, you expect fixed points, and you have to have fixed points because there's at least a minimum and a maximum. But you can solve those two problems by not looking at the action on all of the manifolds, on all of x, but by restricting to a level set of your Hamiltonian. And since H is preserved under its Hamiltonian flow, the action actually restricts to level states. So this kind of thing may. So, this kind of thing makes sense. And if this action is, so this is kind of a famous theorem, if this action is free, then the quotient space carries a natural symplectic form. This is what we call the symplectic quotient or the symplectic reduced space. The whole procedure is called symplectic reduction. And it's one of those things that it's not very hard to prove once you know that such a thing. Once you know that such a thing should exist, you can just sit down and just go through the steps. Because here you get a two-form when you restrict to this thing, which is invariant under the action. And then you see that it projects down to a symplectic form. You have to sort of think a bit why it's non-degenerate, but it turns out that it is. So let's look at the next. Let's look at an example, which is kind of the standard example. I take Cn plus 1, and the Hamiltonian that I look at is just sum of the norms squared of the components. And if you plug this into Hamilton's equation, you find that this defines a circle action. defines a circle action just by rotation. So you have n copies of, or n plus one copies of C, and in each of the copies you just rotate by the same speed. Obviously this comes back to the identity after some time. Here you just have to put some normalization pi so that you get period one. And you see, so let's plug this stuff all into this reduction. Fall into this reduction diagram. Well, if we look at the level set here, if you look at h, you see that the level set will be a sphere. And if you divide out this diagonal circle action from the sphere, you end up with CPN by definition kind of of what CPN is one of the possible definitions of CPN. But what's interesting here is that you get the symplectic form on CPN for free, sort of, or once you know that. Sort of, or once you know that symplectic production makes sense, then you get a nice symplectic form on CPM, which is called the Fubini-Studi forms, or FS. And sort of this C you choose, the level you choose, sort of is just a scaling of the, gives you just a scaling of the forms, some kind of nomenclature. Okay, so this is a very elegant way to get the Foginus 341 CPS. CP2. This will be our favorite example, so I will talk a lot about CB2 in this talk. Right. So in this talk, I'll also be interested in Lagrangian submanifolds. So let's discuss a bit how they interact with this symplectic reduction procedure. But just to recall, for those who are maybe not symplectic geometers, a Lagrangian is just a sub-manifold of half the dimension of the ambient space. Of half the dimension of the ambient space, so that omega vanishes on its tangent, on its tangent bond. And then you have a nice fact, namely there's a correspondence between Lagrangians upstairs, which are contained in the level set, and Lagrangians downstairs in the reduced space. Namely, if you take any Lagrangian downstairs, you can look at its pre-image under the You can look at its pre-image under the projection map. It will automatically be a Lagrangian. There's nothing to check. And the other way around, if you take a Lagrangian contained in this level set, you can check that it's automatically invariant under the group action, and it projects to Lagrangian density. So there's this correspondence. And we will use this to construct interesting Lagrangians later on. Sort of related. Sort of related fact is that if you have a Hamiltonian, let's say you have another Hamiltonian system upstairs on X, such that the Poisson bracket with H, so H is still the Hamiltonian general with circle action, such that the Poisson bracket vanishes, then you get a reduced system, a reduced Hamiltonian system downstairs. So you get a well-defined, you can check that you get a well-defined function. A well-defined function, which I don't know, they have C on the reduced space. And it has a nice property, namely, if you apply the flow of F upstairs and then project, it gives you the same answer as projecting and then applying the new flow downstairs. Which is something that physicists use a lot because it allows you, if you have a system with symmetry, you can sort of go to a system with Of go to a system with less degrees of freedom, which is somehow, in some cases, easier to solve. My favorite example is the cherical pendulum. Servical pendulum gives you four-dimensional system on the cotangent bundle of S2. But it has some symmetry because you can rotate the sphere and sort of gravitational potential is invariant under this rotation. So then you can divide out by this, this gives you Hamiltonian S1 action, you can divide out. This gives you a Hamiltonian S1 action, you can divide out and solve the system on a surface instead of on a four-dimensional thing, which is much, much easier somehow to attack. And this will also use spectroscopic. Right, so are there any questions for plexic reduction? There will be many more examples later on in the Tori context. So let's move on to Tauric manifolds. So let's take a symplectic manifold and this is called toric if you have a moment map having certain properties. So moment map is a smooth map going to Rn where it's very important that n is half of the dimension of x. Dimension of x. Satisfying, so μ has to satisfy the following properties. First of all, all of the components of μ have to generate Hamiltonian S1 actions. So you have n of those actions that we discussed before. And they have to be mutually compatible, so their bus on bracket should vanish. Boisson bracket vanishing means implies Bracket vanishing means, implies in particular that you can first apply the flow along along, let's say, first component of mu, then the flow along the second component of mu. It gives you the same answer as first flowing along the second component, then along the first component. So the Hamiltonian flows will commute. This is a consequence of this. In particular, if you have those two conditions, this will define a TN action by just flowing along. By just flowing along all of the, so if you take an element in Tn, so the n torus, it's just n elements in the circles. And you can flow along the first flow for time t1, along the second flow for time t2, and so on. And this condition tells you that the flows commute. So you can get a well-defined Tn action on the metaphor. On the benefit. This is called Hamiltonian, Hamiltonian Tn action. And one more condition for it to be toric is that this Tn action be effective. Effective means that if you have a non-trivial element in the group, it has to act non-trivially on the space. Only the neutral element does not, acts by the idea. Element does not act by the identity on the space. Okay, this is sort of a lengthy definition, but what will matter for us today is the following. So I'll give you the key facts about toric manifolds. First, there is this nice theorem by classical thing, independently proved by Attia and Gilmar Schunberg in the 80s, which says that the image of the moment map will not be just any set. Map will not be just any set, but it will be actually a convex rational polytope in Rn. So, something very specific. Okay, so here is the word convex for the words. I've done my duty now and I open that. Just normal order. Oh my god, that's the correct order. Up to me. Up to me. Right. It also commutes. So, but okay, this theorem is actually much more general. It holds for any Hamiltonian torus action. So not necessary. The torus doesn't have to be half of the dimension of the manifold, or be effective for that matter. But if you have a toric, if you have a toric, if you're in the toric case, then something If you're in the Tori case, then something much stronger is true. This is a theorem by Delson. Namely, if you are in the Tori case, then the moment polytope is... So by the way, this is called the moment polytope, just saying. If you are in the Tori case, then the moment polytope actually classifies the space. So if you have two toric manifolds and their moment polytopes are the same up to translation and lettuce, And lattice transformations, then the symplectic toric manifolds have to be the same equivariantly as symplectic manifolds, but also equipped with the TN action. And this is a very strong thing because it tells you that in the toric case, you can sort of there's a certain philosophy, namely, you should be able to translate all of the symplectic topology, whatever you. The symplectic topology, whatever you're looking at, be it capacities or anything, any sort of thing that might be very hard to compute in a general context, for general symplectic manifolds, in the toric context you should be able to reduce it to some features of the polytope, because the polytope sees all of the symplectic geometry of the space. So there's this sort of there should be some kind of game where whatever you look at, there should be translation into language of. Translation into language of auditors. And this is sort of something that I'm personally sort of motivated by this sort of thing. And just one more thing on the geometry of the moment map. So you can think of it as a singular vibration where the points of the Where the points of the polytope are exactly the orbits of the Tn action. And it looks a bit as follows. So, this is kind of a sketch. If you look at a point over the interior of the moment polytope, the corresponding fiber will be a TN torus sitting in an N torus sitting inside of the manifold, which will be a brown gem. But then, if you move to the boundary, what happens is that some of the circles are Some of the circles on the torus will collapse. So you'll have a lower dimensional tori sitting over the strata of the boundary. They'll all be isotropic, but of course, since they are of lower dimension, they won't necessarily be lagrunic. And then if you move to even lower strata of the boundary, so for example into a vertex, you find just a fixed point of the action. So the fiber is just a point, but I told you that the points are exactly the orbits. You that the points are exactly the orbits. So, in this case, it's a fixed one. This is one point. Right, so this is a picture to keep in mind somehow. Okay, let's look at some examples. So, the easiest example and the only two-dimensional example if you are looking for compact toric manifolds is S. So, for the two-sphere, the moment map is just given by. So, I'm thinking of the two-sphere as sitting in cycle R3 for simplicity. The symplectic form is just the area form that you see from the inclusion. And then I'm projecting to maybe, for example, the Z component of the sphere. And this actually gives you a moment map which rotates the sphere by a solid rotation around this. By a solid rotation around the z-axis. And so the orbits will be just circles of constant height. And you see that when you move, so the moment polytope is just a segment in this case, because that's half the dimension of the space. It's just a segment. And you see that if you move to one of the two boundary points, corresponding fibers will be just fixed points of the action, north pole and south pole. Right. And second example would be CP2, and you can give some formula for the moment map, which is not too important for us, but this generates some circle action, some T2 action, which is just given by inhomogeneous coordinates, rotation around in the second and last coordinate. That last coordinate. And the moment polytope will be a triangle. The formula is not so important for us because I'll be trying to convince you that there's a more conceptual way of viewing the historic structure than just writing down a formula. And this is what I'm trying to do here. So let's go back. If you forget about the red. If you forget about the red stuff for now, and just look at this diagram here, we've already seen this for Cpn in general. So you see that you obtain Cp2 as a symplectic reduction of C3. But then on C3, you have a natural T3 action. Just by rotation, I mean, this is the most obvious thing you can do. You have three copies of C, and in each of the copies of C, you do rotation by a certain angle. You do rotation by a certain angle. So you have three angles, it's a T, gives you T X. And this is generated by just this moment map here, which for each of the components of Cn, you just map to norm squared of the corresponding component. You can check if you plug this into your Hamilton's equation again that it just generates the rotation. And now you can observe something, namely H, this Hamiltonian that we used for the symplectic reduction to get to Cp2, it's built out of those components of nu, of the moment map here. And this in particular means that the H will commute with the component. With the components of μi. And since, so this, there was this slide about Hamiltonian systems, which are compatible with the group action. So here we are in this case. We are in the case where this Poisson bracket vanishes. And this means that ν gives a well-defined map on CP2. And this map still generates a Hamiltonian T3 action on T3 action on CP2. The only thing that we have to sort of watch out for is that this action won't be effective because think of this T3 and inside of it sits the diagonal circle by which we divide out. So in the quotient, of course, the diagonal circle won't act, I mean, will act trivially. Won't act, I mean, will act trivially. So, this diagonal circle is sort of redundant in the action on the quotient, so we can divide out by it and get a well-defined T2 action on Cp2. And this turns out to be effective, and it turns out to be toric, and generated sort of by the by the quotient map of by the corresponding map, um the map corresponding to nu on the quotient. New on the project. So this induces a toric structure on CP2. The point being here that we're sort of using the fact that there's this toric structure on C3 and we're projecting it to the core. And this is called Delson's construction, so it's pretty old. In this Delzan theorem, In this Delson theorem, you have to have a way to get back from. I mean, you can map from your toric manifold to the polytope, but since there is this one-to-one correspondence, you have to show that if you were given a polytope, you can reconstruct the toric manifold. And this is the recipe that Delzon came up with, essentially, applied to the examples. And sort of the rest of the and this is an example also. And this is an example also of what I would call toric reduction. So you have something toric, you apply symplectic reduction, and you get a toric quotient. So are there any questions? I'm sorry, so where is the information about the polytope? And where did you use you're trying to explain how to go from the polytope to the toric structure? Not on this type, I guess. Right. This time, I guess. Right. I will come back to that later. Yes. That was the use at least by Dalison, how we use this recipe. Right, so let's move on to word reduction. So, in the same spirit as this previous example, you can Example, you can take just any toric action on a space X and fix a circle inside of Tn. Circle will be determined just by fixing an integral direction in Rn. So I will use this vector xi here to denote which circle I'm talking about. And if you have a toric action, and you look at this subgroup formed by a circle, then the induced action of, of course you get an action, I mean if you just take this inclusion first and then act on x, you get an action of the circle on x. And this will automatically be Hamiltonian as well. And the Hamiltonian function generating Function generating it, it's just given by the sum of xi times nui. So it's a very sort of straightforward thing. Then, let's say we want to carry out symplectic reduction with respect to this S1. Then you have the following, and maybe this is coming back to your question a bit. So let's say this black polytope here is. This black polytope here is the moment polytope of X. Then, if we want to see where the level sets map of the Hamiltonian, well, the Hamiltonian is just formed by the inner product of mu with psi. So this means that if you look at level sets, it will be planes or hyperplanes orthogonal to psi. So you're cutting out sort of, by hyperplanes, you're cutting out sub-polytopes of. out sub-polytopes of the original point. And so this is what I wrote here. Plus, again, since your H is built out of components of the mu i, as before in the example, you get this fact that the plus song bracket vanishes and get a well-defined moment map on the reduced space. Then you do the Then you do the same thing as before. You get a TN action, but it's not effective. There's this redundancy here. And you get rid of the redundancy by basically dividing alpha by minus S1. You get a copy of Tn minus 1. And this gives you a toric structure on the quotient, and its moment map image will be exactly the polytope that's cut out by the hyperblock. And the conclusion is sort of something. And the conclusion is sort of something very nice. Namely, on one hand, you have this toric reduction procedure, but you can translate it to some fact about the corresponding moment polytopes. So if you have an inclusion, so sort of it corresponds to reduction from X to X C to the reduced space corresponds to an inclusion of the moment polytope of X C into the moment polytope of X. C into the moment polytop of x. So there's this nice correspondence where you can just read off everything from the. So this is sort of the Delson philosophy again, that you should be able to read off things from the point. There's just a few things to watch out for. So not every one of those inclusions gives you a nice, gives you a toric reduction because you have to check this condition that the action be To check this condition that the action be free on the sort of level set that you're restricting to. So, what may, for example, happen is you're not allowed to run into a vertex of the ambient polytope with your, for example, you're not allowed to run into a vertex of your ambient polytope with the thing you're trying to cut out. Because the vertex corresponds to a fixed point, so you cannot. There, the action won't be free. And so, this is just an example. There are other things that can go wrong. The condition you need to impose for this to work out is the following one. So, maybe forget about the text for now and just look at the picture. So, if you're trying to, so here I'm drawing an edge, so this is supposed to be an edge of the ambient polytone, and the red thing is what I'm trying to. The red thing is what I'm trying to, the sub-polytope that I'm trying to consider here. The condition that you need to satisfy is that you can find a lattice basis, so basis of Zn, in the union of the edge, so this is the edge E that I'm intersecting, union with the sub-polytope delta prime. This is the condition that you need to have. If this is satisfied at all of the vertical, If this is satisfied at all of the vertices of the sub-polytope, then you get an admissible toric reduction. We'll see in examples how this works. So this basically tells you that the action will be free. So here is a theorem to sort of summarize what we just discussed. If you have such a sub-polytope here of Sub-polytope here of a certain moment polytope, toricotoric moment polytope. And this inclusion is admissible, so you check this condition on all of its vertices. Then the action is free and you can perform syntax production. Your quotient is automatically toric and its moment polytope will be this sub-polytope. And just a few remarks. So, again, I restrict my attention. Remarks, so again, I restrict my attention to only circle actions, but the same thing is true for any sub-torus of Tn. And secondly, I'm not claiming that this is new, it's maybe just new in this sort of formulation here, but sort of there were many special cases that were known before, and this just puts them all together into a framework. So as I mentioned, the Delazon construction is a special case. Construction is a special case. Then there are these probes by Macduff, which she used to display storic fibers, which are a special case of this. And there's a nice paper by Abru and Macarini, who also use this kind of procedure to get to say something about displaceability of trail fibers. So, can I ask a question about design construction? Can I ask a question about design construction? Sure. Are you claiming that any toric manifold is a symplectic production of CN? Yeah, that's the claim. Yes. Right. Plus, the toric structure is really the structure that you inherit from Cn. So let's go back to the example here. So, what's the relationship between this polytope and the sort of moment polytope that So the moment polytope, that n non-compact moment polytope of C three is just a positive orthant. So it's just this whole positive orthant here. I didn't draw it, but. And then if you look at what the Hamiltonian was, the Hamiltonian was just a sum of components. So the sum of those three components. So if you fix the sum to be constant, those three components, you're just cutting out a triangle. And this tells you that. And this tells you that the moment polytope of Cp2 will be this triangle here. And you can verify that sort of the condition is satisfied. Like these vectors here form a letter spaces. So are there any questions? I would move on to patients. One part of the time. Okay. Okay, so first application. This is something that I like a lot. So the question is the following one. So you have this, you have a toric manifold, and you know that over each point in the interior, you find a Lagrangian torus. So for point x, I know denoted by tx. And those are called toric fibers. And you can ask a very naive question about toric fibers, namely, well, there's a bunch of them, there's a pod. Well, there's a bunch of them, there's a polytope's worth of them, so you can ask which ones of them are equivalent in a suitable way. So, which ones can be mapped to one another by a symplectomorphism of the ambient space? Very natural classification question. And in the literature, there were some answers. For example, very nice paper by Chekhanov. If you look at the special case of Cn. At the special case of Cn, the toric fibers will just be product. So since the moment map is just the norms of the component square, in each of the copies of C, you'll just see a circle. And those are called the product, right? And he classified them in this 96 paper. So this is a full classification. And there's one other result that I found in the literature. Result that I found in the literature for CPN, for CP2, sorry, for CPN, I don't know the answer by the way, for CP2, which goes back to Schellogrin, Tonkenoch and Biana. And then I recently put out something on the archive which solves the question for most four-dimensional examples, so gives a full classification there. But the higher dimensions are still a mystery to me. Higher dimensions are still a mystery to me. So I can say some things, I can give some obstructions, can tell you some, give you some equivalent fibers, but the full classification is, I don't know, it's still in there. So I'll give a four-dimensional example later on. But for now, so let's just look at S2, so the most naive thing you can do. And there you see that. You see that if you have a circle that's not the equator, so the equator is a bit special, if you have one of those height circles that's not the equator, then it comes with a partner because you can just swap the sphere. And I mean, in dimension two, the symplectomorphism group just sees the areas sort of the level close by the curves. So this curve here can be mapped to this curve down here. So they come in parison. This looks naive. This looks naive, but it's a crucial observation because now we can combine it with story production. So let's say we have a moment polytope here, and let's say this red segment is an admissible thing cut out by a line, in the sense that I gave before. So let's say you can find a lattice basis. A lattice basis, if you take this vector here in the red direction and in the edge direction, then your reduced space will be a two-sphere. And the toric fibers map to circles of constant height. So if you have one of those things, you can exchange in the reduced space. You can flip the sphere, apply a Hamiltonian isotopy. There's a procedure to lift the Hamiltonian isotopy back to the ambient space and check. Space and check that in the ambient space it exchanges the two corresponding toric fibers. So if you have one of those things and they are at equal distance to the boundary here, up here and down here, those distances should be the same, then they are Hamiltonian isotopic. So this gives you a nice recipe to produce them because you can iterate this procedure. You can, let's say, start with Tx and then go to Ty, then maybe there's another probe here, and you can bring Ti. Here, and you can bring Ty over to the right-hand side and so on, and sort of iterate this sort of thing. Those things are called symmetric probes. They were actually used before. So a regular probe is the same as this, but without the condition on one of the two ends. So you're just requiring one of the two ends to have this nice admissibility condition. At the other end, you don't care about conversion. At the other end, you don't care about conversion. They're also useful. And the symmetric version was defined in this sort of follow-up paper by Adwar Borman and McDuff. They were used for a different purpose, but you can also use them for an example to convince you that this is an interesting problem. First, you can look at the monotone as. First, you can look at the monotone S2 times S2. So remember that S2 maps to a segment. So S2 times S2 maps to segment cross-segment. So you have a square. You'll have a square as a moment map image. And let's start with this blue fiber here. And you can see that there are, you can convince yourself that there are three symmetric probes, one, a vertical one, a horizontal one, and sort of diagonal. A horizontal one and sort of diagonal one here. And then by iterating this, by iterating these probes, so if you take the diagonal one, you'll map the first blue point here. By taking the horizontal one, you'll map it here. By taking the vertical one, you'll map it here. And then by iterating it, you find that there are there's a set of eight equivalent fibers. And you can show that this is actually the answer. There are no other fibers which are equivalent. No other fibers which are equivalent to those two ones. So it gives a sort of this construction, gives a complete answer. Right. Ambient symplecton. Sorry? Is it not amazing isentical fuse? Yeah, it's it's so toric manifolds are simply connected, so it's almost the same. So if you take if you look at the um connected component. Connected component of the identity of the simple ectomorphism group, and it's equal to the Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. So it would be just a question about connected components of the simple ectomorphism group. But actually, okay, you're right. The actual question that I address in the paper is for Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. So let's say the equivalents are Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, but they're closed for toyomorphism. Okay, you can say this example looks boring because it's just the symmetries of the square, right? So you might have guessed that this is the answer. But then in the non-monotone case, so if you go to rectangle, so you're scaling one of the, giving a different scaling to one of the copies of S2, then it becomes much more interesting because then you have sort of, you can play billiards with. With your points. Because these diagonal things are all admissible probes. And if you iterate them, it's exactly a billiard trajectory in sort of a smaller rectangle. You don't see it here. I didn't draw it. But there's a smaller rectangle on which those blue points lie. And they are equivalent if and only if there's a billiard trajectory where the blue points are the bouncing points. But then you know that something interesting. But then you know that something interesting happens because if you play billiards in an irrational sort of rectangle, like an irrational ratio, then you'll have accumulation points. So here's something interesting happens, namely you fix, if you are in the irrational case, if you fix the blue point, look in any small neighborhood of the corresponding toric fiber, you'll always see other toric fibers that are Hamiltonian. Other toric fibers that are Hamiltonian diffeomorphic to the one you started with by using the ambient space. Which is sort of the issue condition just determines the lines you're using, but to use other possibilities. Are there other possibilities as long as you're you could take for example Let's draw some. You can take any slope that's integer. So this would be allowed, this would be allowed, as long as you're hitting, sorry, as long as you're hitting, actually here it wouldn't be allowed, as long as you're hitting the opposite, so this would be an admissible problem. If you're hitting the opposite edge. But if you're hitting this one, it won't be allowed. Because Because here it it won't form an integral basis. I think there are at least a few other slopes you could use to define. Yes, that's right. But you can prove that you only need those to produce all of the equivalences. You only need the billiard projectors. So it's really building. Okay, the theorem is now that those are the actual classifications. So the probes give the those symmetric probes give the full answer. So if you were to look at the semi-group of areas of Maslov2 disks that he's found, is that somehow I'm just saying that they can you repeat this semi-cloud? So as for each of the points you could sort of look at the the areas of all Maslow tubes that they found. Right. And then maybe look at like the semiconductor generated by those areas. Those areas somehow, or could it be somehow of the same debate on the same so this is one of the invariants that you would use, but it's not enough, I think. Yes, what you're saying is one of the invariants to distinguish, I mean, to go the other direction is easy. There could be some which kind of all areas of this look the same, but nevertheless, they can't be. Yes, if you're just looking at what you said at the semi-group, there are examples where. So maybe I can give the invariance after the talk, like the invariance that I used to yes. So this there's a second application. I hope I hope. Well, okay, maybe I'll go two or three minutes over time, but it should be fun. The other application would be construction of exotic tori. So let me explain what this is. We can restrict our attention to CP2 for simplicity. So you have this bunch of toric fibers. You have this whole triangle of toric fibers. And now you can ask: are there other Lagrangian toric? Ask, are there other Lagrangian tori in this space? So, are there tori that cannot be mapped by a simple ectomorphism to one of the ones that we already studied? And the answer is yes. And this is the same paper that I mentioned before by Chekhanov. In C2, he constructed the first example of such a torus. So, in C2, you would say it's not equivalent to one of the products, alright? And then there's a later paper where this by Chekhov and Schleng, where this torus is constructed in CP2. They show that in CP2 it's the same phenomenon, so it's not equivalent to one of the toric fibers. And then there was a breakthrough a few years ago by Jana, who showed that there are actually infinitely many monotone tori which are mutual. Which are mutually distinct and not equivalent to one of the toric fibers. So I won't discuss this infinity today, but I will just give a construction of the checkout of Taurus in the case of CB2. Just to give you an idea. So we take this standard. We take this standard, this moment map of CP2 and we fix a Hamiltonian to carry out the toric reduction, which will be mu1 minus mu2. So its level sets will be those red segments here. But now you have, we have sort of a problem because so if you look, let's look at this segment here, for example. Down here, Down here, it will be admissible. So, if you sort of look at this vector here and this vector here, you see that they generate a lattice basis, but up here it's not the case. This is not a lattice basis. So, here, the group action that you try to divide out on the corresponding fiber will have stabilizer Z2. That to stabilize. You can still do it, you can still sort. Do it, you can still sort of set up some symplectic reduction which gives you an orbifold as reduced space. So you'll have for this segment here, actually every segment except the main diagonal here, so for c equals zero it will be different, but every other segment will give you a two-sphere with an order to orbit full point. So it looks a bit like this. So it looks a bit like this. And so let's try to come up with an exotic torus. And the way I want to do it is I take a circle in this reduced space and then look at its pre-image. Because it's a circle, the pre-image will be a torus because you're just adding the S1 action upstairs. But here you can see, so the toric fiber. See, so the toric fibers map to those green circles here. So, here you can see that we're not very successful because if we take any other circle and we lift it, it will always be Hamiltonian isotopic. You can just Hamiltonian isotope it in the smooth part of the obicold to be equal to one of those green circles here. You just need to look at the area that it that it balances and then you know which one of the green ones it is. So this is not successful. So this is not successful. In this way, we cannot get an exotic tourist, because we already see in the reduced space that they will be equivalent. But then let's move to the case where we do symplectic reduction on this main diagonal here, so for c equals zero. Because there, there's this fixed point in the fixed point on the vertex, which is in the pre-image, which is somehow forbidden by what I said before, but let's do it anyway. I said before, but let's do it anyways. So we can remove this fixed point from the level set and still perform syngalactic reduction on its complement. Then we'll end up with a sort of punctured teardrop, like a punctured reduced space. The same as before, but now this blue point is removed. Because over it there would be this sort of single. There would be this sort of singularity point. And now it looks a bit more promising because, so now you can look at this circle here, this red circle, and now at least it's not obviously Hamiltonian isotopic to one of the green ones you already have. So at least now we have a candidate. And this is the actual definition. This is one of the possible definitions of the Chicano of Taurus. So you take this loop, this red loop. You take this loop, this red loop here, which sits sort of nicely in the smooth part of the loose space, lift it back, it gives you a torus, and this is the genomic. And you can prove that actually this lift gives you an exotic torus. This is the hard part. Proving that even in the ambience so here you just see that in reduced space it's not equivalent, but in the ambient space you have much more room to carry out things. Uh so um this is the hard part to prove that this is This is the hard part. Okay. So there's one more. I'm almost done. I think there's two slides left. There's one more thing that Johnny wanted me to mention. If you take this sort of reduced space at c equals zero and you look at a segment connecting the Connecting the orbifold point to the puncture, its pre-image will be. So look at the open segment. We're not thinking about, so for now we don't think about orbifold point and order puncture. Just as an open segment, its pre-image will be a Lagrangian cylinder. But you can prove that if you add back the fixed point, it actually compactifies the cylinder down here to a smooth disk. To a smooth disk. So, this is something you need to check in an open model, for example. So, you end up with a disk downstairs. And up here, when you run into the orbifold point and you lift it, it will give you a copy of RP1 essentially. You get a circle, but with antipodal identification. So, this gives you a copy of RP2 sitting inside of the RP2 sitting inside of the sitting inside of CP2. It fibers over this red segment here. And I think Johnny will use this picture here for RP2, this presentation of RP2, as a segment in the release space. Okay, just one more thing. The idea to construct exotic Torah in this way can be applied to many more examples. This is sort of what I Samples. This is sort of what I have been doing. So, this is an older result. If you take a monotone compact toric manifold, can at least produce one more exotic torus. So, every one of those guys contains at least one checkout of a type torus, which is not Hamiltonian isotopic to the standard fiber, to the monotone fiber. I would expect there to be infinite. I would expect there to be infinitely many in all of the cases. I don't think CP2 is special in that regard. I think this Viana result applies to all of those, to all of those, to this class of manifolds, but I'm not sure how to prove it for them. And then there's another recent result, which I'm writing up right now. In R6, you can also, using this reduction recipe. Using this reduction recipe, can also produce infinitely many different tori. And this is a result that goes back to Ohu in 2015 for the monotone case. But I managed to prove something slightly more general, namely I produced infinitely many two-parameter families of tori, some of which are non-monotone. So they have a sub-family which is monotone. Monotone, and then there's a two-parameter family of grains which are non-monotone, but still mutually distinct and distinct from the collaborator. And the picture is just very naively this picture here. You send out rays from all of the integer points on the coordinate axis, and you look at the reduced space, at reduced spaces over the Space at reduced spaces over those red, over those red things. And most of them will look like the teardrop before, except for the first and the second one, because they will be non-compact things. And then you can use those reduced spaces and look at the lift of those red circles. And for each integer, it gives you a different two-parameter family of tori, which turns out it's. Turn out something. Are the tori smoothly isotopic with standard ones? Yes. Even they are Lagrangian isotopic with arbitrarily, so they're Lagrangian isotopic. And you can measure Lagrangian. And you can measure Lagrangian isotopes by something that's called flux, and you can make flux arbitrarily small. If you fix a flux bound, it's like they're as close as you can get without using Hamiltonian sort of examples you gave this of Vianatori or some of them correspond to Vianatora. Some of them correspond to Vyanatora ideas. Like the one, I think the one coming from 2, if I remember correctly, is like a lift of the Vianatora. So the Vianatora live in CP2, but you can lift them to CP3, to C3. And one of them corresponds to one of the Vianatora. But the others don't, I think. The others are different. AruzResella doesn't get all the mod on Torre, you know, so you get more dot Dora than more from Aruzel? That's a good question. So I haven't compared, I don't know if my Torai are the same as O'Storai. It's a different construction and a different way of distinguishing them. So it's a completely different way to produce the same. So it would be interesting to check what I have. Actually, the feature value of the Viana Tora actually is nicely made to project the plane. Viana Tora 11 CP2. But there's a degeneration. Right, there's degenerations to. Yeah, that's true, yeah. So that design is good. Right, right, right. Yeah, you take those, yeah, you take those weighted projective planes, which can be smooth to CP. Planes which can be smooth to CP2, just take their standard orbifol toric kind of vibrant and smooth, and then, yeah. Any other questions or comments? Two questions. First, what was the invariant that was necessary to distinguish this torrential case? Are you mean for the classification? Yeah, for the classification. Yeah, for classification, distinguish these classes. Ah, okay, so there's a list of invariants, and if you put all of them together in dimension 4, you sort of have enough information to do it. But it's like the mass loop clause and potential. Yes, so there's, yeah, so what are the invariants? So it's a good question. Areas. So you have, yeah, as you say, you have muscle of an area. Yeah, as you say, you have muscle of an area or soft invariant. And then you have so another invariant is you have another invariant is the sort of minimal distance to the boundary. So if you take this fiber here, if you want it to be equivalent to another fiber, you have to have the same sort of distance to the boundary. So this kind of, this thing here has to be. kind of this thing here has to be equal to this whole thing so it's like a minimal yeah disk area minimal disk area and also the number of number of minimal disks has to be the same so for example this one here which does have the same distance but it occurs twice won't be won't be um won't be equivalent to Be equivalent to the lowest area part of the potential superpotential. Yes, something like that, yes. Something like that. So then, my last question. In these high-dimensional examples, are these tori all related by somehow mutation over by some tori or are they related by some other kind of mutation? Uh, you mean the exotic yes, exotic tori. So so they're all they're all like organising, you say, but They're all like organising, you say, but then probably they're related by mutations. By a root. So the ones that come from the Viana Torai, they're probably related by kind of mutation in the Viana Torai, but then times S1, so it's a hard mutation by just by S1 times holiday. But in the class of examples that I gave, there's only one that corresponds to double choice. Okay, just only one. There's only one, yes, yes. But anyway, they're only nice topics, so they're double-timeliness. Ice topics that are not Hamiltonian usually go through some kind of singular torus. And if that singular torus is kind of collapsed, solid torus, or if it's not kind of collapsed. Ah, yeah, I can even give, I mean, yeah. I can even give the Lagrangian a subtlety and say which collapsed torus it goes. Okay. Yeah. But even I haven't checked for I think it's a collapsed two torus or it's a collapsed uh yes it's a three torus that's that's pinched in one of It's it's pinched in one of the gener in one of the circ in a circle. But the circle in which it's pinched changes with respect to the general yoga. Okay. Thanks for having me again. And we have copyright, and let's probably start.
