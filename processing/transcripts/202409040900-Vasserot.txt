So I will first uh begin to recall some basic factor relating to quiver varieties. So I will say quivers so uh we begin with uh with quiver Q with vertices uh I and uh set of rows uh omega and we Omega, and we take the pre-projective algebra, so which is the path, the quotient of the pass algebra of the double quiver by the moment map relation. And so you fix V, which is a E-graded vector space, finite dimensional, graded finite-dimensional vector space of a C. And you consider the space. The space of representation, so the V-dimensional representation of the objective algebra on V. So it's representations of pi. And on this, there is an action of a group, several groups. There is first G V, which is a product of the linear groups. Where a Vi is a component, the I is a component of V, which acts, so it acts by conjugations, by conjugation. And there is some torus. So C star mega plus one. So uh so this this part acts so the it acts by uh by uh rescaling the rozone. By rescaling the rows. So each time you have a matrix here which corresponds to the action of an arrow in the quiver or in the double, you can rescale this arrow by the scalar and the opposite arrow by the opposite scalar. This gives uh uh a symplectic action and a plus one is for the uh a non symplectic one which delays the symplectic form. Which delays your sympathetic form. And so, and I will fix T', a torus, a sub torus, any sub torus, with some conditions, but I will not enter the details. And so, we can consider what is more convenient to discuss all this is to use stacks. So, I will write uh this, which is a quotient of uh Of V by this V. So this stack, a quotient stack. And so in this setting, so I will denote by dv the dimension of it and I will consider so um so T prime V L V L so it's the Borelmo homology equivariant with respect to T prime and I normalize the Tegger like this. So it's a Boylmor homology and you put so VAL corresponds to some cutting, you take the sum over all VAL. You take the sum over all the L and it produces Zi cross Z vector space, radiant vector space of T prime and it appears that this vector space has a gradient algebra structure So it's an algebra over the homology of the torus. So you this is the cohomology of the classifying, and this should be understood as some parameter, as some deformation parameters. And so the way to construct the product comes from you have what we call an induction gram. So, like this. So, here you take the flags of representation. You take, so this is a flag of the So this is a flag of V prime contained in V plus V prime. So you set representation of the big space which preserves this one. And you have this is associated graded and this is just a forgetting of the flag. So this map is representable and proper. So you can use a direct image. And this one's And uh and this one, so here there is a a delicate question. Is that uh this one a priori the you would like to do the the pullback, but it is not not defined. Especially because this map is is uh is very badly behaved, it is not uh it is not uh what is called LCI, it's uh not smooth, it's not regular, it's uh very badly behaved, and so to And so to define the product, you have to do some operation. So there are several ways to describe it. Perhaps the most convenient way is to use a derived geometry. It is not necessary. It's not the original formulation, but it is perhaps the easier to describe. So what you say is that this is the property GT Vangeras. So this is a proportion algebra. There is a it is not that the prepotigitive projective algebra is not tukalabi Au, but there is a a derived analogue which is tukalabi Au. So there is what is called the derived preprojective algebra which it is easy to define, it's just uh Easy to define, it's just in substance you have to derive this moment map equation. So it's not an algebra, it's a DG algebra. So it's a non-positive complex and the usual pre-projective algebra corresponds to the hash nut. And this is better behaved for some purpose than the preposition. For some purpose, than the preprojective algebra, and you take the representation stacks of this instead of PQ. So it produced a derived analog. And this diagram admits a derived analog. And if you pass to the derived analog, this map becomes, the corresponding map becomes a complete intersection. And so you can perform the And you can perform the and you obtain what is called a virtual pullback. Okay, so this is one way to define. So the result. The result is that if you write this, so you obtain an associative algebra on y. So as I So, as I wrote. And so, what are the proper I will not so excuse me? I should say also. So, this is not the. There may be some confusion. It is not the Koncevich Sobelmanner. Not Koncevich Sobelmann Coa. So, it is what is called. So it is what is called uh but uh it is also called uh the pre-projective qua result. So it was uh it has some so uh you can see you can see this preprojective coherence a particular case of uh the conceivable main cohort like this which corresponds to to taking what are called triple quivers and uh and and uh and triple potential. Potential. But it appears that there is an independent theory for this one. There are some specific things which I do not have a clear analog in the other case. So I concentrate on this one and not. Okay. So a few properties which are important. First, it First, it it acts as this algebra acts at the homology of quivarieties. So, with the standard notation, say you if you take the you so if you take the homology G w cross T prime so So these are usual notation of Nakashi mask with a variety, W is a framing. So you have some representation of this. This is an important property. And the second important property is that this coa is nothing, is closely related to Molik Propunkov Jambian. So So what is of the quiver queue? It means that using stable, which is defined using a stable envelope, it means that this young admits a triangular decomposition. And so the So the the the coa here is isomorphic to the positive part and the negative part is isomorphic to a slightly different version which is what is called the nil proton cohere so it means that you you do everything the same but here instead of taking the stack of representation you take Of taking the stack of representation, you take the stack of nilpotent representation, nilpotent in an old state, so it is the same as the spherical cora, which was mentioned two days ago. So, this is this is a morphism, I should say. This is uh due to several people. So, it uh there is two proofs. There is one by Schiffman and me, and another by uh Boota. Another buyer, a bottle and a division. So, what interests us more today is indeed the case of the Jordan Quiver, which was mentioned several times in this work conference. And so I will take so T in this case is just C star cos C star and so the homology the deformation ring its polynomial ring is free uh in two variables uh it is uh the change free. And uh so you you have uh uh an algebra which you have uh where I will write I consider the affine young the positive part of the affine young of J L one, a fine, so positive part of um um of uh young young Of Jungian of GL15, so which has been considered by several people. So it's simply hook me and Shifman also and Young and Zhao, etcetera, isn't it? Etc. Read that so it's a long list of people. Okay, and so it is generated as an algebra. So it's an algebra over the over this and it is generated by so it is uh z equals z graded. In this case uh the the set of uh The set of is simply one point and so it is generated by elements E n of degree one minus one plus n and so n is better to equal and I will not try the relation so the relation essentially there are one quadratic relation which is Quadratic relation, which is called Drinfeld relation, and there is one cubic relation, which is called Sayre relation. And there is another algebra which uh is involved and which is uh closer to rule. Closer to the talk today is the W1 plus infinity, and same thing. W1 plus infinity as a triangular decomposition, so I consider the positive part. So, this is a positive part. It is a Lie algebra generated by span by span by Z M. with m positive and n greater or equal to zero and d is z d over d c and so the the the the w1 plus infinity algebra is filtered by the degree of the differential so it is uh naturally filtered and so you can consider it's a risk algebra And so you can consider it series algebra that we write okay. So what is uh what is known so what's our gatewayma has uh some history. It comes from several uh the works of several people. I will not try the list. So the first So first there is an algebra an algebra isomorphism from say the positive part uh ah yes plus two um uh what I call y q of uh of t. Of t and what is perhaps more interesting is that if you if you change the the equivalent parameter, so instead of looking to t you look to t prime which is the yagonal so you can specialize the chora to this case and in this case so you have a Nash deprived measure isomorphism from From the universal of looping algebra, there is YQT prime. So, what we are mainly interested today is easy, the part B. So, the region. So the reason is that as so one important fact in all this construction is that we begin with the representation category of the derived preprojective algebra, which is 2 colabio, but there are other 2 calabio categories which are similar to this one. So more precisely Here? There is no thing derived here. What is derived? It is the stack. When you take the homology, say when you derived a stack is as if, or a scheme, you had some nilpotent element in the function ring. You have to think of it as some nil potential sort of nilpotent extent. Nilpotentent, sort of nil potential extension, but in another direction. So there is a theory of Borelmoor homology of derived stack, and the result is that when you take a derived stack, the Borelmoor homology is the same thing as the homology of the non-derived stack. So it means that uh when you look to v uh to to the homology, you do not see anymore the derived stack, but it is i but it it appears in the multiplication. Appears in the multiplication. So this is important. Okay, so what I want to say to say is that we are in the case of Jordan. So in this case, this is simply the committing stack of a GLV. So it means a pair of materials. So, it means a pair of matrices which commutes quotiented by the action of the group. And another way to see it is as punctual coordinate shifts and E2. So it's the same thing. So punctual is the perhaps I will say finite lengths, perhaps less. But it appears that this can be generalized. You can replace it too by a smooth surface. And this category still makes sense. And it is still to Calabio, so you can do the same sort of thing. So it's what I want to discuss. So, so in all these talks, so S will be a smooth casi-conjective surface. And so there is a so I will essentially restrict to the to the project. The projective case, indeed. But for some applications, we need the surface to be not projective. But say the basic theory will explain the construction. If the surface is not projective, at least you have to assume that it is pure in the sense of the linear. Else there are some statements which are problematic. And uh so so I will fix some uh T2 trans root of the surface and so there is a C1 is a T1 plus T2 and C2 is T1 T2 so each time I have a comologic class Chromology class. I can define the stack. So, and so once again, here it will be the derivative stack of current shifts. So, of class alpha, it means that the current the shun character is equal to alpha. Is equal to alpha and plus a proper support when S is not projective and S and so there is a as I sketch both there is a substack the classical one not derived okay So it is a brain morphomology of nippotant representation, some of our probability. So So these are nilpotent representations. So these are all the representations which are which have which are successive extensions of the one-dimensional simple representation in your quiver. Okay? No. No. No, they are almost. No, they're almost there is a the shift of the grading is not just the there are some shifts in the grading, they are not symmetric. If you localize, they become symmetric, but already in the case of if you look to the classical matrix already for the Jordan case, the classical matrix, you will see that uh so uh so it it's uh uh quadratic stuff and the the the left term has not the same degree as the right term, there is a shift. So that's like a big flow. Is this the white part? Why not? Yeah, in this case it's a everything is easy because uh the the class is uh so if you have one uh parameter it's H. It's just a C by H in this case. It's it's easy. Because uh that you have to you have to do elementary modification of the plane. You take the cohomology for example with equivalent cohogy inside the cohomology star of C two equivariant with respect to C star. Equivariant with respect to C star, cos C star, for example, this sort of thing. So you can look either to the commod to the to the fundamental class of the point or the fundamental class of C2. And they differ by something simple, by multiplication by hash1, hash2. And so you have the same thing one in in one half, the other you have echo correspondence with respect to this, the other you have echo correspondence with respect to this. And so there is a shift in the radio. There is a shift in the radical. But you don't see because it's just in this case, it's easy. Okay. Okay. So I want to explain the product. So you could consider an eduction URAM as before for any class. You take a current shift and flag of current shifts in the way you imagine. And so, once again, there is an important fact, which is that this stack, here it's a derived stack and it is smooth in some sense. It is what is called Casi smooth. So, Casi smooth is a derived analog of a complete intersection. And so for this, it's important that S is a surface, a smooth surface. And if you take the classical one, then it is singular. This is singular. And with this, you cannot really do defined induction because it's singular. But this one is smooth, and so the virtual pullback makes sense. And so you can again consider M which is M which is um p star or q factorial and it it defines defines uh an associative algebra algebra structure okay what what uh I confess that uh I can give you some reference but I can give you some reference, but so the idea, I think, is that when you have a modulus space, at some point it comes from some Hamiltonian reduction, somewhere, for example. And when you take the Hamiltonian reduction, sometimes the moment map is not flat or not subjective. Yes, but yes. So the Yes, but yes. So it's my understanding of this. I don't know exactly how you define the stack structure, but when you have some moduli space on curve, for example, you use a code scheme and there are some reduction at some point, and the reduction can be derived. So for surface, I don't know exactly, but either Don't know exactly, but uh, these are some. I can give you some reference if you want. But this it has been considered in particular by Porta and Salon to construct the derivative structure exactly. Okay, so I will take delta in the homology is a class of a point. And uh so I will uh I will rest it uh to find a calc shift, so I will reclaim this. So it's uh a disjoint union of all L positive of uh co uh L delta. L delta S and I take YS to be the homology of this. Okay, so it is again big graded. So one is a comological shift, and the other is this is the length. And so you obtain, and so the when so the first the claim is that so Ys is a Z to Radida algebra with multiplication as before. And with all this choice, with multiplication, you can check that it is homogeneous of degree zero. This can be checked explicitly. And so some more information. So the first construction of this algebra was done by Nian Karpanov. And we vote. So as for the case of Cover, you So, as for the case of Cover, you can do it without using derived geometries, but just using derived geometries simplifies the expression. But you can write directly the induction, the multiplication using universal bundle in some sense. And what we check at the time is that as a vector space, it is a symmetric as a grading vector space of this. You take the cohomology of the surface and you tensor by Qt Q polynomial in two variables and you take the symmetric algebra of this and so and Q as Q is of degree 0 minus 2 and T is of degree 1 1 0 but so So what we are interested is to understand this algebra, not only as a vector space, but as a true algebra. And for this, we introduce some one plus infinity algebra for surfaces. So uh So as I say, I will assume that S proper, it's not necessary, but just to simplify to avoid. So I will consider WS to be an algebra generated with an explicit presentation. So I will have a minute like this and N Londa and the C. Lambda and C. So N are non-negative integers, and lambda is a homology class. And relations, so I will not write the whole list of relations, just I want to to give an idea of how it look how it looks like. These are generators. I will give you a few relations just to give an idea. So, for example, so this this this so so uh if you compare to the case of uh of A2 so uh so uh t uh t plus n uh corresponds to e n uh t minus n corresponds will correspond to will correspond to Fn and Cn is correspond to hash n. It's a thing like this just to give an idea. And so a few relations. So there are a relation between this two set of generators of this sort. So Tn plus or minus mu is the plus or minus uh plus or minus m t plus or minus m plus n minus one of lambda mu and here is just a cup product you have two classes of homology you take the cup product and after there is a there is a a big quadratic relation which is an analog of the rainfeld relation that i will not write Which involves involving the the Ts, say T plus between T plus or between T minus, then and there is also a cubic relation, which is an analog of the S relation. PDEM, which is one for this PALF and one for this PALF. And C is a central parameter. And after finally, there is a relation expressing the bracket of T plus n lambda Tm minus mu as. mu as a as a polynomial is a polynomial in the size and in C. Okay. Okay, so we can from the relation is one can check that the algebra has a triangular decomposition once again. So, WS is a transfer product like this. So, this is denoted by the psi and the center, and this by the T minus, and this by the T plus. And uh so the the theorem is that uh Uh the term is that uh so if this uh due to so it's a joint work with uh melet uh minetsman so is that uh y s is isomorphic to w plus s as an algebra. So, I want to make some comments about this. So the fact is that there is no apparent parameter deformation in this picture. So the idea is that when you have the usual core of white two, which is the Jungian of L15, so you can deform, it is known by putting an action of the torus. You can change the size of the action of the torus. Change the size of the action of the torus which act on this. And so this gives a deformation, is what I explained. But that is you should think of S as another way to deform, which is in another direction. And so in some sense, this with respect to this behaves in a similar way than this with respect to this. And this with respect to this. So, here in this case, it is known that the algebra is essentially an enveloping algebra of the W algebra, as I said. Here it is no longer, and here it is not a developing algebra, but if you specialize yourself as to a flat situation, it looks like an enveloping algebra. So, in particular, you have the following: suppose the first chance. Suppose uh the first chant class of the surface is zero, then uh Ws becomes the is the enveloping algebra of Lie algebra of Lie algebra but it is but it is not in general and so of course uh as I said in particular Of course, uh as I said in particular, if S is e A two, so you recover uh we recover the uh recover the Jordan case. This is by construction and uh now the uh what I want to explain is that this algebra is similar to the uh to the Younger Novello one affine by in several aspects. First, uh one uh one important fact One uh one important fact about uh W one plus infinity is that it contains a copy of Eisenberg and Virazzo Ro. This is also the case here. So there is a you can define Virasorow attached to to the surface and and Eisenberg which has partial algebra of W S. So hash s So Ash S so it's uh so it's Estenberg modelda, I will say on as well. On as so as in Nakazima's construction of uh generated by elements. generated by elements Qn lambdas. Lambda is a common class and n is an integer non-zero and central C again and so to define this copy it's a bit uh painful but you have to define what are these elements in the presentation of this one. Of this one. And so it's an inductive procedure. So the Q plus or minus one lambda, up to some normalization, they correspond to the T0 plus minus one lambda. And the other one, I constructed the other Q plus N for n greater than one. I constructed in inductively by taking this one and some bracket with some elements. Inductive construction. inductive construction so it's algebraic okay and you can check that they satisfy the SNB relation and there is also a copy of the RASO so so if you have Virasovo, it's a it's a it's a idem, so Virasoly algebra modeled on this and this is generated by by elements l n lambda plus or minus no n instead. Like this. And lambda is again the homologic class of the surface. And the central elements, central elements. And idem, so the ln are constructed inductively. So the l0 lambda is up C1 lambda up to some normalization. It's not exactly this, but it is closely related to this. And the Ln lambda The L and Lambda are constructed inductively. You take this one and you take brackets with some specific elements. Inductive construction. Okay. Okay, so this is for the algebra. And we are interested also on our presentations. So, to do this, I have to define a following. So, this is an open subset in the Do you have a You take S is A yes, you take S is A two And so is is you define inside the core of S, so it's open open substack. So you impose a condition on the current shift. Condition of the current sheaves. So you take of sheaves of dimension. So this is a geometric definition of sheaves of dimension greater or equal to one. It means that you take the sheaf such that each subsheafs are same. So it means in co-S if and only if for all f subset of E, the support, the dimension of the E the support, the dimension of the support of F is greater or equal to one. So it's an open ship stack. And so we have a, so I will write the theorem in the in the VAC form, I don't want to, but I will exp uh I want to explain in some particular cases. So in the gene, So in the gen i is there is a general statement saying that the algebra acts on um the uh case the space of tautological classes space of tautological classes classes in in the homology of this stuff so we say like this it does not mean a lot Say levies does not mean a lot, but uh full uh full acre correspondence. So but uh instead of uh expl explaining what I mean by this, I will uh I will explain in uh in two examples. So, the first example. So, in the case of X shift, so you take a smooth projective curve. And you take a line bundle over it and you take for S the total space of the line bundle. So it is a surface which is fibered over C, but it is a priori C is compact, but S is not compact because of this. It is why I've said in order to write this example, you need a non-compact case. This example you need a non-compact case, but and so we can consider the X sheaves on C, which are related to sheaves on S. So uh inside uh S there is uh what corresponds to X shields. Correspond to X C L C. So this is a stack of what are called L-twisted X shifts on the curve of fi of of finite lengths. I will uh no, no, I will after that. I will uh no no I will after okay and inside this uh co the uh the the substack of finite length shifts correspond to uh to uh here to uh x shifts of finite length length so x sheaves this means uh it's a sheaf on the on the curve plus On the curve, plus some endomorphism which is twisted by the L bundle, the line bundle L in some sense. So the non-twisted case corresponds to the case where S is the cotangent of the curve. And inside of this, so Of this, so you have XC inside the finite length one, and under the category, which is the vector bundle. So XC and inside there is vector bundle. So this has a X bundle. What S cannot be it is C is projective, but because of its efficient S, but it's not. Yes. But it's not really a big deal. The point is that you can compactify the it has a projective compactification, so you can do this in the and you have to so for some argument you pass to the project compactification after you restrict to the open subset. So it is not projective, but it is not a real problem. But what I want to to say is the following. Inside, when you take inside the When you take inside this, there is in this category. So you can, this is a stack of shifts, some shifts on the surface, cut the surface. As a shift over this, there is a universal shift. Universal bundle, because I reset to bundle. And from this bundle, you can write some evolution map. Write some evaluation map. So you take a homology class with compact support on the surface, and you can produce from this an homology class in X vector bundle Q by integration. When you have a map, you integrate over the surface the short class of I, co-product with lambda, and you apply to the. Landa and you apply it to the fundamental class. So you can do it for all i and all lambda, and it defines a particular subspace in the right-hand side. It's what I call the subspace of tautological classes. So the image of the evaluation map. So it is because the space of universal tautological class and so the this theorem which was uh spelled in a vague term here in this case uh it simply says that uh case it simply says that there is an action of of the W algebra of the surface on this space so it is not compact sometimes you have to introduce some support condition here as I said I don't want to enter into the details you have to modify slightly the deficient somewhere by inputting some condition support this is not compact but it's not really And uh so so this this section uh is important in some sense. For example, uh so so this condition maybe looks strange. It is related to the to the construction. To define uh an action, you have to make a correspondence and you can you must check that the correspondence satisfies the relation of the W algebra. And this to do this, we the techniques that we use, we look how That we use, we look how echo correspondence acts on a universal class. And so, the result we can only check the relation on this tautological class. And so, this explains the form of the result. But, for example, suppose that you are in this case where the rank and the degree are coprima. So, in this case, it is known, there is a result of Mach Manner, which says that if you restrict to the open subset of says that if you restrict to the open shift set of stable shifts, then all classes are generated by tautological class. In this case this implies that hash RDQ is generated by a topological class. So it means that in some cases you can remove this. Can remove this using this sort of result, this condition. It is the image of this map. Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's inside this. Inside this. Yes. Inside this, inside this, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay, and so I just want to finish by another example, perhaps less original, but I think still nice. It's the case of Hilbert scheme. No, uh ah see yes, because in this case is a cotangent case. Yes. In this case, you have some vanishing, yes. Yes, yes. When you take the cotangent case, it's uh it's uh if you take S is a T star, C. S is a T star C it's a function here as I in this case yes. So so in the ill buff S so you can view Ilbuff S so since uh for some thing uh we we argue with stacks uh so you have to use uh the automorphism of so you have a clustering space which appears somewhere. Uh, classifying space which appears somewhere. I don't want to. And you can see it in as torsion-free sheave. So, with the notation that I use, is a thing like this. So, you take torsion-free sheaves, such as the reflexive dual is trivial. So, the bedual is trivial, so it's a thing like this. So, this is torsion-free sheave of a Josephus, and this is a class which determine says that the bedual is trivial. So, you have some embedding like this. And it is known also. Is known also that if so, a priori we can do for this S is projective, but even if S is a projective, if S is pure, then it implies that you can check that Ilp N is pure also. And this implies that the homology of Ilb is generated by tautological classical. Generated by tautological class. So, once this is an example where you can remove this sort of condition, and so the result is that you get that so So you get it. So there is a representation of WS on the sum of in NSQ and so and so we can and and it behaves in the way you imagine. So In the way you imagine, so the Eisenberg operator goes to Nakajima's operator and the Virasero operator goes to Len operator. But there are more with uh the whole algebra which acts. The whole algebra object like this. Okay, I think that's uh
