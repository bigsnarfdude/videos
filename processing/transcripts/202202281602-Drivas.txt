Aspects of the long-time behavior of the 2D Euler equations, and this will be mainly based on joint work with Peter Constantine, Dan Ginsberg, Michela Delce, and Tarek El Guindi. So I'll begin just by reminding everybody about what the 2D weather equations are. So I think of having a fluid vessel, omega. So there's a solid boundary where the fluid is non-penetrative. So the velocity is tangent to that wall. The velocity will be incompressible. The velocity will be incompressible, it's divergence-free, and it will satisfy the Euler equation, which is this momentum equation here. Now, in 2D, there's a number of simplifying features. The first is that since the velocity is divergence-free, you have a Hamiltonian for it, a stream function, with the property that levels of this function c correspond to integral curves of the velocity u at any given time. So u is just tangent to the levels of c. So, velocity being tangent to the boundary means c is constant there. And you also have this additional simplification that the vorticity viewed as a 3D object, so with 2D symmetry, is just unidirectional with a scalar pre-factor, so it's pointing out of the page. That scalar pre-factor is the skew divergence of u, the curl. It can be written in terms of the stream function as Laplacian. Stream function as Laplacian. And the beautiful thing about this object is that it's just transported as a scalar by the velocity u. And this is a closed description of the fluid because I can invert the curl on the vorticity to recover u from omega. And so I can just think of 2D Euler as this system. This is the Eulerian framework in Lagrangian land. This just says that the vorticity at time t is the push forward of. Time t is the push forward of the initial vorticity, so I compose at the inverse flow xt, and x is just the Lagrangian trajectories of u. Okay. So the first question you ask about this equation is what are its integrals of motion? So generically, there are, well, there are infinitely many, but the two that you generically have are energy, so just the L2 norm of U. So, just the L2 norm of U is preserved by the flow. And any continuous function of the vorticity, so these are the Casimirs, for example, anstrophy. And this is preserved just because the vorticity is an area-preserving rearrangement. So, LP norms are preserved by the motion. Now, if your domain has some additional symmetry, like the two torus or the periodic channel or the disk, then you can have some additional conservation laws. Have some additional conservation laws like linear angular momentum, but this one is not generically going to be present. So, as a basic consequence, actually, of the preservation of LP norms of vorticity, you have a global existence and uniqueness theorem in suitable phase space. So, C1 alpha of velocity is good enough. And it says that there's a unique global solution in that space, and the solution. That space and the solution bounds grow. So, in principle, at infinite time, you can leave this phase space double exponentially. And actually, there are examples now by Kisilev and Farak that show this bound is sharp in some situations. This really can happen. We're going to talk at length about generic features of growth shortly. Just a remark, there are weaker spaces where this glow. Are weaker spaces where this global theory holds? Namely, the one by Judovich in the 60s just assumes L infinity vorticity. L infinity vorticity is unpreserved, and you have, and it's a good existence uniqueness class. So the difference between C1 alpha and L infinity is that the bounds on the solution in L infinity are uniform in time. They're just controlled by the size of your initial data, which makes this phase space a very useful one for thinking about long-time behavior. Thinking about long-time behavior, as we'll see later. So, the first setting that one would think about when you talk about persistent behavior is steady states. So, they're just defined in vorticity form by this equation here, just steady transport of the vorticity. And given that u is the skew gradient of the stream function, this equation is just saying that locally gradient vorticity. That locally gradient vorticity and gradient stream are collinear. So, some examples of this are: if you have a periodic channel, they're just shear flows. If you're on a disk, you can have these circular flows. And more generally, actually not necessarily more generally, but a general class is if you prescribe a functional relationship between vorticity and stream, so that of course the gradients are collinear, then if Then, if you can construct a solution of this problem, the vorticity Laplacian of stream is equal to that function of it with constant boundary conditions, then this will generate a steady solution of Euler. So you can construct large families on whatever domain you like by considering this problem. A privileged, just a remark, this is not always a good equation in the sense that there can be one, many, or no solutions. No solutions, as is exemplified by choosing F to be affine. So you just get the eigenvalue problem. A privileged class of these equilibria are Arnold stable ones. They correspond sort of geometrically to maximizing or minimizing energy subject to vorticity being area-preserving rearrangement. That's its picture here. But in terms of F, it's just one of these two conditions has to be. Just one of these two conditions has to hold. Lambda one is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the minus Laplacian. So, if one of these two conditions hold, which corresponds to some geometric feature, then we call these solutions Arnold stable. And those solutions are called that because if you make a small perturbation in L2 of vorticity for the 2D Euler system, as long as it's also bounded so that you have solutions, unique solution. Solutions, unique solution, then the solution stays close by for all time. So there's Lyapunov stability and L2 vorticity. It's interesting that these solutions also inherit whatever symmetry the domain they occupy is. On disks, they're circular, on channels, they're shears, which goes some direction into saying why these features seem to emerge in those settings. The first sort of difficulty that you come to when you think about trying to say what actually happens to a solution even by a stationary state at long time, is that there are huge families of them. They come in sort of infinite dimensional families. So one result that really highlights that is this one by Chofreu and Schrerek in 2010, where they, given an annular domain, they identify in a one-to-one corresponding. identify in a one-to-one correspondence a stationary state of Euler with its vorticity distribution function, provided that it's nearby some Arnold stable one. So they parametrized the space of stationary states by the space of distribution functions in that neighborhood. And so there's a huge degree of freedom and other steady states nearby. So you don't, if you're converging to one, it's sort of So, you don't, if you're converging to one, it's sort of unclear which one because of this. Another result in this direction is one by myself, Peter, and Dan, which says that you can find on nearby domains, so you can wiggle the boundary of the domain and take any Arnold stable flow you like and deform it to fit any small deformation of that domain that you like. And actually, there's freedom to fix the boundary of the domain and wiggle inside. So, a similar spirit to this theorem, the difference being that we Theorem, the difference being that we don't look at rearrangements of the vorticity distribution function, but rather we look at rearrangements of the stream function, which is similar but has slightly different meaning. Okay. So, right, so it's difficult to understand what the solution looks like nearby steady state for one reason because they're infinite. State for one reason because there are infinitely many of them, but there are other reasons. And this is an example that was done by Madrashvili in the 90s, where he constructs wandering points for the 2D Euler equation. Namely, he finds a point C in the L infinity. So it's smooth, but think of vorticity as a dynamical system. Of vorticity is a dynamical system on L infinity vorticity. He finds a point xi such that a small L infinity neighborhood of C, if you flow it by Euler, leaves after some time that neighborhood and stays out forever. So the dynamics wanders away from C forever in L infinity. And this construction is simple. It relies on being close to one of these stable stationary states. So imagine you just take the So imagine you just take the periodic channel with coet flow in the background. His point C is just coet plus a small perturbation of vorticity that connects the top and bottom boundary. Now the point is, because of stability of the background flow, this small connecting ligament will get filamented. It'll, you know, because the velocity is stronger up here than it is here, and the flow is stable, so the L infinity velocity. The L infinity velocity stays close to what it is initially. There's always a relative movement of the top point and the bottom point. So this one's going to go around the periodic channel much faster and lead to this filamenting. And now this is wandering because after some time, this yellow line has support always on the right side of the torus, whereas the initial data has no. So after some later time, you're always outside. After some later time, you're always outside some L infinity neighborhood of your initial point. So, this was the point he made with this: to say that there's some obstruction to ergodicity in certain topologies. But actually, you can also promote it to say something about long-term growth. So, if you look at this picture, you would imagine because the flow preserves volume that this thin, this small little column. Small little column should get sort of infinitely thin in places as time goes to infinity. And indeed, that's true. So you can promote this example to say that because the length of this curve grows like t, the width of this column, when you flow it, also has to decay. So in fact, in C1 alpha, you have t to the alpha growth. So there's sort of two points that are made with this example. The first is that in some sort of weaker topologies, just L infinity vorticity, dynamic Infinity vorticity, dynamics cannot stay in a neighborhood of this point. And the second point is that in stronger topologies, more than that is true. It's actually going to infinity. It's leaving any neighborhood of the original point. So this is the first example, I think, in the literature of infinite time block. And since there have been many others, and I just name some of the authors here. So, in this direction, I just want to. Direction: I just want to say, tell a little bit about a result with Tarek. So, there was a conjecture by Judovich that says that generically you should see this long-time growth, unbounded growth in these stronger topologies like C1 alpha. So, sort of any point, it should be sort of open and dense in general. But he said, in particular, it should be near any steady state. Any steady state. So this is still open. But with Tarek, we showed that if you take a steady state which is stable and has some region where it's strictly monotone nearby a global extremum, so like a global max or min that's isolated. So for example, you could take monotone shear on the channel or a radially decreasing vortex on a disk as just Vortex on a disk as just two examples. Then the set of points in a neighborhood of such a steady state, which grow like at least like T to the alpha, is open and dense. I'm going to see one alpha topology. So this example of Nadarashvili, that particular example, is actually a general feature of nearby motion of points close to steady states. The way we prove it, I won't really go into it, but the point is that we identify a different form of stability that's at the level of the flow map, at the level of the particle trajectories. So we can control essentially how much a particle trajectory can deviate away across streamlines from the stationary solution. And thereby, effectively, the maxima, the extrema that we assume the steady. The extrema that we assume the steady state have acts like a boundary, like in Narashvili's example, and localize it. So it applies in cases like channel and disk, but it also applies without boundary because of that remark. For example, a torus, and here's an example of the type of data we consider: some perturbation like this of a stable on the cell stationary state, and this thing will just spiral, and you'll get two to the alpha growth of. The alpha growth of such solution. Okay. Okay, so we have this picture that there are these stationary points, and nearby these stationary points, there's a tendency for information to go to high frequency, small scales to be created. And that corresponds to things like growth in C1 alpha topology. There's this question: can we get any information about an asymptotic picture? Information about an asymptotic picture as time goes to infinity. And for this question, you really want to think about Euler as a compact dynamical system. So, for example, on the Judovich space L infinity, where you stay inside the unit ball for all time. And then this picture at infinity could be defined by just thinking about what this omega limit set is. So you just take the weak star closure of the solution. Closure of the solution map, the solution of Euler, starting from a given initial vorticity. Take the weak star closure as you run time to infinity. So it's a collection of all weak limits. And by the way, you have weak limits because you have uniform bounds in L infinity. So it's the collection of all those weak limits starting from a given initial data. And the goal is to understand what this set looks like. So there are some simple remarks you can make about this. Remarks you can make about this. The first is that kinetic energy, which was one of the invariants that we started discussing, is weak star continuous. So the energy of the weak limit is the same as the energy that the initial data had. So you don't lose any energy at infinite time. So that tells you something about what's in this set. But the other invariants that we discussed, these Casimirs, continuous functions of the vorticity, those are in general not. Vorticity, those are in general not weak star continuous. Instead, what you have is lower semi-continuity if you have strictly convex function f. So you can say that the Casimir, let's just call it the entropy of the weak limit is less or equal to the entropy of the initial data. And this is just because of this irreversible process of mixing. So if you stir up the vorticity, creating infinitely fine scales, these scales could be so Scales could be so small that the whole orbit of vorticity is not compact in L2, and you have some local averaging of these vorticity nearby. And in doing so, the weak limit has lesser entropy because you've averaged it out. Okay. So let's try to just make some naive prediction about what the limit may look like. May look like. Let's take the viewpoint that mixing should be a generic thing, that it should really be happening everywhere. Then the first conjecture you might make is that the vorticity mixes entirely. So the long-term limit just replaces the vorticity by its average over the domain. And in that case, the omega limits that would just be the singleton, the average constant function. And this naive conjecture is not correct. Naive conjecture is not correct because of the remark on the previous page about the energy. So, for example, in the torus, your vorticity has to be mean zero. The initial energy, however, is not zero. So, it cannot be that you mix to constant, which in this case would have to be zero. Okay, so we can describe five minute warning, Theo. Five minutes, yes, five minute warning. Okay, or take six, whatever. Six, okay. Um, the second. The second naive conjecture would be that you, okay, you have to keep your energy constant, so you fix the energy, and you would just minimize the entropy. And it turns out that if you posit this, then you find that the minimizer should be described by stationary Euler solutions, which are in the first shell of the Laplacian. So it's just the first eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. And this is nice because it says that the It says that the limit should be somehow large scale. These things are sort of the largest scale structure that you fit inside your domain. But there's this issue, why choose the entropy over any other, say, convex casimir, to minimize? It seems sort of arbitrary. For this reason, this theory is called selective decay. You've picked one of the inviscid invariants to minimize. Although, by the way, this could be maybe even. Maybe even proved in a way to be true for Nevier-Stokes limits in some precise sense. But okay, it leaves something to be desired for that reason. It's going to be hard to do this in six minutes, but okay, so there was a principled, or there was a principled approach to trying to understand long-time behavior sort of introduced by Ansager, now called Produced by Ansager, now called statistical hydrodynamics, where the general scheme is to introduce some finite-dimensional approximation of the Tudi Euler equation. He studied the point vortex system, which can be thought of like that. If that approximation preserves, for example, the energy, which this one does for an appropriate version of the energy, and satisfies some good properties like the Lewis Ilfie. Properties like the Louisville theorem. So the volume of, it preserves the volume of the finite dimensional system, which this one does. And the dynamics are ergodic on their phase base, which is usually something at constant energy. Then Ansager posited that as you take large numbers of these vortices, you'll start to look like maximizers of a certain entropy, which you get from. Which you get from a counting argument. And if that's the case, then the stream function that you weakly converge to will be some solution of a problem like Laplace psi is f of psi for some particular f. So again, the prediction is that you go to steady state. And these have nice features that they also capture this accumulation of large-scale structures. But But like I said, there's this scheme for doing it, and there's some issue with the scheme philosophically in that it involves commuting long-time limits with finite dimensional approximations. And there are some senses in which, so this is sort of, you can carefully try to argue this in regimes that are close to equilibrium, but fluids in general are systems that are very far from equilibrium. From equilibrium. And so there's numerous evidence for that. There's some global Lyapunov functional constructed by Schnellman. There's this wandering example of Nader-Schwili. And even for the finite dimensional system, there are arguments by Kanen about you can construct integrable n-vortex motion. So you can't have just one ergata component for the phase space. But even perhaps more fundamental to Fundamental to standing in the way of such an approach is this true infinite-dimensional nature of the fluid as an open system. So, namely, there is this mixing that's coming from having infinitely many degrees of freedom. The vorticity is tending weakly, but not strongly to something. And there's rigorous examples of that by Pedrozi and Masmoudi. And also, the configuration space of the fluid, the volume preserve or area-preserving diffeomorphisms, is unbounded in the sense that. Is unbounded in the sense that its diameter is infinite. So you can really develop arbitrarily complex motions. And these are features that are very hard to capture, if possible at all, in finite dimensional approximations. So in the remaining couple of minutes, let me just say that Sherlman in the 90s developed sort of a general theory for understanding the constraints just that mixing imparts onto these type of statistical arguments. Type of statistical arguments. So he basically constructed objects that are maximally mixed vorticity at fixed energy, and they always exist by a Zorn's lemma argument. And what he finds is that there are steady solutions of Euler that have a monotonic F, which is quite interesting. So rather than say how he said it, let me just introduce quickly say a different way to say it. Way to say it. So, if you look at the orbit of an initial vorticity in the group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms and you intersect that with an energy surface, I'll call that set O of omega 0 E0. Now, by our discussion of the conservation laws, the solution of Euler always lives in that set. And moreover, the omega limit set lies in the closure of that set in weak star. So, Ellen Finny. Weak star, so L infinity weak star closure of that set, which is just the closure in the volume-preserving orbit intersect equal energy because energy is weak star continuous. You don't lose energy on the weak limits. So what does this set look like in some example? If you take omega 0 to just be two values, like a patch, minus one plus one, then this set is just all the vorticities with value less than or equal to one and absolute value with equal mean. Absolute value with equal mean. So you can mix everything to get even continuous things, I mean smooth things that just go from minus one to one, you can mix them in this way. And so this is like the augmented phase space for Euler at long time. Now, one way to say sort of what Schneerlman did, or part of what Schneerlman did, is through this theorem. So this is like sort of a reinterpretation of Schneerelman with Michele Delce. Of Schneerelman with Michele-Dolce, at least half of it is. So it says: if you take any strictly convex function f that you like, and you take any initial data which is L infinity, having some energy E, there always exists a minimizer of this conduct function on this sort of long time phase space, the closure of that orbit. And moreover, these minimizers are minimal flows. Minimizers are minimal flows. They're solutions of Euler with the property that you sort of can't mix them anymore. We also prove that you can replace this minimization with an unconstrained space at the expense of essentially a Lagrange multiplier, but sort of not trivial because this space is sort of hard to understand. So, however, it's possible. So, this minimum is actually also a minimum of a functional on the unconstrained space. On the unconstrained space L infinity. So from this, it says that no initial data is isolated. Yeah. Sorry, Theo, you're out of time. One more sentence. Is isolated from equilibrium by just taking into account conservation of energy and vorticity transport. So you can't rule out convergence equilibrium. And I'll just take one further sentence. That sort of doesn't. Sort of, uh, it doesn't allow you so if you if you want to know what happens, it doesn't really say much because, in principle, you could go to stationary. But if you ask for a little bit less, we can say a little bit more. So, this statement, also with Michele, says that if you take, say, a shear flow and you make a perturbation of a shear flow in some sense, you would like to say, does it go to shear? Right? So, there are results. There are results in that direction by, for example, Jacob Berjoti and Madamas Moody. They prove that for sufficiently regular perturbations close in some strong topologies, that's an affirmative statement, that it does go to shear. But here's sort of a no-go if you allow for the perturbation to be further in a strong topology. So given any shear you like, in fact, any point in L infinity that you like, we can find another point with Another point with the property that it's close to that shear in L1, but that this set, this long time phase space, contains no shear flows at all. And what these points look like is just you take a shear and you add some smooth approximation to a point vortex. And these are very localized objects. The idea of the proof is essentially that their energy has to be very large, like logarithm of their Logarithm of their radius. And there's no shear flow in this set whose energy can be that big. You can show that all the shear flows contained here have order one energy. So you can basically have a scale separation. You can never undo a very concentrated vortex by Euler. In fact, by volume preserving rearrangement. So, okay, that's a definitive statement that at least there could be steady, but they're not sheer. And we did some numerical simulation also. And we did some numerical simulation also, and you see that indeed it's true that they're not sheer, but you can get very different behavior depending on the setting. So either remain concentrated or like cat's eye structure. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Sorry for going over. No, I only let you go on because I thought it was very interesting. Thank you very much, Theo. Thank you. Thank you. We don't really have time for questions. We don't really have time for questions, so let's just hop into while Alexi is screen sharing. Why don't I offer that at the end of this session, if there are questions for Theo, we can do that? Are you just going to present from Zoom? Theo, when we come offline, my question will be, is L infinity topology critical? Topology critical, or could use a different topology. Don't answer it, it's not your time, but think about it.
