Okay, it's my great pleasure to introduce Professor Monique Masu, our first speaker this evening or morning sessions. Her title is Compactness in Boundary or Yamabi Problem in Load Dimension. That's welcome. Okay, begin. Thank you very much. I would like to thank first of all the organizers. Thank first of all the organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here and to report on some recent progress in the study of the compactness of the boundary MIB problem in low dimension. And this is research in collaboration with Kim from From Korea, Anyang University, and Juncheng-wei. So let me start recalling what is the boundary Yamabe problem. This was proposed by Escovar in 1992, and the question is. And the question is the following. If you are given a smooth manifold of dimension capital N, so a smooth Riemannian manifold in dimension n greater or equal than 3, which is compact and it has a boundary, whether it is possible to To find a conformally equivalent metric in this given manifold so that the scalar curvature is zero, but the mean curvature on the boundary is constant. So, this is the problem I will mainly talk about. And well, it is, of course, well known that this problem is equivalent to finding a function capital U, positive function capital U on defined on the manifold, smooth, which solves these Problem that I wrote in red. So in the inside of the manifold, you have that the conformal Laplacian of U equals zero. And on the boundary of the manifold, the following operator, which is the The conformal boundary operator given in terms of the mean curvature and the normal derivative to the boundary equals a constant capital Q, which depends on whose sign depends on the conformal class of the manifold M multiplied by U to power. multiplied by u to power n divided by n minus 2. What I mean is that this function here, if it exists, is the conformal factor that gives you the conformally equivalent metric with the scalar curvature zero and the mean curvature constant on the boundary. So this problem here This problem here has a variational structure, and you can introduce an energy functional and the critical points of this functional in the class of H1M of functions that don't vanish on the boundary, correspond to a weak solution to Solution to the problem. Now, in the original paper of Escobar, he observed the following. So, you want to find the critical points of this energy, and in particular, you can look for minimizers. And minimizers are attained if you can prove that the infimum of this quantity here. Of this quantity here is less than the one you would get in B. This is the ball in Rn that I consider endowed with standard Euclidean metric. So this is exactly the analog to the Aubert result for the classical Lyamabe problem. For the classical Yamabe problem, which simply tells us that if you are able to find a test function so that this quantity here is below this given number, then you have that the minimizer is attained and the problem has a solution. So, about the existence of a solution to the boundary Yamabe problem, this has been The problem. This has been studied by several authors and starting from Ekobar, Maris, Almarath, and Chen, that covered basically almost all possible cases and they found minimizers for the Minimizers for the energy functional Q, a different type of result was, or proof in reality, was given by Meyer and Jadine in 2017, in which they use, in order to find the critical point of the function Q, they use the Barycenter technique by Bary and Coron. Varying coron. And about once you find solution in the energy space, you can apply a result by Charier for the regularity of the solution. So it's about the uniqueness of solution. Well, there are two cases. If the constant Q, which whose size Which whose sign depends only on the conformal class of the manifold M. If this constant is negative or zero, you basically have uniqueness of solution. On the other hand, if this constant is positive, uniqueness of solution is not true. It is the example of the ball that after a stereographic After a stereographic projection, you can see you push the ball to the upper alph space Rn plus, and the boundary becomes the base Rn. Here, little n is capital N minus one. So the problem reduces to find the solution, positive solution to this equation. To this problem here, to this boundary problem here, which are well known and well classified. In fact, all positive solutions to this problem are the so-called bubbles, which are described here. It's a family of capital N A family of solutions that can be parametrized by capital N parameters. In particular, these functions are all solutions for any value of this number lambda positive and for any. And for any point here xi on the bottom of the alpha space. So in this case, certainly solutions are not unique. So this is when the constant Q is positive. And an important for our purpose Ingredient or information you may have on this bubble solution. The ball is that they are non-degenerate in the sense that if you linearize the equation around any one of these bubbles and you consider the kernel, the kernel, the function phi that satisfy this. That satisfy this equation. And you ask what are the elements of the kernel. So there are natural elements in the bounded elements in this kernel. There are natural elements in this kernel that comes from the invariance of the equation and that are given by this partial derivative. And being non-degenerate means that there are no other elements in the Element in the kernel. So these are all the elements in the kernel. And this was proved by Davila Del Pino and Sira. Let me mention that all these bubbles have finite energy in the sense that if you compute the energy Q for any lambda, for any xi, It gives you the same value, which depends on the dimension. And the function have this shape. So if the scaling factor lambda goes to zero in my language, the L infinity norm of this bubble becomes large and say you have. You have blow up. So, what is compactness? What does compactness mean for the boundary Yamabe problem? Well, we take, of course, a manifold that is not conformally equivalent to the ball, to the unit ball, and you ask whether the set of Whether the set of all solutions, namely all conformally equivalent metric with zero scalar curvature and constant mean curvature on the boundary, is compact in C2 or not. And this is a problem that has been studied by several authors. And let me mention Several authors, and let me mention, without following the order of these slides, the results that are available in literature. So there was a first result by Felli and Ulm Medou, in which they proved that compactness holds in any locally conformally flat manifold whose Whose boundary is umbilic in any dimension greater or equal than three. There is another result in the literature on a manifold whose boundaries are umbilic, and this is the result written here by Igimenti and Micheletti, in which they prove that They prove that for a manifold with umbilic boundary and certain assumptions on the Vale tensor, if you are in dimension eight or higher, you have compactness. Then there was a result in 2011 by Almarath in which he proved that if your dimension That if your dimension n is bigger or equal than 7, and your manifold has the following property. If you consider the trace-free second fundamental form on the boundary, so you take the second fundamental form minus the mean curvature vector. If you assume that this object never This object never vanishes on the boundary, then you have compactness. And very recently, in 2020, Almara, de Quiros and Wong proved that in reality, compactness holds in any manifold non-locally conformally equivalent to the ball in dimension three. So Uh so um what I would like to uh discuss is uh a result uh in dimension four, uh, five and six and this is uh um the theorem uh we we obtain so um so in in the in the previous yeah list of results um Nothing was known except in the locally conformally flat case for these three dimensions. So if you have the theorem goes as follows Assume you have your manifold in dimension four, five and six with no further assumption in dimension Assumption in dimension four and five, but with the assumption that the trace-free second fundamental form never vanishes on the boundary if you are in dimension six. So the same type of assumption that Almaras had in his paper in 2011. Then you can prove compactness and Compactness and of the boundary Yamabe problem. And let me state the result in a slightly more general form, which is not original. It is usually stated in this way. So for any small epsilon greater than zero, you can find a constant so that if you consider So, that if you consider this problem here in red, so let me see this problem here in red. You have the conformal Laplacian in M, and then you have the boundary operator equals to this constant Q times U to the P. And now P is any number between a little bit bigger than one and equal to n divided by n minus two. So, the case of the boundary young. So, the case of the boundary Yamabe problem corresponds to taking P exactly this number. So, if you have any solution in H1 to this problem, then you can bound it in C2 by a constant that depends only on M and epsilon zero. So, in other words, In other words, in dimension four and five, the boundary Yamabe problem is compact. In dimension six, it is compact if we add this extra assumption on the trace three second fundamental form. And I would like to briefly describe these Describe these the proof of our result. And let me start just mentioning that, yeah, so if you take here a p, which is not exactly n divided by n minus 2, you lose the conformal invariance of the problem. So there is a trick that is to study this equivalent problem star. Problem star, leaving the p that you have and putting a function here f to a certain power minus delta, which takes into account what you are missing to being conformally equivalent. So, this the solution, our solution is just a special case of this star problem. Problem. The proof of this result is the strategy follows exactly the argument of the original lecture notes by Shoen, in which he stated and he proposed the problem of compactness for the classical Yamabe problem. So I will go sort of Go sort of quick on the most standard part of the proof and spend a little bit more time on the original contribution. So you start by an argument by contradiction, and we assume that we have a sequence of Sequence of solution um to Pm, so to this problem with P equal to Pm, the metric G equal to G M and the function F here equal to F M. Now, we in our choice, what we will see is that this sequence Pm converge to a number P naught. P0 in the right interval. Gm converging C4 to a G0, which is a metric in M and this sequence of function Fm positive convergence C2 on the boundary to a positive function F0. So we take a sequence of solutions which blow up. Solution which blows up, and we want to get a contradiction showing in this way that you cannot blow up, you have compactness. So, in this case, the maximum goes in the boundary, so we can assume that there exist points on the boundary y naught and ym, so that ym is a local maximum for the boundary. Um on the boundary, this local maximum as m goes to infinity diverges, this um is blowing up and the set of the sequence of local maximum converge to a y naught. And let me introduce this number here: it's epsilon, so it goes to zero. Well, what you show first. Uh what you show first is uh and this is sort of standard that uh uh the the blow-up point is uh isolated and simple, which somehow prevents a situation like that you have blow-up in in the form of Dirac deltas in multiple points uh approaching the limit points or Limit points or deltas that are one above the other, the so-called clustering or towering phenomena. And also you can prove that if you are a little bit far away from your why not, the limit point of blow-up. Point of blow-up, then this sequence converged to a multiple of GY0 in a neighborhood of the point Y0. Here G0 is the limit metric, and Gy0 is the green function of the conformal Laplacian on the limit manifest. On the limit manifold with the limit metric with the Neumann boundary condition and pole at y0. So this is the function g of y naught. We can prove the existence and positivity of this function following a result by Almarath and By Almarath and Sun, and Sun, in which they, which also gives us information on the profile or the expansion of GY0, which allow us to use a version of the positive mass theorem, which is valid between in for dimension from three to seven. Mention from three to seven that you can find in these two papers by Elmaras Barbosa de Lima and Elmaras Kiros Wang, which tells you that if you consider M with the conformal metric given by the conformal factor this function G, this is asymptotically flat. Flat, and it has a mass which is positive, and which can be, for instance, computed by using the integral expression for the mass, which I am not writing down that was introduced by Brendle and Chen. So just to summarize. Just to summarize, up to now we proved that the blow-up is simple and isolated, and that a little bit far away from the blow-up point, you go to the green function with delta on the boundary. Now, the contribution that in this kind of line, in this line, is kind of line in this line is the following claim so if you consider the the norm of the trace free second fundamental form on the boundary this object here on computed with respect to the metric gm at the point ym this this function this number This function, this number here, this here goes to zero as m goes to infinity, and it goes to zero exactly with this speed in terms of epsilon m. I recall you that capital M sub M is the speed at which the sequence blow up and the epsilon. sequence blow up and epsilon m is a negative power of capital M. So in order to prove this fact, what we use is a local Polhodzeif identity and we need a precise expansion of UM near the blow-up point. So let me discuss this second point. Point the description of the blow-up sequence near the blow-up point. So if you stand close to the blow-up point, YM, and you introduce Fermi coordinate, you can prove that a scaled version of your sequence of solutions converges. Converge to the bubble I introduced before, capital W, centered at zero and with the lambda scaling parameter equal to one. And you can prove this convergence locally on a compact set of Rn. So this is So, this is the first. So, what I am trying to say here is that at main order, the scaled blowing up solution looks like the bubble. But then, to get the previous result, so this kind of information, we need the extra term in the expansion here. Here. And in order to get the extra term in the expansion, here we need to go to the extra term in the expansion of the metric that involves this form pi of ij at main order. So if you call psi, Call Psi M this difference, you can see that Psi M satisfies at main order this problem here in red, where you see the appearance of the expansion, the first term of the expansion of the metric. So you have in the inside In the inside, the Laplacian of psi m equals 2 epsilon m times the pi times xn times the derivative, the partial derivative of the bubble. And on the boundary, you have this boundary condition where little wy0 is simply capitaled, the bubble just restricted to the bottom of the elf plane. So we want to. plane so we want to to find it's important for us to to have a quite explicit expression of thisi m because later on we will take this psi m and we will use a local po identity we will need to compute certain integral where Where in order to understand the size of those integrals, we need an expression of psi m as explicit as possible. So, in order to construct this psi m, let me do the following. Let me, well, this 2 and epsilon m are just constant. Let me forget about it for the moment. About it for the moment. Let me forget about this pi and let me leave it only with the right-hand side like xn partial derivative ij of w. And let me even forget about the partial derivative of w and let me sorry sorry. Sorry, let me go back a second. So I will write the function psi m as the sum of two objects. The first object satisfy the equation in Rn plus the second object, capital F, will take care, takes care of what happens on the boundary. Now, what we were able to prove. What we were able to prove is that this part here, the phi, is an explicit function given by this formula. And what I would like your attention on is that in this formula, it depends on two parameters, on two constants. One constant is a One constant is A1 and one constant is A2. So, where do this constant come from? So, let me do what I was mentioning to you before. Let me drop the two epsilon m, the pi, and the partial derivative. Okay. And let me, so what survives will be xn times w one zero. And let me write. one zero and let me write this as xl plus one minus one w one zero and let me split uh the the problem i have so minus laplacian of phi equals xn w1 zero in two pieces one carrying xn plus one and the other carrying just w one zero So these two problems are simpler in the sense that both of them in a slightly different way can be solved by an ordinary differential equation. So in reality, to solve this, you realize that this expression is the partial derivative. This expression is the partial derivative in n of a function which is radial in all the coordinates. And you can do the same here and you can reduce the two problem to two ODEs and you simply solve by variation of formula variation of parameter formula, you can simply solve, find the phi1. solve, find the phi1 and phi2, which depend on constant, the constant a1 and a2 that will appear in the definition of the phi. And after you do that, you define phi as this function and using the fact that your the trace of pi is zero, you can prove in fact that Prove in fact that the function defined in this way is what you were looking for. So we have an very explicit expression of what, going back, of the second expansion of the bubbling family of solutions. So the bubbling family of solution, after rescaling, look like the bubble plus a term epsi m that you can That you can describe very explicitly and whose definition depends on two constants, A1 and A2. Okay, so the argument, how does it go on? The argument goes on by obtaining a local Poet Zi identity. Xi identity, where you multiply the equation against this object here, which is one of the elements of the kernel of the linearized operator in the ball, and integrating it on a ball of radius rho around the point of blow-up Ym. And you get a certain pod esiphy identity that I will not write down, I just call it P. Down, I just call it P. It depends on um and on the blowing up sequence of solutions and your row here. And a simple scaling argument tells you that this quantity here, which so which is obtained after multiplying the equation against this function and integrating on. On a ball is of this size in epsilon m for in any dimension and equal for any dimension n greater or equal than three. On the other hand, you can explicitly compute this and you immediately see that this expression can be. Can be described as one part which carries the information of the metric and whose definition depends on the bubble and the expansion psi m or if you want this function here that we found plus something that goes to zero and how does it go goes to zero and how does it go to zero look at compare please this uh velocity to to zero with the the scale velocity to zero epsilon to uh n minus two so when n equal to four uh they we have epsilon squared on both sides and we will see that these terms because in dimension four we have some lack of integrability will be of size will be of size epsilon square log epsilon. In dimension three, you have here epsilon cube and here you have something more than epsilon cube. And we will see that this term will still be of size epsilon square. And in dimension six this will be epsilon to power four much smaller than epsilon to power cube here and this Cube here, and this will be still of order epsilon square. So let me say what R, what is, because it is from this relation, it's from the expression of Fm that we will see the trace-free second fundamental form multiplied by epsilon squared. And it is from this relation that we will conclude then. Will conclude then that along this blowing up sequence of solutions, the second fundamental form, trace-free sequence, second fundamental form will go to zero. In fact, in dimension five, we can prove so the previous formula expansion is telling us that you can compute it. You can compute it, and that the function or the expression that depends only on the integral expression here that whose computation needs a precise form for psi m can be bounded below by epsilon m to power two times the square of pi m the trace free Uh, the trace free second fundamental form multiplied by a constant, positive constant doesn't matter, and an expression that depends on a1 and a2. This expression plus o of epsilon cube log epsilon. This expression here is a polynomial in A1 and A2, which has a As a maximum and the maximum point that I called A1, A2 is so that the maximum value is positive and it is these numbers. And with this observation, we can say after dividing by epsilon m square that this quantity here can be bounded by something that goes to zero. And this is And this is the first of the three cases I wanted to discuss. So in dimension five, in dimension six, you get something similar. In dimension four, so the term coming from Fm, what I call Fm, is a polynomial multiplied by epsilon m to power two. epsilon m to power two and the the norm of pi m and this polynomial is again a polynomial in in the two constants a1 and a2 with maximum value at a certain point so with maximum value a positive number here from which you can obtain the result for dimension six in dimension four this is slightly This is slightly more complicated. The appearance of this logarithm of epsilon m is due to the fact that in dimension four, the bubble is not L2 integrable. So when you integrate, and it is not integraby, so in dimension 4, it's like 1 over x to power 4. So 1 divided by 1 plus x to power 4. Power four, it's not integrable by a factor. What you lose is this log epsilon, which is good for our conclusion. So, what I stated before about the trace-free second fundamental form that goes to zero is true. Okay, so in particular, in the limit point, you have In the limit point, you have that this quantity is zero, which concludes the proof in dimension six, because you were assuming in dimension six that the trace-free second fundamental form never vanished on the boundary. But you proved that if you have a blowing up solution, the blow-up point converges to a point where this is zero. Is zero. In dimension five, in order to get our conclusion, I recall that in dimension four and five, we don't put any condition on the manifold. In dimension five, where the previous formula was telling us that, no, sorry, from the Port Ziph identity, we get. entity, we get that these quantities is epsilon square. And here we have a term like epsilon cube log epsilon. And we needed to understand this term here. And what happens is that using again the explicit formula of psi m the local The local Po-Zeif identity I described before, this function that I call capital P, is of order epsilon m to power cube, then you see epsilon square times pi square, and then you are able to identify what comes in front. comes in front the next order term. This next order term is bigger than epsilon m to power 3, which is in dimension 5 epsilon m to power n minus 2. And from this inequality we get that in the limit point this quantity here which is the derivative in ij in of the second fundamental form this evaluated at y zero this must This mass has to be greater or equal than zero. And with this, we conclude the proof. Why? Remember that the UM was blowing up and outside, far away from Way Not, it converged to a multiple of the Greens function. Multiple of the Green's function whose mass is M0. But then you can compute this mass using the integral expression of Brendel and Chen that can be related to a possib integral, say, and you get these two kinds of results. Kind of results. So, from one side, you get that the mass must be positive thanks to the positive mass theorem that I discussed before. And on the other hand, you get that using the previous computation, this must be less or equal than zero, getting immediately a conclusion in dimension four and in dimension five. In dimension five, we have that this quantity here is less or equal than zero, thanks to the fact that we expanded the energy up to epsilon cube log epsilon, where we found this. This is positive, so you have something negative, and you get the contradiction. Now, let me mention something, all these We really needed to introduce the function psi m and to have a precise expression of the function psi m in order to identify the several terms in the expansion of the energy. In dimension greater or equal than seven, it is in It is enough, you don't need to be that precise in the description of the blowing up sequence of solution. I think I am running out of time. So, this is the summary with respect to what is about compactness and what is And what is known about non-compactness for the boundary Yamebe problem? Well, there is a result by Almaras that tells that in dimension, well, capital N is bigger or equal than 25, or equivalently, the dimension of the boundary is greater or equal than 24. Almaras gave an example of a manifold with umbilic uh boundary in which the solution set is not bounded. So you have you have blow-up. So compactness in general holds for up to so dimension six. Six or better four. So the expectation is that in reality you can hope to have for a general manifold a compactness up to dimension 24. The reason of this expectation are the next 10 slides that I 10 slides that I will skip. But let me say just the following. So you can consider what it is already been mentioned in this conference yesterday, the generalized or fractional Yamabe problem. So you introduced Yamabe problem. So you introduce a fractional conformal Laplacian and you ask for a conformally equivalent metric whose scalar curvature is constant. It has been studied, it has been defined through the extension problem. Extension problem. And to solve that problem is equivalent to find a critical point of a certain function. But what I want to say is that if your generalized conformal Laplacian is gamma, and gamma goes from one to from To from zero to one, somehow you can recognize the boundary Yamabe problem that I have been talking about when gamma is one half, and you can recognize, say, the classical Yamabe problem when gamma is equal to one. So So, what is known about compactness and non-compactness in the classical case? In the classical case, everything is by now understood, but it was not easy. So, in the classical case, you have in the classical Yamabay problem, let me say gamma equal one, you have compactness up to dimension 20. Up to dimension 24. And you have non-compactness in the classical case from dimension 25 on. For the fractional, for the boundary Yamabe problem, I said that you have non-compactness from dimension 24 on. 24 on, and we proved that for gamma in between zero and one, you can find a gamma star. So this gamma stands for the index of the conformal Laplacian. This gamma star is a number bigger than one half. And if you are in between zero and gamma star, we prove that the problem is not. That the problem is not compact, but if you which in if it's not compact for dimension greater or equal than 24, which includes the results of Almaras, and when gamma is between gamma star and one, non-compactness starts to hold from dimension 2025 on. So, yeah, Yeah, it would be very nice for us to be able to prove that what I mentioned before are the correct the critical dimension to have compactness or non-compactness. Thank you very much for your attention and sorry for running out of time. So sorry, going over time. Thanks, Monica. Are there any questions, comments? Monica, can you share the last two slides? The one, yes. So there is n bigger than 52. So at gamma equal to one is a jump. No, yeah, this there was a Oh, it's there was um oh, two, yeah, yeah, two papers. So, and the yeah, also in these two papers, so in in Brendel in 2008, he proved the non-compactness for the classical Yamabe problem from dimension 52. He uses certain yes, yes, he uses a certain polynomial. He uses a certain polynomial. And the year after, with Marcus, they were able to, with slightly different choice of a certain polynomial, to prove in reality non-compactness from dimension 25. Can you say a little bit about gamma star, how this is discovered and the phenomena? And the phenomena happens? Yeah, this gamma star comes from. I don't know, I don't know the meaning. So the let me, yeah, thanks for the so what we could prove is, so we constructed this this metric like a bump. A bump you put in the hyperbolic space. And this gamma star comes out of the computation. I don't know if there is, maybe there is a more deeper meaning for that. Also, in this result, there was a polynomial that we had to choose, and we needed to prove the maximum of that polynomial was positive. But that polynomial depended on this gamma. And gamma star was a crossing point in dimension twenty-four and twenty-five to get. And 25 to get what we, but a deeper reason. Yes, I don't know. It's amazing. One doesn't expect that, but yeah, right, right, right. Well, if you take a gamma equal to two, there is also there another dimension. There is also there another dimension. I don't remember. Maybe it's 25 for non-compactness. So or 24, I don't remember. So maybe there is a jump. But yeah, absolutely. You don't expect this. Thank you. Yes, any more question? Yeah, I have two questions. I have two questions. The first one is that when you do the you defer the scalar curvature to zero by conformal deformation, so what's the possible value of the mean curvature of the boundaries? Maybe first pay first page in PTTs, which is based by ESCOBA. The problem is ESCOBA. Yes. Bar, yes, right exactly. So, what's the possible values of the mean curvature at the boundary where you deform the scalar curvature to zero? You may have, say, positive or this is related with the sign of these. I don't know what are the possible values. So in dimension, yeah. So this problem, if you look at this problem in dimension two, this is equivalent to the Riemannian theorem that tells you that if you have a simply connected open set in open set in in in the in the in c in the plane the complex plane which doesn't which is not the complex plane that you can i think allomorphically deform it to to a disk i i i i don't know what are the possible value yeah thank you yeah thank you thank you okay because limit of time so Okay, because limit of time, so this is the first talk. Let's speak again. Thank you. Thank you.
