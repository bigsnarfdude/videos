Okay. Our last positive, now I know for sure from last possible recording. Sorry, Russia. Our last talk for this morning is Russ, and he'll be talking to us about a perfect matching sense of how to do your development. Thank you for the introduction, and thank you for having me. And thank you for having me. How great to be here. We can at both the animals. Although it's a bad idea. Can we decide if they're reindeer or deer or less? So this talk is going to be a continuation of the problem of the Problem that I talked about yesterday. There's not going to be too much new. I'll try to keep it short and sweet. So this is something that I was talking about with an undergraduate student over I teach. So I want to tell you about this tool for computing homology or cohomology of independence complexes of graphs. Complexes of graphs with perfect matchings and somewhat more general things if you want to. But I want to go into a little bit of detail about how combinatorial Alexander dual works in the classical case. Well, associated with the simplicial complex is this other simplicial complex, which I'll write delta. Which I'll write delta wedge, what is that, delta V. So you take the facets of the Alexander pool to be the complements to the missing faces of your original complex, the missing faces to be the complements to the facets of your original complex. Where a facet is a maximal face, missing face is a minimal non-face. And we all love simplicial complexes. I'm pretty sure. Of some pushal complexes, I'm pretty certain. So I would now I've seen the history of this misattributed. I think that the view of this as an Alexander dual object was first made by Kalai in 1983. This object actually goes back further and has been studied. Further, and it's been studied. Oh, I didn't run down references, but since the 60s or 70s in the hypergraph and combinatorial optimization literature, where it's called the blocker or the traversal hypergraph. Indeed, if you look at Kalina's paper, he calls this the blocker. Okay, so this complex. This complex has some great properties, and the thing that makes this useful are pretty much two of them. It exchanges the link or deletion of a vertex. So the Alexander dual of the deletion of a vertex is the link in the dual, and vice versa. And it turns homology slash cohomology upside down. So if you want to look at the ith homology of the Alexander dual, you look at the n minus i minus 3 cohomology of the original complex and vice versa, where I'm saying n for the number of vertices. Okay, so directly. So a direct consequence of these is basically, I'm giving the theorem that Egan and Reiner should have given. I'm looking at Reiner as I say this, that the regularity and the depth of a simplicial complex and its dual have a super simple relationship between them. And my depth and/or regularity. And/or regularity might differ by one from your depth or regularity, but up to a constant we all agree on this. So the point of this formula is depth measures the largest degree. I put a star there because there's some shifting involved in this as you look down into things. Below which, Below which the homology vanishes on all of your wings in your simplicity complex. Whereas irregularity measures the least degree above which the homology vanishes on all deletions. Alexander duality exchanges deletions and links and And it turns the homology and cohomology upside down. And well, you have to track this down and cross some I's and dot some T's. Do I have this wrong? It's right, actually. Because it's right. Possibly. I mean, I'm saying essentially Egan Reiner because it's basically in your. Egan Weiner, because it's basically in your paper, except you just talked about the case where depth is maximum and regularity is minimal. So I'm sorry if I'm not acknowledging Torah here and I should. Maybe there might have been some work before this, but I think that the Work before this, but I think that that paper is the first one which is noticing the usefulness to algebra. But I'm missing, I'm pretty familiar with the papers that have something about homotopy type and not as paper, not as familiar with the papers that have stuff about prime ideals or primary. Ideals or primary ideals. Am I using the word sort of right? Okay, so for me, you get all this from several ingredients. So first of all, there's this Alexander duality theorem of topology that if you have a compact and nice subset of the n-sphere, then The n-sphere, then you've got a similar local relationship. You have an n minus i minus one instead of an n minus i minus three, but it otherwise looks very similar. Second, a sympuschial complex is cryptomorphic, if I can throw around the words like that, to a downset in the Boolean lattice. Jay is frowning. Jay is frowning, so that just means that the definitions are the same, but the ones that one of them is wearing a disguise. Probably just wearing a status. It's not that disguised. And some yoga with order complexes. Now I know some people are the opposite of me in here, so I'll pop up. Uh, so I'll pop up the order complex of uh. I want to look at the order complexes with uh upper and lower bounds because I want to throw them away. Um so the order complex, you just take the simplicial complexes of chains, forget the top and bottom elements because those can go in every chain, so just throw them out. Okay. Okay, so in particular, moving to the order complex, you don't change the topology. The order complex of the Boolean mattis gives you a sphere. Oh, that should be minus two, I think. Sorry about that. And perhaps most crucially, if you delete. Crucially, if you delete a polyset from the Boolean lattice, then topologically or combinatorially, they're the same up to a deformation retraction, which you'll remember is your favorite type of homotopy equivalence. That's what a homotopy equivalence should be, except it's not an equivalence. Not an equivalence. Okay, so then the final thing is that, well, you know, you take your downset in the William Mattis, you delete it, you get an upset. And now if you turn it upside down, you get a downset. And the particularly nice thing here is that the map sending a set to its complement dualizes the postet. And if you just Post-it, and if you just track this down, you get this description which I put up in a yellow post-it note at the top. Okay, so I mean the nice thing about doing things in slides is I can do a moderate-sized example. So if I look at a path graph with three edges, what I'm doing here is Doing here is, well, I mean, I cleverly drawn this so that I have a path over here as a downset, and then you look and you see you have something that looks the same but upside down as the complementary upset. You turn that upside down, you get a downset, and I just talked you through showing that the Alexander dual of a half graph with Path graph with the independence complex of a path graph with three vertices is the simplicial complex of the one-dimensional complex given by a path graph with three vertices. Three edges. Three edges, three edges, yeah, sorry. Okay, so Okay, so I want to look at this in other simplicial spheres, particularly the cross-powered folk, as you know. So, I mean, let's just look at the ingredients. Most of these go through perfectly. Alexandria duality theorem, we just need a sphere. Simplicial complex, okay, I guess we need a simplicial sphere, say a simplicial policy. The order complex yoga, no problem. No problem. The one thing we really lose is that some potential spheres aren't self-dual except for the simplex boundary. You do get back a simple palotope, which is, well, it's maybe not that bad. And I really want to think here about the cross-palotope. About the cross-palato, there's a little generalization you can make, but it's probably not so helpful. So, this is the generalized octahedron. And, well, it's the independence component of a matching graph. So, if you have a graph that has a perfect matching sitting inside it, that means that you've already taken away Taken away, those are already missing faces, and then you have some other edges which are adding on additional missing faces, then this sits as a subcomplex of the boundary of the cross-palato. And applying all this Alexander duality, topological Alexander duality, and order of complex loga, we get back a We get back an upset in the cross palatope, in the face lattice of the cross-palatope, which is a downset in the face lattice of the cube. So a cubicle complex, and I was corrected from my softiness yesterday, there are cubicle complexes which are not down sets in the cube. Okay, so if we do the same thing, the path graph with three edges, that's got perfect matching, the two end edges. It has one other edge. And, okay, well, we look at the one-dimensional cross-palato, which is a diamond. Diamond, it's a square, but I want to think of it as a diamond. And we're taking away one edge from that. The dual of this is a single vertex. So this is the same example and giving at least some of the same information as this back here. You can see that it's somewhat simple. Somewhat simpler. So, this is that one is kind of cheating. So, I drew out a good-sized example. So, I'm taking, well, I could think of the path on three edges as taking a path on one edge and whiskering it. So, I'll take a path on two edges and whisker it. So, now I've got a nice perfect matching again. Again, I put some of the edges here in red, the edges that aren't in the perfect matching. So those will correspond, those are the missing faces in the original. And I can look at those in the face lattice of the octahedron, which I hope I have here correctly, assuming I can put stuff. Assuming I can code stuff. So your dual object is: you take this and you turn it upside down. This is a cubicle complex, which you could also represent as a supercial complex. I've drawn it this way because I want to suggest that you would fill this out to a square. I lost them before I added one more. Before I added one more here, but you can sort of see where this is going. If I took a path to three edges and whisker dip, then I'd have three red edges here, giving me three red things here with some stuff above them, which would then correspond to three filled-in squares fitting together. Okay, so the power of a part of the power of some pushal-Alexander Tuality is this link dilation interchange that doesn't seem to be as nice here. Well, so in the classical case, So, in the classical case, the thing that's happening is that the link corresponds to taking a vertex in your boolean lattice and looking above it. The link is cryptomorphic to all the faces containing some vertex or some smaller face. Okay, so now if you take this and look. And looking the dual lattice, that's going to everything under a facet. And I'm saying facet, maybe I should say maximal element, but the maximal element in the coatom, coatom in Bn corresponds to deleting the vertex from the underlying insect. So this gives us back the relationship between Relationship between deletions and wings. Okay, so you can do the same kind of thing in the octahedral cross-palatopal setup. So when you're looking at a link now, you're looking at the interval over a vertex in the base lattice of the loss column. Of the cross-palatal, which dualizes to everything under a asset of the cube. And well, I don't know how to think about that as far as a direction. Maybe there's something super nice, but it's not terrible either. Okay, you can do the same thing with the links and cubes. Links in cubes that gives you back a sufficient object, which is maybe more attractive. It looks to me like deleting edges from the matching is well behaved, but the story is a bit more complicated and I don't completely understand it. There is a mild generalization. Art, you asked me about this yesterday, and I've You asked me about this yesterday, and I forgot. You can, if you have a graph which doesn't have a perfect matching but is close, take your almost perfect matching and then put everything else and set it inside a simplex boundary. And you can get something that looks like a join of simplicies or the join of a cross-pile tope with a simplex boundary. A simplex boundary. I don't this looks strictly harder than this stuff. Yeah, again, this is kind of a fun story. It's a little bit of a toy. I would love someone that love it if someone would tell me how to take. Love it if someone would tell me how to take my toy hammer and use it to drive some nails. So I'll end with a picture. This is not damp. This is that's cobrun there where I'm from. I'm bringing some sunshine with you, also some lemons. We could make lemonade later. So thank you. Thank you. If you're interested, I have a couple of general items for reading about Alexander duality and the topological viewpoint. And I'll tell you that I did my figures in my gap.app front end for gap which I've got plus some editing and IP. Thank you.
