Thank you. Thank you for the kind introduction. And I thank organizers for inviting me here. So today, my main theorem is non-preservation of concave concave properties by Diricure Hijofuro on Limanyang manifold, but to be precise, unless sectional coverage vanishes. So, for example, on Euclidean space, so concapitative property is preserved. So, this is joint work with Katohiro Isige and his student Haruto Tokunaga from University of Tokyo and I from Tokyo Metropolitan University, not the University of Tokyo. So, maybe everyone knows, but I'd like to make sure. So, what is deliberate flow? Delete heat overall. So deliberate heat overall is parabolic equation. So time derivative of u is the repression of u in omega times zero infinity and u punish on the boundary of omega. Boundary of omega, its boundary is non-empty, and we give some we give some initial data u0. So in this talk, always I assume that u0 is LO infinity and non-negative. And also, maybe this is. And also, maybe this is a common notation I denote by UT omega super UT omega of U0 is the solution of director for the law. And the next one, I have a question, everyone. So, orange and green, which is better? Orange, thank you. I use orange, thank you. Then, so what is the concapiti property is sorry, I use porosity. I use green only here. Sorry. So, for example, if we constant you could omega is you could. Euclid convex domain of Euclidean space and assume that initial data of rock is concave in omega, then it is an exact the solution of rock. Of rock is also already concerned in omega for any t. So, this is known result. This means that I write here, if we consider logarithmic graph of the solution, then concavity is preserved by the decrease heat flow. So, this folds on. This fold on Euclidean space, then we consider okay, maybe this is true for Demanian manifold. But finally, we have a negative answer. Preservation holds only if sectional coverage vanishes. So, covered space, this is not true. So, I'd like to explain why we'd like to generalize the Riemannian manifold and why this is not true. So, and you notice that So and you notice that this is not related, this seems not related to optimal transport theory. So first I give my motivation and background here how optimal transport relates to these programs and dynamics. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yes. But indeed, so fast. Indeed, so first, so after I say another name Paulo Sarani, and first Patricia and Paulo consider such a problem on Euclidian space. And when I attend his talk, I noticed, okay, because of optimal transport theory, we can extend it on LiManya manifold. Then I join it, but finally, okay, we can't extend your results. On the first part of optimal transport appear to background and the second one, so we generalize it on Euclidean space because we consider it to this result we consider logarithmic graph, but we can consider another graph, for example. Consider another graph, for example, power function graph or something. Then we place logo with some suitable function f. Then we discuss about the preservation with respect to f on ingredient space. And finally, we consider it on the manyang manifold. So this is my talk plan. My talk bra. So, first, so my motivation is for us campur equation for us campu in coli or for co para intora in coligi. So this result is a corollary of Braskampriva in Kuriki, but usually it is said that Boredo Braskampriva in Kuriki and sometimes it is said precopara indura in Kuriki so b So bo averaging around 970 in quality draw in code. Okay, next. Okay, next slide. Next problem. So we take three functions F G H and they are L one and non negative. Non-negative and fixed T is not good S I know maybe lambda rambler is parameter between 0 1 and if so sorry row of the good of F one minus f one minus t x plus p y is greater than logo of fx convex combination of f logo over fx and logo of g y for any x and y so for example if f g h are same function this is just Same function, this is just concavity of logarithmic concavity of the function. Then this ed1 notable keep the same relation so ed one notable. So L1 norm over H ah sorry logo of L1 norm of L1 norm is greater than convex combination of logarithmic L1 norm of F and H F and H Ah, sorry. Sorry, Ramada. Yeah, because usually I use parameter Ramada, but now I consider direct heat flow. So here is Ramada. Thank you. So here, Ramada. Sorry. So this is, so this is Pudekoparangura in Gore. Is precoparantra inequality and they consider logarithmic concavity and polyproscopic inequality is power concavity, power function. So and if if we take we take skushy and ether or RM. Data on RN and F to see its user ano GT GT is a shito kanel or Dausian kanel of C minus X and no soda again Sorry again and CT U0 X U 0 is the initial data of D regretor row and G Y is G E d over Y U zero Y and other I say G T is a heat okane. On it, fix sorry, fix and fix one and we consider so indeed f is depend on chi and g is depend on eta. And H Z is G T not T Ramoda C Ramada E ta minus z and u zero. And user data. Then so applied inequality because local concavity is preserved by degradation flow on the whole of RN. Then, this is the first starting point. And it is to buy the code.  2001. This is the inequality is extended to the money on manifold. So, in their paper, they state the such inquiry under the assumption. Under the assumption that lit curvature is bounded below by something. And in particular, if lit curvature is non-negative, then same conclusion false. Then we believe that, okay, so maybe the logarithmic concavity is preserved by delicate heat flow and preserved by delicate heat flow if demon only. Flow if the man on the mania manifold if this covert is non-negative. So, this is my starting point. And how do we do the inquiry extended other inequality extended by Leemania manifold? So, this is the optimal transport theory. So, here optimal transport appears. So, the to extend it. To extend it to extend this inequality, we need one one way is to use optimal transport inequality. But as I said, so precopara internal inequality is logarithmic function, and bodily scampriva inequality is power function. And usually, if power Goes to there, then we consider this is logarithmic function, logarithmic function. Then maybe we this volume scamp inequality is the inequality related to power function. So we consider the logarithmic concavity preserved by degree heat flow. Then maybe some of the power functions also preserved by heat flow we construct. We construct. So, to discuss such property, we consider generalization on Euclidean space. So, this means that we replace logarithmic function to some function f. Function f because if initial data is non-negative, then the solution of heat equation is always non-negative. Then we consider the function f is defined on some interval zero a. Here, a is between zero and infinity. And the value is such one, and because first we considered logarithmic concavity, and now we'd like to consider some concavity. So, it should be strictly increasing. And continuous, but this is all open interval 0a. And after I explain, but we said f0 is minus infinity. So we use f yeah. We use f yeah, we replace logarithmic function with such a function f. So, let's continue. So, So omega, let omega be convex domain in Rn then I denote by C this is C sub omega X is the set of a function defined in omega and valued in zero A A and composed of F mar F sac F in concrete concrete in omega we consider such a set this one this is just just increase strictly increasing and continue Yeah, but no concavity for project and then we consider we consider the such a function because why we assume such a condition. Condition if F zero is finite value, then C sub R n of F is only positive constant function. Then, so this is totally better, and there is nothing to do. So, in this reason, Reason we assume that one and we can define we can define the hierarchy between so indeed we call such a function admissible function admissible So, then we can define the hierarchy between atomic security functions. So take the admissible function. Admissible function and take some positive number between zero and minimum of a one and a two and we say that F2 is stronger than F a with respect to A if and only if C omega F2 contained in C omega F one. But here we don't know the relation between A one and A two, then we construct the intersection. The intersection if function a function defined on omega value to in 0x because the such relation. If we consider some the other number P this is not equal to zero and consider Pipe this is given by Power functions. No, here we don't need sorry. That's okay. And if we let p tends to zero, so this is logamic function. So we consider this is phi zero. Then P is smaller than Q if and only if Phi Q I know Phi P is stronger than Pi P is stronger than Pi Q. So our function has hierarchy. Hierarchy means that the if means that the if the fun composed of phi P and F is concave, then phi Q compose F is concave. So this is here. As Q gets smaller, then it would get closer to the logarithm, and I would have more, there's more log-concave functions, right? So for example, for example, if we consider G X so he took on. And if we consider logo of Gt, then this is concave because just quadratic function. But this is not one concave, not concave. Then, so, and if we consider negative power, this is concave. Can I ask correctly? Sorry, maybe I miss your question. Your question. Okay, yeah. Is that the inner value you intended? Am I misinterpreting it? Like they contain. Yes. Like F1 is smaller, so that means it's a larger class. So logarithm is smaller than all the power of positive powers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But now oh, okay, no, I think I missed my question. Okay, maybe but to give you the equation, I'll give example it's very good. I give example is very good. I think so. Okay. So, technical example, we consider the hito corner. Hito corner is always useful. That one. And very, it is very easy to see that this is log concave. So then GT Belong to Pi Zero. But and also this is belong to phi P if P is negative. But so this is not an So then, yeah, this is bigger than the two. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I said five zero is minus infinity. Ah, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Sorry. Thank you so much. I should say if zero is positive and if zero is r equal to zero, so we set minus infinity. Sorry, thank you. So this is not continuous at zero. This is continuous on open interval, but not yeah, we don't assume it is continuous at zero. Sorry, yeah, we should I should say sorry. Phi P R Pi P zero is always my Phi P0 is always minus infinity. Thank you. So then now we have many administrative functions. Then we means joint work with We meet joint work with Isige, So Kazuhiro, and Paulo Sarani from Firenze University. Like this one: so phi phi q phi q q is positive and phi zero is here and k totaner is around here. That's true. F2. I think you have this reference. So this is 50 on 5P. No. P. Phi 0 is bigger. Yeah, that's what I was asking. So, okay, this is okay, so I. Okay, so I take this is positive and this is zero. Yes, sorry. Opposite, opposite, sorry. I should I should use sorry opposite sound here. Sorry. No, no, no. Q is stronger than P. Sorry. I made a mistake here. Sorry. So sorry. So if So, sorry. So, if sorry, if number is bigger, then this is more stronger. Sorry, yeah, you're right. I made a mistake. Sorry. Yeah, so then so maybe I now answer correctly. So, sorry, yeah. If the number is big, then this is much stronger, more stronger. Sorry. And now we assume that so if u0 f is admissible function and u0 is contained f u0 is f concave. User is a concave implies the solution of the recruit heat flow is also concave. So if concavity is preserved, then if is always true. Always strong as logarithmic function and weak as some function called HA and it And if A is finite, then Aj is the inverse function of the solution of So the solution of the delete heat flow with initial data is given by the characteristic function of half line at time t times oops sorry. So it is very hard to compute to To compute such a function explicitly, so then I stop here. But so a j is an inverse function of such a function, and if a goes to infinity, we can, in some sense, we can say that a j converts to logarithmic function. So in this case, so if we consider the admission field function defined. function defined on zero infinity, then only logarithmic function is preserved, logarithmic concavity is preserved by the recruit heat flow, only logadismic function. So this is ourselves our result on Euclidean space. And now we'd like to extend it to Riemannian manifold. Papa theorem is that no concavity is preserved by the recurrent heat flow. So if we take any F for any F concavity does not hold, doesn't it's not preserved. So, M is the Money of Moneyboard. We consider a set of set omega in M and then there are three types of convexity in Li Manya manifold. So most strong one is strongly convex and second one is totally convex. And the Sadua in the weekly at Justo Kumbek. What's the IGBUTA picture? If we consider Sophia. Sophia, then four of Sophia is totally convex but not strongly convex. And if we consider equator, then this is convex but not convex. So this is the difference. So strongly convex means that for any point There ecosystem a unique minimal geodesic in M such plot okay totally convex is not here now the image of omega uh image gamma sorry contained in omega and omega zero Omega and omega 0 is X and Omega 1 is Y. So this is strongly convex. And if you consider sphere and take north four and south score, there are many minimal geodesic. So then this is not strongly convex. Totally convex. So any point and the whole any geodeship. Ah, I should say here. Mini module the oldest. Any model geodesic from X to Y we have the image of the minimal geodesic contain omega. Then for the sphere is okay, but equator is not good because But equator is not good because if we consider this point, this is also geodesic, but this is not contained in omega. Before you're right, I ask, I just make sure I understand. Did you say that the conclusion of this theorem is that only long log pathogen is preserved? If A equal to so I don't say here, F is admissible function defined on zero A. Defined on zero A. And if A is infinity, this is only so because between Roger and Rogue, this is only. And if A is not infinity, there are many barriers. Thank you for your question. If A is infinity, if A is not infinity, there are many choices. I don't know how I'm comfortable choices. So, this means that the power concavity is. Power concavity is preserved by direct heat flow if power is zero, so rogue concavity. Ha is a function of inverse function of such a function, then this is not power concubination. I forget the name Koerufu, Erufu, Erufu function. Some so this is So this is combination incomplete similar. So I don't, yeah, indeed, so we don't know such a name, but the referee say this is called Elf function. Elf function. I will write down. And finally, come back. Convex is here. We always consider all minimal geodesics, but no. For any point, at least there is one minimal geodesic. Okay. X Y at least one minimal geodesic contained in omega. So then equator is okay. So this is three kind of geodesics. And really, and also I should say that if omega is open set, then omega Omega is totally convex if and only if omega is convex. They are same if omega is open. And when we consider the delivery heat flow in omega, we consider omega is a domain. Then so in our paper, totally convex and convex is the same. Yeah, equator is not open set, of course. And again, we can define same way so and do And compose small f compose gamma is con concave, so concave in zero one for any mini model the situation We define such a way and also we can define weaker version of such a space. Maybe I should write. Weak is mean that. So for any point, at least there exists one minimal geodesic. From X to Y, such that F composed capital F composed small F and omega gamma is concave. So difference is all geodesic or some geodesic. And on Euclidean space, they so totally convex and strongly convex and convex are same, so then everything are same. Then with Isige, Tokunaga, and maybe I should write an unname Isig Tokunaga and myself so that to assume if If the equist F a domesticable function such is that E P omega U zero C omega F holds So assume that there exists some admissible function such that f concavity is preserved by the regression flow. Then sectional cover is vanished in omega. This is our conclusion. And we can change here if week and week. Even we change here week and week. So this is true. So we need, yeah, we need flat space. And we don't know. We believe. We don't know. We believe that maybe in Taurus this is not true. Then we think this is only true for Euclidean space, but we now we don't prove it. Any admissible function? Even infinity, no. So this is, yeah, we believe that the Rogukonga, so if we first, we believe that if this is a negative. First, we believe that if this is negative curvature, maybe this is not preserved, there is no preservation. But we believe that first, yeah, positive, if there is no negative curvature, this is this fold through for logarithmic function because we have precopara angular equality. But finally, no. So maybe so the key point is that if this is true, then If this is true, then, so as I said, in Euclidean space, logarithmic function is the weakest one which preserves by delegate heat flow. Then key point is that if this is true, then logarithmic function also preserved by delivery heat flow on Euclidean space. And we make very precise example which is Example which is logoconcave but which is not preserved by heat with flow if sectional coverage does not vanish. Of course, I can write down such a concrete example, such a concrete initial data, but I think this is not meaningful because the micro operator constructs such a function and I can't understand the meaning. So, why you choose such a function? Then he knows he says no. Then he knows he said no because I just calculated, then finally I got to it. I don't know the geometric meaning. So then maybe it's time and I think it is not useful to write down here. Then I stop here. Thank you for your attention. All right, thank you very much. So, if you replace the preservation of concavity by some kind of K concavity, we can consider some so maybe so you mean that so key concave so Ramada so So kung kabiki is this one and ke you mean ke kung kabiki is between on Euclidian species you mean the yeah and also now we consider two ways one is K concapity the other one is we consider the con copity with Competitive with distortion coefficient. So maybe we hope we can do both or at least one, but we don't know now. So my question is: is there any, is it somehow related to totally? I have no idea. Yeah. Large division principle is basically taking the log and scaling. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, maybe, yeah, maybe good point, but sorry, I now I have no idea. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you for the really nice one. So I just wanted to check. It's a really nice one. So I just wanted to check. So even in the Euclidean case, so this is like a super naive question. But is it possible that if versus if you consider in instead of the law capacity, like the concavity, that like would it be preserved by some kind of coarse medium or the plastic diffusion with the correct power? Indeed, so paper with power uh power we consider some non non-linear non-linear diffusion. So I think So, I think I forget. So, we consider porous fossil diffusion. So, but so, okay, anyway, heat equation, we have complete or complete answer. So, what is preserved, what is not preserved, but we have a partial answer to the question? Okay, so take the microphone here again.
