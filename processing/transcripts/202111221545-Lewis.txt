It's well, there's math, but not research level. So, first couple slides are some background on the situation at UCSC. Geographically, we're right there at that corner. And so it's looking at population, income, ethnicities. You look one direction, there's Silicon Valley. And I think we all have a pretty good feel for demographics, income, very STEMI. You look. Look down towards the south, it's typically income level drops off. It's not only agricultural, it's hand labor intensive, hundreds of people out there in the fields hand harvesting things, very small, very distributed communities, almost impossible to keep well-qualified STEM teachers in those school districts for more than a year or two at a time. It was an incredible churn among K-12 teachers. Among K-12 teachers. And there's basically no functioning internet. So trying to improve STEM education by using Zoom requires infrastructure that's just not there yet. So we have students coming from both those directions and need to try to give all of our students a good opportunities. So quick overview of some demographics. Roughly 30% give or take. 40% give or take one or two free main groups are white, Asian, and Latinx. And then international students are counted separately, and then only 5% other underrepresented groups. A huge thing for us is then largely because of that, look this way, you see really rich, look rich, look that direction, you see not so affluent designation that we use as EOP for various forms of education. Various forms of educational disadvantages, first generation going to college, roughly a third of our students, low-income, which I think would go by Pell Grant recipient or Pell Grant eligible. Again, about a third. And then we also have undocumented students, veterans, so forth, fall under that heading. Gender, it varies a lot. Roughly 60% of our life sciences majors or intended majors are female. Female? Well, more than half that are female in the physical sciences and engineering. It's really, really small. Big concern, and somebody's been working on mostly in administrative capacity, but also getting into some research with it. What's going on with moving students through our STEM programs? So only about half of the students who come to UCSC intending to major in STEM graduate within four years. Graduate within four years in any major at all. One fourth of the ones that intend to major in STEM haven't graduated within six years. We never say never, after six years, looking pretty grim. And a whole lot of students switch to a non-STEM major. Here's the percentages. And again, if somebody falls in love with the fine arts, that's great. But if someone switches out of STEM because they couldn't meet the requirements for a STEM major, that's not great. That's not great. And so that's sort of focused. So, some particular concerns I've been looking at have been: okay, how long does it take a student to declare the major? How long does it take them to graduate? Are they staying in STEM if they started in STEM? How many courses are they repeating? And how many courses are they taking that actually satisfy requirements either for their major or a university-wide general education requirement versus how many courses are they taking that don't really count for much of anything. Taking that don't really count for much of anything. One thing to look at: this chart is pulled from a grant proposal from a year and a half ago. Differences in mean grades for different sub-cohorts. And this was for a life sciences and chem proposal. So it's looking at the key sequences for declaring those majors. So what's going on in this graph is then for each of these bars. This graph is then for each of these bars, the top of the bar is the mean grade over this 2015-2018 period for fully served or overserved students. The bottom of the bar is the mean grade for the underserved students. And the color coding indicates what the nature of the challenge is. So the green is the EOP. So first generation, low income, et cetera. Gold, underserved minorities, which for us is brand new Teenx. Blue. Teenx, blue, first generation, no additional things about income and so forth. And so there's a lot of overlap between these. So the taller the bar, the bigger the gap in the mean grades. And a key thing for us, the lowest passing grade is a C. So that the first course in our life sciences and chem calculus sequence for these underserved groups, the mean grade is well below passing. That's a disaster. Say that's a disaster. I mean, it really is not acceptable. And for the chemistry in that first course in the sequence, barely passing. So the Gen Chem is a three-term sequence quarter system. So this is a four-year sequence, and those gaps shrink dramatically, and the means increase if they survive that first course. Same for calculus, physics. It's a two-course sequence. I'm always showing the first. Sequence. I'm only showing the first one again because of the grant proposal. So, concerns about okay, what's driving the size of those standards, the differences in grade outcomes in the first course in those required sequences. And we call them those the course sequences, as there's a substantial number of different majors that all require those sequences. And so, big question: you know, are those gaps due to differences in Gaps due to differences in the students' skills and knowledge when they walk in the door. Saying that for a lot of the underrepresented students, they're coming from school districts with really lousy STEM classes. So is that the whole thing? So a little very quick tour of how students get into calculus and the general chemistry sequence here at UCSC. CSC. Some come in with AP or IB calculus credit and they can go straight in calculus as long as they've got a sufficiently high score there. Some have transfer credit from community colleges. Our main placement route is through ALECS PPL, which is software that's both assessment and learning support. And so they can assess in ALECS, and if they don't place in the course they want, they can do some directed self-study in ALEX, reassess, reassess. Alex, reassess, reassess, and then go into whatever class they're finally eligible for. We have two preparatory math courses of college algebra. And a key thing is this covers only material they hypothetically had to know to get admitted to the UC campus. So this is what's called a developmental course. Pre-calculus, students are not required to know pre-calc to come in, but almost all of our ones do. Almost, almost everyone who's considering STEM has. Everyone who's considering STEM has already seen pre-calculus. And so there's all kinds of possible loops in here. Key thing, you know, so they can, if they're not ready, they can boost things before they start official coursework through self-study. Another thing to note is that we allow students to take the prep courses even if they don't need them. So someone can be calculus eligible and still choose to take these classes. And in fact, for years. And in fact, for years, an amazingly persistent bit of data has been that almost exactly half the students who take pre-calculus don't need it. They're already eligible for the calculus they need. Okay, so with that, and now I'm going to show you some, and this is going to be a rat's nest of data points, and that's part of the message of why moving frames could be helpful here. Let me make sure I'm not running over time too much. Um, let me make sure I'm not winning every time too much. Um, so we're now going to say, don't just consider those ethnicities, those AP categories, let's break that down by pathways. So, here this is looking at the first grade in each of those sequences where we're aggregating by, so for this plot, it's ethnicity, those three, Latinx, white, Asian, and then by initial placement and what they did, if anything, from there to get into the sequence and keep. Sequence and key thing, these have called them constellations, these points linked by little lines, are outcomes for the same pathway, different ethnic groups. So if everything were driven by initial preparation, these points should all be sitting on top of each other, but you should not be able to see the constellations. And so here, the dark opaque is Latinx, semi-opaque, the kind of faded ones are white, and the hollow outlined are Asian. Hollow outlined or Asian students. So, here for life science calculus, there's big differences, even for students with comparable preparation and comparable activity to get ready for the sequence. Here with the axes, let me say just a tiny bit about those various things we're comparing outcomes for students who started in STEM in 2015, 2016, fall coming in this spring. 2016 fall coming in as froze versus starting in the two-year window, fall 2017 and 2018. A lot of changes overhaul in those prep math sequences. I was doing a whole lot to try to encourage. So we had enrollment in those prep courses went from half to a third to a quarter of what it was before we started with ALECS in the first. Before we started with Alex, in the first couple of years after we adopted Alex. And so this split is sort of lots of change going on. What effects are those changes having? So here, all I really want you to take away from it is it's a rat's nest. These things are overlapping. They're sprawling very quick. And most of the just having the slides is kind of what do the different things mean. The shapes indicate what the students initially placed into. They just did Alex. If they adjusted Alex once, that would be the most advanced course they could take. So, triangles, those are the people that did not demonstrate that they actually had the mass skills that hypothetically needed to have to be UC eligible. Squares, pre-calc eligible. Diamonds, this is only for students who need the physical science and engineering calculus. Their life science is eligible, but not the more rigorous calculus eligible. And then the circle is they're eligible from the get-go. Is they're eligible from the get-go for the relevant sequence. Colors indicate what they did from there. So, black, yeah, they were ready, already to take the class. They started right in the sequence right off the bat. Green, they weren't initially eligible, but worked in ALECS and went straight. Their first course was then, you know, one of those core courses, calculus or chemistry. Blew, placed in, you know, eventually were eligible for pre-calculus via Alex, took pre-calculus, not college algebra. Not college algebra, yellow took college algebra and pre-calc, and that was consistent with their placement. Red is they took pre-calc even though they didn't need it. And so we'll bounce back to this one. So black circles, red circles, comparable walking in the door, knowledge as evaluated, different outcomes. And the difference there. And the difference there is: did they or didn't they take pre-calc? So, taking pre-calc if you don't need it doesn't need to work very well. So, here's similar things for EOP status: educationally disadvantaged, income, first generation, gender. And don't worry about the details. All I really want to take away from this is you're seeing similar shapes, different colors, wildly different outcomes. So, what they know coming in the door. What they know coming in the door, if we're measuring that accurately, is not calling the shots. And then, relevance to frames, there's just a whole lot of data here. And so the moving frames are a way to try to tame some of that. A very quick heads up on this. That's grade data. That's taking mean grades over these various subgroups, cohort snug groups. GPAs by instructor jump around like crazy. Jump around like crazy. So, here, this spike is the introduction of an online calculus class that the people who designed that class wanted to be popular. So, they were giving it a Halloween candy. This drop in bounce, this drop in bounce were Department of Education grants awarded to improve outcomes in these classes. And some I'm kind of guessing it was, let's see, an improvement relative to what they were in this year. What they were in this year. So there's a lot happening. So can we trust the grades at all? Well, for this thing, you want to standardized scores. You adjust by the mean and the standard deviation, and we can think of that as a moving frame. For a semi-direct product, I hope I'm putting my vertical bar and my semi-direct product in the side people are used to. So positive scalars, scalars, just doing a scale and translate. Translate. And so here, then, this is just, we're shifting everybody together. Okay. That gives us, and apologies, I am just really walked into left invariant moving frames. And so I'm going to get to my cross-section by pulling stuff back to that section rather than pushing it onto it. So if that's bothering people, I'm sorry, but if I tried to change it at last minute, I would get minus signs and inverses in the wrong places for sure. So our moving frame is pretty much standard deviation, and this is just a scalar multiple of the mean. Okay, so yeah, it's what people do all the time anyway, but we can think of it as a moving frame. And depending what you're after, you can either say, all we want are these two scalars, the mean and the standard deviation, or you can say, no, we want to look at that normalized data and see what structure you think it has. So that's one moving frame. It's one moving frame. Now, quick question, and I need to be going quickly on this. What do we mean by equity? So, if we're looking at k outcomes and we have n subcohorts, strap those outcomes into a k by n matrix, what do I look at that matrix to decide whether it's describing something equitable? One size fit all would say same outcuts, outcomes for all subcohorts. That corresponds to a matrix with equal columns. Corresponds to a matrix with equal columns. That's rank one. Here's your outcomes. This is just 11111 scaled to get a unit vector. So that's a kind of naive sense of equity. That's the one I'm mostly going to talk about. Realistically, different students will have different priorities. Some care a lot about their GPA. Others have constraints about their workload, time to graduation, coming from Graduation, coming from financial or time constraints, societal, family expectations, career goals. So they're really, yeah, to say the same outcome for everyone is the ideal is probably not realistic. It's just something that's easy to get your hands on. So if you could know what would be best for everyone and could check, are they getting what's best for them? That would be the ideal. And I'm just going to super fast at the end say. Super fast at the end, say maybe there's a way of trying to tackle that. So if for now we just look at one size fit all, we can then do a generalization of that mean standard deviation to the matrix situation. We do a rank one shift of our matrix, our outcome matrix, by the equal outcomes for every one projection of that. So we get something whose columns sum to zero, and that modification. And that modification is zero if and only if we have something that already is, in that naive sense, exactly equitable. Okay, so we can think about the norm of this difference then being some scalar measure of the inequity of the process this matrix describes. Here again, we have rescaling, and now we have a vector value translation again, a semi-direct product, and here again, we need to get rid of. Here again, we need to get rid of the stuff that's already perfect so that we can rescale and have a group. So we have it in action: rescale and shift by that rank one. And that gives us a sorry, horrible pun, unfairness and mean moving frame. So here we have the scalar, a vector quantity that's giving us the up to scalar. Up to a scalar, the mean outcome. And this is the extent to which it's not that naive sense of equitable. And that can determine the section, which is then just take that extent to which it's not one size fits all, normalize it. And so I'm not going to talk much about this, but this is a situation where rather than using the moving frame primarily to get that cross-section. Get that cross-section. Use this to try to tame that massive amount of data and get things down to a manable number of numbers to talk to people about. There's a section, there's a lot of info still there. And judging from what happens around here, even this is more than most administrators want to look at. So we can squish that a little bit more. And here I'll just show you. bit more and here i'll show you very it's going to be yeah very quickly um we can normalize this with respect to the outcome matrix for the whole course and then those errors and just very quickly here looking at things about the flip of the sequence students who passed at least one course percentage to success successfully complete the entire sequence ones who don't need to repeat any courses one who need to repeat at most one course mean One course, mean grades for the first course, mean grades overall for the sequence. And then, if you look at those norms, we get these. Somebody sneezed on the screen. Again, we're comparing this first two years, more recent two-year period. We're cramming all three of those sequences into one graph. And all that you have more time at as you look at is the stuff down here is red and yellow. So, and here we've got, again, So, and here we've got again, the red is not equitable. So, taking a class, taking a prep class you don't need is not super helpful. And here, the circles are you were eligible right away and you went into it right away. The corresponding red circles are you were eligible right away and you took pre-calcium away. It's not a good strategy. Okay, so flagging which approaches are not working for. Which approaches are not working for much of anyone? Okay, and similar then for EOP and gender. And this in the early steps, we're getting a little bit more of a wedge. Here it's fanning out a bit. So the changes we're making, and those are the ones affecting the blue, yellow, and red shapes. It's not obviously really benefiting most of the students taking those paths. So, in oh, minus time. So, um, just very quickly to say this, and I'll two minutes over time. Um, if you don't want to say one size fits all, what can you use? Okay, if you've got something rank one or almost rank one, but not just summing all the terms, that's blatantly inequitable. Some people are getting better outcomes in everything. Um, if you have, if you have some magical perfect outcome matrix, you just receive. Perfect outcome matrix and just rescaled it, renewed that, that would be equitable. And can we use matrix analysis to do that? And just to do a quick thing called a partial moving frame, which Peter and Nelamanihim and I worked on back in the early turn of the millennium. Something that literally acts like a moving frame in that you've got isotropy floating. In that you've got isotropy floating around, but when you apply that element, the isotropy gets lost in the wash, and so you still get a well-defined cross-section, and that can be used. We'll not go into the details on that because I'm out of time, with say like SVD or QR. And that's what I'm looking at these days in terms of trying to find ways of saying, how do we recognize that we're getting different individual outcomes? Different individual outcomes, but the overall effect is hopefully equally good for everyone involved. So, questions? Any advice? Suggestions on what to try, suggestions, what to avoid? All ears. Let me down sharing screen. Any questions for Deborah? Yeah, so I think, Deborah, you win the prize of the most unexpected application of Google. Most unexpected application removed. Good application. Yeah, it's very interesting. In terms of advice more than questions, it may be well worth interest. You may want to get interested in, sorry, you may want to get in touch with our Center for Educational Programs at Minnesota. One of the things we found, so you have Alex in that big green box as I Alex in that big green box, as I remember in the beginning, we found Alex was really poor at placing students in our courses, and we were having lots of trouble with what we call the DFW rate, DXFs and withdrawals. And so we ended up working with Wolfram to design our own placement system that we can completely control. And we are happy to share the technology and so on. So it's the thing, if you know very basics of Mathematica, you can program. Of Mathematica, you could program the placement tests, and it seems to be working much, much better. If you get in touch with our Center for Educational Programs, you can get the tools and tests. Okay, I will definitely do that because I'll try not to, I was extremely skeptical when basically I was arm twisted into doing the implementation of Alex PPL. It was largely the thing we had before that was so abysmal. I mean, you could literally have been looking at chicken gizzards. Literally, I've been looking at chicken gizzards and done better. And I was like, How could something that was created in the 90s? So, um, I would be very happy to try something better because, again, for us, Alex has been working better than our prep courses, but I don't think that's because Alex is that great. I think our prep courses are just that bad. So, um, I will definitely, I will email you or at some point or get a chat or something. If I can't, I'll try finding it, but if I can't figure out questions. Try finding it, but if I can't figure out who I should get in touch with, because that sounds like it would be really wonderful to try out. Hi, Deborah. I was going to. Yeah, so I don't know that we are that good at placement and pre-calculus, but I think math is actually very successful, especially when it comes to great gaps, when it comes to calculus. And the reason is because they put together a program called REACH, which is very Which is very structured activities that involve the student in the topic all the time. Like, you know, before going to class, you have to do this and this and this and this and this. And then you go to class. And when you are in class, in the lecture, you are listening and doing things and doing things and doing things. And then you leave and then you have to do this and this and this. And it's all very structured mix of group work, lecture, and all. Lecture and online, and everything. But the fact that the students actually engage all the time actually helps them a lot. And the grades, not only the grades, but giving them past exams, right? So exams that in the past had big grade gaps and had big problems, and they were doing very, very well. Then again, I will ask for some, you know, if there's materials I could take a look at, because we've had some of the changes. Take a look at because we've had some of the changes put in are officially active learning, but it's sitting and doing individual worksheets. And they're very stereotypic, pretty much identify the numbers and plug the numbers into a formula. Actually, no one. So, so yeah, this is this. Our approach totally, our approach is totally the opposite. That sounds perfect. And I may be getting a switch to I don't. And I may be getting switched to, I taught a college algebra. I'm the first regular faculty in the history of UCSC to teach that college algebra class. And I may get swapped into it this winter and short notice. So I may follow up on that very quickly. I'll send you an email with the information. That sounds terrific because it's something where I think we've seen that active learning that actually teaches mathematics rather than rote plug-and-choke works. Rather than rote plug-in chug works wonderfully, but the rote plug-in chug does not work with bases. So we have other questions or? Maybe I'll make one more comment I was going to say. The other innovation we did while I was head working with Dwayne Nightcamp was to completely redesign what was calculus for biology majors. We decided it was just not serving them well at all. So we have a course that's Well, at all. So, we have a course that's not even really calculus anymore. I would say it's a dynamical systems with a little bit of probability and statistics course that are, and it's very much active learning, group learning. So, Buen put a lot of effort into this and it's been very successful. Are you familiar with the UCLA modeling life? Yeah, that rings a bell. It is a dynamical systems class, and Alan Garfinkel. Class and Alan Garfinkel was lead author on that. Total Chaos Groupy, I guess, did history of science for quite a while and then does biomed research using dynamical systems techniques. And so there's sort of the, what's it, whatever such and such recapitulates phylogeny of that, I think it has a very clear sense of what things, you know, about limits, calculus, so forth. You start off with discrete time dynamical systems. Discrete time dynamical systems, and then get your calculus as letting your time step going smaller and smaller. So that's something I tried for a couple of years to get funding to get that adopted here and just wasn't successful with that. It was a little considered a little too avant-garde for rant here, but again, I'd love to learn more about what's there. And I'm going to keep trying because I think dynamical systems is really, yeah, I think they have what? Yeah, it's a quarter system, one quarter. It's a quarter system, one quarter dynamical systems, one quarter linear algebra, one quarter statistics. And that's their freshman year on life sciences mathematics. And it's been working apparently extremely well for them. So I'd like to see the Minnesota version of that as well. We had a lot of support from the College of Biological Sciences that developed it. Or any other, or it's okay. We have the digits of pie, 314. So let people go get ready for dinner and enjoy their things. So thanks, everyone, for listening, and thank you for the wonderful advice.
