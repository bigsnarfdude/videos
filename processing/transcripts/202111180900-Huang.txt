It would be a good time to start this morning listening to some basic topology. And so this is part of joint work in progress with David Flavero. And get started. So I want to specify some terminology for the talk. So there's this skeleton in the title. So I guess it's better since I'm speaking to this audience. Better, you know, since I'm speaking to this audience, it's better to just explain what a skeleton means. By a skeleton, I mean a Lagrangian in an exact symplectic manifold that's invariant under the Liouville flow. So you can imagine that your symplectic form is exact and you can set up an equation and solve for a vector field using your symplectic form and flow that vector field. Flow that vector field, and you require the Lagrangian to be invariant under that. So, this is the conical condition. But if your manifold is a cotangent bundle, in which case, you know, this is the case we have basically for the talk, then this just means your Lagrangian is invariant under the dilation of cotangent vectors. So, for example, if you have a constructible sheaf, If you have a constructible sheaf on a manifold with respect to some analytic, real analytic stratification, Widney stratification, you can take the singular support of that constructible sheaf, and that would be a conical Lagrangian. And if you have a fan, you know, excuse me, most people here are doing Torque geometry or have done some sort of Torque geometry. Geometry. For each of the cone in the fan, you can take the orthogonal of the cone times the cone itself. And that space would naturally live in MR cross NR, which is cotangent bundle of MR. And that, you know, you can take all the cones and union them and maybe shift them by the lattice, stuff like that, and that will give you the product. The conical Lagrangian, the kind of Lagrangian I'm talking about. So by monomial relations, I mean an ideal in the quiver of this kind. So you set two paths equal to each other. So the relation is generated by P minus Q, where the head of P equals to head of Q and tail of P equals to tail of Q. So it's basically a Tauric relation. Relation. And so I will not. So, most, I mean, in the talk, I will basically only talk about the constructible sheaf category, singular supported on a skeleton. But there's a subtle difference here because the constructible sheaf category is technically mirrored to perf, not co. So if you want co, you need to take Co, you need to take the compact objects in the category of weakly constructable sheaves, meaning that first you allow locally constant sheaves that are not necessarily finite rank. Then you take compact objects of that, and that's the correct category if you want to think about co whenever there's a difference. But in this talk, I'll just say she's see most of the time, but whenever But whenever, you know, if you think about the story, whenever there is a difference between sheaf W and sheaf C, sheaf W is the correct one. Mirror and co. So, okay, so here's the general idea. I don't have a name for it, but so we start with a quiver. It's a bounded quiver, so it has some relations. The relation is just of the type. The relation is just of the type I just talked about. From this quiver, I want to build some topological space that deformation retracts to a manifold, smooth manifold, and I want to construct a Lagrangian skeleton from this XA, this space I want to construct. It's a CW complex I want to construct. Then, you know, on the one hand, XA would offer a bimodular resolution of this quiver with relations. And on the other hand, this somehow gives the mirror of whatever category on the B side of mirror symmetry that the quiver is computing. And so, yeah. So here's the data to begin the story. So let Q be a finite acyclic curve and use Q0 to denote the vertices and Q1, the set of arrows. And you can consider the postet of paths, including the constant paths, namely. Namely, you know, just take all the paths and you set p less than or equal to q if q is obtained by post-composing p by an arrow. So I don't know if you're used to, you know, like, so the picture on the left means like the way, pictorially how it composes, and you know. And for that picture, I write q equals to p times r because I think people type of say like, you know, is it if it's composition, r should come before p, like r circ p. But this is the notation I use. So yeah, so we have the past pulse at, and for any other, so if I So if I give you an arbitrary poset mon, an arbitrary surjective map of posets from past to mon, it defines a relation for you. And the relation is that you just said the ideal generated by P minus Q when P and Q are mapped to the same element in mod. So mod stands for monomials. Stands for monomials. So the construction is actually pretty simple. What you do is that you take the order, first take the order complex of Monk. That would be some disconnected topological space. It would have several pieces. And then you quotient that by an equivalence relation given by the following. Given by the following. So when you have two simplicies of this type, so basically you have, you, what do you do? Like you, you, you post-compose two different paths by the same chain of paths. You declare two of these guys are the same if one of The paths you're post-composing can be obtained from the other by pre-composing with R. So R comes up from the other direction. So this is just a way to identify the cells in MON. It might be a little bit harder to digest right now. I'll give the example to just explain how this equivalence relation works. Works. So here's an example, very simple example. There's no relation. So F is just identity, right? So you take this, this is A2 or A3, I think A3 quiver. You take A3 quiver without relation, right? So the paths in this quiver, there are not many paths, so you have three constant ones, and X and Y. And x and y and x and xy and y, right? And the different connected components are given by paths, or chain of paths rather, starting from different vertices. And so YA is an order complex, so that consists of a two-simplex plus destroy union with. destroy union with an interval, destroy union with a point. And if you identify, so this equivalence relation is basically just identifying each time you multiply by an arrow, you just identify all the kind of like the smaller cells in the bigger cell that In the bigger cell that corresponds to the same arrow, if that makes sense. So if you look at the cell E1, from E1 to E1y, you get the blue interval, and you identify that blue interval with the blue interval inside the two-setfulx, and that's how it works. Okay, so now we can consider some more, I guess, more slightly more complicated examples. Slightly more complicated example. So, this is the famous bounded Billingson quiver. It's the P2 quiver, right? This has that like CQMOTI module. If you derive that, you get the derived category of P2. So the pass, here I'm using the edges to just identify the whole side relation in pass. But here's the way to just draw. Here's the way to just draw everything, and f just identifies the same monomial. So that would mean like f of e2xy equals e2xy equals, sorry, like E0xy would be the same as E0YX. That's right. And this is what f gives you. And so, this is kind of, we can try to draw this. So, this is the picture for XA. So, first what do we do? We can take the order complex of Mont, which is exactly like this kind of flower thing. Each simplex in the order complex is given by a chain of paths, right? But now certain paths are identified. So if you just think about the order complex of mm, you get exactly this flower shape. And the equivalence relation is just given by identifying, so whenever you multiply by x. So whenever you go from a blue dot to a red dot by the same color by the same like by that edge of the same color, you decide in file manage like labeling the same variables. That's essentially what it is. And so XA is just this flower shape quotient by an equivalence relation that identifies. Relation that identifies edges of the same color. And so, of course, this wouldn't be a T2 spot on, but so when you collapse all the edges and collapse the gray triangles, you get T2. So you can construct the deformation retract from, you know, You know, from a gray triangle to just a line from, say, E0, variable, variable squared, and then you can fold this extra edge in and get your torus. And here's a very nice way to draw a torus, I think. And the basic propositions of this torus is that the zero cell in this torus is precisely the The vertices in the quiver, the one cells, are the arrows in the quiver. And if you take the two cells, they'll be the minimal generating, the minimal, the set of minimal generators of the relation. And so there is one thing I didn't say, which is that there are some dotted lines in the Line dotted lines in the picture below. So even if we collapse the gray triangles and identify all the colored edges, it's still not the correct CW complex structure. Because the squares are divided into two parts, so we still need some simplicial collapse for that to get. Collapse for that to get the CW complex below. But that's what we'll do later. This is where you've also had higher dimensions? Yes. You can literally construct a simple initial complex like this for Pn or NEN. Okay, so let's talk about. Okay, so let's talk about some trees. So they're not really trees, but I don't have a better name for it. Like an alternative name for it would be flowers. Just kind of like this flower shape of this XA in the last page. So for any given vertex in the quiver, you pick Basically, you pick a lift of this vertex in your symplectial complex, and then you just look at everything greater than that in K-mon. That would give you a subspace, right? And of course, you can just map this subspace to this xA. Remember, XA has some equivalence. Remember, XA has some equivalence, it's quotient by some equivalence relations. So when you have such a tree in Kma, you can just map it down to XA delta. And now here's a lemma. So the lemma is just that you can embed the one-sided module category of the quiver into the constructable sheaves on this by pushing forward the constant sheave. The constant sheave on the trees. So, yeah. So you have a, so the tree is a subspace of yA and yA is a kmon. What you do is that you take this projection map onto xA delta and you know push forward that constant sheaf. So if, for example, if you take For example, if you take the flow I'll talk about this actually. Never mind. So this is just a definition and you just send the project modules to these objects. So of course, you know, ideally, you would want to say, right, like I have a skeleton on XA delta, and, you know. Delta, and you know, you take the singular supports of all these sheaves and take the union of all the singular supports of all these sheaves, that gives you a skeleton on this xA. But xA is not a manifold. XA delta is not a manifold. One thing you can do, though, is to embed this into a manifold and kind of do this thing I just said. So you can just take a smooth manifold, embed XA delta in there. embed xA delta in there and define a skeleton by further pushing forward. And one corollary you can get from this lemma is just that dB of A mod is equivalent to sheaf C X. First, you want to require it to be supported on X A delta, and then you want it you want the sheaves to be singular supported on the skeleton. Single support on the skeleton. So that would do. So let's go back to this projected plane example, right? So are you just saying that xa delta is not always a manifold? Like it's not a manifold in general? It's just, it's just, it's a simplicial complex. Oh, is it? Yeah. It's like, you know, you can do this for PN. You know, you can do this for PN, right? I mean, there's always those extra triangles, extra wings. So let's look at the trees. So in example number two, which is the P2 example, here's a Taurus. And the trees are basically the following. So the tree starting at zero consists of Of the three kind of three squares and the edges extended from it. So I'm already looking at the CW complex, not the simplest one to begin with. So T0 looks like that, and T1 starts at the blue dot, right? And there are three arrows going out, and T2 is just a point. Just a point. And so now you can take the constant sheaf on these guys and push it to the torus. And so below is the picture of the skeleton. So I guess I should probably explain a little bit about the hairy pictures here. So the hair denotes the co-normal directions you would get along Look at along a strata, along some strata. So here, basically, the CW complex gives you a stratification, and over those four points, those are the same point, essentially. You take the entire cotangent fiber, that means you take all the cotangent directions. And the hair along the lines would be the conormal directions to the line. And, you know, for each line, there are two conormal directions. And here I just mean, like, I take both. And so the skeleton, if you push forward the constant sheaves and take the singular support, of course, I apologize, I haven't defined the singular support in this talk. Singular support in this talk, but you can just think of it as: so the support measures, you know, kind of places on the manifold where the sheaf is not zero, basically. The singular support also remembers the direction of the jumps when you retreat from an open set, from an open ball around a point to Around a point to a half all around a point against the cotangent direction. And so it remembers more information than just the support. And so, right. So I'm just telling you, if you take the union of the singular support of the push forward all these trees, you would get this skeleton essentially. Where over this point in the middle, you would... Over this point in the middle, you would get a union of three cones. And the intersection of the three cones would be at zero, but zero in the cotangent fiber lives in the zero section, the manifold. So what you can do here is just that you can pull apart the three components. And that, if you're familiar with the mirror symmetry construction for P2. For P2, you will recognize the picture on the right, because the picture on the right is the mirror skeleton for P2. Yeah, so basically what I'm saying is just that the tree skeleton on T2, if you do a topological deformation like this, it would give you The mirror skeleton constructed from the fan. Okay, so now it's time to, I guess, talk about what we kind of want to do. If, so here's, I guess the definition is due to Napler originally. So if you have a continuous deformation of Lagrangian skeletons in the cotangent bundle, Skeletons in the cotangent bundle, its deprivation is not characteristic if the category doesn't change. And so, and generally, well, probably I phrased it the wrong way, I should probably say if there exists a full strong exceptional collection on some smooth DMTORX stack, I denote that collection, but But L. I want to say the following. I mean, you can take quiver associated with that full strong exceptional collection. So what we're working on is just that first we want to construct a minimal cellular resolution that embeds into a space like that. I haven't explained yet. And number two, we want to show that this minimal resolution that This minimal resolution that for a Tauric variety, this minimal resolution always deformation retract to the Taurus of the correct dimension. And number three, if you consider the skeleton associated with the trees, so constructed from the trees, you can deform that to the mere skeleton of the Torah writing. So I guess so this page of the slides may not be very satisfying, but it's probably the best explanation I can give. Like why should X be a Taurus cross R to the K? Like R to the K here is like Picard tensor R, essentially. The cart tensor R, essentially. So basically, the space I'm talking about is so if you recognize the bottom sequence here, if you have a Tauric variety, you would probably recognize the bottom short exact sequence here. And X, this ambient space X, I want to embed XA to, is R n mod M. So and And yeah, and somehow I wanted I wanted the CW complex to retract to the fiber torus. And so here's like a way to think about it at least. So here's a motivating theorem by Cron Smith. So if you have a projective toric variety with some base 0.3 line bundles and you take the endomorphism algebra. The endomorphism algebra, the direct sum, you get a quiver with relations. And you can realize this Tauric variety as moduli space of quiver representation with certain stability condition. And so you have this map. So there's a map from a Tauric variety to the GIT quotient from GIT quotient of CQ1. By a bigger Taurus that identifies the Tauric variety with the image of this map. The image of this map is essentially just you take the vanishing, you take the variety defined by the ideal of the quota and then quotient by the Taurus. So you, you know, the Taurus axiom restricts on this variety. You take the variety, you take the GFT quotient of this sub-variety. So but that will give you, if you look into their paper, this will give you kind of this short exact sequence in the middle where you have a map from ZQ1 to the weight lattice of the quiver, which is spanned by Um you know, e to the sorry, like e of the head of the uh of an arrow minus e of the tails. And so you have this, you know, incident, this lattice, incident map from ZQ1 to wake Q. And wait Q is a sublattice of ZQ0, and there's a kernel, and you can check that you have a commutative diagram. Have a commutative diagram where you can take the subspace spanned by just the linear relation in your equipper. And you would have a commutative diagram like this. And so, right, here, so here's the thing: right, if the div map that sends your The div map that sends your arrows to the monomials. If that map is searchive, we can have short exact sequences in the vertical direction. So your sequence for the toric variety is like a quotient of these complexes. And the good thing about the The good thing about this diagram is that we can, you know, although it's not like, yeah, we can, the good thing about it is that we can embed your, we can embed the simple complex we constructed at the beginning to not exactly that, but we can embed simple like simplicies in paths. Simplicies in paths, like we can embed the entire order complex of paths into RQ1. And that's, and we, you know, basically I want to identify this XA delta after some deformation retract, I want to identify it as a subspace of RM by this quotient idea. By this quotient idea. So each synflexing path can be modeled on this cube in RQ1, the unit cube in RQ1. And what you can do is that you can take Kv pre to be like everything greater than the constant path at V in path, not in mod. In pass, not in mod. So 1xxy would be a different simplex from 1yx, one yxy. 1yx, since x, y and yx are different, you know, those edges are not identified. But they're not identified in RQ1, but if you take the quotient, they will get identified. They will get identified. So that's what I wanted to say. So for each tree, you can do something like this, and you can view XA delta as the union of these pre-trees, the kernel of the incident map, and then you map it all down to this RN mod map. And of course, the image of that wouldn't be XA delta precisely, because if you think about the P2 picture, XA delta always has these three extra gray triangles. And those will get linearized when you map X-Pri down to the Taurus. So yeah, so here's a proposition, and you can define a map that the information retracts xa delta to the image of the pre-tree. And that's just a way to get your xA delta into this torus. Okay, so a few remarks. Is that so? The first one is that, like, One is that, like dim R, so the image of XAPR under dim R is not minimal. You know, it will have, for example, I mean, simplicity is still map to, like, if you have, you know, some simplicities that are non-linearized, so you can have, like, the square divided into two triangles that would still get mapped to a square. Get mapped to a square divided into two triangles, and that wouldn't be minimal. And like for surfaces, there are not many surfaces with full strong exceptional collections. So we can just take each of the cases and just draw the pictures and see if two. And I don't have a general proof why this would be a Taurus. But since we haven't used the fullness of the quiver yet, it will have to involve that. So, okay, so yeah, once you have a cellular resolution model on this cylinder, you can write down the projected bimodule resolution following the labs. Following the lab's recipe in their paper. So, okay, so I have some words to say about minimality and reduction of cells. And I'm not sure. I think this method at least is very cute. And so this kind of, like, the way I want to think about it, at least. At least. So XA is YA mod equivalence relation, and you can just take the face pulse set of this YA and you take the Hesse diagram of the face pulse set. So essentially, each cell is an element in your pulse set, and you take the Hessie diagram indicating the phase relation. And here's something you can do. You can define a matching on this HAC diagram. So if you have a matching, so if you have a matching on a graph, you can orient this graph in the following way. So for each matching, you orient the arrow upward, and for the rest of the edges, you orient it downward. Oriented downward, and if this oriented graph, you get it acyclic. There's a theorem studied by several people. I think the theory was studied by Foreman originally. Maybe so. Yeah, this is probably not a complete list of reference, but Foreman was the first person studying it, I think. I think. So if you have asynchronous matching, the unmatched cells would give you a CW complex. So you can do a simplicial collapse. If you have a simplicial complex with ACP matching, you can do a simplicial collapse and collapse your simplicial complex to a CW complex consisting of only unmatched. Consisting of only unmatched cells. And so, if you want to minimal CW complex, one thing that you may want to consider is to match as many cells as possible, because the matching is like a cancellation. So the unmatched cells are critical. They're like, you know, analog, they're an analog of critical points for a Morse function. And, you know, essentially, this theory is telling you that an. Telling you that an ASIC matching defines a discrete Morse function on the set of faces in your simplicial complex, and then the critical cells will give you the CW complex. Yeah, a much smaller one. And okay, you know, if you have a matching algorithm that somehow is maximal, then you can try. Then you can try to identify the cells in your CW complex and map it to the C basis of the minimal resolution. And that would prove that you have the correct thing. So here's our attempt, at least. I'll give an example. So how much time did I have? Ten minutes. So the matching diagram we have, algorithm we have. Diagram we have, algorithm we have, is just that you first extend the order in mon to linear order, to a length lex order. So basically this is just to say that you order the arrows and you specify that cells with arrows like coming with. With how do I say, if an error, so if error A comes with a 4B, then the cells with A comes before the cells with B. The cells with B. So we don't match any zero cells and consecutive one cells. Consecutive just means that you have a path and a path concatenated with an The path concatenated with an arrow. And inductively, you match the rest of the cells as much as possible. So basically the order will give you a minimal unmatched cell and the algorithm is just to match the minimal unmatched k cell to the minimal unmatched k plus 1 cell. And yeah, so that's an algorithm. Let's look at Hertzburg for a second, right? There are many cells if you think about it. If you think about what the simplicial complex looks like, there are many cells. But this is the quiver. This is the quiver for F3. And the relation is the commutativity relation. And And uh so let's just have some fun looking at the matching. So the matching for um so I have the matching for the trees. I mean so it's eventually we want a matching on XA, but you know that can be obtained from a matching on the trees that's compatible with the relation. And so you have this many zero cells and this many one cells and yeah, those are all one cells. Those are all one cells. I just separated the consecutive ones with the non-consecutive ones because we require at step one that the consecutive cells are unmatched. And we only match the rest of that. And so there are 19 of them, and you match it up. There are 19 two cells that are matched, and 11. It's okay. No, that's that's the Euler characteristic. But yeah. But anyway, I've labeled all of them. So basically, all the 192 cells are matched to the one cells, and those purple ones are matched to three cells. And so eventually, you would have all the cells on the right-hand side of the board unmatched, but there are some equivalence relations. But there are some equivalence relations among them. So if you count the equivalence relations, you will get the correct weather characteristic. So there are only four equivalence classes among the zero cells and nine among the one cells, and six equivalence classes for the two cells, and only one equivalence class for the three cells. For three cells. And so, yeah, right. And if you look at the quiver, right, there are like four vertices, nine arrows, and six relations, and one relation among relations. And the Hawkshield dimension is three. Okay, so you can draw the whole thing and see what's torus. Like, here's XACW for the Hertzberg. The picture on the left is for the Hertzberg. Is for the Hertzberg. So a torus is divided. Now I'm changing the variables. So I change x1 to x, x3 to y, and x4 to z just to make things easier. And the torus on the left is the torus with the Hertzbrook. And you can check for yourself that it's a Taurus, so you had points. So you have points with the same color identified, and edges with the same color identified. And if you count the number of points and edges and the two cells and this one tetrahedron on the bottom, you will get the correct structure. And basically, this is just a thickening of the half torus to Of a half torus to this tetrahedron thing on the bottom. Okay, so that's the quiver for the Hertzberg F3. And yeah, so I don't know why. The picture on the right is just showing is, you know, isotaurus. It's just easier way to see it's a torus. And the picture on the bottom is what you get for P113, the stacky P113. The stacky P113, where you have this quiver. So the quiver has five trees. So P113 has five trees. This has five vertices, right? But F3 only has four trees. Okay, so those are the pictures. And as you can see, they're both the two towers. Okay, so let me see how many more slides I have. Okay, great. I guess, yeah, I don't have a lot more to say. So let's discuss some applications of this thing. And a lot of this, you know, a lot of things on this page is still speculative, but on the next page, you can make things more precise more easily, I think. So we have the F3 and P113 VGIT example. So you can write down the two quivers and you can write down how the BGIT give you a semi-orthogonal decomposition where one of the categories into the other. And here, like if you consider the skeletons associated with the trees, they're very different. And it's also very different to compare it on a two-taurus. But it would be easier if you compare the skeletons in the cylinder. And so essentially, these spaces would live in, so this picture. Live in, so this picture here is Picard tensor R. And so what you do is that like your quiver would give you, in this example at least, the vertices of the quiver would be some points in this lattice, and you can, in this case, like all the xA. XA1 and XA2 both live in the pre-image of this region under this map, mu from R4 to R2. On the other hand, there are some results of mine and my collaborators that don't directly apply to this case, but in this case, To this case, but in this case, it definitely works because we had some conditions saying, you know, in what case it would work, and this case satisfies that condition. So basically, what you can, so the conclusion we have is just that you have a skeleton constructed from the generators, from the strong generator. The generators, from the strong generators, in this case. In this case, you want to take the five trees and you would have a skeleton whose shadow kind of resembled the GIT fan structure. And this skeleton is kind of universal in a way because, you know, the shadow of the skeleton sees the decomposition, and if you look at And if you look at an interior lattice point within the chambers, you would get the mirror skeleton. And the skeleton will have some characteristic changes along the walls when you cross the walls. And there are two paths when you want to go to MT. One is like directly from P113, another is going through F3. And so And so this kind of prescription, the CW complex prescription, lives in the pre-image of this region. And that gives you a way to kind of compare, you know, this two different wall crossing phenomena, essentially. And another application, I don't have more time for it, I think. I'll just say it briefly, right? Because this is not. Right? Because this is not really hard to see. So if I take the for math, you still have about 10 minutes of ingenuity. No, I only need like one or two minutes. Yeah. So if you take the Fermat polynomial, here's the grain plus or mirror, right? You take the Fermat polynomial, and you can get a hypersurface, and the hypersurface mod G max has a grain. Hyper surface mod Gmax has a green plesser mirror. Uh wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It has a green plus a mirror, which that's super potential. And if you extend the G max to this, you know, maximal symmetry group on your matrix factorization of your polynomial, you would get. You would get the Berglund-Hoofs-Krawitz mirror, which was proven to have a strong exceptional collection. And the mirror of this is the Fakaiocidal category with the Morsified inverse polynomial, Burke matrix. And so here one can see clearly the trees in the C-value. The trees in the CW complex correspond to the symbols of, yeah. And so this is the picture. So you can take x cubed plus y cubed plus z cubed. If you morsify, if you just take the one variable, like, I mean, this is the Tom Spassiani sum, so you can just take x cubed and morsify that, and you will get this kind of picture on the left. On the left, and the trees would go to. I mean, the picture on the left is just that you parallel transport the skeleton, the fiber, to the critical point in an orderly way given by the exceptional collection. You get a tree. And that tree is the same tree as this tree. As this tree skeleton, you get in the yeah, as the tree skeleton obtained from the quiver. And here, if you take the Fermat polynomial of three variables, the CW complex is just the three cube. It's not a toric variety, so it's not a torus anymore. But the CW complex is 3 cubed, and you have You have eight trees corresponding to eight vertices. And, you know, more generally, because you have, you know, like we have a VGIT prescription for the PHK mirrors in general, you know, you can take the VGIT approach, right, and the decomposition of the skeleton. According to this VGIT sequence, it would be very similar to this MARA program for TORAC VGIT. This was studied many years ago, 10 years ago, by the five guys. Okay, so yeah, so that's the story, and it's in progress, and that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you. Questions for Jason? Something you can do with a non-minute infection? Not for this prescription. No. What do you have about this? For non-viewing repa. So we So do you mean the C double complex or do you mean the mirror? I mean you probably want both, right? Yeah, the seed. So if you have, that's kind of a question I asked some people earlier. I asked many people earlier. So you can, I think one case one can consider is like Xn acting on is like xn acting on c2n by permuting the coordinates. And that way that way the quiver is still like, you know, it's kind of complicated. But the mirror, but the mirror should be something like you take R to N and there is a lattice and there is thus n and you take the semi-direct product of the groups and you let Of the groups, and you let that act, and you can take the singular support of the equivariant constructible sheaves on R2N with respect to action. And that would give you some skeleton, but I'm not sure if it's like the mirror on the nose. It's just some folklore that I've read from somewhere, but I don't know. May I ask you? Who? Sorry, who's that? My name is Alexei Bonhoeff. Oh. May I ask you? Did you see my report in Odor Ofa 15 years ago? It's about stratification of real Torres related to Torikura. That there is equivalence which you construct from the stratification, direct equivalence of the query with the relations which come from the stratification. Like what you this example for P2 is a very particular case of this, and many other things which are related to your talk. I see. Thank you. So you didn't see it, right? I did I didn't see it. I don't like that. I wonder how your constructions are related to that. I mean in particular the stratification you can get in different ways. One of them is by using geometric Frobinos and there is also just also just you can consider the fan of the torque right and then consider just as from the fan you can consider the stratification etc so maybe I'll just send you HS. Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome. No other questions. Let's thank Jesse again. Let's thank Jesse again. We'll be back at 10:30 local time.
