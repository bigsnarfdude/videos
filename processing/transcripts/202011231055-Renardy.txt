Okay, go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead. So I would like to finally we have really like a talk which is related to the main topic of the workshop. So this is Michael Renari and his pure stress modes for linear viscalistic closest variable coefficients. Okay, so I would like to thank the organizers. It's nice to be in band and I would also like to And I would also like to acknowledge my co-authors, Stevanjana Mitra, who was my postdoc for a couple of years, and Maithili Ramaswamy. So let me first of all explain what pure stress modes are and why we care about them. So we're looking at a linear Maxwell fluid. So we have the momentum equation, we lost the Velocity is divergence-free, and we have the constitutive law relating the stress to the velocity gradient. And let's say we are in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions for velocity. And what's going to be important in the following is we are going to deal with an inhomogeneous medium where these coefficients may be depending on space. Maybe depending on space. So, the question that motivated us is this one. Are viscoelastic flows under control or out of control? Or more precisely, can we choose a a body force F to steal this system from a given initial state to a dis to some desirable final state. Desirable final state. So, as usual, there is a duality between controllability and observability. So, what I'm going to do is multiply this constitutive equation by another tensor S divided by this coefficient kappa and integrate. And what results after the usual integration. After the usual integration by parts, is this identity? So we have d by dt of this, and then we have a term here, and we have this term on the right-hand side. And of course, if we can make these disappear, so we have that, and we have divergence s equals the gradient, then all of this disappears. And therefore, the time derivative of this quantity is zero. And therefore, at the final time, the value of this is equal to the same as the value of the initial time. And now, if we look at these two equations, then except for a reversal in the direction of time, they are exactly the same equation. Exactly the same equations. Oops. How do I go backwards? No, that's not what I want. Ah, there we are. So except for reversal of time, these are exactly the same equations as our original problem if we set the velocity equal to zero. The velocity equals zero. So, those would be solutions which have a stress but no velocity. So, that's what I call pure stress modes. So, these pure stress modes would be obstacles to controllability. Now, if we had constant coefficients, then all we have to do Then all we have to do is take an initial value for the stress, which has a divergence, that's a gradient, and there are lots of functions like that, and then let it evolve according to the evolution of the stress, which would be just exponentially in time. So, if we had constant coefficients, there would be a lot of these pure stress modes, which would optimize. Modes which would obstruct controllability, and we can also see that at the level of the original equations, because if this is constant, then whatever I put on the right-hand side here is a symmetric part of a gradient, and I could never steal the stress out of that subspace. Okay, so but if we make the coefficients spatially dependent, Coefficient spatially dependent, then if we evolve exponentially here, the divergence doesn't remain a gradient necessarily. And so the problem becomes a much, a lot more interesting. Okay, so I've more or less already said all this. So what can we say about the structure of pure stress modes? So let's now Stress modes. So let's now just look at these pure stress modes. So we have some initial condition. The only variables are the stress and the scalar pressure. They, of course, have to satisfy this constraint. So this we can solve explicitly. The solution is still an exponential. But now, if we take the divergence of that, it looks like this here. like like this here and i'm gonna i'm gonna make this substitution for the uh unknown pressure and i have to look at what becomes of this equation so that leads to to this and that includes that from that we can conclude that e to the minus lambda of xt times gradient q of x0 times gradient q of x0 is the gradient of q of xt. So we have a relationship between the gradient of the pressure at a later time to the initial gradient. So for the following we're going to make a non-degeneracy assumption that the gradient of lambda is non-zero and if we take the curl of this last equation what we find is that the That the cross product between the gradient of lambda and the gradient of the pressure of the initial pressure is zero. So if you have the cross product of two gradients being zero, then at least locally this means one is a function of the other. So Q of X0 must be some function of lambda. And then it follows that Q of XT is a function of. Q of Xt is a function of lambda nt, and that's related to this function phi in this way. So we have that, and now I finally set this initial tensor t tau minus pressure times identity equal to q. And we end up with this system divergence q has to be zero, and q plus phi. And q plus p prime of lambda identity gradient lambda is equal to zero. So I skip over all the details of deriving this, it's just algebra. So in terms of this unknown tensor q, what this equation tells us is that the gradient of lambda is an eigenvector of q. Okay, so now we do some naive equation count. Equation count. So if we count the number of variables, we have a symmetric tensor Q and we have this undetermined function phi of lambda. But phi of lambda is a function of only one variable as opposed to the components of Q, which are a function of all the space coordinates. So in this naive equation, So, in this naive equation count, I'll count this function phi as half an unknown. So, what do we have? In two dimensions, Q has three independent components, a symmetric tensor. This I counted as half. So we have three and a half unknowns, and we have these equations, which is two plus two equals four. So, we have four equations for three and a half unknowns. For three and a half unknowns, which is formally overdetermined. While in three dimensions, we have six equations for six and a half unknowns, which is formally underdetermined. I should also remark, we have always have a trivial solution where the pressure simpler, stress tensor and the pressure simply cancel each other. And so my question is going to be in the following. Are there Going to be in the following are there other solutions in addition to this trivial one? So, knowing that so in two dimensions, let n be the normal of the unit normal of level curves of lambda, and E is a unit tangent vector, so we can represent q in terms of these dyadic properties. These dyadic products. And since gradient lambda is an eigenvector of q, of course, this has to be zero. And beta is determined by that eigenvalue. So if we write down the equation gradient q divergence q equals zero, it becomes this, these two equations. And these coefficients kappa one and kappa two are geometric. Kappa 1 and Kappa 2 are geometric quantities. One is the curvature of the level curves, and the other one also has a geometric interpretation. So we can use this to find that. And for non-zero kappa one, we can solve for alpha and results, insert the result in the other equation. So if we make some other non-degeneracy assumptions. Some other non-degeneracy assumption that this is non-zero, we find that phi double prime is zero, which makes q a constant multiple of the identity. And this solution simply corresponds to a spatially constant isotropic pressure, which is not of interest. So, under generic hypotheses, indeed, in the two-dimensional case, no non-trivial stress modes exist. Now, in the three-dimensional case, Now in the three-dimensional case, the situation is quite different. So again, gradient lambda is an eigenvector of Q. So now we take the normal to the level surface of lambda and we have two linearly independent tangent vectors. We can write Q in terms of dyadic products like that. And now if we write down the condition divergence Q equals zero, we get divergence q equals zero, we get three equations for these coefficients alpha, beta, gamma. And I've written out only the leading order terms in this three by three system. So we get two first order equations and one zeroth order equation, which look like this. And now we have here these coefficients L, N and M. L, N, and M, which again can be written down in terms of geometric quantities. So the first question you may ask, what is the type of this TE system? And that is determined by the combination L times N minus M square. And that combination, again, as a geometric interpretation, A geometric interpretation: namely, up to an irrelevant factor, it's the Gauss curvature of the level surface of lambda. So, it turns out that the system is elliptic if that Gauss curvature is positive and hyperbolic if it is negative. So, and indeed this system of equation is completely decoupled as to Completely decoupled as to different level surfaces of lambda. So we can consider solutions completely separately for each level surface. Okay, so in the elliptic case, let's make an assumption that the level surface of lambda has a transverse intersection with the boundary. Intersection with the boundary of our physical domain. And then on that boundary curve, we can supplement the elliptic PDE system with a boundary condition. So we have on that boundary curve two different normals. We have a normal to that boundary curve within the tangent plane of the level set. level set, a level set of lambda, and we have a tangent vector to the boundary curve. So we can, for instance, prescribe either of these two quantities. And in either case, that boundary condition satisfies the complementing condition of Eggman-Douglas-Niremberg. And therefore, we can prove that solutions exist. Prove that solutions exist for boundary for given boundary data, at least in a space of finite codimension. So for any level surface like this, we have a lot of non-trivial pure stress modes. And again, I can consider this problem separately for each level surface, and using a pretty standard approach, I Standard approach, I can also piece them together smoothly to find a three-dimensional solution that way. So this is what you can in general say about the elliptic case. Now, in the hyperbolic case, of course, you expect well-posed problems not for boundary value problems, but for boundary initial value problems. But without But without having some rather specific assumptions about the geometry of these level surfaces, I don't know what in general I can say about that further. So that's what I have to say about those pure stress modes, and I'm ready for questions. Thank you. For questions, thank you. Okay, thanks, Michael. So
