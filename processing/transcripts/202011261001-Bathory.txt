Thank you for the introduction. And this work is a follow-up of my doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Mirsa Gulicek and Josef Malek. And as you can see, the title is quite complicated, so I'll be considering rather complex points. So let me first explain what I mean by this. Me, first, explain what I mean by viscoastic fluid. So, many fluids in our world are not only viscous, but they also exhibit some kind of elastic behavior. And to name some examples, it may be glues, oils, liquid polymers, molten glass or metals, or various biological fluids such as blood or saliva, and so on. And in 1B, there are nice. In 1b, there are nice analogues to these fluids that the fluid molecules consist of these shapes. In blue, there is a dashboard, which represents the viscous part of the fluid, and in red, you see the spring, which represents the elastic behavior of the fluid. And you can combine them in many ways, of course, which will lead you to many different models. But this is also But it is also often the case that the elastic properties of these viscoastic fluids depend very significantly on the temperature. So the isothermal simplifications of these models might not be very relevant in applications. And for this reason, our goal is to identify some class of thermodynamical reasonable models for complex fluids and proof and include. and prove in including the temperature evolution and prove that the resulting PD system will have a global in-time solution for any given data with finite energy and entropy. So let me briefly introduce the model. So good starting point are the Naverstog equations, where due to the theory of Le Ray and Hopf there exists a weak solution to this system which in addition satisfies the energy inequality. Satisfies the energy inequality. So, we would like to really generalize this theory by allowing two additional physical effects. First, the elastic behavior of the fluid and second, conduction of heat and the temperature dependence of material coefficients. So, how can we add elasticity into the system? This can be done by the composition of the Pauchi-stress tensor into the viscous part which you are which you Which you know from the Navier-Stokes fluids. But now the viscosity may depend on the temperature. And there's also an elastic contribution which may depend on temperature and on some tensor B which somehow describes the forces that arise due to the elastic part of the deformation of the fluid. There's some notation by DVL denotes the symmetric part of the velocity radiant. Symmetric part of the velocity gradient, and by Wv, I will denote the anti-symmetric part. So, with this constructive assumption, the momentum balance takes now this form, where I add this additional force to the right-hand side. So, now, of course, I have two other unknowns, theta and b, and I need to provide some equations to close the system. And this is really part of the mathematical modeling, and there's a lot of physics going on. Physics going on, which is interesting, but since I want to talk about the mathematical analysis of the resulting PD, I'm afraid I will have to skip this now. So let me just tell you that you can derive the model if you prescribe the Helmholtz free energy by this formula and if you prescribe the rate of entropy production by this formula. And now I recall. And now I recall the talk by Havit Prusha on Tuesday who said that if you know psi and xi, then you know everything. And this is really almost true and it will lead you to these constitutive equations. So in particular, note that I obtain also the equation for B as a constitutive relation. And here this D-wed circle denotes some This gives circle denotes some kind of objective derivative, and instead of this function, I may imagine, for example, b minus identity or b squared minus b to, for example, model the Gisecus model and so on. And I also introduce the stress diffusion, which is this term, and I really want this term to be there because there's actually Because there's actually a certain physical justification behind it. So, once I plug these considerative relations into the general balance laws, I'll finally arrive at my system that I want to study. So, I have Niger strokes with additional force and I have equation for B and these terms come from the objective derivative. And also, I have the correct equation for temperature because I also have this contribution here. This term is sometimes omitted in some approaches to thermoelasticity, and it be the most difficult term in the analysis to control, because it is hard to make it integrable, and it also spoils the minimum principle that you would have for the temperature heat. You would have for the temperature mean. So, I complete this system by some standard boundary conditions and initial conditions. And really, for the velocity, for example, you can do anything you can do for Navier-Stokes, and it will work here as well. Okay, so let me proceed with the mathematical analysis of the model. So, first of all, why is it difficult? So, there are indications that even There are indications that even the isothermal Nauer-Stokes model coupled to the diffusive Old Regby model might be an LPOS problem in three dimensions for large time intervals and for large data. And the reason is, of course, these terms on the right-hand side. Because of them, you will be able to test this equation only with some negative power of b. This will produce rather poor estimates. Rather poor estimates on B. And people usually tend to think that if you add this stress diffusion into the system, then it will make the analysis easier. But I would say that this is true only if you are able to test this equation with some positive power of B. But if not, then you are doomed and this term does not help you. And it rather makes it more difficult because It rather makes it more difficult because it rules out certain other test functions which you might want to use. And furthermore, I'll add the temperature evolution into this system. It will, of course, make it not easier because it will destroy the energy inequality. The system is not dissipative anymore. And the energy might be transformed into entropy and heat. Therefore, I need to help the system in some way. Help the system in some way. So I'll do this by imposing sufficient growth assumptions on the thermal conductivity kappa and on this function P. And this is quite all right from the physical point of view because you can interpret it as an entropy producing mechanisms. You can just say that the fluid produces more entropy compared to, for example, Gisecus fluid. Example, Gizekus fluid, at least for large elastic deformations or for excessive temperatures, because the only thing which is important is the asymptotic growth of these assumptions for the analysis. So here it is precisely, so I'll assume that the viscosity is bounded, that the thermal conductivity has an R growth near infinity. I'll assume that the coefficient of the stress difference Efficient of the stress diffusion is bounded. And for simplicity in this talk, I'll assign this particular function to this P. But yeah, you can see that this is reminiscent of the Audrey B and Gizekus models, but only thing which is important for now is that the whole function has a growth of Q plus 1. If you sum these powers, you will see that P grows as B to the power of. grows as b to the power of q plus 1 okay and in addition i will also assume that initial condition for b admits some additional integrability which will be described by this row greater than 1. So in the end I have three parameters to play with in the analysis. And for the existence I can expect that the larger these parameters are the easier it will be to prove the existence of Will be to prove the existence of solution. Okay, so first I have to arrive at some meaningful definition of each solution. So I will proceed with the estimates formally. And as I suggested before, the energy equality does not provide much information now. It only tells you that V is L infinity L2 and temperature is L infinity L1. And let's There's another difficulty compared to November Stokes for air fluid that you are not able to deduce estimates on gradient or velocity simply from the momentum equation. You need to do something else because you have these additional terms on the right-hand side, including B. So instead, we focus first on this equation for B and we want to exploit this additional integrability of the initial datum. Of the initial datum, we want to pass this equation by a certain matrix power of b. This power will be sigma minus one, where sigma is defined as minimum of rho and b. So you see that I would really like to, if I go back, I would really like to treat this equation, sensorial equation, as a scalar equation, because I'm going to test it by some colour of solution. And to be able to do this, And to be able to do this, you need to do some estimates. The most interesting part are the estimates of this term. So these are some estimates for the derivatives of positive definite matrices. And this can be really done and you can find it in this small red print if you wish. And this will eventually lead to this estimate where the most important part is here. So, I see that I need to get some control over the velocity gradient to make it work. And for that, I go back to the temperature equation again. And I see that there is this viscous dissipation term on the right-hand side. So if I multiply this equation by minus some negative power of temperature, this term will move to the left-hand side and eventually it will produce. And eventually it will produce this estimate that you can see on this line. And now it's just a matter of Helder inequalities and subliff environments and interpolation to deduce that the velocity gradient is bounded within this p-norm where p is defined as this number. But all this works only if this condition A1 holds. But actually, together with this additional condition A2, which is needed to control the convective term, this is all you need to define a sensible notion or weak solution. However, you have to lower your expectations very significantly. Because in the temperature equation, you have these terms theta, B times Dv and Dv squared, which might not be integrable. Not be integrable even if these conditions k1 and a2 hot. For this reason, we replace the temperature equation at some point with the entropy inequality. And this is really much easier to define because the left-hand side is in the divergence form and it dominates the right-hand side, which is non-negative. So all which is on the right-hand side. All of which is on the right hand side is integrable a priori. So this leads us to the appropriate notion of weak solution. So here the most important thing is that I require the tensor B to be a symmetric, a positive definite matrix almost everywhere. And the temperature must be positive almost everywhere. Then I require this regularity. And then I require that this I require that this thermodynamical identity holds, and finally, I want that these integral identities are satisfied. So, here I have momentum equation, equation for B, entropy inequality, and I also have the global conservation of the energy. But now, this is really global because it is just ODE in time. So, the main result is that if I have So the main result is that if I have square integrable body forces and some initial data with this regularity, and if those conditions A1 and A2 hold, then I have existence of a global in-prime weak solution to this system. And in addition, I'm able to prove that if this condition C holds, then also the temperature inequality will hold. And also we can study what conditions are sufficient. What conditions are sufficient for the local balance of total energy, for example? It will turn out that the condition lies somewhere in between. Okay, so let me say a few words about the proof. So on the upperximet level, initially, I would like to work with the temperature equation instead of entropy inequality, simply because I need to prove at some point that the temperature is positive. And having some numerics in mind, I would like. Having some numerics in mind, I would like that the proof is constructive using a Galerkin method. So, what I facing is a problem that there is something like an orthogonal basis for this subolef space where the functions, where the values of functions might be in this set of positive definite matrices, which is clearly not a linear space. But we avoid this question completely This question completely by using the usual basis constructed by eigenvalues of generalized Stokes operator and truncating the most annoying terms in the PD. This will be truncated by this function g and here the uppercase lambda is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix A. So what it does is that if the smallest eigenvalue is too small, then it is zero. Is too small, then it is zero. Yes. Similarly, if the temperature is too small, it is also zero. This is just some normalization, and this helps to estimate the non-linearities. But in the end, the whole thing should converge to one if everything goes well. And then with this cutoff, the equations for B and for temperature become just convection-diffusion equations with some additional bounded terms. Therefore, we have minimum principles. Principles. So, in particular, we can prove minimum principle for the eigenvalues of B and also for the temperature. This means that once you converge out of the Galaxy for B and for temperature, that your solution will be positive definite matrix and the temperature will be positive, even if the basis functions did not satisfy this. So, this allows you to define the inverses, and this is crucial. And this is crucial to derive the entropy equation because you can follow this identity and derive it. So the entropy equation is important because you can read from there that these logarithms are integrable and therefore the strict positivity of the terminal B and of temperature is uniform with respect to all parameters. And ultimately, this. And ultimately, this enables you to remove basically the cutoff and arrive at the solution of the original system. Okay, I might be running out of time, so actually the payment of initial conditions is also quite interesting. There are two issues. The first thing is that you would like also to have some initial condition for the temperature, but For temperature, but we lost the temperature equation in the process, right? So we have to somehow compare the information that is coming from the entropy inequality with the information that is coming from the energy inequality to first prove that the temperature converges strongly. And only then you can prove that the velocity converges strongly as well. And for B, we use some specially designed tests. Specially designed test function. So, let me finish with the overview of the result in three dimensions. So, I recall that this number p is the best possible intimidability we are able to prove for the symmetric part of the velocity gradient. And with this definition, we can slightly rewrite the conditions, this A2, A1, M. This a2, a1, and so on, and we arrive at this table. So, if p is greater than 6 over 5, and if r is greater than this number, then we have existence of weak solution, which means the momentum balance equation for b and the entropy inequality. Then, if p is greater than 8 over 5, we also have some global balance of kinetic energy as an inequality, of course. An inequality, of course, and also we gain compactness of velocity, trace of velocity in L t, which might be useful when you are dealing with some general boundary conditions. And further, if p is greater than 9 over 5 and r satisfies this, then you have also local balance of total energy. Now, this of course holds only if you are able to prove by whatever method the By whatever method, that the pressure is integrable. And finally, the terminal case is that if P is equal to 2, then you have also the local balance of temperature. So you see, it was initially a bit surprising for me that these numbers are precisely the same as you would see for the Navier stokes for P-fluid, right? Which you could see in the better stroke. But we have a completely different model. This number P is arising in a completely different way. It is basically describing the thermal elastic behavior of the fluid and not the viscous part of the fluid. Okay, so thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Michal. Thank you.
