Thank you very much. Thank you very much. My name is Hossein Rahmani. I'm a former PhD student at the University of Labal under Supervision of Resource Ababi. I joined Professor Jerry Fregaard group just before the New Year holidays. Since then, I mean after the holidays, I started working on the network modeling of illustrators fields in sports media. First of all, First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for organizing such a wonderful workshop. In addition, I would like to do a special thank you for providing this opportunity for me to present my work. So I'll start with the outline. I mean, I'll start with the introduction of the applications, I mean of the previous work of the discovery in Porus Media. In press media. Then I will talk about the methodology that we developed, then some basic results of this work and the conclusions. So focusing on the basically it doesn't work very well. Okay, I see. So Okay. So the numerical works of the numerical works on modeling is classic computing. Porous media, I just want to just present some of the works. First, in this slide, we're going to show the Porisket simulations. Back in 2004, Batman basically started addressing this problem. So as you basically are familiar with You basically our family or based on Darren's presentation. So there is a critical pressure for the classic looks in Force Media that after this critical pressure they have to floor in the basically system. Layer back to 2014 basically, they start simulations in the pore scale and basically it is caused And basically, it's caused by some sort of possible breakage of the microscopy, the major riological features in the core scale. A former PhD student in Frigard at UBC, he developed a couple of work on the basically plastic flues in Port Meteo. And as you can see, they could basically capture this nice club. Nice club regions, both the ditsungs and the moleclog. Recently, Tavarian and his colleagues basically studied the problem comparing the viscopelastic and elastic flex. Regarding the pore network modeling, I can also mention of the earlier works of Balo and then there have been some work by Sushi. And you can see And you can see many of the works by Talon that, I guess, you're familiar with these countries that Laren just presented today. So, in addition, there are some other works by Frag Gedalkis and also one of the former PhD students in Frigaard that basically modeled the two-phase law of Aeron Muscoplastic, that Aero pushes the miscoplastic for the menu for. So inspired by the analogy between the following Heli shot cell and forest media, we basically rely on basically solving Stokes equation of a Herschel-blocky fluid in a Helser cell. We consider this domain, as you can see. So we have the zero flux of the string function. Zero flux of the string function at the inlet and outlet. That means that we don't have any vertical flow, so the pressure at the inlet and outlet is fixed. So also we have psi 0 and psi q at the lower and upper boundaries, which means that we have a flow rate of Q in the system. If we basically solve this problem and define a gap average stream function, we can reach to this. We can reach to this basically equation for the history function that represents the historian function as a function of the pressure drop in the system, the edge, which is basically the size of the gap that we have, the yield stress and other geological parameters of the flow. So we have here the pressure draw, which is basically S, as also Don Can mentioned. So we have the one So we have the one contribution, the viscous part contribution of the pressure drop, and also the stress contribution. So we can remove the pressure, the pressure gradient, so to find this equation. Okay, so looking at the variational calculus methodology that we have a little to solve this problem, the continuum model that I'm going to now talk about is we consider two test sets that basically here are the Basically, here the phi is basically belongs to the Sovolov space. And since we need to have a closed space, as you can see here, this, I don't know, it's called V, it's not, it's on the boundary conditions, not closed. And then we define some sort of perturbation parameter here. And to be able to do that, we define a base solution for this test function that basically satisfies. This function that basically satisfies the flow rate. So based on the base flow, we have always the flow rate in the system. I just need to solve this perturbation test function that basically have this boundary condition that is now the closed oscillator closed space. So using the divergence theorem, we can change that elliptical coefficient to this one. And since the boundaries are now for the perturbation term here, For the perturbation term here, as I mentioned, we can make sure that the second term is going to be zero. So, doing some algebra, we can find this variational inequality, and basically the solution of this inequality is equivalent to finding the minimum, I mean to minimize this function. So, we have a velocity potential that we're going to minimize, and this has a viscous part and also a yield stress part. As you can see, the yield stress part is not. Can see the yield stress part is not differentiable, so we have two choices. We can do the polarization or the using the augmented Lagrangian method. So, we use the augmented Lagrangian method, and so this problem leads to solving a saddle point problem. That here we have this mu, which is the Lagrangian multiplier, and R, which is called the augmentation parameter. So now I want to talk about the network model. Talk about the network model and make the analogy with the Helmshasse flow. Okay, so this is my basically my mesh for the pressure nodes. So you can see that the pressure nodes are located at the cell corner. Using a segregated mesh, I can have the basically string function nodes at the cell centers. And so And so we can have the flow rate in the x-direction, which is the difference between the psi and y-direction at these horizontal edges of the cell. And then we have the QY, which is the flow rate in the vertical edges. So looking closer to this problem, here I have the T node, so I call it K. It has in 2D it has. It has in 2D, it has I and J as basically indicator of these nodes. I could be in the X-direction J. I have this sine node here that is basically staggered mesh, so it's half above and to the right. Then I have this flowed in x-direction and in y direction. Okay, so if I have other two notes here, if I consider Two nodes here, if I consider other two nodes here that I call them K star, you can see that the difference between this side here and here provide me with the flow rate here, okay, in this horizontal edge. And if I find the difference between these two sides, I have the flow rate y. So based on this, we can think about having a network. That's basically the pore is basically the pressure mode. We have this. mode we have these throats that I basically showed them with these dashed lines. This is the horizontal throat in our network system and it's going to be the vertical through. And the new thing here is that in the hell shell cell we had h so in the continuum model we had h. Now for every third in the horizontal and vertical ones we need to define another value of h. So I call it h. So I call it Hx and actually H1. Okay, so if you remember in the continuum we had these equations, we had this relation for grad of psi versus pressure drop, and also we might minimize this velocity potential. If we take the idea and follow the same mathematical procedure, we can find, instead of this relation, we can find this relation. This relation basically provides us with the Basically, provide us with the difference in the stream function versus the difference in the pressure drop. So, if I have the difference in the pressure in the string function up and down, I can find the basically pressure drop in the horizontal circle. And also, it's a function of the relativity of properties. And when I try to find this velocity potential, I can find that this has two components. I can found that this has two components. One I call Px, which is the viscous part, but it is in the horizontal direction. I have a critical pressure drop, which is basically in the x direction, and another two terms that are basically in the y direction for the vertical throats. And the pressure, critical pressure drop here is related to the yield stress, the gap size that for the horizontal and vertical, they could be different, also the size of the throw. Also, the size of the throat that we have. Okay, so we solve both the problems, the continuum and the network model, with the Uzova iteration method. So the second problem that we had basically reduces to solving this Poisson equation. And here we have this psi, which is the string function, and q here basically is the grad of phi that we had, that phi was our test function. Test function and Î¼, as you remember, was the Lagrangian multiplier. So, in the continuum model, we need to basically find the Q in the next step, we need to just locally minimize the problem. Doing that, we find this relation that we can simply solve to find basically the pressure dual misuses part and also the flow rate. And then, with this basic relation, we can update the new mu, which is the Which is the Lagrangian multiplier, and then put it back to this Poisson-Solver equation and iterate on that to find the converged solution. But what happens when we have a network model? Then we have a network model. This solution basically is now separated in two parts. We need to minimize that in most the vertical and horizontal direction, so we get these equations. And also, we can do the same for these other equations and basically have equation in the x and y direction. X and Y direction. So we did solve this problem with second order finite difference code in math. Okay, so I would like to present some of the results. First, I talk with some results for the validation of the codes. Here I use generally a Bingham fluid for these results, but the model is capable of handling the Herschel volatility. But I just present the Bingham fluid results for being illustrators of. For being a yielder stress of one Pascal and the consistency coefficient of point one. And here I use a large pressure drop, which is 10 cube Pascal. So consider this simple geometry, the 1D variation in y direction. It's a kind of petition cell that the follow goes from left to right. So you can see and we have the maximum thickness here and the minimum thickness there. This has the exact solution in the as you can see with the da uh black line. Can see with the black line, and with the continuum model, I just analyzed the effect of mesh size and saw that as we increase the mesh, there is a better match between these two models. And so if I want to look at the network solution, here I have this network solution that the photo goes from left to right as expected, because this is just 1B. And so we expect that the vertical. Uh so we expect that the vertical edges must be blocked because we don't have any flow and I'm showing that block through the grey colour. So if you can look at the flow rates and compare that, it's almost close. And then if I have a finer network, I see the same phenomena, but maybe more accurate results. So I have a larger flow rate at the title score. Flow rate at the t-squared of the penitential and smaller at the tin score. Now I choose the same geometry. I choose a very small pressure drop is 125 Pascal and you can see there is a plot flow here. In the tin part of the gap, there is a plot flow. And again, then we have a mix of 50 by 50. I can fairly get a good result. So now So now here we should have a plug in this area in the TIN port and the network model also can show that. So the horizontal edges are now blocked. We don't have any flow here. And if I show it for the finer mesh, I can see the same trend. But now I try to analyze the result in a more complex geometry. So we have 2D variations. 2D variations. Okay, so you can see that the continuum model having 50 plus 50 grids. Okay, so we showed this result. We expect to have the maximum pressure, maximum flow rate at the center. And you can see the string functions that they coming from left and going to the center. And then again, deviating that from the center. So if I look at the network model, the network model also predicts that the Moxo fluid is going to be. Predict that the Muxon flow rate is going to be at the center. And you can see that here flow goes down and then here goes up. They merge the center flow and then again they go up and down. And also you can see that the flow rate is kind of satisfied at the pressure nodes. That are basically the pores. So for a finer grid, I can see the same result with maybe more accurate data. I could also saw some blog. I also saw some blocked vertical throat here that could be kind of symmetry here at the center of this basically network. I have symmetry, so it could be related to that. But now I'm going to think about a smaller pressure drop. So the same geometry, the continuum model suggests that the flow should be like this. So more deviated towards the center. So, more deviated towards the center and also vertical structure close to the heel. So, this is the flow rate problem. I mean, the flow rate that I show in the network. And there are some beautiful things that you can see that, for example, here this network can also capture these kind of vertical structures here that we see close to the center. And maybe it's more obvious here. But the problem that I have The problem that I have is that when the pressure drop is small, I see that based on if I consider the criteria of the blocked path, I see that the vertical edges, all of them are blocked. And it's not basically, it shouldn't be like that. Because if these two vertical edges are blocked, it means that the flow rate is not satisfied at the pawn. The point. But you can see that the flow rate is satisfied here. Okay, we have flow, we have flow rate in vertical edges, but the criteria that we use basically tells us that it should be blocked. So I will elaborate more on that. So now I thought maybe it's about the f size of the mesh, so I use the finder size of the network and I guess I saw the same problem. I saw the same problem that blocked vertical pages. All the vertical edges are blocked. But here we can see that we have two. So now I looked at another geometry. So I have two fields and two values, basically. So I expect that the flow should go around the thickest part. For a large pressure drop, you can see that the flow goes from the larger the thickest part and then basically we have less flow here. Basically, we have less flow here. The network model can capture that very well. The large pressure drops, you can see that flow goes there and then goes down, then goes out. In the finer, basically, grid, I can see the same. And very interesting thing also that the network can capture the details of the flow is that, for example, here you can see the flow going down. There are some vertical components that are going down, and the network can capture that. And again, we have a vertical component. That and again, we have a particle component that goes up, and the network also can capture that. But again, when I have a smaller, when I have a very small pressure drop, the same geometry, the continuum model tells me that I should have some clock regions just behind and in front of the valley, okay, in both colours. And when I look at the network model, I see that again, every vertical edges are blocked. Every vertical edge are blocked, but I see some one basically blocked, two blocked horizontal edges that may represent this. So you can see it here. I plotted in a considerable finder network. And again, I have the same problem that vertical edges are blocked, but you can see that the horizontal edges are now very well captured, that this is just this region that we shouldn't have. We shouldn't have flow. So, the conclusion is that we developed continuum network models for this class through in first media. The models are based on gap average equations for the additional cell. And we use the variational analysis, we are metal averaging method, and we solve the minimization problem using the Uzova algorithm. And so, for the network model, the velocity potential is minimized for each component at each different direction. At each different direction. The network model can capture the flow rate in both horizontal and vertical throws. The horizontal throat can be blocked for a small pressure drop. The vertical throat should both remain open or blocked. But here, the problem that we had is that, based on the theory that we developed, the critical pressure for the vertical stroke should be this. So it's related to the hinder stress, the thickness of the basically. Basically, vertical throat that basically is the discretization size of our system and the gap size in the y that we define. So now the question is if this basically can say that what should be the correct maybe criteria for this pressure drop that provide us with the With correct block path throats. And the thing is that if you have a helicopter cell with some H value, we can have many choices for HY and H. So if I change the value of HY here, if I use a larger value, I have a smaller pressure drop and cadmiate opens the blocked vertical. Opens the blocked vertical throats. So now I'm basically trying to find a solution for this one. Thank you very much. Alright, we have some time for some questions. Any questions?
