All right, wonderful. So, first of all, so my name is Ahmed Sidaghi. I'm postdoc fellow at Carleton University and the supervision of Professor Zaro and Donald Dawson. So, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity. So, today I will present some ongoing research in collaboration with Professor Zaru. In collaboration with Professor Zaru and Donald Dawson, and I will present the topic: a fluid model for multiple TCP and UDP connection throughout the network of use in a random environment. So, the plan, first, I will introduce the UDP and TCP protocols. So, I will review some important features of these two main protocols. And then, I will present how to model TCP and UDP connections. DP connections and therefore I represent our model in the sense that we represent multiple TCP and UDP connections through network of queues and then I represent how we can scale the model in order to ambisticate the large numbers of connections and also I will share with you a result, we convergence result of the model toward a limiting process. A limiting process. So, first, the TCP, so the transmission control protocol and the user data gray protocol are the two major protocol suite for data transmission in the internet. So, the major difference between these two protocols is that the TCP provides flow and congestion control, where the UDP does not provide any control, any congestion control. Control. So when multiple connections are interacting through a given router or this given node, congestion control mechanisms are used to rerogate the TCP transmission rate across the gateway by regrowing the connection sending grades in order to prevent congestion. So basically, TCP is an algorithm used to prevent the congestion in a given network of nodes. So the network congestion occurs when Congestion occurs when a pocket from a given source or sender or server exceeds what the destinations can handle. And the network congestion can lead to different big problems. For example, we can have packet growth, transmissions, reduced data throughput, performance degradations, and even in some extreme cases, it could result in network collapse. Therefore, to avoid Therefore, to avoid congestion, congestion avoidance algorithms are used. And one of the most congestion avoidance algorithms is the TCP. So the TCP protocol uses a congestion window variable which can name W. So this variable limits the amount of data that can be sent into the network before receiving an acknowledgement. So TCP agreement two main phases. So there Main phases. So there is other phases in practice, in some practice, but let's focus on these two main phases. So the first phase is the slow start mode. In this phase, the TCV connection starts up geometrically increasing the congestion windows, so the congestion rate of sending, until it crosses the slow start threshold. So there is a slow start threshold that when the W exceeds this slow start threshold, This rule start threshold. We go to the congestion avoidance mode. When we are in congestion abundance mode, so this mode starts once W so the congestion windows is greater than the slow start threshold. This mode follows an additive increase and multiplicative decrease scale. So I represent to you what is an additive increase and the multiplicative decrease or aim scale. So first the source So first the source sends new packet at time an audioment is received for the previous packet. So the net of time it takes for a packet to be sent plus the net of time it takes for an audioment of that packet to be received is called the round trip time. So basically at each round if all the packets are successfully transmitted then the transmission window is increasingly Transmission window is increased by one. So we have a linear growth. If a congestion is detected either by a receipt of a duplicate analogy or even a timeout signal, therefore the sender decreases the congestion window size by a given factor F. So here basically we have the resume of the scheme. So at the beginning of a given want, if there is no if there is no loss among the W buckets then the windows is increased by one otherwise the windows is decreased by factor error so error basically in practice in general is equal to one half so after reducing w TCP goes back to slow start mode so here in this presentation we will ignore the slow start component and we focus on the Start component and we focus on the congestion avoidance files. So we will just focus on the behavior of the algorithms during this file, so during the congestion avoidance phase. So using an adequate scanning procedure, a flow rate representation means in continuous state space of the window size can be obtained. So this has been done in This has been done in this paper, so in Duma and in 2002. So the idea is to interpret the congestion windows as a continuous time and continuous space stochastic process where it is interpreted as instantaneous throughput of the connection at time t. And this process is basically a Markov process with this given infinity similar generator. So in this infinity similar generator, we have the two Generator, we have the two components of the aim algorithms. So we have the linear growth, which is represented, which is characterized by here the parameter A. And A is basically related to the inverse or activity, so the round trip time. Because remember that the source sends new packets as time, the acknowledgement is received for the previous packet. So therefore, The previous packet. So, therefore, the rate of sending is basically related to the inverse of this RTT. The variable B here drive actually the MOS rate and it will depend on the state of the nodes used by the conditions. So, basically, this infinity simulation generator will characterize the given continuous time continuous space Markov process. So, the Markov process, though we So the macro process WT increases unearthly at rate A, and given that this window or this process is equal to given X at time T, it jumps at time T at rate X from X to R X. So R is the rate of reductions. So this process can be represented as a suggestion of the Markov process, which is given by this stochastic differential. Given by this stochastic differential equation driven by a Poisson process. So here basically n is a Poisson process on Erg2 with a Meerberg intensity measure on this R2. So this equation, so this stochastic equation characterizes basically the behavior of one single connection, one single TCP connection. So now So now we will look at the UDP flow or the UDP protocol. So the UDP connection doesn't depend on the state of the network. So the idea is that UDP is used as a nightwide protocol without congestion control. So there is no congestion control. And therefore, it is completely independent on the state of the network. The UDP in practice is suitable for delay sensitive traffic such as video and video. Such as video and voice applications. So, some observations suggest that UDP flow follows Poisson arrival distribution, and therefore we propose to model the UDP connection by a given inhomogeneous Poisson process, given by basically this anti-gar relative to a given Poisson point measure. To a given person-point measure. Here we propose to use the rate as a stochastic process, so we propose to use a random rate, but in practice, we can also consider a constant here as the rate of arrival of this possible process. So, this is just a general idea. Now, we will consider a model where we have multiple TCP and UDP. Multiple TCP and UDP connections going through a network of queues. So here, imagine we have capital G nodes through which NPTCP and NUUDP connections are accommodated. We consider two families of process. So the first family of process WT representing the behavior of the TCP connections and the second family VT representing the behavior of Representing the behavior of the UDP connections. Also, we suppose that the nodes of the network are implementing a dynamic routing protocol. So what it means is that the routes taken by the different connections could change dynamically due to the network topology or due to the state of the nodes. And the state of the nodes basically refers to the congestion level. So the roots or the route. So the roots or the routing is dynamically changing here according to both network topology and the congestion at each node. That's why we have what we call a random environment. So the dynamical routing process or the dynamical routing protocol can be considering as let's say dynamical aggregation matrix A T which change which is which is Which change, which is which is dependent on time, and this A T characterize the root of the connection. So basically, A I G at time T is equal to one if the Eth connection passes through the node G at time T and equal to zero. So it is zero, one value stochastic process, continuous time stochastic process. The state of the coefficient A A G AAG at time t depends on the dynamical routing algorithm which takes into account the topography of the network and the state of the node at time t. So it depends basically on the congestion on the different nodes at time t. So it's dynamically changing. Now the complete model that we consider is given here. So we define the vector capital Y. the vector capital Y capital Un which represents the member of congestion at each node of the network. So basically at each node of the network UG is equal basically to the sum of all T CP and UDP packets going through this node at a given time T. So here each UDP connection is represented again by these Poisson. Again, by this Poisson process. And HTCP connection is represented by the solution of the stochastic differential equation driven by the Poisson process. So this is our model under consideration. Let's see some few comments on the model. First, remember that the UDP connections do not depend on the state of the network and therefore are And therefore, they are independent. So, here again, if you take a look at the UDP or at the Poisson process that represents the UDP, so the UDP doesn't depend on the state of the nodes of the network, and therefore all the UDPs are independent. However, the TCP connection interacts through the congestion vector. So, here we can see from the model that both The model that both coefficient A and B depend on the node vector u n, so depend on the state of the network at each given time t. So therefore, the TCP connections are affected also by the UDP connections before because the UDP are going also throughout the node of the network. So this is interesting interaction in the sense that the UDP connection. The UDP connection does not depend on the TCP connections. However, the TCP connections do depend on the UDP connections through the nodes of the network. So the structure of the interaction also is changing given the dynamical routing table protocol. So here, remember that the coefficient A, P and A, U here IG, so A I G and I G U here are time. GU here are time changing. So they are stochastic processes. And therefore, the interactions is changing with time. So it is continuously changing. One of the questions of interest is to study the behavior of the system when the number of connections get very large. So when we say that the number of connections get large, we are referring. That of knowledge, we refer to the sum of all the TCP and the UDP connections. So basically, the idea is to investigate the mean field property or the mean field behavior of the system. So first, we will introduce a mean field scaling in order to study the behavior of the systems. So the mean field scaling, the goal basically is to get first surface. is to get first so first of all is to get no trivial scanning limit when the number of connections get large so goes basically in theory to infinity so this is done in order to investigate the qualitative property of the corresponding marker processes and also it will reduce the high dimensionality of the systems because here we have basically np plus n u RAS and U connections. So we have a high-dimensional system. Therefore, if we can prove the mean field property of mean field behavior, we reduce this dimensionality. So the idea, the classical idea in the mean field scaling is to introduce a factor one by n into node vector u n. And this, basically in practice, can be interpreted as Be interpreted as that we scale the capacity of the routers with size capital N, and again is the total number of connections going through the network. So the Mirfin scaling basically, again here what we do is that we replace the vector, the original vector u n by bar u n where we introduce this factor. So 1 divided by n. And therefore what we obtain, we obtain a new We obtain, we obtain a new form of the mode vector, which is basically given by the empirical means of these two quantities. So the rescued system of the TCP connection is given for each A between 1 and P by these new equations. So these new equations is, so the difference between this one and the first one is that we have replaced the original mode vector by The original mode vector by this new risk covered vector bar Un. So now, given the symmetry between the TCP connections in sense of exchangeability, because all the TCP connections are equal in the sense of exchangeability, so they follow the same equations. So we can expect a mean field phenomenon to hold. And therefore, we investigate the convergence of the very squared system. Convergence of the very scarred system toward a limiting process when the number of conditions get very large. So, the first assumption is that there exists two constants which gives the proportion of, or the limiting proportion of both TCP and UDP connections. And obviously, the sum of these two constants should be equal to one. So, basically, what it means is that both the number of means is that both the number of TCP and the number of UDP goes to infinity when their sum goes also to infinity. So here we have some hypothesis in order to prove the weak conversions of the risk carried system. So the hypothesis are basically done on the coefficient of the TCP equations. So we suppose that A and B are mipe shapes are And B are mipe sheets are bounded. We also suppose that the stochastic process lambda, which governs the rate of the UDP connections, is also bounded by a given constant. And finally, we suppose that there exists exponential moment for the initial condition of both the TCP and UDP connections. And using this hypothesis, we can prove the following proposition. So we suppose that we have in Suppose that we have initial or we have converging initial conditions in the sense that the initial conditions are exchangeable and P0 chaotic. So from this hypothesis, we can prove that the limiting process or that the risk carrier process converge weakly toward the typical process W T, which is solvation of these Of these new equations. So, the difference between these equations and the equation or the rescario equation is that we have replaced the risk carried vector by this u star, which is given basically by the expectation rather than the empirical mean. So, here we have the expectation of the product between the stochastic process AW and A. Aw and Av rather than the previous restored vector here, where we have here the empirical mean. So basically, this is typically now of large numbers. So we can prove that this proposition or this result holds. Finally, the last point is to investigate the equilibrium. is to investigate the equilibrium behavior, or in other words, the long time behavior of the system. So the idea is that we can investigate the stationarity property of the solution of the SDE of the Nimeting equations. And we hope that equilibrium properties of the Nimeting process are expected to provide a good approximation for the corresponding property for the classic for the Classic for the basic network with large finite nodes. So, first, you have to remember that the Markov process is the Markov process characterized by the limiting equation is not homogeneous Markov process. And therefore, we cannot use classical theory when we deal with homogeneous Markov processes. Well, here, in order to Here in order to be simple, we will ignore the UDP flows and investigate the Kergenberian behavior of the SAMP field model without UDP conditions. We will just focus on the TCP conditions. So, basically, we will consider, rather than considering the limiting process, we will consider this sample field limiting process, where basically we don't have UDP condition. We suppose that here we just have TCP flows, and therefore, here this new. Therefore, here this new mode vector, which is just basically equal to the expectation of the product between A and W. So the limiting process WT depends on the joint distribution on Wt and A T as we can see because it is basically equal to the expectations. So therefore, since that A and W are interconnected, so we can think that if they exist Think that if there exists stationary distributions, so therefore the stationary distribution will be a joint stationary distribution for both A and W. And functionality, so far we cannot prove the existence of this stationary distribution. However, if we suppose this stationary distribution exists, and therefore if we take P as this stationary distribution and also we take P as the initial distributions, therefore initial distributions therefore this the quantity of the mode vector will not depend anymore on the time t and therefore we you we will obtain a new equation where u basically is replaced by a constant a given constant and therefore this equation for this equation we can prove that there exists under some condition can prove that there exists a unique stationary distribution Exists a unique stationary distribution pi. But of course, remember that these results hold just if we suppose the existence of stationary distribution for the game meeting process, which so far we cannot prove. As conclusion, we can say that we propose a Markovian model for TCP and UDP connection in the communication network with dynamical routing. Network with dynamic routing table. And we have investigated the property of this model. When the number of connections is potentially huge, a mean field result with an adequate scaling is proved in order to reduce the motionality. So far, we don't have existence and uniqueness resolved for the stationary distribution. And if we suppose that the joint stationary distribution That the joint stationary distribution for W and A exists, then the resulting generic process has a unique stationary distribution. Of course, the big question is to try to prove an interchange of the mark time and the large size limit, but this seems to be a hard problem to solve. So I will finish by give you some related literature, some papers, and finally, thank you for your listening. Thank you for listening. And if you have a question, don't hesitate.
