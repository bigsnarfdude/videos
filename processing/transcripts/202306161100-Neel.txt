Thank you for the invite, especially Jennifer, for being my mentor for the last five years. So today I'm going to talk about Kaki Music Complex of alternating 11 crossing knots. So Kaki Music Complex is a surface complex on knots and links. So we will And links. So we will describe a little bit about the definition of Kakimuso complex and some early developments and some topological properties. And then we would go to like Kakimusu complex is known for some class of links. So we will use those to compute the Kakimusu complex of alternating 11 crossing knots. So that's going to be That's going to be the goal of this talk. Okay, so let's dive in. In this talk, we will be considering prime non-split oriented links, L. We know that we obtain a minimal genus Cipher surface on an oriented link L by applying Seifert's algorithm to an alternated alternating diagram, alternating oriented diagram D of L. So this L. So this at least shows that there exist Seifert surfaces on every oriented link L. So just an example of a Seifert's algorithm on a figure eight naught. So we take every crossing on an oriented diagram. We resolve each of these crossings according to the orientation and attach a one twisted band to each of the ciphered circles that we obtain after every crossing has been resolved. Crossing has been resolved. So we get a cipher surface whose boundary is the given knot. So we define Kakimusu complex. So what are the vertices? So let L be a non-split link. Two ciphered surfaces, we say, are isotopic in S3. If there is an ambient isotopy of S3, taking S1 to S2, keeping our link L fixed. So we denote the isotopy class. Denote the isotopic classes of each of these ciphered surfaces on our link L to be MSL. So, MSL denotes the set of all isotopic classes of minimal genus ciphered surfaces on our link complement. Yeah, this is important. Ciphered surfaces on an oriented link L are connected and has no closed component. So, the Kakimizu complex is defined as follows. So, the zero-scale. Defined as follows. So the zeroskeleton of the complex is MSL, namely the isotopic classes of cipher surfaces on the link complement. The one skeleton consists of edges between two vertices, V and W, for which there exist disjoint representative surfaces in their respective isotopy classes. So if we can make, if we have two surfaces in link complement, which are disjoint. In link complement, which are disjoint and non-isotopic, then we consider an edge between those two isotopic classes. And this is a flag complex. And the n simplicity of the complex is spanned by the n plus one vertices in the cactimisu complex, which admit disjoint representatives simultaneously in the link complement. So, diving into some early developments. To some early developments. So, Bird and Zhishang in 1967 and Witten in 1974 independently proved that minimal genus spanning surface for a fibered knot is unique in the above sense, meaning there is only one vertex in the Kakamisu complex. Eisner in 1977 showed that the composite knot, K1 composite with K2, has infinitely many non-equivalent minimal genome. Any non-equivalent minimal genus spanning surface. So this is the main reason why we consider non-fibered, non-split, and prime links in this context. And in 73, Witten proved that the minimal genociphered surface for double of non-trivial non-cable knots is actually unique. And in 1990, Kakimizu proved that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic. Infinitely many non-isotopic incompressible siphons surfaces for whitehead doubles of non-fibered knots. So here we take this like holopholotaurus and we and each of these surfaces follow this holopholotaurus. Each of them gives us like different incompressible cipher surfaces, but all are non-isotopic to each other. Okay, so some topology. Um, some topological properties that are known for this kakimusu complex. So, Kakimizu's work and independent results by Charlman and Abigail Thompson have shown that Kakimizu complex is actually connected. And Kakimizu conjectured that the Kakimizu complex is contractible. This was first shown by Sakuma in the case of special arborescent links when Sakuma generalized the result of Hatcher-Thurston. Of Hatcher Thurston for two bridge knots to special arborescent links. And in this case, Sakuma showed that Kakamizu's conjecture is indeed true. Kakamizu complex is contractible in the case of special arborescent links. Next, Hirasawa and Sakuma also confirmed the result for prime special alternating links. So they showed that the Kakimizukama. The Kakymizu complex is actually homeomorphic to a ball. And this result was finally proved by Protitsky and Professor Schiltens in 2010 that Kakimizu complex for a non-prime non-split link is indeed contractible. More recently, Johnson, Tarayo, and Wilson showed that the Kakimizu complex is actually quasi-Euclidean as well. So, why alternating knots? And one of the main themes of alternating knots is going to be Murasugi sums. So, Joel Haas, Abigail Thompson, and Anastasia Sietkova recently in 2019 showed that the alternating links have at most polynomially many ciphered surfaces of a fixed genus. Well, this result was known that alternating links have at most like finitely many. Like finitely many ciphered surfaces. This result was known, but they improved the result to give a polynomially bounded, a polynomial bound. So at least we know that MSL for an alternating link L is finite. So there's hope to find Kakamizu complex for non-split prime alternating links. So one of the main highlights of the paper by Kakimizu, where he described the Kakimuzuzuzuzuzu Described the Kaki Mizu complex for all knots of less than 10 crossings is Murasugi sums and especially plumbing. So let me see what is a Murisugi sum. So a Murisugi sum is of a surface is said to be a Murisugi sum of two surfaces, S1 and S2 in S3. If there exists a split of three balls, V1 and V2, such as Balls v1 and v2 says that the union is s3. Each of the surfaces contained in the respective balls and they intersect. So the two surfaces S1 and S2 intersect in the boundary of the two balls in a 2N gon D. So as in this picture, this is the ball where this surface, the red surface is contained in. There is another ball, the complement of this ball in S3. This blue surface is contained in that ball. And S1 and S2 intersect in this boundary of this ball in a 2N gone. So, this green disk is called the Murasugi disk. Now, worthy to mention here that if we take the complement of this disk, complement in the surface S2, we again obtain a disk. So, instead of this disk, we delete this disk and consider the disk in the outside part. So, S1. So, S1 union, this outside disk union S2, this is again will give us a ciphered surface. And this new surface that we would obtain is called the dual to the given surface. So, we will use this dual thing later. So, I would like to mention that now. Okay, so why there is hope for alternating knots? So, Cromwell in 1989 showed that In 1989, showed that every homogeneous link is a star product of special alternating links. So, every homogeneous link, so alternating links are actually part of homogeneous links. And this translates to, if you have an oriented alternating link diagram D of L, and we apply Seifert's algorithm on it, we obtain a Seifert surface on L, which is actually the Murasugi sum of spanning surfaces on special alternating links. On special alternating links. So each of these S1, S2 up till SKs are actually spanning surfaces on special alternating links. Murasogi summed along two and gones di in S. So this is a quick example. So this is the NOT 1129. So we apply sci-fi surfaces on this oriented diagram and And so there should be one twisted bands on every corner, wherever there is a crossing. And they split into these three knots. So here is a disc where we plumb half-link, this L4A11, the spanning surface on this, and a spanning surface on 5.2. So these are getting plumbed on, not plumbed, but Murrsugi summed. Plumbed, but Murusugi summed on respective disks. And that constitutes the ciphered surface 1129 out here. So some important theorems to know to describe, like, to describe the cipher surfaces on our link. So Gabai proved that if S is a Murasugi sum of S1 and S2, then S is of minimal genus if and only if both S1 and S2 are minimal. S1 and S2 are minimal genus side for surfaces on their respective links. The same result holds if S is incompressible. And for fibered surfaces on links, so L is fibered with the fiber S if and only if both L1 and L2 are fibered links with fibers S1 and S2 respectively. So if we have a fibered link L, then both of their respective constituents for the Murusugi sum has to be fibered. Sum has to be fiber. So, Balio and Gabai also proved that if L is a non-split link, S, a spanning surface for L, and suppose that S is the Murasogi sum of two components, S1 and S2, both non-fibered, then S and its dual, the surface S and its dual surface, are actually non-equivalent, meaning they're not isotopic to each other. So, Kakimizu realized that if S Then the Murasugi sum S1 and S2 is actually a unique spanning surface on its boundary L. So here in the previous example, L4A11. L4A11 with this given orientation is actually a fibered link. Half-link is actually a fibered link. And 52 from the paper by Kakimizu, we know that this actually bounds a unique spanning surface. So using this Kakimizu's result, we can say that 1129 actually has a unique spanning surface. So this is the main theme for 11 crossing alternating links. Most 11 crossing alternating links have. Most 11-crossing alternating links have a fibered surface S1. Murasagi summed to a unique spanning surface S2 on a link L2. So to have this result, we need some more fibered surfaces on some fibered links. So let's look at what can arise for 11 crossing knots. So among unknotted annules with n full twists, half band, so for n equals Half band. So for n equals one, it's the only fibered unknotted annuli. And for n not equal to one, all unknotted annuli with n full twists, so they are unique minimal genus spanning surface on their boundary link. And Gabay and Kanunubu proved this for pretzel links: that if k equals a pretzel link p with n1, n2, nk being the integers, so be a pretzel link. So be a pretzel link, pretzel knot for with all ni's being equal to one or all n i's being equal to minus one. And assume that k spans a siphon surface with two disks and bands BI with NI twists, in this case, one twist or minus one twists all around, attached to these two disks. Then this is actually a minimal genus ciphered surface and it is fiber with this surface being the fiber. With this surface being the fiber. So, this is exactly what we use to prove that 1129 is the surface which, after applying Seifert's algorithm, we got it's actually a Murasogi sum of S1, S2, and S3. But turns out that S2 and S3 both are actually fibered, and 52 has a unique spanning surface. So, by the result of Kakamizu, we know that MSF 1129 has actually a unique spanning surface. Is has actually a unique spanning surface. Okay, so coming to two classes of links, which has whose Kakimizu complex is known. One of them is special alternating links and the other is two bridge links. So we'll describe the algorithm, how to get to the Kakimizu complex for each of them. So a special alternating link is an oriented link which admits a Is an oriented link which admits a special alternating diagram, D. And a special alternating diagram means that when we apply Ciphered's algorithm on it, each of these ciphered circles is innermost in S2. So meaning that the Ciphered circles do not overlap. Perfect. So Joshua Green, a corollary of Joshua Howey's paper, Hirasawa Sakuma and Jessica Banks have independently proved that every site Independently proved that every Seifert surface on a special alternating link L is obtained by applying Seifert's algorithm on some diagram D of L. So if we can find the diagram D of a special alternating link and apply Seifert surface on it, we will get all Seifert surfaces on the special alternating link. So date sleiping conjecture approved by Thistlewaite and Monasco in 1991 says that given any two reduced alternates. Says that given any two reduced alternating diagrams, D1 and D2, of an oriented prime alternating link, D1 may be transformed to D2 by means of a sequence of flips. So the most important thing turns out to be to transform one diagram to another, applying Seifert's algorithm on each of them to find out the Seifert surfaces and to know if they intersect or what is the structure of the Kakemizu complex. Of the Kakemizu complex using the essential flips. And Jessica Banks, using essential flips and applying Seifert's algorithm on each of these diagrams, gives us the Kakimizu complex for special alternating links. So I'll just quickly give you the algorithm for it. So if you have a special alternating link, first obtain the Seiferts graph. Obtain the Seifert graph for it. With the Seifert graph, let's take all the bygone regions and consider them to be one edge. So for example, in this case, it got one edge with weight two. And we can add edges to it such that they don't create new bygone regions. So this is the diagram we get after we could add these two dotted lines. Two dotted lines, which are not exactly edges on cipher graph, but we could add them such that they don't add bygone regions to our new found graph, right? And after this, we consider the theta graph. So the theta graph is the graph containing all the vertices with more than two edges emanating out of it. So, for example, the green and the blue ones are the only ones with. The blue ones are the only ones which gives us the theta graph. None others have more than two edges emanating out of it. So this is the theta graph. And each of these edges could be given actually an orientation using this diagram. So we have an orientation to our knot, and using that orientation, we can give an orientation. We can give an orientation to each of the edges of our cipher graph. So, for example, in this picture, we see that each of these edges get an orientation, right? So, using these orientations, we can apply regions. So, applying a region mounts to fliping our diagram to get a new diagram and applying Seifert's algorithm on this new diagram. So, we apply each of these research. Apply each of these regions according to the signs. So, for example, a plus sign would mean that we have to add this edge, which is zero right now, which it'll be added to give a one. And this one would reduce to become zero when we apply R1. So, we apply this diagram on each of these surfaces. And what we obtain is the Kakimizu complex of 11,237. So, this is the 11-237. So, this is the 11237 knot, and we obtain this triangle, which tells us that this is the maximal simplex for each of these siphon surfaces. So each of these siphon surfaces are contained in this maximal simplex. So, if we apply this to every diagram, we will obtain the Kakamisu complex. Okay, moving on to two ridge knots. On to two bridge knots. So, since I'm a little short in time, I will directly explain the algorithm here. So, each two-bridge knot could be given, each two-bridge knot is actually classified by a fraction, and each of these fraction could be given a continued fraction decomposition with every number in that continued fraction being an even integer. So, we do that for the So we do that for this knot 11192, which is actually a two-bridge knot. And we apply a continued fraction decomposition for this knot. So we get minus 4, minus 4, minus 4, minus 2. So those are exactly the decomposition we have. And Hadgett-Turston, generalized to special arborescent links by Sakuma, has proved that every of these surfaces has to be plumbings. Surfaces have to be plumbings on each of these unknotted annules of these NI full twists. So in this case, what we get is, since there is a half band at the end, we can ignore that part. So the Kakemizu complex of 11192 turns out that we either have zero means the actual surface and one means the dual to this surface. The dual to this surface. Let's call it that. And so then we will get there is an edge from 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, and 1, 0. We get an edge from 0, 0 to 1, 1, but there is no edge from 0, 1 to 1, 0, which indicates that these two surfaces can never be made disjoined in the link complement of this link. So we could apply all these to all 11 crossing links. So 11 is not a big number to apply these. So we could apply all of these except for these two knots, 11.104 and 11.201. 11104 is the only special case where we start off with our surface T1 and we take We take its complementary sutured manifold, and we see in the complementary sutured manifold, after doing some disk decompositions or product decomposition, we get only one other surface, T2, in the complement of this surface. And we again proved that if we take the complementary sutured manifold of T2, T1 is the only candidate in the complementary sutured manifold. So this shows. So this shows that for 11.104, we get only T1 and T2 to be the only two surfaces in the link complement. So similarly for 11201, we apply Kakimizu's theorem twice to get a similar Kakimuso complex. So for 11 crossing knots, so these are the ones with non-trivial Kakymuso complex. Non-trivial Kakimisu complex. So we got two of them, three of them, four of them, five, and six of them. For 11,237, there is this triangle filled in, which is a special alternating link. And for 11,192, which is a two-bridge link, we have four surfaces with these two triangles filled in. So these are all the Kakimizu complex of 11 crust. Kakamizu complex of 11 crossing alternating mass. So the question is that given an algorithm, so give an algorithm to find the Kakimizu complex of all oriented non-split prime alternating link. So that is the goal. But since we know that a Seifert surface obtained from by applying Seifert's algorithm to an oriented alternating link diagram gives us actually Murasogi sums of spanning surfaces on special alternating links. On special alternating links, and we actually know the Kakimizu complex for special alternating links. So, Gabai, Boilo, Kakimizu, and others have developed the theory of sutured manifolds for plumbing. So, plumbing means like foregone Murasugi-sum surfaces. The hope is to find the Kakimizu complex of a special class of alternating links, which are Murasugi sums of plumbed spanning surfaces of special alternating links. So, generally, it may not be plumbed. Generally, for any alternating links, not be plumbed. Generally, for any alternating link, it may be Murasugi sums of different to and gone Murasugi disks. But the hope is to find the Kakemizu complex of the special class of alternating links, which are just Murasugi sums of plumbed spanning surfaces. Thank you for your attention. Are there any other questions? Is there any questions? Nital, have you started thinking about 12 crossing knots at all? Yeah, I did a little bit. I did a little bit, and till now, like most of them turns out to be okay. But I went till like hundreds of 100, 105, something like that. And it turns out okay till now. But I suspect that there will be links which will be like the plumbing of two special alternating links. So 7-4. That's what I suspect. And that's where the known theorems will not apply. So probably we have to apply. Not apply. So probably we have to apply Gabai's and Kakimizu's theorem to probably see the complementary switch and manifold. And case by case, probably we should be able to figure that out. But it's both in terms of when you think of, let's see, constructing ciphered surfaces via plumbing. Maybe that doesn't give you all possible ciphered surfaces, right? That's one problem. And then the other problem. Right, that's the problem, and then the other problem is also to know whether or not they'll be disjoint or not, disjoint or not, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, both both issues are issues, yeah, okay, right. Okay, thank you. Okay, here's another question. Uh, so has this algorithm been implemented on the computer? Like, do you have a source code or something? I don't. I did it all by hand, actually. Actually, so I have a computer program. Okay, well, thank you. It would be nice if you have a code or something. Yeah, that'll actually test with other examples. Yeah. Nice. Nice talk. I have a question. So, what would be needed to do this on a computer? Like, you drew pictures and all these lovely diagrams. How would you even, yeah, what would you need? Yeah, what would you need if you had a dream team and a wish list? So I feel the first thing is to apply Seifert's algorithm on an oriented link diagram to first understand just the components. So because every alternating link diagram, when you apply Seifert's algorithm, it'll be a Murasugi sum of some special alternating links. So first finding them out, and we know the like. We know the Kakamizu complex for every special alternating links, right? Now, the question is: take a surface and find, like, in the complementary Sucher manifold, find all the surfaces which are disjoint from this. So, finding the biggest complex. So, that is the question. And so, there, I think the only thing which can help is sutured manifold theory. Theory by taking product decomposition. So, getting all this, like, you know, product disks and taking the decompositions of all of them, that's the only thing which I can. You need a sutured version of Regina. You need to have another lifetime. No. I have a question. I have a question. When you talk about this, like Murasugi-sam, the composition, do you allow the disks to have different, to be different polygons? For instance, for the two bridge nuts, we see all plumbings, but like, I mean, like, that's a good, that's actually the correct question. So, um, for two bridge. Question: So, um, for two-bridge knots, it's the property of the two-bridge knots that enables us to only have plumbings, but for alternating knots, it's actually general two-end Murasugi disks. So, when we apply a Seifert's algorithm on it, so we get, we might get Murasugi disks of any polygon, like it can be any two-end gone polygon, actually. So, we know the theory for plumbing. The theory for plumbing using sutured manifold theory developed by Gabai Kakumizu, but for a general version, we don't have a lot of theory developed yet.
