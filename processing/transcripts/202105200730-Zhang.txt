Okay. Okay. Welcome to the second session of today's workshop. And first speaker is Professor Weiping Zhang from Chen Institute, Nankai University. The title of his talk is Positive Scalar Curvature on Foliations. Please start, Weiping. Thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers. To thank the organizers for the kind invitation. So, I also want to make an apology because when I receive invitation, I think that I was trying to do something involving the conformal deformation. So, I thought I may try to finish something. But turns out that it is still a long way to go. So, then my talk. So, dynamite talk will not involve this explicit conformal deformation. But anyway, I will try to say something about the positive scale curvature on for the agents. So to start with, start with, let me recall the basic concept of the scalar curvature. So let N be a be a So let n be a be a let n be a sorry let n be a close smooth manifold and take a Riemannian metric for any for any for any point P we take a We take a point, take a radio, take a ball of radius r, of any positive number r, and then you take the volume, and then you divide it by the volume of the of the ball in the Euclidean space of the same of the same radius. Radius. Then when R tend to zero, R to tend to zero, there will be a symptomatic expansion as in the right hand side. And then this coefficient K is called the scalar curvature, is called the scalar curvature at this point. At this point, this is the basic geometric definition. And the basic question is that when there exists, given Given a manifold, when there exists a remaining match with positive scalar curvature, this question is meaningful because for every manifold of dimension larger or equal to three, there always exists a metric with a negative curvature, negative scalar curvature. And indeed, this question on the existence of metrics with positive scalar curvature is highly connected. And there are indeed And there are indeed topological obstructions to such existence. A classical theorem, besides the two-dimensional case, a classical theorem due to Lichno around 1963 says that if we have a compact spin manifold, which carries a Riemannian metric of positive. Which carries a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature, then the Hertzbrook A-hat genus will equal to zero, where the A-hat genus is equal to this A-hat class pairing with this manifold. And if you use the Chengwei theory to represent, then this RTM is the curvature, is the curvature, then you can express the integration over the manifold of this differential form. uh is a differential form differential form and here the spin condition is uh is essential for example on this on the two dimensional complex projective space space there are always existing metric for the scalar curvature but the a hygienus is a is non-zero is a non-zero this is because this one is a is a not spin and for a complex manifold such as cp2 a manifold A manifold is spin even only if the first class is even. So, and so this becomes this is a theorem due to this noise in the in the more than I think more than 60 around 60 years ago. And the proof and the proof is. And the proof is relies on the spin structure. Take the advantage that on a spin manifold, there always exists a Dirac operate. Of course, on spin remaining manifold, on this spin manifold, one can define a Dirac operate acting on this boundary of spinners, such that the square, the D square, is the Buchanan. Is the Buchanan Laplace plus this scalar curvature? And this is the Discharus formula. And this Oknah Laplace is always negative. So when the scalar curvature is positive, then the D would be positive. And then the index in general is equal to, is defined by dimension. is defined by dimension kernels d plus minus dimension kernels d minus the kernel would all equal to zero all equal to zero but by the a t single index theorem this index is equal to this etagenus this gets the vanishing of the etagenus so the so the theorem is that so so the the the case is that that here here here the interesting of this Yeah, the interesting of this theorem is that the condition is geometric and the consequence, the result, state result is a topological, but the proof used to use this analysis. So in this talk, I will try to present a generalization of this classical theorem to the case of volations. So before going on, before Before going on, let me simply mention two other classical results for manifold for the existence of the metric of positive scalar curvature. The first one is that is due to a theorem of due to Stoge's theorem. It says that if M is thing. is a spin close close and dimension m larger than equal to five and assume it's a simply connected connected and if for simplicity we assume this manifold is of dimension for key because the digital vanishing theorem applies in this dimension with k with k bigger than one then Then there exists a GTM with such that the scalar curvature Tm larger than zero if and only if and only if A hat m equal to zero. So for simply for higher dimension simply connected spin manifold, this topological condition indeed gives a complete topological condition on this geometrical problem. Condition on this geometrical problem the existence of positive scalar curvature. So, this is a Stowe-Stimer theorem for simply connected manifold. And for non-simplic manifold, the simpler case is Tn is the torus. And then we have a theorem of Shung-Yao, which was first proved by Shung-Yao for n less than equal to seven, and also generalized by Gromov-Vlausson. generalized by Gromov Lawson to arbitrary to arbitrary manifold is that that there exists no G
