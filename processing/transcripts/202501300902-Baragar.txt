And I apologize to some who have seen perhaps parts of this talk in the past. So I'm going to be talking about orbits of rational points on K3 surfaces, but not really too much about it. I want to sort of motivate it. And the story begins with the Markov equation. So let me begin. Actually, let me end. So this. So, this is the question that I'm interested in, and I'll explain an awful lot of these things as we go along in the lecture. But the question is, if you have a K3 surface, the K3 surface has a group of automorphisms. And the group of automorphisms gives us what the ample cone looks like. And if you think of what, so suppose you have a K3 surface with the card number four, so it's in four dimensions. It lies inside the light cone. It lies inside the light cone. So a cross-sectional light cone is a sphere, which is what I have over there. And each face of the ample cone will cut this sphere in a circle. So that's what's being drawn here. So this is basically an ample cone for some K3 surface. And what you see there is that there's only some points on the boundary, but that those points on the boundary form a fractal. Boundary form a fractal, and that fractal has some sort of dimension. So that's what these quantities are here. So we have a group of automorphisms. We can pull it back, and that gives us a description of how things act in hyperbolic geometry. We can take the limit set and ask for what the Hausdorff dimension is of that. And then the other part of it is: I want to count, I want to take a point on the surface and I want to count the number of. On the surface, and I want to count the number of points in an orbit whose height is bounded. And the question is: if the point is generic, is this quantity always the positive dimension of the fractal? Okay, so like I said, this starts with the Markov equation. You know what the Markov equation is. It has three involutions, the Guieta involutions. Generate some sort of group, and with that group, we can get the whole tree of solutions. So it's something like this, if you think of it as an orbit. And there's the same natural question, given an orbit of a point, count the number of points with bounded height. And this was done by Zagier, as was mentioned by Alex. And this is the result he came up with, and I understand. He came up with, and I understand there's been improvements on the error term. And this particular argument has, roughly speaking, two components to it: one is this map from the Markov tree to what we call the Euclid tree, and the other is sort of getting the estimates to look good so that this map is actually meaningful. So, initially, the map is just a note-by-note. The map is just a note-by-node comparison. You have a tree, another tree, let's just match up the nodes, but it ends up being approximately logarithmic. The nodes on this side, we call it Euclid tree because it's roughly speaking, the Euclidean algorithm is going down the tree. And so the points that appear in it, the first two components, are co-prime pairs. And the third one is just the sum of the other two. And what's important about this tree, or one of the features of this tree, This tree, or one of the features of this tree, is that the branching operations are all linear. And then part of the argument in here is possible because of classical number theory and because we're looking at things in Euclidean geometry. These are, like I said, cocrime pairs. You can think of them geometrically lying in some sort of region in the plane with some sort of density. And so counting things in some sort of region is So, counting things in some sort of region is not too hard. And that's what I was saying. Okay. So, related to the Markov equation is the Cayley cubic. And the Cayley cubic, one of the interesting features of it, is that it includes a curve. If you plug in 1Tt, this is 1 plus 2t squared. Notice that you have 2t squared plus 1. So with that curve, you can generate a tree of curves. Tree of the curves. It has a nice parameterization by this trig identity. You can think of those angles as either being real or imaginary, in which case you're really thinking of hyperbolic cosines. And because of that parametrization, you may notice that the polynomials that appear here are exactly Chebyshev polynomials. And this time, the node-by-node comparison is exactly the degrees of the polynomials that are involved. So the map is exact, and there's no estimations required. So part of what I want to get out of this is that curves are easier to look at than points. Okay, my story began with this equation, the Erwitz equation, which is, again, as Alex mentioned, dates all the way back to my thesis. Back to my thesis. Again, 1111 is a solution, and so from that we get a tree of solutions, and the dissent argument works. And so, this is a set of all positive order solutions to this equation. Again, you have a map going to something else, some other tree, which is generated by linear maps. But this time, the geometric interpretation is not as nice. It's not uniformly a region in two-space. Region in two-space. It's going to be in three space first of all, but it ends up being the fractal. I wish I'd seen this picture a long time ago, but I persuaded Roger to draw this for me only five years ago when I realized, hey, you know, the stupid thing to do is to just plot the points. And that's all this is, plotting the points, where they look like. And you can very clearly see the fractal nature of them. And so counting, there's results of myself and then also Gamber and his co-authors in here responsible for the exponent and down to the exponent. And then they had this amazing result where they could actually show that it was a constant multiple of this without really knowing what beta is. You also have Kaylee-like variations where you can look at curves. Where you can look at curves on this hypersurface, but well, it makes, I suppose, I don't think it makes accounting any easier in this particular case. My next foray was into a particular type of K3 surface. These are what are called 2,22 forms and P1 cross P1 cross P1. The idea is what's nice about the Markov equation. Well, there's plenty of things that are nice about the Markov equation. There's plenty of things that are nice about the Markov equation, but one of them is that you have these Vietnam volutions. There's quadratic in each of the variables. And you can try doing this in P4, but then you have problems at infinity with the maps not being smooth. So a way of resolving this is to look at it in P1 cross P1 cross P1. And these end up being K3 surfaces. So, like I said, there's the Vietnam Volutions. There's the V-t involutions, and so you have this group of automorphisms. It's going to be a subgroup of the full group of automorphisms on the K3 surface. And if the K3 surface is generic of this type, then in fact, these Vietnam volutions form basically everything. They form a group that is a finite index interval. For this particular case, I was able to look at the same sort of problem. And again, there was sort of that map, and then there's Of that map. And then there's also the estimations. And the estimations were harder, which is why this is only, I don't have some sort of equality here. I'm sorry. Yes. I didn't get the definition or two. What's the two-tier? Oh, so each of these. So this is quadratic in each variable. I wrote it explicitly quadratic in the third variable, and so each of these things, F1, F1. F1, F2, and F0 are again two tube forms. So quadratic index and quadric. Yes, I'm sorry. And so you can permit the three variables and you still get something above four. Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So again, there's this one map, and again, it goes to some sort of tree of solutions. And again, we have linear maps to describe what's going on here. This time, these points have a nice geometric interpretation, but in hyperbolic geometry. So this is the Poincar√© disk. There are the points in the tree. And so counting the number of points in a disk is the classical problem, the Gauss lattice point problem. And for For regions with finite area but unbounded fundamental domain, these I think are first to the pattern. In terms of what's going on here, you have this surface, you have three copies of p1 you can project onto each one of these variables. So take the x-coordinate, for example. So pi1 is selecting out the x-coordinate. When you project it down, you have a point. When you project it down, you have a point, you can pull that back, you have some sort of 2-2 form in Y and Z, which ends up being an elliptic curve. And if you, so over every point you have an elliptic curve, so you have an elliptic vibration of the surface, and you have elliptic vibration in all three directions. If you think of the divisor classes, the equivalence classes of these elliptic curves, they're self-intercepted. Their self-intersection is zero, so they correspond to points on the boundary. So D1, D2, D3 on the boundary. And the three involutions, well, for example, sigma one fixes Y and Z and switches the X. So, well, it's not necessarily like this, but you find out that it's a reflection. Yes? You said this before, but can you remind us what things are on the boundary of this is the point. This is the point correct plane. Yeah, but why does the point crave? What does the silver intersection mean? Oh, you're right. Yeah, okay, so intersection is if you have two rational, if you have two curves on a surface, you can count the number of points of intersection. And the number of points of intersection, so this is kind of like a, but the point is, um, the K3 surface, like you get an uh an indefinite sorry. What's the connection with the K3 surface? I'm not sure. Okay, definitely. Not sure what the question is yet. Yeah, okay. Well, maybe I'll say a little bit about intersection of curves. And the intersection of curves depends only on divisor classes. You can think of this as a generalization of degree. And in fact, in the generic case with D1, D2, and D3, all I'm doing is counting the degree, basically the degree in X. Basically, the degree in x, y, or z for the particular curve. This gives us an intersection pairing. The intersection pairing has signature 1, in this case, 1, 2, which is where the hyperbolic geometry is coming from. So this is the, is that what you're looking for? Yes. Okay. Okay. So the generic K3 surface of this particular type doesn't have any rational parasites. Any rational pairs. So, in some sense, I'm thinking this is an analog of the Markov equation. Instead of going up to four dimensions where things get a little hairy, it turns out it's nicer to stay with these sorts of examples, but now consider nodal K3 surfaces. So K3 surfaces of this type that have rational curves on them. And you can do this. One way of doing it is, you know, we have these. We have these three coefficients that are two two forms. Suppose one of these two two forms factors into two linear terms. Just force it to do that. Okay? Then the pullback of the one point, 0, 0, 1, would be an intersection of two rational, or a union of two rational curves, smooth rational curves. And everywhere else, the fibers alone. And everywhere else, the fibrous elliptic curve. So, in terms of divisors, that third divisor is just the sum of those two. And if it's otherwise generic, then the Picard group looks like this. And this is an intersection pairing. It's now in four dimensions. So the hyperbolic geometry is going to be in three dimensions. But in this case, the Vietnam evolutions aren't enough. The index in the full group of automorphisms is infinite, we're missing something. And again, that goes back to the results of Pioteski, Shapiro, and Shapuravich that sort of tell us how to find what the full group is. So looking for this new automorphism, let's take again an arbitrary point, say, project down into P1. So we're going to fix our x and look at the curve above x as a lifted curve. This is true of the generic case as well, but what's new is that we now have a rational curve, L1, that intersects at exactly once. So it's now an elliptic curve with a section. And so we can choose that point of intersection to be our canonical choice for a zero on the elliptic curve. And then for a particular point, so for a particular point, project it down onto P1, pull it back, it's on the elliptic. Onto P1, pull it back, it's on the elliptic curve. Somewhere there's a zero. Now let's take P and send T to minus T using the elliptic curve group. And this generates an automorphism of the K3 surface. And these four maps now form a group that has a finite index in the full group of automorphisms. And again, they behave like Like more like the Hurwitz equation, where we don't have it, where you have some sort of fractal going on. This time the fractal is going to be in hyperbolic geometry, again, like that very first picture. So I'm going to think of this picture here. Things are a little bit off. Anyway, this picture, I want you to think of this as the boundary of an upper half-space model of hyperbolic geometry. Based model of hyperbolic geometry. So our two L1 and L2, they give us circles, but they ended up being tangent. And because those circles are tangent, this gives me a nice point to choose as my point at infinity. So I've chosen that to be the point at infinity. So I'm getting two parallel lines. That point at infinity ends up being D3. The divisor class is so the third variable. Class associated to the third variable. And then the four automorphisms. So we have sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, and sigma 4. So the first theta involution ends up being rotation by pi about, so I guess I called this E2 before, sorry about that. I'm calling it E2. So it's a rotation about that, the line through E2 and, or D2 and D3. So in this picture, So, in this picture, it is exactly rotation by pi. Same thing with sigma 2, and then sigma 3 ends up being reflection in a plane that's represented by this circle. Sigma 4 ends up being, again, reflection in a plane represented by that circle. So if you take one of these curves and ask, well, what happens to it after applying these maps, this is what we get. So again, So, again, a bunch of circles, and again, you know, there's a fractal left over, and I'm interested in dimension of that fractal. In this particular picture, there are some interesting things. For example, the curvature of each circle in this picture represents the degree in the variable z. So L1 and L2 have degree 0 in the variable Z, and then first generation. And then first generation are going to be these ones, and then the degree goes up, which means the curvature goes down. But again, there's some sort of Osdork dimension. That this thing goes off to infinity means that the degree in Z is not an ample divisor. That kind of makes sense. But if you choose an ample divisor, then we can talk about the number of points with bounded height. And counting the number of curves on the surface ends up Number of curves on the surface ends up corresponding to calculating that fractal dimension. But then the question is: what happens with a rational point? Okay, so in what cases have I done this? Well, you saw that in the generic case where I was able to get the exponent one and there were no nodal curves, so the fractal is in fact the entire circle. So there's Circle. So there's dimension one. No practical involved. And I've done it really only in one other case. And to come up with this case, I had to look at some sort of complicated surface that has much easier stuff to deal with. So in particular, the part number was only three. But this was a pretty exhausting calculation to come up with. The set of points, if I had a rational point on that surface, Point on that surface, either the orbit was finite or it was infinite, in which case the growth rate corresponded to the fractal associated. And that's a picture of the fractal look like, so you have dust here on the boundary that has some sort of posdorth dimension, positive posdorth dimension. In terms of tools, sort of the basic tool is some Um sort of the basic tool is somehow you want to encompass information in terms of a vector rather than just um a height. And so developed a height function. Basically you choose a basis of the card group and choose heights on each of those basis elements and then put them together in some way in a natural way. Then it has this nice property that if you have an automorphism, apply it to the, well, I guess I can use the pointer here, right? If you have an automorphism, If you have an automorphism, play it to the point, you can pull the automorphism outside at a cost of the maritime. And then if you have your favorite ample divisor, you can recover it by intersecting it with the vector height at a cost of an error term. In some cases, useful cases, this error term, so this error term typically has, I mean it lies in. Has, I mean, it lies in dimension, the card number. So, in the example that was in four dimensions, it would be a four-dimensional vector. But in some cases, I can make it be flat, so know that there's no air term in a particular direction. So, an error term that's only in three dimensions. But there are some basic questions that I don't even know about this vector height, like does it always lie in ample column? Does it eventually? It does eventually lie in the ample column. It does it generically lie in the ample column. I can't even ask questions like that. And that seems to be the first place or one of the biggest places I've been having difficulty. Anyway, that's my story. Thank you. And if none of you made it out to Johnson Canyon, this is what it looked like yesterday, and that's what it looked like. It looked like yesterday, and that's what it looked like I don't know, 10 years ago during the summit. Yes? Yeah, it's maybe a weird question, but so you're taking these K3 surfaces and you're translating to these fractals, what we're calling these like circle packings, and you're finding the housewife dimension that has something to do with the growth, right? Can you go the other way? Like, can you tap Can you go the other way? Like, can you have some sort of fractal, like, say, I don't know, apple and final or something like that, like go backwards and fine? Yeah, so there's this result of Morrison that it says pretty much exactly that. I mean, there's details to check. It only works to like dimensions 10. But I did check it with the Apalonian circle packing. The Apalonian Circle packing comes from a K3 surface, a class of K3 surfaces. I don't know what they are, but I don't know what they are, but at one point I was interested in that question. I might come back to it. Morrison's. I think it was Morrison's that had this result. Roughly speaking, if you have a lattice and sort of natural properties on this lattice, with the Apalonian Circle Pack, you can create that lattice, has all the right properties. Almost all the ones we look at. So in your the bounds for the dimension that are between that last case at 0.65 something something and 0.65 something something. Are those explicitly written down, like what those are, those numbers on both sides? Or how are those obtained? So they're obtained by. So they're obtained by looking at, well, you take the heights and now remember, I'm working in hyperbolic geometry at this point because I'm not having to worry about the error term. So I'm not dealing with the rational point to come up with the dimension. Just like with the Hurwitz equation, we weren't looking at the solutions to the Hurwitz equation, we were looking at that Euclid-like tree and looking at those points there. And looking at those points there. But then you do the height, you raise it to a power, you get some sort of function in terms of the exponent, and this function either converges or diverges, and the boundary of divergence or convergence is what you're looking for. And so you play this game where you can find that certain functions have to be larger than one or less than one and find points worth. points where that that changes and that's roughly speaking how you find those panels. These are rigorous panels. They're not experimental. I have a comment? Yes. The thesis of Lam Wang is probably worth mentioning here because she studied a problem of Maser about the topological density of the rational points in the Zariski density. Points in the zerosity density that they lie in finitely many components, a conjecture that many of us don't believe. And you might have thought that this is a place where you could find a counterexample if you look at the rational points of these cases, especially ones with these evolutions, that she shows exactly how to use that to prove that Mesa's conjecture is true in this case. You remember that? I do not. I'll have a look at it. This is a case, a thesis. This is a case. Her thesis. And she uses the group you use to prove topological density. And then, of course, in the fibers, you have elliptic curves. So there she uses basis of boundaries of torsion. I'm just saying that something that's very related to your, and she answered the. You all and she answered it in this setting. So this conjecture is truthful for these gate resets. The rational points, the topological density in the real points, they are dense in one of the finitely many connected components in the real points. Could you explain again what what's this definition of the vector height and what it what would it mean if were it uh Would it be in the angle of the curl? Okay, so you take a basis of so you take a basis of the card group. For each of those divisors, you can talk about the Bay Height with respect to that divisor. So you're choosing a point? No, I'm choosing a basis of the Picard group. Yeah, but what is H D I of? Oh, so yeah, so this is defining the vector height. Yeah, so this is defining the vector height of a point. Finding the vector. So H D I is not the way to define? So you're picking your DI's, and so yes, you're fixing all those H D I's. There's only a finite number, right? And then somehow you want it to be expressed inside the Picard group, roughly speaking. So you find a dual basis for the vectors that you. For the vectors that you've chosen. And that's the way you piece them together. So each individual one is not going to capture enough information. You need more information than that. So this way, we're capturing information with respect to several different bay heights. And the number that we have to capture is, you know, dimension of the card group. What would it mean that it's like in the flying curve? Okay, so um Okay, so you can ask what is the, if you have a vector height, you can ask the question, what is it when you intersect it with the cell? Some sort of number. And the question is, is that positive or is that negative? And if it's positive, it's inside the light cone, and if it's negative outside. And the problem with these O1, O, these error terms, These error terms is that they're Euclidean. And so you can be close to the boundary, and you know, this air term can take you across it. Let's talk into the end.
