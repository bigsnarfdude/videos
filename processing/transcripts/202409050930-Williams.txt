So, I'll talk about some joint work with Tom Gannon, who's a postdoc at UCLA. And the talk will be a mix of an older topic and a newer topic. So, the older topic is the base affine space of a simple algebraic group and its algebra of differential operators. And then the new one, newer one, is the theory of Coulomb branches of supersymmetric quantum field theories. So, I'll start by reviewing some background about the older topic. Reviewing some background about the older topic, then some newer background, and then I'll state some results that connect the two. Okay. All right. So first let me fix just some Lie theoretic notation here. So G is going to be a simple complex algebraic group. B is a Borel subgroup. U is its unipotent radical. And then H will be its carton. And at some point later, we'll just specialize to SLN, in which case these are just upper triangles. In which case, these are just upper triangular, strictly upper triangular, and diagonal subgroups. And then the base affine space of G is just the space of cosets of multiplication by U. So this is a fundamental object in Lie theory for a few different reasons. First off, just what kind of space is it? It's the quasi-affine variety. So it's an open sub-variety of spec of its ring of regular functions, which is just the ring of u invariant. Is just the ring of u invariant regular functions on g. So, with that in mind, I'll write g mod u bar for this affine variety that's submitted in. It inherits some symmetries from g, so the multiplication action of g times g on g descends to give us an action of g times h on g mod u, and in particular, an action on the coordinate ring. And when we take the coordinate ring and we decompose it as a g representation, the result. G representation, the result is that it's the direct sum of all the irreducible G representations. So this is the most kind of elementary reason why this is a fundamental object. The sum of all the irreducible G representations is a completely canonical thing. And so this variety is encoding some canonical ring structure on that canonical representation. And then on the other side, we can consider this H action. If I further quotient by that, I just get the flag variety G mod B and this real. mod b and this realizes the base apine space as a torus bundle over the flag variety. So another kind of role played by this space is it's a kind of quasi-openization of the flag variety. So what does this look like just in the simplest case where we have G is SL2? Well, the Europs of SL2 are just the symmetric powers of C2. And of course, the direct sum of those is obviously a ring. It's the symmetric algebra on C2. So spec of that is. So, spec of that is C2. And then sitting in there, I have the open sub-variety given by the complement of the origin, and that is SL2 mod U in this example. So, of course, regular functions on C2 minus the origin is the same as regular functions on C2. And then the complement of the origin, of course, has a C star action. We quotient by that, we get P1, which is the flag variety for SL2 mod B. So there's the most basic case. Most basic case. The one thing that is kind of misleading about this example is that this is the only case where this affine closure of the base affine space is smooth. So the coset space is always smooth, but only in the case of SL2 will this affine closure be smooth as well. So for example, in SL3, what does this affine closure look like? Well, it's a spec of a symmetric algebra in 6gN right here, or really on. Six generators or really on the direct sum of the fundamental and anti-fundamental reps modulo a relation coming from the invariant pairing between those. And by inspection, one can see that the vanishing locus of this equation is going to have a singularity at the origin. And that illustrates the kind of general pattern. So there's the base affine space and its coordinate ring. And that, of course, sits inside the algebra of differential operators on G mod U. Sorry. G mod u. Sorry, d sub h bar for that. This was studied and highlighted in particular in the classical work of Bernstein, Gelfand, and Gelfand in the 70s, which introduced what we now call BGG resolutions. And this ring has various interesting structures of its own. So a particular one I'll highlight is another discovery of Gelfand with Grahov. This ring of differential operators has a hidden symmetry by the Has a hidden symmetry by the Weil group of G. What do I mean by a hidden symmetry here? I mean it doesn't come from a symmetry of the base affine space itself. It only exists, it's kind of something it only exists at the quantum level. So for example, going back to the SL2 case, here's the ring of differential operators on C2, which generated by X, Y, and their derivatives. Their derivatives. And just a note is that I'll work throughout with a parameter h-bar that controls the commutation relations between these. And then the action of S2, the Weyl group of SL2, is just the action of Fourier transform on differential operators. So we switch coordinate functions and their derivatives. And in general, that indicates how one defines the generators of this action. So for general G, the action of the simple reflections. The action of the simple reflections is given by partial Fourier transforms in a subset of the variables. But what is not at all obvious from this description is that these generators obey the relations of the Weyl group. And trying to understand these relations better has been a kind of ongoing issue of interest in the subject. So for example, in 2018, there was a paper of Ginsburg and Kazdan devoted entirely to this issue. Devoted entirely to this issue. So, to say, let's take a look at SL3 for a second, which already is a quite interesting example where we have the following description due to Bohming Jia. So, first note, so sometimes I'll talk about differential operators, but when I specialize h bar to zero, I take the semi-classical limit, this just specializes to the ring of regular functions on the cotangent bundle of g mod u. And for SL. And for SL3, this spec of that ring turns out to be the closure of the minimal nilpotent orbit in SO8. And that orbit closure inherits an S3 symmetry from the triality symmetry of D4, and that turns out to be, to correspond to the Galfon-Gray action under this isomorphism. All right, so that's a particular, one of several interesting structures on this ring. Interesting structures on this ring. All right, so putting that aside for a moment, let's move on to Coulomb branches. I guess I should pause for questions. I don't know if I can hear questions that people ask. All right. So on to Coulomb branches. So these are moduli spaces. So these are moduli spaces which are associated to certain supersymmetric QFTs. So we'll focus on the case of a 3D n equals 4 QFT, which I'll usually write as T. And these are spaces of vacuo parameters, which are needed to define the expectation values of certain observables in these theories. So for this talk, the exact meanings of the physics terminology won't really be relevant. The key point is that these spaces have a Is that these spaces have attracted a lot of interest in mathematics because many objects that mathematicians are independently interested in can be recognized as Coulomb branches, and this recognition has led to a lot of profound insights and connections. And indeed, the main result of this talk will be yet another variation on this theme. So, what kind of thing will this Coulomb branch be for us? It will just be an affine variety with a natural quantization. Really, there's a hyperkalar structure on the space as well, but that won't play a role for us. And more specifically, so I'll write this as mc of t will be the coulomb branch, c sub h bar will be its quantized coordinate ring. And then more specifically for us, we'll be interested in the case of a gauge theory, a 3dn equals 4 gauge theory, or more specifically, a gauge theory of cotangent type. And this is a kind of theory. And this is a kind of theory associated to a choice of a compact or reductive group and then a finite-dimensional complex representation of that, which I'll denote by n. So associated with this, we have a gauge theory TGN. And in this case, we have a mathematical definition of the Coulomb branch, Duodeva Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. And they realized this quantized coordinate ring as the equivariant Berl-Moore homology of a certain infinite dimensional space, which I'll write. Infinite dimensional space, which I'll write as Rgn. So the equivariance here is going to be with respect to this group G sub O of G valued power series semi-direct the C star that acts by rescaling this variable T. The equivalence for that C star will correspond to the quantum parameter H bar. And this space Rgn will live equivariantly over the affine Brismannian of G. So that's the quotient of a group of quotient of a group of G sub k of a g valued formal Laurent series by G sub O. What does this projection look like? Well, the fibers can be described as follows. So first of all, since G acts on N, the group G sub K acts on N sub K, the space of N value Laurent series. And if I pick an element of G sub K, which would project to some point in the Alpha-Crismani. Would project to some point in the Alpha-Grismannian, that element is going to take space n sub O in N sub K and move it around somewhere else. And the fiber of this projection from Rgn to Gerd G is this intersection. So Rgn, it's a G sub O space over Gerd G. The fibers are vector spaces, but it's not quite a vector bundle because there's jumping in the fibers. So it's a kind of Steinberg-like object. And this Bralmore homology. And this Bralmore homology group inherits a convolution product, just as one has in the Steinberg situation. All right, so there's the BFN construction. And more specifically, still, we'll be focused on the case of a quiver gauge theory. So if I have Q is a quiver with a labeling of its With a labeling of its vertices by natural numbers, then I can associate the following choice of g and n. So I'll have n to be the direct sum over the edges of my quiver of the space of d of v by d of w matrices, where d is our labeling function and v and w are the edges, the vertices of that edge. And then for g sub q, I'll just take the product of the general over. Product of the general overall vertices of the general linear groups of the size of size given by our label. For our purposes, I'll be interested in the situation where I further quotient out this product of GLs by just the overall diagonal C star. So more generally, one might omit some of the GL factors, calling those frame vertices, and then one wouldn't be able to consider the C star quotient. But for us, C star quotient, but for us, this will be the variant that I want to discuss. All right, so those are whatever gauge theories and their Coulomb branches. So now here's the main theorem that I want to state, or the first theorem. So let's consider the quiver gauge theory associated to the following quiver. So I have a linear segment where the labels segment where the labels increase from one to n minus one and then at the end i have n leaves where the labels are equal to one then claim there's an algebra isomorphism between the quantized coulomb of this perfect theory and the algebra of differential operators on the base affine space of sln and moreover so this quiver has an obvious sn symmetry given by just permuting the leaves Given by just permuting the leaves on the right-hand side, and that symmetry is inherited by basically anything that we construct functorially from this quaver. So, in particular, this quanti-Scoulomb branch has an action of the symmetric group. And the claim is that under this isomorphism, that corresponds to the Gelfan-Grayev symmetry of the left-hand side. So, there's theorem one, and in the semi-classical limit, as a correlate, Limit, as a corollary, obtained the following conjecture, which was a conjecture of Dancer, Hanani, and Kerouan that led to our work, which is that there's an algebraic symplectic isomorphism between the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of SLN mod U and the underlying classical Coulomb branch of this quiver gauge theory. So they were inspired by completely different context from what. By completely different context from what I've been discussing, which is the theory of hyperkalar implosions. So, let me say a little bit about that. So, in their terminology, this affine closure of T star SLN mod U is what they would refer to as the universal hypercalar implosion. All right, so to say a bit about implosions now. Implosions now. So let me switch for a moment to compact Lie group notation. So I'm going to let K be a compact Lie group now. I'll let T be its maximal torus. And this, so the starting point is the construction of Gillam and Jeffrey and Shamar of the notion of a symplectic implosion. So suppose that I have a Hamiltonian K-manifold M. They associate to this another object called H Associated to this another object called its imploded cross-section or symplectic implosion. So, this is a stratified Hamiltonian T-space. So it's a singular space, but it's stratified by Hamiltonian T manifolds. And its characteristic property is that the reductions of the implosion by T, of course, are the same as the reductions of our original space by M. So this is saying that there's a kind of trade-off. So, this is saying that there's a kind of trade-off. We can either work with reductions of a smooth space by a non-abelian Lie group, or we can trade that for working with reductions of a singular space by an abelian Lie group. So it's an abelianization construction for Hamiltonian spaces. Moreover, if I consider the implosion, so the most basic Hamiltonian k-space is just the cotangent bundle of k, and the implosion. K. And the implosion of that is exactly this affine closure of the base affine space of the complexification of K. So, in particular, that singular variety is stratified symplectic. And moreover, this is a universal implosion. So, T star K has actions, just as we said before, there's the action on the right by K that we implode down to U, down to T, and there's the residual action on the right. And there's the residual action on the left by K as well. And then the statement is that the implosion of any m can be identified with the reduction by K of M cross the implosion of T star K. All right, so T star K, that's the universal symplectic implosion. And more recently, Dancer Kierwin and Swan, they started pursuing the hyperkaler analog. Doing the hyperkalar analog of this theory. So, in particular, they showed that now if I take the if I take the affine closure of the cotangent bundle now of the base affine space, and here the base affine space of SLN specifically. So, this theory is less fully developed in general, but there's a well-worked out theory in the case of SLN at least, and they proved to have. Ln at least, and they proved that this is indeed stratified hyperkalar Hamiltonian t-space. And they suggested this should play an analogous role in the theory of hyperkalar implosions that the cotangent closure of the base affine space itself did in the theory of symplectic implosions. So, these are the considerations that led them to reflect on this space, and then in subsequent work, And then in subsequent work, Dancer, Hanani, and Kerwan used their analysis to propose this description now of this affine closure of T-star SLN mod U as a certain Coulomb branch. And they showed that this was consistent with various numerical checks and also was consistent with known computations for small values of n. And in passing, a feature of this description. A feature of this description that's of interest is that it comes with a description of the symplectic dual of this space as well. So I haven't said anything about symplectic duality yet. This is a general kind of phenomenon associated to algebraic symplectic spaces of a certain kind, of a certain conical kind. So such spaces should come in dual pairs. And in the case of the Coulomb branch of a gauge theory, the simple The symplectic dual has a simple description as the Higgs branch of that theory, which can be described in elementary terms, more elementary terms than the Coulomb branch, in terms of the defining data of the group and the representation. So this conjecture comes with a conjecture for the symplectic dual of this space as well. So this was our starting point. We had read their construction and viewed it through the lens of geometric representation theory. A nice Representation theory. A nice feature of that is that when one looks at the quantum version of the story, it turns out to connect to this rather classical topic in representation theory. And moreover, we found one has the tools to turn this into a theorem. Before I say a little bit more about that, though, another thing that we get is a more, we were able to formulate and prove a generalization of this conjecture. So let me state the more general result. More general result. All right, so let me now fix a tuple, an ordered tuple n1 through nk, whose sum is equal to n. So I can identify such a tuple with the data of a function psi from e1 through en minus 1. So the Chevrolet generators of the Leonardo row u, a function from that set to just 0 and 1. 0 and 1. So, for example, if I take psi to be constantly 0, that corresponds to the tuple where I have all ones. And if I take psi to be constantly one, that corresponds to just the singleton tuple where I just have n itself. And any such psi extends to uniquely to a Lie algebra character, so to an element of little u dual in particular. So we have the action. We have the action of u on sln that induces a Hamiltonian action of u on the cotangent bundle of SLN. And let me write mu for the moment map. So mu is a function, regular function from t star sln to little u dual. And if I choose any value of the moment map, in particular one of our characters psi here, I have associated to that the Hamiltonian reduction of t star SLN. Hamiltonian reduction of t star SLN by U at that moment map value. That's the pre-image of psi under u, the categorical quotient of that by u. So in the particular case where psi is just the zero, so if psi is zero, so the corresponding couple is all ones, then this is just the affine closure of T star of SLN. Of T star of SLN mod U. All right. And then the more general statement we have is the following. So now let's consider the variant of the preceding quiver where now I take as the leaves on the right-hand side. I have fewer leaves, but now they're populated by these numbers n1 through nk. Again, I consider the quiver gauge theory associated with this. Gauge theory associated with this. And then the claim is that there is an isomorphism of algebraic varieties between this Hamiltonian reduction, this unipotent reduction of T star SLN at this value of our moment map with the Coulomb branch of this theory, this 3dn equals 4 over cage theory. All right, so there's the more general version of this theorem. Maybe I'll come to it in a minute, but another, well, okay, let me. But another, well, okay, let me revisit this in a second. So let me now just say some things about how these theorems are proved. What are the ingredients that go into this? So the main ingredient is the regular perverse sheaf. So recall the geometric Satake equivalence. So this identifies perverse sheaves on the affine grist monitor. On the affine Grismondian of a group with the category of representations of its Langlands dual group. So, I can consider in particular the perverse sheaf or in-perverse sheaf that corresponds to the coordinate ring of the language dual group. So, here let me consider the we'll be interested in the coordinate ring of SLN. So, the corresponding perverse regular sheaf will live on the Grassmannient of PGLN. And this object, there's various interesting things to say about this object. It plays a role in the theorems I stated because it gives us a connection between the two sides. So on the one hand, Ginzburg and Riesz explained how this regular perverse sheaf encodes the ring of differential operators on the base affine space of the dual group. Of the dual group. So, in particular, in this type A case, so this ring of differential operators we're discussing on SLN mod U. So, this is the, let me write T check for the, I guess, the, yeah, the torus of PGLN. So this is the T check O by C star covering cohomology of the shriek restriction of the regular sheaf to the Grasmanian of the torus of PG. Grassmanni and of the torus of PGLN. So I can recover dh bar of SLN modu from this regular sheaf. And on the other hand, this regular sheaf also has a known role, known connection to the Ethereum Coulomb branches. So Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima proved that it is the push forward of the dualizing sheaf of one of these spaces R. So let me let consider this quiver here. I have This quiver here, we have the corresponding space R. We can take the dualizing sheaf of that space and I can push it forward. So, if I push it forward to a point, I obtain its Borel-Moore cohomology. If I just push it forward to R, then this is the regular perverse sheaf in this case. As a related note, so this quiver is an example of one of the quivers on the preceding page corresponding to the On the preceding page, corresponding to the Whitaker reduction of T star SLN. It's the reduction by a generic value of the moment MAP. And they had, so this corner, this Coulomb branch was specifically known in that case. And one can just, let's see, going back to this theorem, essentially in that case, this theorem is that the special case is a direct, sorry. A direct is an example of this computation in BFN. So, this statement here is just the kind of most natural way you might imagine interpolating between the theorem on the previous slide and this conjecture of Dancer and Ani-Kerwin, and then this special case of the Coulomb branch of this theory, which we already have a very explicit description of from this computation. All right. So I have the regular sheaf, and that gives us this connection between differential between the base affine space and its differential operators, and between the theory of Coulomb branches. And that's by manipulating that relationship. That's how we're able to obtain the theorem we want. And then, in the case of this Levy generalization, the key ingredient there is some recent work of Mark La Serrato, who Work of Mark Lasserato, who proved the analog of the Ginsburg-Ries result in the context of now restriction not to the Grismannian of the maximal torus, but to the Grismannian of a Levy subgroup. So these tuples are the part of the gauge group corresponding to this tuple is just a Levy subgroup of G L of N. And the general result he showed is the semi-classical version of this Ginsburg-Ries result. So if I take Ginsburg-Ries result. So if I take the coordinate ring of the cotangent of this reduction at the moment value psi, that is the levy of covariant cohomology of the restriction of the regular sheaf to the affine Resmannian of the relevant levy. All right. So that's what I had to say. So I kind of blew through my slides here, but thanks a lot for your attention. Thanks a lot for your attention. Oh, yeah. So in principle, one would expect that they should be, so I believe there is a, I'm not sure that this is written down, but I know that Ginsburg has, there is a difference analog, there is an algebra of difference operator analog of this algebra of. Analog of this algebra of differential operators. So the kind of Lie theory side of this theorem is known. One knows the object that you would expect to replace this in the K-theoretic setting. One has the K-theoretic Coulomb branch here. It seems perfectly reasonable to imagine that those continued, that one has an identification of those. The strategy of the proof here. The strategy of the proof here does not generalize in any obvious way that I could see to that case because one doesn't have the same role played by the regular sheaf in order to play the kinds of sheaf theoretic manipulations that would go into this. So the statement of what to expect in the k-theoretic setting, I guess I should have, sorry, I read the question in chat. I should have read it out loud. The question was basically was, what Was what about the k-theoretic situation? So instead of taking the Coulomb branch of the 3D and equals 4 quiver gauge theory, we can take the Coulomb branch of the 4D and equals 2 gauge theory in terms of the space R that corresponds to taking its algebraic K-theory rather than its Brown-Moore homology. So the point is there's an obvious expectation that K-theoretic Coulomb branch should be the analogous operator algebra of difference operators. Operated algebra of difference operators, which again is not kind of in the literature, but it's a known thing. But I have no idea how one would go about proving that kind of in general, since the tools of this proof just don't extend to the k-theoretic setting. Probably in small cases, one can work things out by hand and check that the conjecture passes there, but I don't have too much more to say.
