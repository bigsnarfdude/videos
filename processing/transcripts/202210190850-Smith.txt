So, today I'm going to talk about plant growth with morphodynamics. And I guess the first thing I want to mention is something that Gabriela spoke about: this relationship of all these softwares that we have. Basically, we have this software called Morph Graphics, which many people know for image processing, and in particular, image processing on surfaces. So, what we call 2.5D image processing. Then Brendan came along, did his PhD. Oh, sorry, did his PhD. His PhD, sorry, did his PhD in Shermik's lab, and he developed this framework for modeling using cell complexes, which then allows us to do 3D modeling of geometry. Because this VV is pretty much mostly for surfaces. And then on top of that, Gabriella, during her PhD, she developed a finite element framework to work with this cell complex framework we have. And we also have another software that we use for biomechanics experiments, which Biomechanics experiments, which I'm not going to talk about today. And so, since I was talking about modeling growth, I think the first place to start is always with the descriptive model, because if you can work with your problem with a descriptive model of growth, then that's probably the best way to go. Everything's much simpler. And this started with my PhD work in Shemek's lab, where we want to model a shoot apex. And with his very nice tools in VLAB, we're able to create sort of an outline of the shoot apex. Of the shoot apex, you know, interactively on the screen, and then make a mesh like this. And then by defining some growth function as a function of distance from the tip, we can displace the points down this shoot apex and put cells on it and make the cells grow. And so then here would be an example of this type of simulation done in morphodynamics, where you have this activator-inhibitor system that makes peaks of activator and inhibitor. That makes peaks of activator and inhibitor, actually, and spaces them nicely. And if you combine that with this growing shoot tip, you get this sort of nice phylotactic pattern emerging from this. And so maybe one of the first unsolved questions that I'd like to talk, maybe a bit geeky for most of the crowd, it comes to the modeling itself, is how you make a simulation like this and then separate all the different aspects. So there's three aspects here: you have this model of cell division, you have a model of growth. Division, you have a model of growth, and you have some genetic network model with cell cell communication sitting on top of this. And sort of one of the design goals behind morphodynamics is to separate these three into components so that we can reuse them for different simulations. But the question is still a bit unsolved. Now, we've made some headway there. For example, the simulation I just showed you before, we're able to do this, run exactly the same code for this Mineheart system. Exactly the same code for this mine heart system on all these different templates. You can run on a fixed grid effect cells. You can have this dividing cell apex here. We can take a mesh from morphographics that's segmented from a confocal image, simplify it into cells, and run the simulation on that. Or one of the three, this is a 3D Void Night cube, which also use the same simulation. So then, so the idea would be we want to recycle things like this Mindheart system as well as the This mind-heart system, as well as the as well as the growth and cell division. Okay, so with that in mind, here's some other examples of cell growth. Sorry, this flicker is maybe a bit too much. I have three videos on one page in Haliba office. But the first possibility is using, or one possibility is using Bezia interpolation. So this, we define keyframes of belief at different timeframes, and then we put the growth on top of that. Top of that. And then we can put cells and cell division. And then this is actually a pin-oxygen simulation. It's actually up the gradient in the margin and NIFT reflex to make veins here. This is a very old simulation. Here's the Henowitz model. So using the Hennewitz coordinate system for those who know who this is, where he defines a coordinate system local to the root to make this kind of shape. And there's another outstanding question I'm interested in: is how, if you have cell divisions at the very tip of this root, eventually they will. Of this root, eventually they will they only have to be a little bit off to get this very oblique cell shape, and the root somehow managed to control that. So, anybody interested in that, you know, give me a call. And then finally, this MOS apex, which comes from Brendan Lane, his project is working on the Fisco apex. So, the framework now we have is capable of doing growth and cell division in 3D. And this one uses the same growth model that he's adapted to 3D as we're using for the shoot apex. So, now switching from descriptive. Now, switching from descriptive growth. So, like I said, if you can do your model with descriptive growth, it's always going to be faster, easier, and so on, right? But most of what we're interested in involves things where the shape is an emergent property of the model. And I would say in general, if that's what you're after, where you want to explain how the shape happens, then you need some sort of physically based model. And so, one popular model for this, which is pioneered by Rico, involves using finite. You know, it involves using a finite element model. And basically, what you do is you take it, start with a template like this. You have some gradients that go here. Usually, there's two: one to define the polarity of the tissue and one to define the morphogen on the tissue. Here is our simplified version of this. I don't think we have the mid that Rico has in his model. And basically, the idea is you specify how much the base is going to grow, not so much. This is going to grow in width, a little more than height, and then there's going to be a gradient going from top to bottom. And then there's going to be a gradient going from top to bottom, and you can get this emergent form. Now, this is a continuum model where each triangle represents a bunch of cells, and each triangle is just told to grow, and then they don't all grow at the same rate. So then you get some conflicts, and then the finite element simulation will resolve these conflicts, right? But this is not very, that kind of model is not very applicable to how we think of how the cell wall grows. Like it's great to say how genes are going to control the shape, but it doesn't give us But it doesn't give us, you know, it doesn't relate directly to how the plant cell wall is growing. And as Daniel said yesterday, spoke a lot about this, you know, the basic idea, sort of, is that you have a predominant direction of cellulose orientation, and that the growth is going to be perpendicular to that. And this is sort of the simplest way to think about this, I guess, is this Lockhart equation where. This Lockhart equation, where he was looking at a line of cells growing in one direction, so very much these kinds of cells. And then basically, he has two factors in this equation. One is this wall extensibility factor, which is multiplied by the pressure that's over a threshold pressure. And I think in discussion yesterday, Niltas touched on this a bit, or Uriko actually as well, about how this extensibility factor, it's really a product of both of these that determine how much the cell is going to integrate. That determines how much the cell is going to increase. So, in other words, if I drop the pressure, it's going to be less stress on the cell wall, the cell is going to grow less. And also, if I drop the amount of extensibility factors, the cell will also grow less. So, then this has over the years, actually Gorielli, Alain Gorielli has some very nice papers on this, about how this models of growth have progressed over the years. And basically, it starts with Lockhart model where they have pressure. And then you can imagine turning these terms to be both. Turning this these terms to be more general. So instead of volume, it's going to be now the strain as a function of elasticity times this stress over a threshold stress. And then probably what we use the most now in our models is, I guess, closest one is called this Goodwin model, where the growth or the elongation of an element depends on the strain over a threshold strain by the amount of extensibility factors. And so, how you call this, I call it strain-based growth, and maybe the best way to call it. Strain-based growth, and maybe the best way to call it is elastic strain-based growth, because growth itself can be considered a strain. But that's how we think about it. And so then here's sort of simplest simulation of such a thing. This is a toy simulation of root hair growth. And so basically, what's happening here in this simulation is I have chosen. So, first of all, I have a shell of finite elements of uniform material properties, and it's isotropic. Material properties and it's isotropic in this case. And then I select the vertex at the very tip of this, and I say, okay, within some distance of this vertex, I'm going to let these elements grow. And how we let the elements grow is we look at the difference between the reference configuration and the global configuration. And we look at the strain there, and then we multiply that strain by some growth factors and relax the strain. So we make the elements bigger. This is how we grow them based on. So they will never get bigger than what they are. They will never get bigger than what they are stretched to. But the more they are stretched, the more it grows. And as well, the higher the growth rate, the more it grows, or the higher the growth factors, extensibility factor, the more they grow. And so then things to think about in this kind of model is that, first of all, it's trigger driven, right? And we have some sort of realistic mechanics going on there. The growth is strain-based and, in this case, isotropic. It's not uniform in the sense that. It's not uniform in the sense that I'm only growing the elements here at the tip and not these. There's element subdivision going on because obviously you cannot grow something like this and keep just the original triangles. That will last for very long, maybe a little bump, but that's about it. So you have to be able to manage element subdivision. And probably one of the sort of outstanding issues in these kind of simulations is how to do that and preserve the residual stresses. Because this whole thing is stripped. So if at every simulation step I was to relax all the residual stresses, Step: I was to relax all the residual stresses in order to grow, then it would also grow here, and I wouldn't be able to stop it. So, what we once these elements are stretched, we need to be able to allow these ones to stay with the original reference configuration and change the reference configuration only of this. I kind of like this kind of simulation because it's creating a very anisotropic structure from basically what is purely isotropic growth at the tip. And surprisingly, in this simulation, without any other factors involved, the tip grows relatively. Factors involved, the tip grows relatively, relatively straight, although I'm not sure why. And so then, you know, going a bit further than that to anisotropy, the question is how to model anisotropic growth. And sort of the easiest way or intuitive, most intuitive way we think about doing this is this case I've started with the sphere and this green patch, I've given same uniform material properties to everywhere. Of course, it has the same pressure everywhere. And then in this Same pressure everywhere, and then in this green patch, I've made it softer in this direction, and so then I apply growth the same to all elements, so even these elements have growth, but they're growing based on strain above a threshold. Now, because this is quite stiff and it's soft in this direction, the only thing that goes above the threshold is the stretch in this direction, and therefore I get growth in this direction. So you could very much imagine this a sphere starting with some cellulose microfibrils primarily oriented in this direction. primarily oriented in this direction and then um and then of course the growth is going to be perpendicular uh perpendicular to that right so the primary growth direction is going to be opposite uh the direction of stiffness or the stiff direction in the simulation and so then what this means is these this growth factors which are controlling the growth they don't have to care about orientations or polarities or anything like that they just grow the elements Or anything like that, they just grow the element they're operating on, and they operate it based on how much it is strained. Therefore, it's the material stiffness that chooses the direction of growth. Of course, then this implies sort of a very, how do you say, intimate relationship between elasticity and growth directions. So, whether it's true or not is another question, but that can be for discussion. So, then the last thing I want to talk about is this trilayer material model that Trilayer material model that Gabriela introduced earlier. And this is basically for modeling this cardamomy valves, which have this tension that gets built up by the shrinkage of cells. And here I'm kind of interested in the material model, in particular, how this model relates to growth, because in this model, we have sort of three layers. One is isotropic material, and this isotropic material grows. And then we have fibers going one direction, another. Fibers going one direction, another group of fibers going this direction. So then I stole this slide from Gabriella. Thank you, Gabriella. And so basically, the idea is we put three materials in the model in the same place. So if I imagine a triangle in the cell like this, I have three finite elements, if you will, operating on the same nodes. So they're just stacked on top of each other. And this is a feature that also Brendan added to the solver to allow us to. To the solver to allow us to put multiple JRIS processes together. And so then these things can share the nodes. Fiber one and fiber two, they don't grow. So they actually also share their reference configuration, whereas the isotropic one is going to grow. So its reference configuration has to be different from this. And this is also kind of key in finite element simulations: is that this reference configuration here can this reference Can this reference configuration here can be different for one element than these other elements, even if it's operating on the same node? So there's no global, it's stored very locally in market dynamics. And so then we get a simulation like this. And I think Angela was discussing this yesterday. So basically what happens is we pressurize it and then we allow growth to happen. And because it's sorry, keep tricking around here. And because it's And because it's um because it's stiff in this direction, because of these fibers which are going like this, and like this, and soft in this direction, it is only grows in this direction. It's fixed at the ends because we imagine the valve is not exploded. And then, oh, boy, sorry. I have trouble going backwards, backwards. Oh, I lost them. Sorry about that. My fault. My fault for not using the mouse. Okay, there we go. There we go. And so then it only grows in the one direction. And then at some point, the ends get released. And then the whole thing shrinks. And this model I find very interesting because the question comes is to the valve grows to its full length, and then the tension is developed. And then the tension is developed due to trigger pressure over time. But how can this happen? So basically, you have a system where the tension is developing via a stress relaxation process. So in other words, how do you make tension if the only thing you're allowed to do is grow, which in itself is a process of releasing tension? And so then the idea here is that by releasing tension in one direction, this way, you can create tension in the other direction. And so how much time I'm going to do. Richard, we are out of time, unfortunately. Okay, and then so here's my questions. So, how to connect cellular to continue models and what models of growth do we need? So, we can discuss that about that. So, maybe I'll take the moderator's prerogative and ask a question about Turger-driven growth. Question about trigger-driven growth. So, by trigger-driven, do you mean that trigger is actually stimulating growth or that trigger is a product of growth? I would say neither. I would say trigger is required for growth. In other words, trigger creates the strain. So you imagine, and actually I think Anya had some experiments with fawn tubes where they did this. They took a fawn tube that was growing, and then they put it in a high osmotic solution to reduce the pressure. Would reduce the pressure. And then they would see the cell wall material was being still delivered to the wall. And then when they let it go, it starts to grow again, and there's a little lump of material there. So the idea is: you know, you need the wall to be stretched, as well as you need cell wall remodeling enzymes to come along in order to have growth. So it's driven in the sense that Turger is a requirement, right? But I wouldn't say, you know, it controls growth too. If you have more turger, you know, it's likely to grow faster. But in the end, I wouldn't, I don't know of very many systems where turger. Many systems where Turger itself is being regulated in order to change growth, maybe cotton fibers or something like this, but a few specialized cases. Great, thanks. We have a Zoom question. Go ahead, unmute. Me? Yeah, Adrian, Ale, yeah. Hi, Richard. Thank you for the talk. I'm a bit puzzled by your tri-layer constitutive model. So you said that only one layer is growing. So, you said that only one layer is growing, which means that there will be accumulation of mechanical energy in the other layers. I'm not sure I understand what this means physically. Well, you can imagine that the fibers, suppose you have fibers embedded in an isotropic material, or actually, if you look at that McKibben actuator and imagine elastic expansion is like growth. You know, you blow up the balloon, and then the fibers, they stay where they just kind of, you know. They just kind of, you know, twist a bit, and then the whole thing expands. And so, here, instead of blowing it up, because you can't change the trigger because trigger doesn't change the system, so instead of blowing it up, what you do is you soften it instead, which causes, but but it is true that over time there would be more and more stress in the other layers because they do not grow. But I guess you would you would have the same effect if you would use a single anisotropic constitutive relation with a threshold. With a threshold? You could, but then the question comes as to how you would actually use that. Because if you want to have two families of fibers at not perpendicular directions, and then you want to combine that with an isotropic material, which requires stiffness and faucet ratio, here it's quite easy because the nice tropic material has two parameters, stiffness and faucet ratio. These guys, fibers, have a direction, which you can see. Yeah, but I mean, you have a lot of hyper-elastic models that include fibers. Fibers, uh, right. No, no, you do. That's that's very true, yeah. Okay, so I mean, theoretically, you could do that, right? You would have to sorry, I can't hear you. Yeah, so we have to interrupt, unfortunately. Okay, thank you, Richard. So I had a very it was very nice, enjoyed it. I had a question on your anisotropy solution, which uh involves modulating stiffness locally. Things different locally. So, how would you then square that with implementation in the same framework of genetic factors that clearly control polarity and growth direction? Like, how would that be implemented? And second and related, are you effectively using modulating stiffness as a proxy for regulated creep? And what would be the implications of that then? Implications of that, then, yeah. So, here, um, I guess you would say, uh, you know, you can control growth by this two, you know, there's this duality there, the amount of extensibility you have plus the amount of stretch you have. And the stretch, of course, is directly controlled by how stiff it is. So, then, you know, I'm always, I was thinking about this in terms of, you know, if you want to stop something from happening, all you need to do is mess up one piece, right? So, if you want to stop a plant cell from growing, Right, so if you want to stop a plant cell from growing, you could either drop its trigger, or you could make it way stiffer, or you could get rid of the extensibility factors. Either one will stop the growth, but you sort of need everything there together in the right proportions to make it grow. So a model like what we are using would suggest that most of the extensibility choice in terms of anatropy is determined by the stiffness component as opposed to the extensibility factors themselves. Because you would go, okay, how can they know what direction? Now, with Daniel's model, with the hotspot model, you can imagine. Daniel's model with the hotspot model, you can imagine that if it's primarily sliding and you have a preferential direction of fibers, and all you can do is slide, right, then maybe you can control the direction of growth through this, although oftentimes the growth is happening perpendicular to the primary direction of the fibrils. So does that answer your question? Yes, but and of the genetic factors then, how, I mean, is that too involved? How would you put the sort of Would you put the sort of bona fide the genetic control of polarity and growth in this where you actually get a change in or anisotropy via changing? Yeah, well, here, I guess the genetics. Sorry, Richard. We're going to have to leave that as a rhetorical question for further discussion. So, thanks again.
