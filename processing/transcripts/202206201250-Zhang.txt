Just to check, can you see my shared screen? Yes, yes, we see everything and we hear you very well. Okay, okay, thank you very much. So it's a great pleasure to be speaking at this conference and thank you to the organizers for inviting me. Uh, inviting me, and it's uh, it's a pity that I cannot join you in Oaxaca because of traveling schedule reasons. So also, I would like to apologize that this is not a talk about celestial mechanics, but maybe a billiard problem is the playful little brother of celestial mechanics. Celestial mechanics. So, while you guys play with planets and the spaceships, we play billiards. So, let me just tell you the problem itself. It's a very simple problem. So, it goes back to, I think the problem, the discovery was almost 10 years old. I think this was. years old i think this was probably first announced in 2014 uh that the chef uh discovered uh a remarkable uh billiard problem uh which is simply a billiard played between two symmetric walls so uh what happens to the billiard near these two parts doesn't really matter because it's uh all about About this two-piral or the orbit and the orbit around it. So, just to fix ideas, what we can do is we can just simply write this as x equal to f of y and its reflection x equal to minus f of y. And then Kesha discovered that there exists an even formal power series given by this. Given by this function, so that if you play the billiard in between these two walls, then you know that you have a fixed point for the square of the map exactly here. And then you can adjust your curvature so that this fixed point is an elliptic fixed point. And his theorem says that you can choose the parameters, the power series. The power series so that this map is formally conjugate to a rotation by any irrational number that you choose. So I'm actually going to explain using a slightly different setting from Chechev's how this example can be constructed. But before I do that, let me But before I do that, let me first tell you why this is interesting, why this example is remarkable. So this relates to an old conjecture of Birgoff, which was formally stated by Poliski, I think, that the conjecture is that all integrable billiards are ellipses. So the word integrability always had an ambiguity. Always had an ambiguity. So, people, different people have different definitions of interoperability. There are many advances made towards this conjecture. Let me just mention two. So, Avila, the Simoy collosion proved a perturbative result around ellipses of small eccentricity, which was then generalized by Carlos and Sorrentino. By Carlosian and Sorrentino to perturbation for all ellipses. So there's some kind of rigidity, integrable perturbations of ellipses are still integrable. And another result is a recent result of Biali and Miranov, who proves that if you look at essentially symmetric billiard, as long as it has a four caustic and it's in the goal. And it's in the goggle on the face space above the core calculus, then it actually has to be ellipse. So there's remarkable rigidity for billiard problems. However, if this Trashv example converges, then you have a billiard with not only integrable dynamics near a periodic point, it has a completely linearizable dynamic near that periodic point. Near that periodic point. So, this will mean that the definition of integrability has to be taken carefully in the Biographical Politsky conjecture if Trechett's example converges. So there are some numerics that points towards convergence, but numerics are not reliable, actually, in view of the theorem that I'm going to state. The theorem is a joint work with Cheng Wang, who is currently. Work with Cheng Wang, who is currently a postdoc at Toronto. He will also be speaking at this conference. The statement says that suppose you start with a diffracting frequency, then we can make an estimate of this type. That the growth of the coefficients grows like k log k with some coefficient beta. If you just apply the uh if you just applied the the sterling's approximation to factorial you realize that this means uh that the this formal power series uh is one plus beta jevere with one jev raid being analytic uh so so if beta is quote zero you have analytic uh map that means this sample converges uh what we can prove is that it's one plus beta jepuri and as a kind of a straightforward And as a kind of a straightforward standard argument, what you can basically say is that there exists some edge of very smooth billiard and age of very smooth conjugacy map so that the billiard is conjugate to rotation with an infinitely flat remainder. So this is the theorem I wanted to tell you about. The theorem I wanted to tell you about today. So we started out trying to prove that this is valid, a very ambitious goal. After we obtained this theorem, and hopefully I will explain by telling you about the proof of the theorem that we're much more ambiguous about whether this series converges, mostly due to a Mostly due to a very essential difficulty in the proof. But of course, if that essential difficulty can be overcome, then maybe actually Treasure Shaft example converges. So that's the main result. And my goal is to tell you a little bit about that. So let me start with showing you some nice pictures. So, what happens with this billiard plate between two walls is that the two-periodic point is elliptic if the radius of curvature at this point is larger than the distance to the origin. So that's why you were seeing that the bilia that looked kind of like a lemon. And in this particular case, the analytic extension, analytic curve does not. The reality curve does not actually extend to full billiard, but as I mentioned, I don't really care about the dynamics away from the two periodic points. So this kind of look like the taustic for elliptic billiards. And to just show you, to convince you a little bit more that this is integrable, that's a plot of face portrait near the periodic point. And you see that everything. And you see that everything nicely lined up. But of course, numerics can be deceiving because our theorem would in particular imply that you can do averaging theory to at least show that for this example, the system should be very, very close to integrable, even if it's not integrable. Let's say you truncate the power series, you have a system, and it will be very, very. have a system and they will be very very very close to integral due to average theory so uh so this is uh the example uh so uh let me uh uh move forward uh to explain a little bit uh to the details of at least the formulation of the state of the theorem uh so i would like to uh introduce to you a somewhat unconventional way of thinking about Unconventional way of thinking about billiard, kind of pioneered by this work of Bialy and Miranov. What I observed, I mean, as have been observed by many people before them, that it may be helpful to study a convex field using the so-called support function. The definition is simple. You take some direction. In this talk, I always identify the complex plane. identify the complex plane with R2. So e to the it stands for unit vector. And then what you do is you just fix an origin. The origin actually doesn't matter. So everything is well defined up to the translation of the origin. So you look at the distance from the origin to the tangent line that's orthogonal to this direction. To this direction. So that's the support function of the billiard. So this is a weird way of describing this convex set. At least let me convince you it's equivalent way. So the standard way of describing a billiard is to provide a parametrization of the boundary. And what I would like to do is to parametrize using this angle t. And in fact, after some computation, you realize that this vector is actually equal to is actually equal to Q of t times e to the it plus Q prime of T times I e I t. In other words, this is Q and this is Q prime. So very easily you reconstruct the parametrization of the boundary and therefore you reconstruct a boundary of the billion. So but we don't want to stop here. But we don't want to stop here. We want to push this idea of support function further to actually use it to define the reflection law of the billiard. So this is how you do it. So here, the green orbit is a billiard orbit. The standard parametrization, the standard way to describe a billiard will actually be keeping track of the reflection point and the reflection angle. That's the standard way. That's the center wave. What we would like to do is to keep track of the incoming ray and the reflective ray using the support function of the rays. So what we would do is that the analog of the angle is the rightward normal of the ray. So that's phi one, that's phi two, that's two angles. And then the analog of the support function will be the distance to those rays. To those rays from an arbitrarily fixed origin. For convenience, you want to fix the origin inside the billiard so that P is always positive. So this discovery of, actually I don't know exactly the history, but it was first mentioned in this paper of Vyali Mironov, is that you can actually write down a symplectic generating function for this period. For this period. Precisely, if you write a function S sub q, which is q of one half phi one plus phi two times sine of one half phi two minus phi one, you want to be slightly careful here with how you choose phi two and phi one when phi two and phi one are defined on the on the unit circle. What you want to basically choose is you want to choose phi two phi one so that this value is between zero and two pi. As long as you do that, you can. as long as you do that you get the well-defined function and some not so hard geometry planar geometry will show that this distance happened to be the first partial of minus minus this distance happened to the first partial of s and my p2 happened to be the second partial of s so you get a generating function of of the billiard and part of this uh of this breakthrough what on Uh, uh, of this breakthrough on Birkhoff conjecture by them is based on using this generating function instead of the standard one. And for us, this generating function has a huge advantage in terms of applying a KAM type theorem. So roughly speaking, what we like to do is to use this Q as a parameter and adjust this parameter to solve some homological equation. And it's a And it's a tremendous simplification if your parameter, if your functional depends linearly on your parameter, right? So the generating function depends on this function as Q in a linear fashion. So this is a tremendous simplification and it's why we chose to use this generating function. So let me now restate, kind of reformulate this treasure example using The Trchev example using this generating function. And I already filled in, so I would like to do some reduction, do a change of variable. I already filled in the kind of BRE-Miranov angles. These are given by the right facing normal of the bilial trajectory, the rays corresponding to the bilial trajectories. What I would like to do is to get a map. get a map where the parameter with the variable is close to zero. So it makes sense to think of instead of that angle phi, think of angle t, which is just phi rotated by 90 degrees. And then it makes sense for the t to go in this way. But if I do this, I have to consider the square of the billiard. The square of the belium map. So, I would like to now take advantage of the symmetry of the system and just simply say: whenever I cross this line, I'll identify this ray with the central symmetric reflection of that ray. So, I will identify this ray with this ray. Because my billiard is in fact horizontal and vertical symmetric is also centrally symmetric. So, in this case, I will call this angle E2DIT2. As it turned out, if you use this generating function, you get almost the same thing as in the BI Mirrov formulation, with the exception that because you rotate it by 90 degrees. That because you rotated by 90 degrees, the sine turned into cosine. So that's the only difference that this coordination change makes. So let me now recap. So if I play the mechanic, the billiard in between these two walls with the coordinate T1 and T2, and then I have the generating function given by this. As a result, we use this kind of a well-known Kind of a well-known idea of going to what I would like to call the Lagrangian coordinates in the sense that you only keep track of the billiard orbits in the configuration space. So a map, the mapped billion map map T1, T2 to T2, T3, if and only if this version of the Euler-Lagrange equation holds. So this is our standard. So now, how do I solve for How do I solve for the equation that defines a linearizable digit? To do that, I would like to define some kind of coordinate change from a space xy to the space t1, t2. And the way I would like to define it is to basically take a mapping from C to R, but actually from R2 to R, because this is not an analytic mapping. are because this is not an analytic mapping. It's a real analytic mapping, not the complex holomorphic mapping. So what I would like to do is just choose the first coordinate and then choose the second coordinate as the rotation of the first coordinate by the angle I'm looking for. So by choosing this specific conjugacy map, I can write down the conjugacy equation using just this equation. In particular, what this means. What this means is that if you go backwards one step, so that's t minus one. Let's say this is t zero. Let me actually just write this down. Let's say this is t zero, this is t minus one, and this is t zero, and this is t1. According to the way I define the coordinate change, all I need to do is for the coordinate change phi. Coordinate change phi to satisfy this equation at every point for which the equation is defined. So that reduces the problem of finding an integral billiard into solving a functional equation. And this equation is a functional equation of two unknown functions, q and phi. Let's call this the energy functional. And we just need e of q phi equal to zero. So So once you get this, let me now reformulate Freshoff's result in the setting. Let's assume that the coordinate change phi is given by a power series in Z and Z bar. Then all you need to do is plug in this power series into the equation. So let me just highlight it. So let me just highlight the equation first. Right. So what you want to do is you want to plug this into the equation. And also you want to assume your Q is a power series, even power series in T. So now you plug these two formal power series into an equation. You want to say that formally, the solution, the energy functional as a formal power series is equal to. As a form of Hauer series is equal to zero. It turned out that if you do some normalization and assuming some symmetry, so the first symmetry you want to assume is that the phi is an odd power series. So it only has odd terms. This is related to the fact that this Q only have even terms. So if you have an odd power series that is also symmetric, and then And then you normalize the first term to be to have coefficient one because it has to be symmetric, so the coefficients are the same. Then you normalize the first term of q to one, then this this formal equation has a unique solution. So this is kind of a recasting of Trichev's theorem. And let me just also make the remark that just The remark that just by comparing the linear term, you actually immediately get that your Q2, which is the curvature of the bouncing billiards, bouncing wall, depends, it's related to the curvature. The curvature is not Q2. Curvature is one plus Q2. No, one plus four times Q2. It's related to the rotation number. You can just compute it. So at least at linear term, you know what to do. term you know what to do so what i would like to do now is to uh tell you kind of a km uh scheme uh but applied in the in the in the in the space of formal power series uh to solve this equation so uh to do that uh let's uh just do the kind of uh the naive thing so we will try to solve some functional equation uh to apply a km skill To apply a KM scheme, what you would like to do is to write down the linearized equation. So you linearize your equation at q plus delta at q phi and at delta field delta phi, and you get this. So you would like to solve this particle to zero, then you can apply a Newton scheme. So the problem is, usually it's kind of a Usually, it's kind of hard to invert this operator. Here we're using a pretty well-known trick. Okay, let me actually show you the trick and then go back to this definitions. So a well-known trick, which is, as I understand, is known before the paper of Levi and Mosa. Of Levi and Mosa, but they have the most popular version of it. So it's always getting quoted. So the idea is that instead of inverting this operator, you rewrite it in this way by kind of multiplying an additional term by partial z. So this is the partial derivative of phi with respect to z. And And once you do this, you can actually rewrite your operator into two part. And this part is very nice because this is non-constant coefficient and both of these operators are constant coefficient because what you really do is take your phi and just plug in a lambda inverse times z and lambda times z bar into phi. And lambda times bar into phi to get this like the negative shift operator. And this is a kind of some kind of difference between your negative shift and your original map. So you get a linear constant coefficient operator. A price you have to pay is that you have to apply the operator twice with a second order operator. And another important aspect of this reduction is that this thing now becomes this thing now become order of energy squared so this is of the order energy and this will be chosen to be of the order energy if you can invert the operator so this is called the approximate right inverse in in the in the km theory uh community so it is well known that as long as you have approximate right inverse Approximate write inverse, you can apply the KM, the Newton scheme to solve equations. So this part, as you can see, is as long as you have a generating function is standard. So where does this part come in? So let's go to the next step. So what we know is that essentially, Essentially, we can ignore the second-order correction term, and you just try to solve the first-order equation, which is this plus this equal to zero, which is the equation I wrote on the next page. So we like to solve this linearized equation, approximate linearized equation. But what you want to do is to invert this operator. But this operator, if you look at what it is, you look at what it is uh it's uh apply replacing z with lambda inverse z and replacing z bar with lambda times z bar so uh if you just do the computation you realize that it's multiplying one minus lambda to the j minus k plus one uh onto your coefficient and again uh for those uh who are doing km theory this is entirely standard because all the operators in km Because all the operators in KM theory work like this. But this kernel, this operator has a kernel. When j minus k plus 1 equals zero, this just goes to zero. What this implies is unless the right-hand side is in the kernel, you cannot solve the equation. Again, this is standard in KM. So the idea is that let's choose the delta Q so that the right The Q so that the right-hand side falls into the kernel. Okay, so naively, you can kind of write down the form of power series in the right delta Q so that it falls into the kernel. But I would like to do something more sophisticated for a reason that I will be revealing in a moment. So how do I choose the delta Q so that the right hand side falls, sorry, not false in the kernel, the right hand side. Not forcing the kernel. The right-hand side has zero projection to the kernel. That's what I should be saying. So this can be inverted only if the right-hand side has zero projection to the kernel. So let's try to see what happens. So before I define this weird operator, delta plus and delta, nabla plus and nabla. Delta or Nabla plus and Nabla. Let me just remind you: the operator works like this. The kernel is this. I would also define a kind of a projection, I'll call the averaging operator, which just projects to the power that has zj and z bar to the power j. This is actually the averaging in the angular component, if you think of this in copolo. Component, if you think of this in copolo coordinates, and then you can see that the projection to the kernel is equal to zero. Sorry, if you differentiate something for which the average is constant, then you precisely fall into the kernel, right? So what this means is that Sorry, if you differentiate this average with respect to z, you fall into the kernel of this operator. And therefore, this function is equal to constant if and only if its derivative project to zero in the kernel space. So what this means is that instead of requiring requiring this kernel, this function to project to a zero function in the kernel, I can simply require the generating function applied to this coordinate change after averaging is a constant. This actually makes sense because if you think about it, if your billiard, If your billiard is integrable and you have some coordinate which make it integrable, then any transformation that permutes all the level set of the first integral still give you an integrable billiard. As a result, something, suppose you already linearize the billiard, then something that promoting kind of a shuffling along different level set of the distance to origin doesn't actually Doesn't actually preserve the class of linearizable billions. So that's why, which is why somehow this is a reasonable assumption to say that you project nicely to the kernel. You're kind of killing all the average component, killing all the resonant component for people familiar with game. So this is the right condition. So once you have this. So once you have this, I can try to describe what is a kind of KM scheme on the formal level. Sorry, there's one more thing. So I've said that it's the fastest to solve this equation, that this thing is equal to constant. So let me just convince you that this can be solved. Convince you that this can be solved. First of all, just because we choose Q2 to eliminate the linear part of the energy functional, as a result, we also simultaneously eliminate the constant and quadratic part of this average. Let me just make a remark that this is the even function because when you project, you always project to even power series. Project to even power series. So after you do just one step, you currently up to order four. And then recall that the generating function is this. And let me just plug in the formal power series. Here is where we're using the fact that the functional is linear in Q. So when you perturb the Q, you actually split into Q, you actually split into S sub Q and S sub delta Q. Now suppose the delta Q are given by these coefficients. And then all you are doing is keep the coefficient and plug in T1 plus T2 into this function. And T1, T2 is phi minus and phi. And then you have cosine. So all you have is all these coefficients multiply to some polynomial. And if you compute some polynomial, and if you compute some power series if you compute this power series you get a leading term which is uh of uh of the power 2k and the remainder term which is the power 2k plus one plus two and it's easy to compute that this is not zero then you can just recursively solve all the coefficients out of this and that everything gets solved so So, if you kind of write this thing, the equation as a matrix, as a linear equation, it's a lower diagonal matrix, which you solve using the standard Gaussian elimination method. So this means you can solve the equation SQ plus delta Q equal to constant by simply using this part to eliminate all the non-constant part of SQ. So this is kind of the So, this is kind of the adjusting for averaging part, which solved the equation. So, just to confirm, I think I started five minutes late, right? So, yes, you have you have okay. Yeah, I'm almost done because I'm just going to show you what the kind of the formal KEM iterating scheme is. So that's what I just said. So that's what I just said that you can always solve for the formal solution here. And let me go to the part where I described the KM scheme. So just to reiterate, we want to solve this equation. We know that we need to solve this equation first so that the right-hand side projects to zero in the kernel space. And we know this equation can be solved. know this equation can be solved. Once we solve that, we know the right-hand side is in the right space, then we invert the Snaplaw plus operator by simply dividing 1 minus lambda j plus k minus 1 into the other side. This is a really nice map because due to Diffanting condition, it actually is tame in the Km sense, right? So you can easily invert this operator. Okay. Okay, so now comes the funny part. We still need to solve the other direct equation. So psi is this part. So we still need to solve this part equal to psi. Then we need to divide the h to the right-hand side, and we need to solve this. We can only solve it if the right-hand side also projects trivially to the kernel of this operator. Trivially to the kernel of this operator. And now comes to the surprising fact. There's a miraculous cancellation, which is not miraculous after the fact, that, okay, it does not project zero, but it projects to zero up to a quadratically small term in the same sense that my original Mosa-Levy reduction also produced a quadratic. The reduction also produces a quadratically small error. So I can solve this equation approximately by subtracting the average because the average is quadratically small and is not important when it comes to the Newton scheme. So this entire procedure can now start running that you can essentially have a Newton scheme. A Newton scheme in the space of formal power series, the scheme would double the number of effective digits in your formal power series in the same way that Newton's scheme is quadratically converging. So we get our formal KM iteration. So let me just say that why don't I get the convergence in the analytic case? What happens is that this equation that I have to solve. Is that this equation that I have to solve and this part is unbounded in any kind of norm I can come up with? I mentioned that this is a lower triangular matrix. And usually you can control the norm if, for example, the off-diagonal terms have some control, even exponential. So basically, you want to say the Aij term of the matrix is bounded by some Is bounded by some exponential of i minus j. That's what you want to control. However, in this case, it grows like e to the i, not e to the i minus j. And this makes the whole thing unbounded. We don't know how to do how to control it. And we do the down way by truncating the power series. And the norm will grow as the truncation grows, but we can at least control it. But we can at least control it. And then what happens is that the K-M process does not converge in the analytic category. But what we can do is we can shrink the domain of analyticity by a constant factor each time so that it shrinks to zero exponentially fast. And by doing the estimate that way, we recover a Gevre estimate if we do everything carefully. And that's why we got a Gevre. So to end, let me just make both cases for maybe this converges or maybe this doesn't converge. In the positive case, this is the numerics. It does look like the log of coefficients grows kind of look like a linear function. And on the other hand, like I said, I don't know how to bound this operator. Bound this operator. So, of course, this may be an artifact of the proof, but maybe it's some evidence for divergence. So, that's the talk. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. It's time for questions. Oh, I have a quick question. Sure, okay. So, about So, about the Jaberic exponent, do you have any estimates? Yeah, so just some rough work. It's some constant, I forgot, maybe it's something like two over three. So we didn't try to optimize it. So let me just say this is still kind of work in progress. We're almost finished writing everything. Finished writing everything, but we didn't try to optimize the exponent because we're pretty sure we cannot get it to analytic or say to get it to arbitrary small. So it's some number. Let's say two-thirds is my current guess. I see. Thank you. Well, well, so well, so I was working with Professor Lagabinagina, similar Similar to steps. So, I would think that maybe we could cap later. So, this okay, final lecture for myself. Thank you. Yeah, Adrian had almost a very, we had a very similar scheme that one of the this is the paper that just appeared in all linearity, right? So, the scheme of doing the KIM but shrinking the domain exponentially fast, right? Right? And the factorizations, yes. So no, we should certainly talk about it. Yes. Do you also get a Jeffrey type of testimony? Yes. Yes. No, it's a very general fact that you see if you can do a KAM scheme, right? And even with exponential fast, but then you if you decrease the, I mean, you run the KAM scheme and then you get quadratic estimates, right? And then, but the domain. Then, but the domains are shrinking. So, this is not the shrinking exponentially. But then, if you do Cauchy estimates because of the super exponential convergence and the exponential decrease of domains, then you obtain Gebray automatically. That's the way that we were using it, right? Yeah, I'll be happy to talk about it. Yeah, yeah, I mean, we can something later. Thank you. Yeah, let's uh, yeah, this is something that I mean, maybe there should be some breakout rooms or something, right? If they organize to hear them afterwards, I'll talk to the people here in CMO to have more Zoom rooms to discuss, but I haven't done it yet. I will do it soon. Yeah, it's very good because, I mean, yeah, that could be very useful. That could be very useful because, yes, I mean, we are discovering that there are quite a number of relations, right? Yep. No, this is very tantalizing, yes. Is there any other question? Yeah, I have a naive question because as you look for the like a power series. Like a power series, no, and you get that the power series is a gray. I wonder if there is a way where you can look for the Boreal transform of this series and then see that this Boreal transform is converging and study the singularities. It would give you information also. You are the expert, I'll be very happy to actually maybe talk to you in Barcelona. So, so yeah, I know the only thing I know is that let's say if it's a Jebere with beta smaller than one, then you can divide another factorial, then it will be convergent. And then you get a meaningful function out of it. But what is the meaning of this function? I don't know. Yeah. I can talk about this. Yeah. I mean, if I can tell, I mean, we look at the same problem, but so you get a functional equation for the So you get a functional equation for the Borel transform, right? And the Borel transform satisfies an equation, satisfies a functional equation. But then, I mean, how do you the thing that we didn't know how to do is how to attack this functional equation anyway, right? Yeah. But I think, yes, I think your problem is more difficult because you have both to the parameter, but he has a But he has just the power series in the variable. Well, it's the same because you can always extend the system and the things become whatever. But the question that we had is you have a functional equation, but the functional equation is basically a conjugation through the Borel transform, et cetera, of multiplications, etc. I mean, and of course, there is all this theory that tells you that if you can deal with convolutions by other. By other methods, et cetera. But in this case, there are other operators that we didn't know how to deal with except by undoing the Borel transform. You see, you get a functional equation. This is something which is, I believe, very, very interesting. Then you get a functional equation for the Borel transform, right, which involves very strange operators, and then you try to attack the linearization, right? But we never found that. We never found a direct way of attacking the linearization. You see what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the spares are in Paris. But okay, we can talk a little more about this. Yeah, it's one of these things that you get a very strange functional equation, but the functional equation is basically the conjugate by Borel transform of a very simple thing, right? And we were always doing that. I mean, so basically, you end up doing the. I mean, so basically, you end up doing the overl transform, yeah. And unless you have a direct way of attacking this directly, you see what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. Okay, you have a functional equation that the border transformer. So you mean that the functional equation in the borderl plane is even more complicated? Yes. Yeah. I mean, or I mean, it's I'm no, I'm not saying it's more complicated. I say that we didn't know how to do anything. Yeah, yeah. Which is a different point. which is a different point uh yeah well but but that's the point uh that i believe is uh the difficulty right you get uh uh in the world plane then you get a fancy equation right which involves multiplications and things like this etc right i mean basically it's the same as what kay was saying i mean it's one of these things that factors into multiplications and derivatives right okay so we can probably they are telling me that this They are telling me that it's time, so I'm going to. We are, we can postpone the discussion for later. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Now it's time for the photo, no? Hi, guys. It's time to do your photo. Hi guys, it's time to do a photo. I'm going to take a snapshot here for the participants who are in Zoom. Please turn your camera on if you want to be here. Okay, let's wait some minutes, seconds.
