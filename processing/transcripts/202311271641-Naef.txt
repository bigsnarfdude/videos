So yeah, first I wanna start with some kind of motivation and like how does English antiquity appear? Sorry, the classical definition how to define what it is. And it's just they define as heat doubling complexes. But now the equivalences are not just all the multiple equivalences, but only collapses. And extensions but classical terms of nine minus or In terms of right maister and right hat, tell that there's some right way of thinking about that. Namely, it's just ordinary homotopy type together with some extra structure, which can only say it's the same as the basis of a change on universal colour up to some. Up to some equivalence that I will not like. But since this is already some kind of k-theoretic way of saying this, we end up with the modern definition, such as like a way how to say basis. Or first of all, instead of just going to the universal coverage and go all the way to the point, then instead of talking about Pi 1 modules. But I one modules talk about the rejective spaces. But then the whole thing becomes equivalent to talking about the following rejective space. The class in A3, only one equals of that thing zero. And all of this is happening in A3, where you have to model Uh image of GSM divide. Um but and so here are is the homotopy just recall what uh we're gonna call this the characteristic of X and here I I'm gonna already view the equations, maybe it's not quite well characteristic. Quite quite a characteristic right defining a subtraction. And then I'm just this whole equalities are made sense by the following theorem that x is a finite C double complex. If none if the finite obstruction vanishes. And if you have, say, now two But what is X? Sorry, mate, but X. Here just X and Modipitag? X on Multiply type for me finally dominated. That thing makes sense. What's that what? Yeah, yeah, that's one. Right, so in particular, if you have a map between two of those. Two of those, you can ask whether it's compatible or it's a simple map, which is just being compatible with that null homotopies. So then what we want to end up is the following sequence of homotopies. Well, first of all, we say it's the same as the characteristic of the axis here. Let's look at homotopy films. We start with a multiple lens as a is a simple map, but if and only if the following combination is zero. So first the characteristic is null homotopic by power x but then since that refactor space doesn't depend on and let's invert under concepts, like just ordinary hardware concept. So that's the same as So that's the same as pull back the characteristic on y, but that we also said is zero. Pull back on that null homotopic and we get a loop here and we can ask where the loop is non-homotopic. If this is non-homotopic, then the map is simple. So this combination here is Rx minus or Ry that is the hyter torsion which now lives in this guy also the light type spectrum. Uh but some difficulty ingredients that well kind of an obstruction that vanishes and if it vanishes you can you get the kind of secondary operations and if the second operation vanishes then the map also preserves your extra structure. And the ingredient for that construction was that we had this functor from topological spaces to topological spaces. Spaces. And we also had some characteristic. So for all topological spaces that satisfy some condition, you get this characteristic. But it's only really invariant under what to be called, so you can only take that's all. So you can only take, that's only a get the function out of the group point core, or like a natural transformation out of the group point core. I don't think I'm saying this. Characteristic is something in the limit. Easy input here. So whenever we have this kind of structure, we can produce Structured, we can produce such a group point of simple spaces by knowing exactly what we did here. We take a pass between zero and the characteristic. Whether this is the space of all the simple structures on X. And since it's a path space, this is a either it's empty, and if it's not empty, then it's a torsor or face pass. That's why I'm going to use the same thing. But I can build a category or just a group point of these things. Overall x not to be times. Right, we're going to call this Well, so the ingredients were just powered together to characteristic. So I've triggered what we did before is ethereal functor and the characteristic given by back construction. What are you modding compact? Sorry? What are you modding out by? I just can't read it. Very classical theorem is that Very classical theorem is that if you have a compact manifold, like a smooth manifold, you can triangulate it, so you basically get these spaces. And the family version of that is the zero, or at least a version, a family version is the zero YWAS Willems, which tells you that you take compact manifolds, the two points. The group by chord there is a map into this guy here. But which one may have to say that for manifold, a compact manifold, you can assign a simple homotic type, because we can just coherently in families. But then there's also some kind of variant of that where we take manifold, a closed manifold, because then one can ask for these spaces to be somehow compatible with the parent neutrality. Oh, wait, so this can be informal. But yeah, I'm not gonna like explain the details here. But instead of that function, there's some other function called L A or this probably routinely bit for you, but this would be like it's from the bit or. Like it's from the bit or LA, which is funker from basis. So here we need to remember some circle vibrations. And there's again some characteristic um yeah, I may just write myself again. I mean now to like what we need to do. Well, you need to, I mean instead of trying to donate it, take vibrate, there are all the complexes. And for each of those, there is some characteristic thing. Right, so one can produce the same construction as the say on off. So can you just unconfuse me for a second in the moment? Why can't you put top FP core on the left side? I mean every every finitely dominated topological space has an undermining simple homometer type and every homeomorphism preserves that. Why can't you replace a compact manifold by top finite dimensional every every finitely dominated topological space has an unrelaxable homotopy type and every homeomorphism finitely dominated spaces? So what was the confusion? How did it resolve? It did not. I will try to resolve it after the file. I think like given the idea of some kind of like bundle instead of vibration type of thing. Type of things. What is the statement of the theorem of why we're actually waving up? What is the statement? There is a map. And I should probably say it is at least factors over the top. So at least then it's. I think then the statement is already non-trivial. But they have like m they say much more about this map. There's one? But so if one also incorporates frankly, then there's this much more complicated version where now we can take close manifolds and again like it exists.dismap is part of this. That this map is part of the Spiceville 3 paper, and yeah, they have some connectivity. So, like the kind of picture that I want to understand, that's that's what I want to talk about. So, a manifold in Figgle you can take configuration spaces. This gives you a write module. I need the right module based on the right task, but it's a reasonable thing to write here. But there is a bunch of undefined districts that Because there's lots of weakenings of that function. I think I'll call everything from something anyway. Call everything from something eight, like call all these trace nets. I could ask whether there is such a square, and this is like the content of what I want to talk about. But maybe the whole thing is more like a dream or hope. That first of all, that there exists such a square, and then I guess if you talk to Manuel, he'll tell you that there's some. Manual, he'll tell you that there's some modifications. So, maybe here I should more likely write some configuration categories, but also here with the assembly maps, there's maybe like some slightly better thing to do. And then one good hope or wish for that is actually good pullback. But this I'm not gonna even attempt to do. Why the claim would be that there is square, but even that I cannot do. So having a square means, and first of all, I should tell you what is this map, and I should tell you why this square per meets. Yeah, maybe before I do that, so there's some adjectives that we need to write here. Or it doesn't make sense. I don't know if it's well one tick group before. And also, it doesn't make sense for empty construction that I'll talk about. Will not make sense for any of those EGRI modules, but only certain subject shapes that are of congregation space type, which I noticed introduced by Thomas, I'll say just in a second what this is. And also, they need to be closed, and I will also tell you what I mean by closed. Can you explain in like a few words what so so just this right-hand side was the horizontal maps are supposed to be like Euler characteristics or something like I guess I'm just all of the the adjectives are like I'm I'm not really understanding what's going on can you like say like what the Can you say what the bottom right is? Right, so what this is supposed to be saying is that what I want to say is that this is kind of an approximation of like manifolds are approximated in some sense by just saying you have a space together with like explaining how it is finite or like how it is finite compatible with being perfectly duality. But then there's a bunch of other ways how you could kind of talk about what being finite Kind of talk about what being finite means. And I want to say, like, if it, if you do this for any of those other ways, then you can actually extract, like, whatever the extra piece of information was, you can just extract it by knowing the congregation spaces. Don't think about like what I'll explain at the I mean, I'll not be able to do any of this, I'll be able to do like some mild version with like the weakest version of that, and then we'll explain to you that you. And then we'll explain to you that you can, like all this fineness abstraction and white attortion, you can sort of extract at least their traces if you only know their congregation spaces. And they don't depend on like more than that. Does that. So like this top right thing, that's something I could define for any space, right? That. That's over in A, that's true, but that's in L A. Right, so there's something that structure. But it doesn't have to be a manifold, right? To define that. I'm sort of thinking, so you have a category of manifolds, and here you have a category of spaces together with some extra structure that is sort of cooked up out of the L A theory. That category you can always define. Like that that there is such a map that it seems very hard. Seems very hard. That there is such a map here. This is again just abstract nonsense. I mean, once you know that those traces exist. So I guess I don't know what the bottom right corner is. So whenever you have a functor from, like whenever you have a functor, you get a characteristic, you can produce this kind of space or just you can define the notion of say a simple space with respect to that functor. With respect to that functor, which is a space together with actualization in the translation of its Euler characteristic, the finest abstraction which you can just define in terms of the characteristic. Okay. Does that clarify anything or something? Yeah, some, yeah. I'll make this more precise because as I said, I cannot prove the full thing here, so the things that we can actually prove are much more concrete. Thanks for that was one quick forward one. I'll tell you a bit of progress on showing some of this. By so there's two steps. Like the first thing is, first of all, define such a map, but the next step is to show that the spectrum meets. So far we can only do it for almost like the very weakest thing. And for THH together with its characteristics, like the trace of the characteristics. So that's what we do. I'll explain how to do this, but the form Uh I'll explain how to do this, but the formula is essentially also in the paper molecule which wind. Then Klein explains almost how to do this thing, except that we not quite get trace of that characteristic, but or we don't know it, we get some characteristics. We get some characteristic that might or might not be what we actually want. I mean for sure it is, but we can't do it. But at least that characteristic, it maps down to the good one. That we can show and that the square commute we can only show on pi zero so far I will explain and here we can like at least in some cases right so having the map on I0 that also allows That also allows you to construct those white head torsion-like elements. Pressure you can find abstractions from maps, form maps. I mean, you can compute those torsion classes. And here, we can also, we can at least compare those torsion classes. As of the torsion, the client version torsion is the same as trace of the actual torsion in here in this THR business, but only for For homoticals that are used by H coborisms. Yeah, so the statements get weaker when you go along with this diagonal. And I'd also say that everything here, it will, there is a much weaker thing that will fracture through. The first speaker thing is that I don't really need to know all disks, I only need to know almost two disks. So like if you go along this direction, let's say do T C, then yeah, don't really know much, but I'd sort of expect that you need more disks in this direction. Yeah, so then maybe like. Um yeah, so then we like spell out what those statements what we can get out of this. Uh so we make no claims about anything being such and such connected. So kind of the best result that you can get out of this is just distinguish some potentially different uh propagation spaces. Or sort of figure out whether or not to homotopy type even allows a configuration space, like sort of a dispersion of that set in that sense. So just like the existence of map more of just map one, we get the following results. Okay, if you have a parameter complex, right then fx admits the one of those discrete use with all the adjective but then you get trace of But then you get trace of IS obstruction. What does that mean? X admits. I guess if there is a, if there's a disk precise with those adjectives such that the underlying space, I guess by underlying space I should say, embeddings of one disks modded out by automotors of that disk, that should be x. That should be x. Okay. And if such thing exists, then trace of that is zero. So, in particular, if trace of multi-finance abstraction is non-zero, you'd get an abstraction. So, like with the configurations type condition. And closeness. But that's the immediate bit. It doesn't have any known examples because conjecturally trace of, like just the trace map is zero and the past conjecture tells us that this is always zero. Potentially there is no example of that. It's actually interesting. Unless you want to use this to study the or I can try and prove the past conjecture, but I don't think that's But next thing where there are actually examples, if you have now two manifolds that are homotopy equivalent, but we have the trace of the bite-time version. If this is non-zero, then we get that. Okay, but from let's take a joke. We get that they have different congregation spaces and right here I mean really I really mean like congregation categories or disk reshives. Like the single spaces take the I mean I don't make claims about single spaces not being claimed. Single space and not being equal, but like the family of all those spaces together with the SMS. That means they're different even as truncated? Okay. That means they're different even as pre-sheets on the truncated disk. Yeah, I mean like the precise thing is like the two truncated thing, or even like the two truncated configuration categories, they will be different. Which doesn't mean that yet the spaces of they could still be the same much. For the second correlation, where is this space value? Is this one that like the you have you com is this trace like computed for any things? Right, so yeah, maybe we should say that this there are actually examples of this lens spaces just two lens faces Spaces. There are a moderate ground, and you can compute this torsion, and you can compute the trace of the torsion, and it's still non-zero. And th of x, usually I would put in, is that like you take sigma? Yeah, I can find it. The lights are here difficult sort of because making two things as similar as possible but still having different configuration categories. Different configuration categories. And this is sort of what we had in the upper, in the lower right corner. You could cook up an example if you given a group and say I have something in the white group of it. Such death under the normal yeah there's some involution on microgroup and I want that the norm is this would go to zero but still that Just like marking orbits are actually If you had an element microgroup such that its norm is zero, but its trace is non-zero even in C2 orbits. And from that, one can look at two manifolds and then H cobordism. So H cohorts cobortism But you have sorry H cohorting inducing our mod pictons but does not extend Uh answer right no, but we can't. And such that as a simple but you can even make it a simple map um You can even make it a simple map, and the thing is like what is used here. So you take that element in Meit group to produce an H coordinate that will have non-terral torsion, but the multiple equivalence is really those two terms, inclusion of left boundary and inclusion of right boundary. And there is this duality formula that tells you that for the composite map, this is really the torsion. So the composite would be a symbological. So the next thing that uh wanna tell you is briefly how this construction of the arrow button works. Um it particularly doesn't really go out of And in particular it doesn't really go out of this species, but something that's a bit weaker. Is there an example of that we're going to have X for this? Oh yeah, I should have said that. I don't know whether there are examples of this. Yeah, you can update it. It's at least a purely algebraic statement. That map usually seems to be non-trivial in general, but still I was not able to. Channel, but still I was not able to find any. Also, I'm not very good at like computing bytec groups. Can you say the map add is not induced in map of the configuration categories? Or is it? Yeah. Here the goal was to find you can find just two manifolds together with a simple map. But still the map does not induce, like you cannot extend it to the congregation. Use, like you cannot extend it to the congregation spaces. When it's a surfing case, you would want to conjecture that any simple mapping uses probably no, but also can find examples. Right, so I'm gonna tell you what the actual thing is that like where all this is kind of a Actually, this is kind of an obstruction to what the actual structure is. And for that, I'll tell you what the primary duality diagonal or primary duality embedding of the diagonal is. And it's going to be a diagram of the following tape. And what I actually have in mind is for manifold if you want to say what is an embedding just purely in terms of, say, your homogeneous, or like if you try to come up with a definition of an embedding, just in terms of homogeneity, then Then you could come up with the following notion that for an embedding, you don't just need to know what the thing is that you embed, but you also need to know what is the complement, and you need to know how they glue together. What we in particular see here is that for every by very concrete manifold, we can produce such a we can produce such a diagram that will satisfy some some condition about non-degeneracy condition this diagram does the bottom map need to be the diagonal for the other ones of your finger yeah the other ones yeah so like you have to choose two spaces and I guess three maps And I guess three maps and homotopy. And the rest is conditions. That's only general sequencing equivalent to the map from U to M being a spherical vibration? It follows in two dimension three, if M is at least, what, three dimensional or something, it follows from the fact you assume that there's some Punk array duality around in that diagram. It's a Punk array stratification on M cross M really. It's a push-out diagram. But I but I can't choose U to be M and C to be M. You don't choose U to be M, but You don't choose U to the M. There's some additional conditions that are not stated. And it also imply that U is the inverse of the dualizing spectrum. When did I start actually? How much do you have left? Yeah, let me explain what the tongue collapse does. So basically, now I can do the tongue collapse along the diagonal. Lting up push M. I get a disinclosed, so I get a map from m times m to m mod u. But I want to do this not just for But I want to do this not just for everything. I don't just want to do this for homology, but maybe for all local systems. And since I need to take some kind of quotient here, I should probably do this in spaces over m times m. Spaces over n times m, or pointer spaces or n times m there's a trivial zerosphere for m times m. And the same kind of construction gives you a map into what I'll call delta lower phi club S u. And just to say, so this is a space over m times m. This is a space over m times m. This is phi group. Phi is the following thing. It's pass from x to y and m at the base point and then smash with the unregulated suspension of This is like what you mean. Command map and I'll call this map the elevation map. Because one thing that you can do like the same idea here, if you would want to figure out how this is how the intersection pairing is non-degenerate, you'd want to join one of the factors over. So the same thing you can do here. So the same thing you can do here a joint map where you map points in M to sections but only in one of those factors and I guess yeah should well you prepare to take that fiber and you can either take that X or Y doesn't matter because there's a path between them but this means that you can accurately put this. This means that you can actually put this outside. Quite so yeah. A map like this, that is about adding point at non-latticle spaces over m. And so far this is an unstable map, but you can just as well stabilize it. What is what is gamma? The sections. The sections move back to one of the. I don't know. Let me write the number one, which doesn't explain anything, but at least it's not just. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not sure. And there's another that's used here, I suppose. I can stabilize everything, turn, but I take stable sections. And what this guy is like the way of writing Like the way you're writing like client's version of the dualizing the dualizing complex. And I want that equivalence. This is going to be that condition that this map is now in the clones, which import people in files that don't know. But this in particular implies that this is the inverse of the dualizing spectrum and the dualizing spectrum is a dualizing complex and it's spherical and yeah. I mean that's that's a condition which implies in particular u was a spherical vibration and it's inverse spectrum. And once you have this identification, there is some Eograph. We close five or six functors. And namely, if we take homology twisted with this inverse dualizing spectrum, that's the same as taking homology in that local system. But I'll just use this one again. Right, so also from this yoga here, what you get is that this map together with this object, they are uniquely determined. But I put like such a map, like if I already know this invertible, I can put this on the other side, and then I'm literally just introducing a new object to get an isomorphism in the krill. To get an isomorphism equivalent to the known oscillator. Also, the paragraph. Any practicality complex, more or less, I will define it in such a way. So, this is like the version of the inverse version of the uniqueness of the speed of normal vibration. For speed of normal vibration, usually you remember the vibration together with a class such that some conditions and some conditions will say something is invertible, and if you take the inverse of that map, then you will end up with that map. This dead. Right, so far we haven't really gained any, or we just explained that if you have such a particular duality embedding, you can extract something that actually does not even depend on that diagram. But if I There's two things that are special in that situation. One was a by like how we started with was that evaluation was not just a stable map, but it was unstable. And the second the second thing that you would get is that if you now restrict that evolution map to the diagonal, then in principle it goes into something like the free loop space with a twist, or it's like a section of loop space with a twist, everything over m. But if you follow through the attacker, it actually has a factorization. And all those loops, they're just trigger loops. Yeah, let me first save something bad. Okay, what what we get here is bad. But for every breakthrough duality complex, I can look at this stable evaluation restricted to the diagonal because I said this doesn't depend on any additional choices. But if you have such a permutuality diagonal, then the thing actually becomes true. Or rather, it leads to constancy. Right, so really what we have constructed is. Right, so really what we have constructed is maybe using the space out of sections here. Sorry, Flori, just in E, which of these objects are stable and which of these objects are unstable. And yeah, in the first one. So here everything is stable. Ah, sorry, this is not here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, here everything is stable. But part of the specialism is just always true for any conference. It's not true that you can factor it. Or at least like it might be extra data that you can factor. And let me like take the upshot away from Like to take the upshot away from it. The area that you use is that I claim this guy was something in here. Okay, it will resolve itself, I guess. Sorry, it becomes canonical after you send it to Tate. That's the extract. After you send it to? After you send it to Tate for the situation on the diagonal. So a different explanation of that is that that elevation map restricted at an angle, there's something in that homomorphism space, but that thing using again this quite good wealthy correlator, you can identify that with the freedom phase, which you can identify with THH. And you can ask what is that element here. What is that element here? And the element here is the trace of the trace of this characteristic, the A3 characteristic. And here's what I mentioned, there's a calculation that also appears in this calculation. Multi-blood blank paper. Right, but now we said it's it's not just Now we said it's not just the section in here, but it actually lifts to a section when you remove that guy, which is just a different way of writing the stable multiple effects. For example, Because what we explained for every of those diagrams that we drew before, you can find that this map which is completely canonical factor against factorization. And computing those mapping spaces, you get that it's a GHH source of the GH assembly map. Of the GH assembly map. Right, and this was the definition of what you think works. So, and here is this work of finding one of the channels. Because here we now have the problem that we have a stable map and we want to figure out whether or not it admits an unstable lift. And for those things that are obstructions, as we call the coffee map, and this will be a map, and we do this. Just fibrise so we get a map into this guy and again like these home spaces you can identify using paracutrality. So this is again going to be the freedom space But now we have some some C2 action that I mean does two things interverse or rotation of loops and there's a sign that sort of depends on the on the blue lysis spectrum there's like this like the state of animation then the bits okay Unstable lifts they at least give you automatic of the of the of the hopping there. So now we can So now we can write the same kind of thing as I did here. So whenever you have such a factor duality at any of the diagonal, we can produce primarily like this guy. It does not depend on us choosing such a diagram. It is just something that you could do purely in terms of the stable evaluation. But if you have a diagram that you get a normal homologue of that, so we can again write this in kind of way. But we can also identify this with GHR, at least if you only consist of your screen fiber of the assembly map, then there's no difference here. But the only thing here that maybe we don't quite know yet is that we would want this to be the trace of the easier characteristic. And don't quite know that this is true. But what is true is that at least if you take the norm of the former one, and then this is only But that should at least explain all the maps of type 1. Was it just like One, but there's just like two different obstructions that you can write down. One is sort of like the devilation map when you restrict to the diagonal, it's also restricted to the diagonal, and the other is that the elevation map which admits unstable lift. And for some reason that I don't really have deep understanding is that those two obstructions are related. So, right, so and now just a phrase what those were things done. Or once now we phrase what the choos were and then maybe So if you have a closed manifold, then you can take this trace of the bin S obstruction in A here. And this now has a long amount of B for these seemingly two reasons. Seemingly two reasons. One is the trace of n being a finite complex or is millions. I'm just like, it has normal multiple B because it was a finite complex, but now it has also the different normal multiplier. But it's seemingly different, which is what we explained, what we explained here. And the claim is that this commute So that means the loop you get is a trivial loop. Yeah. But it will in particular imply that now you have same maps between two manifolds and you can define these two obstructions. One is just trace out the trace out the right attortion and the other one is this obstruction that you get by sort of asking where the two reasons that the evaluation map were six to the diagonal were Evaluation map for six to the diagonal where those two regions are the same. And those two different obstructions will agree. So I still get like five more minutes. Is there? Just very briefly says that. Just very briefly say how this is related to string topology, maybe only sort of schematically diagnosis. Maybe more or less RED figured out the depth to do something with intersection theory. And here what you can construct is something that I'll call relative intersectioning, which is Relative intersection theory, which is the situation if you have an absolute intersection theory, I want to say if you have a vibration over m times m, you can produce a metronomy of that into multi-o the dang. And for this, you don't need anything. This is sort of a commodity invariant for the reason that. This is sort of a commodity invariant for the reason that this calculation map was canonically defined. Now, if you also have something that lifts ordered angle, you can do this relatively well. Which if you think about it geometrically, then there's sort of like no counterfeit. But if you try to implement it using those calculation maps, then Collation maps then here you exactly need this additional this additional piece of structure, like this frame neutrality diagonal. Turns out the outshot is so, since this depends on that diagram here, and we understand how the different diagrams relate in terms of torsion, there is a theorem that you can now multiply cones and you can do intersections like on M one and you can do this relative intersections on M two. Relative intersections one and two and try and compare them. And this you can express now in terms of the same type of format and now intersections given in terms of the right minus the face of the mice atrsion, but it's But it's bigger than that kind of intersections here, it's not homotopy nurture. And maybe the last thing. So one example of E and L that I particularly like. Take the free loop space and evaluate it at two points on the circle. If you restrict that to the circle, you get spaces of figure eight. Just take inclusions of, take the figure eights that are trivial on either left or right here. Or I guess you can just like take the identity and then explain why the diagonal commutes optimally. It will be L and E, but then the intersection will be something from Into figure eight, mod out this L, and you can break this further apart. I guess there's not some that's up to shift, that's just If it's just two-space homology, and the claim is that this is, well, it's called the product. Okay, so once handled, yeah, now you can apply this form to here, and you get some kind of formula that tells you that the Lupko product is not in red land homotopy, but it transforms to some formula that trace of Formula involving the trace of the torsion. Any questions? What what approach to this dream you had about oh just ask the question. What's now presumably from these media disk structure thingies? Disk structure that you need, you can also build a comporting category. How much is not a problem? I don't quite know to whom this is an actual question. But one approach to this dream you wrote down, you can make a composition category within the disk structure thing. Also learn about the homotopy type of this particular note to not be excising the ten-venture structure. I think probably not. I think we talked, but I mean that's kind of like an approach that we're trying. I mean. I think it's not. Yeah, but you can sort of like, but it factors under. Are there what's the reasons to believe the dream? Sheer hopefulness and no, like I'm there's like paper of Mandela. Yeah, they know something. Yeah, they they know something about like the fiber of like manifolds like the difference between manifolds and discrete sheaves. They have like a bunch of properties that it's like an infinite loop space and the thing only depends on like the tangential one type or something, two type. And then you can try and figure out like what what else what else has the same difference for like Else had the same difference, like at least a difference of a similar shape. Okay. But it might just be like that we don't really know too many other functors out of A-theory instead of those traces. Oh, one more question from the chat. This is from Mohammed. You mentioned the result at the beginning, but you can only go over it. Can you explain the part? Uh because I don't understand well enough the trace map from L like from current or L theory L A theory to T H R. Mar, I think you can speak also, we can hear all the speakers in the speaker. Any other questions for me? No more questions from something that we will learn about currently.
