Introductory words I made, I didn't make clear enough the scope and limitations of what this was good for. So the idea was simply to prepare the grounds for, well, initiating the discussion and well, giving a picture that sort of brings us on the common grounds. On the other hand, I thought that there's clearly no way how this can serve as or replace an introduction to the subject of, say, these relations between quantum field theory in three and four dimensions and VOAs. So this was not the intention. So in particular, I couldn't be proper at all. Be proper at all concerning history and credits of the subject. I was actually struggling. I mean, I had assigned myself five minutes to these introductory words, which were just to sort of initiate the discussion, and I failed meeting this own constraint badly, I noticed afterwards. So, yeah, I would like to apologize. I mean, indeed, I did mention some people's. Did mention some people's work there because I was very directly referring to the work where this picture I drew was basically taken from. But due to this concept of sort of these very brief, as it was meant, introductory words, I missed to, of course, mention a lot of other important work which initiated the subject. Initiated the subject, and I mean, in particular, of course, if I did not mention this work, it doesn't mean I consider it not important. So in particular, there was definitely pioneering work of Sergei Gukov and his collaborators that in a, well, more complete introduction would have deserved to be mentioned. So I would like to apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that this has caused. That this has caused. My idea about sort of, I mean, my idea was to moderate a discussion really rather than giving an introduction. And yeah, this may have led to misunderstandings for which I want to apologize. All right, so to otherwise sort of start today's discussion, I want to very briefly, in just two sentences, sort of start with what basically was What basically was the origin of the idea to have a continuation today, which is yesterday we discussed some aspects of the relation between topological twisted 3D supersymmetric quantum flow theories and vertex operator algebras, on which by now we've also heard several talks. And very basically, okay, this it hinges on this correspondence, the relation between line operators in the TQFT and we also. Operators in the TQFT and VOA representations. And Tudor made a remark: I hope I'm not misrepresenting it badly, that basically in this context of topological twisted supersymmetric field theories, that basically the category of lines and, well, the associated objects in the TQFT that one obtains in this way always wants to be derived. So that is, of course, a rough slogan, but this. Slogan, but this sort of led then us to discuss developments about derived conformal blocks that Christophe and Lucas have made recently. And yeah, interest was expressed in the round to hear a bit more about this. And I think this is what we should start with today. So I don't know, Christophe or Lucas. So, I don't know, Christophe or Lucas, who ultimately wants to say something more, but I think this was the intention that was expressed yesterday. Lucas has prepared a few slides in a bit more detail, and so I would suggest that we leave him the stage. Okay, we're good. Yes, please. Okay, yeah, I hope you can see this. So yeah, this is supposed to be a bit longer, but still a kind of short introduction to differential graded modular functors. And yeah, these are the two references that I will speak about, but I want to mention that there is. About, but I want to mention that there is more. There are also these works of Len Amir, Sommerhuiser, and Schweiger, and that I will also mention along the way. But I will mainly discuss these two aspects. Okay, so the input datum for this, this is a modular category, so we have seen this many times now, so this is not necessarily semi- Times now, so this is not necessarily semi-simple, that's that's kind of important. And this is a finite ribbon category with non-degenerate grading. We have also discussed a lot about sources for this and that there are a lot of sources from ribbon factorizable Hof algebras. So one of the easiest things would be Drinfeld doubled, but also, yeah, certain quantum groups. And then the VOA side, to which a lot of people have contributed, that is something that I do not know so much. Do not know so much about, but those are the two main sources. And yeah, we have also seen that in some sense, getting non-semi-simple examples, that's somewhat easier, it's a generic case to a certain extent. And this entails that the homological algebra is very rich. So there are a lot of results on the homological algebra. Algebra of these categories, a lot of important conjectures attached to it, for instance, by Eddinghoff and Osteck, the finite generation conjecture of the X algebra, etc. And yeah, so starting from this, we can try to build a differential-graded modular functor. So we first define a synergic monoidal category of C-labeled surfaces, where the objects are surfaces, where the boundary components are labeled with. Components are labeled with projective objects. This is not necessarily a limitation, but the projective objects already tell us everything, so we can concentrate on these without loss of generality, actually. The morphisms are mapping classes and sewings. And this is what such a sewing or gluing looks like. You glue two boundary components together, which have the same label. And this gives you a symmetric novel category by disjoint. Monoidal category by disjoint union. And then a differenti-graded modular functor. This is a symmetric monodal functor from this thing to chain complexes. And you're on the last slide when you were gluing, you said the same label, but you had P's on one side and X's on the other. Is there some sort of duality? No, the X's, those are just spectator labels. They are there before the gluing and they are there after. Are there before the gluing and they are there after the gluing, they're not affected. They are just dummy variables, it doesn't mean anything. The important thing is that this is the same label. One of the boundary components is incoming, the other one is outgoing. All of them are projective, but these two coincide and they are too much into the P's and the X's. Yeah, okay. Yeah, sorry, this was, yeah, yeah, the question here was: I mean, what's left is not necessarily. I mean, what's left is not necessarily ingoing, and what's right is not necessarily outgoing, but ingoing and outgoing is color-coded by the red circles. And then you're gluing the two right circles, one of which is ingoing, one of which is outgoing. Yes. Yeah. Okay. And yeah, the symmetric monodal functor, when you evaluate it on the cylinder, gives you back the category. The category of projectives. And then it satisfies excision. This is a locality axiom that amounts to the factorization axiom for conformal blocks. We will discuss this in an example in a second. And then, yeah, so the values of this modular functions is something that we might want to call differential-grade conformal blocks. And then the statement here is that any modular category in a canonical way gives us such a thing. Gives us such a thing. In homology, and strictly speaking, also after dualizing with the modified trace, this recovers mapping class group actions given by Lend Amir, Sommerhozen and Schweigard. And this thing is not only homotopy coherent, but also a marking-independent version of that thing. That is how it should be understood. The mapping class group actions that you get from this, these are computable and they are non-trivial. So, the thing is, what I mean by this is that. The thing is, what I mean by this is that in zero's homology, they give you indeed the Luvashenko actions that Ingo and Azad have talked about a lot today. And these differential graded representations that you get here, it's not the case that this is just somehow just an obvious upgrade of the degree zero part. And I know that Jorg and Simon have looked into some examples. And if you want to hear some more details about this, I'm sure they will be happy to. I'm sure they will be happy to tell you some things about it. Here's the idea: how you actually construct this. So, the idea is that this differential-graded conformal block is a homotopy collimit of so-called marked conformal blocks, which are constructed for some additional auxiliary datum. And then, the crucial thing is that this category of markings on that surface is actually constructed. On that surface is actually contractible. This is something that we prove building on work of Grotendi, Kara, Hatcher Thurston, Mozebeck, and then also Bakalov and Kirillov. This is this Lego Teichm√ºller game. And this is, in a sense, an infinity version of this. And the fact that this is contractible will entail that you can actually compute the differential graded conformal block by choosing a marking, as you might know it from other contexts. Yeah, up to equivalence is. Yeah, up to equivalence. This gives you the differential grade conformal block. And here's how this looks like in an example. So let's discuss the torus. This is the torus, and then there's this marking. The only important thing is really here the cut system. And then the prescription is that you need to perform for such a cut a homotopy coant. And this will, up to equivalence, compute the differential gradient form a block. So, what is this homotopy coant? Coand. So the coant in the first approximation, this is always a direct sum, as we have also seen it in a different context, also in the talks of Ingu and Azar. We take a direct sum and then we divide out these relations. And since these are chain complexes, we have to do this in a homotopically correct way. And then we end up with this simplicial object, or you can also see it as a. Or you can also see it as a chain complex. I mean, that's equivalent. And yeah, this then in this case happens to be the Hochschild complex of the category, or rather, of the ideal of projectives. If this comes from modules of an algebra, this agrees also with the traditional Hochschild complex. Yeah. And maybe I can interrupt for a second. Yes. Yeah. So in Yeah, so in a sense, the logic is the following one. I mean, when the idea is to sum over all intermediate states, but people never thought over all intermediate states, but it's summing over isomorphism classes of symbols, for example, in the Durive-Wirrow construction. Now, since we are non-semi-simple, the first approximation is to sum over all objects, modulo, all morphisms. That's the co-end. Morphisms. That's the co-end. And then taking a quotient is bad in the world of complexes. So that's why what used to be relations here in the line in the second to last displayed equation that will be encoded in terms of the image of a differential. And that leads to a very standard complex. And whether you write down a complex or a simplistic. Down a complex or a simplicial object, that's a matter of convenience. So, there is Dolt Kahn correspondence is implicitly understood by what Lucas was saying. So, really, it's here summing over all intermediate states and imposing the relations of not only isomorphisms, but morphisms in the category in a homotopy correct way by imposing relations as images of differentials. And a nice thing. And the nice thing is that this leads you immediately necessarily to the Hussie complex. So in this way, you get just by implementing the sum over states in a correct way, you get, for example, the Hochie complex for the torus and similar complexes for all kinds of surfaces. Yeah. And the nice thing is that this gives you really the mapping class group actions. This gives you really the mapping class group actions in a very organic way. Because on this thing, since this is a functor, you have the mapping class group action. You don't have to think about it. It's just because it's a functor. But then this thing is equivalent. And now you have the mapping class group action here. So you have the mapping class group action on the Hofstrid complex. Here, however, this is even a strict action. And it's actually relatively easy because it comes from the markings. Here, this might be hard. So this is something that So, this is something that Lennamir, Sommerheiser, and Schweigard have computed explicitly on the level of cohomology of Hof algebra. And this is something that you can do very explicitly, but it's not easy. And especially saying what the S matrix on this side is, this doesn't have a very direct and natural interpretation for this description of the complex. And you have to go to different descriptions of the complex to give it directly, and then you have to go back and so on, and then it becomes very messy. And then the trick is somehow that you have this object on which the action is just there topologically and where it's strict. And then, yeah, you can transfer it here or you don't. But do you know any other way of computing the right-hand side? I mean, it is precisely excision which allows you to compute it. But I mean, this thing has the description as this homotopy co-limit over the markings, and it is a homotopy co-limit over a huge contractable category. And the mapping class group action happens just on the markings. It doesn't actually really act on the marked conformal blocks. It just acts on the Blocks. It just acts on the markings, and then this translates to the mapping class group actions if you know these moves inside the Lego-Teichm√ºller game. And then you really arrive at something which is comparable to what Lubashenko has done. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, and then so we have seen now that this homological algebra is already compatible. Already compatible with the low-dimensional topology to the extent that it gives a modular functor with various chain complexes. And then, one thing that you might want to save also is something which looks like the Verlinde formula. And the Walinde formula here in the semi-simple case, so this formula that probably everyone here knows, what this says is that this mapping class group element S, this very specific mapping class group element. This very specific mapping class group element is an algebra isomorphism from the Verlinda algebra, so the torus conformal block with the fusion product, to the same vector space with the diagonal product, which is very easy. So the trick of the Verlinda formula, topologically speaking, is to find inside the mapping class group orbit of the fusion product an easier product and then use this to actually compute what the fusion coefficients are. Compute what the fusion coefficients are. This is what this says, and this often summarized by saying that s diagonalizes the fusion. And here in this derived setting, you cannot get directly commutative algebras with values and vector spaces, but you will look at E2 algebras, so homotopy commutative algebras whose commutativity behavior is parametrized by the break group. So, for instance, the binary operations is. So, for instance, the binary operations is given by the configurations of two disks inside a bigger disk, and then you can move these configurations. And then, yeah, it's exactly the bread group which controls this. The homology of the E2 operat is Garsten-Haber operat. You can have a framed version of this where you also allow for rotations of the disk, and then you get, and this is equivalent to Batalian-Wekowiski algebras. And then you can observe two. You can observe two things. So, yeah, so we had seen that the differential grade conformal block for the torus is the Hochschild co-chain or chain complex. They are dual to each other because of the colour VR structure coming from the modified trace. So you can look at both. And you find that the Hochschild chains, that this is a non-unital E2 algebra. This structure is relatively trivial and very easy to get. Trivial and very easy to get. And if C is additionally unimodular, the Hohschild co-chains, they come with an E2 algebra structure induced by the monoidal product. And seeing that is actually relatively hard. So in the second thing, this can be interpreted in a sense that you have a differential graded Valinda algebra. So there's an E2 structure coming from the monoidal product. Now, via the S matrix, you want to compare it to a different. Want to compare? Maybe briefly interrupt. Well, first, unimodularity is automatically fulfilled for modular tensor categories. So this is not an additional condition in the case we are interested in the framework of this workshop. And also, you should see that, I mean, morally speaking, also the complexes we get for other closed-oriented surfaces, they are They are also Hochschild complexes, but with non-trivial coefficients. So we get plenty of higher structures on these derived conformal blocks like these Gaston-Haber algebra structures in cohomology. And one of the questions we might discuss after Luca's presentation is whether there's a field theory analog for this. Christoph, can I ask a quick question? Christophe, can I ask a quick question? So is it clear what should be the additional condition on this BTC for this X to extend to three manifolds, or is there additional condition? Well, let's be very precise what we mean by extending to three manifolds. If you say we take a standard category of cobordisms, which are oriented manifolds and which do not have any additional conditions, as we have seen. Additional conditions as we have seen it this morning, like there is at least one projective object in every ingoing component, and so on. Then there is a classification result, and we can extend it if and only if the modular tensor category is semi-simple. I see. So, just to clarify, if we don't want additional projectives or graphs, it has to be anticipated, right? That's the statement. Yeah, it right. Yeah, it right. So there is nothing deeper in between. Well, but of course, the fact that what we have seen this morning is, I mean, any no-go theorem is made to think about the conditions that are really there. And I think we have to think a bit harder about the conditions. And one of the possible questions is to think about what the correct scalars for three. Direct scalars for three-manifold invariance are. But maybe Lucas wants to complement my answer. No, this, I mean, to some extent, this was what I also would have said. So, I mean, as complexes, the things that you assign to surfaces, this is infinite-dimensional. So, with the traditional notion of TFTs, this is going to be difficult because of dualizability. Yeah, if you somehow Yeah, if you somehow replace what the ground ring is, maybe one can get around this. But that's hard to say. But I mean, definitely we force in the standard approach the ground ring of the TFT would to be scalars by imposing that the endomorphisms of the monoidal. Endomorphisms of the monoidal unit are just multiples of the identity. Right? I mean, the natural countering for a TFT is endomorphisms of the monoidal unit. And if we now go to a derived setting, of course, we would look for the derived home from the monoidal unit to itself. But I don't think we have discussed this so far anyway. Discussed this so far anywhere in the literature as one of the recipients for invariance of three manifolds. But from the logic of a 3D TFT, this is the thing you would try. Let me just connect what you just said, maybe with other things Sergei has thought about for my own benefit. For my own benefit. So, if you're doing something like Litton theory with a non-compact target, you will at some point get a divergent integral. And it's an integral over the moduli space of a vacua of the theory. Functions on that are endomorphisms of the tensor identity. Morphisms of the tensor identity. So it's what you're saying almost suggests that we shouldn't do that integral at all, that rather we should take the integrand and think of that as the three-manifold invariant. Yeah, I think that's the first good approximation. Now, I'm thinking in a more algebraic way, as you're undoubtedly realizing that the point is. The point is that if you look at the derived TOM from the monoidal unit itself, this is a complex which should play the role of scalars. But this complex is, of course, only well-defined up to quasi-isomorphism. So it's kind of very subtle to start to discuss invariants which take values in a codomain which is defined up to quasi-isomorphism. But definitely, the zero approximation that you shouldn't try to integrate these things, but look at the values as these functions as recipients. That's a very useful starting point. If we took a three-manifold and cut out a little ball and asked, instead of a number, asked for the vector in the Hilbert space. In the Hilbert space of the two-sphere. Do you think that has a chance of making sense? Is that an interpretation of what you're saying? I'm not sure it's an interpretation of what Mam was saying. I'm a bit slow to answer this question, but it reminds me one thing I was asking years ago, Christian Mapries. ago chris shomapries um if you have a finite if you have a finite modular tensor category which is not semi-simple on which three manifolds expect you to be able to define this and i really mean three manifolds with any additional decorations in distinction to the talks this morning and he was saying he would he wouldn't be surprised to see that you can define these three manifolds these invariants on any three manifolds This invariance on any three manifolds, where you cut out at least one sphere for any connected component. And if I don't know about the status of this conjecture, but if this is true, it would be very much in line with what you are saying. Yeah, I think that's sort of dual to what you were saying, which is to take the ground ring to be Z of S2. Yes, but dual in a way where you have to be. In a way where you have to be subtle, and I mean, Lucas was saying this already. In order to have a good duality, constantly, the theory of the modified trace enters. And the modified trace apply to the ideal of projectives, to be precise. That's what you meant, right? Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, I think, yeah. Sorry, I have another question for Lucas about this slide. So the E2 algebra structure on Hochial tomology should somehow be induced from a higher E2 rating in the category, which is maybe what the previous slide was about. Yeah, that is literally true for this first part. This is why I said that this is. This first part, this is why I said that this is more or less just a formal do you have a definition of what it means to have an e-tube rating on the derived category of modules for one of these hop algebras. That's a good question. No, not really. I mean, you can. Really? I mean, you can. I mean, you could somehow, of course, consider E2 algebras in DG categories, in an infinity category of DG categories, and that is probably what you want. Yeah, there's some very clear to me. And also, it's not so clear to me to what extent this is different to just saying I take differenti-graded modules, which also then. Modules, which also then, of course, just inherit the braiding. But this is somehow relative, this seems to be a bit more strict. And I would not really know where this occurs. Specifically, the thing that would be nice would be to extend this E2 bracket to give another way to fuse line operators. Line operators. So you could either tensor them directly, or you could sort of smear one around the other. That would correspond to the bracket. This is this idea of secondary operations, right? Yeah. Yeah. But it descends precisely to the Skirsen hubber bracket once we take Hochschule technology. It would be sorry. It would be sorry. I just been wondering about this for a while and I haven't quite put my finger on it. Thanks. I mean, of course, you have to be careful in one respect if you compare these things to what you have in mind. I mean, we do something which in principle has the risk of an information loss. So we don't do any derived representation category of a structure which comes with a representation. A structure which comes with a representation with a differential. But we take an ordinary vertex algebra, if you wish, no differential implied, take its category of representations and derive it as an abelian category. And what you have in mind is you start with a system which has already a differential for very good reasons. Right? And if you would kind of Right, and if you would kind of forget about the differential and restore it at the level of a billion categories, it's not clear that you would get strictly the same thing. So there is a subtlety involved, and this is how much of the information of these higher operations is encoded already in the abelian category, and to what extent you do need to do the representation theory directly in the detail. Theory directly in a DG world. And we are working, our starting point is in good old-fashioned category, no DG structure, and we derive, in a sense, the abelian category. But this is not the only thing that you can imagine to do. Yeah, you're right. And I'm pretty sure that. At a given moment, we will see these derived structures also directly implemented for vertex algebras. But Lucas, I think you have a couple of more slides. Yeah, it's almost done. So I wanted to say what what actually is here the uh Verlinde uh formula. Valinde formula because we need to relate the differentiated Valinde algebra to another algebra that only sees the linear structure. This is exactly what happened here in the semi-simple case. And now you have to ask what is an E2 structure on the Oshik co-chains that just depends on the linear structure. And that's, of course, the E2 structure that comes from the linear conjecture. So Gaston Hauer in the 60s discovered. Gastnerhava in the 60s discovered the bracket that is now known as a Gastnhaver bracket. The linear conjecture that this is actually in E2 algebra, and this was then proven in a lot of different ways, a lot of different versions of this, including the cyclic delinear conjecture for symmetric Fogenius algebras. This is in a linear world, or maybe differentiated world if you like. There are no monoidal structures for this result. And then the Werlinde formula relates these. Formula relates these and says here again in this setting that this mapping class acts as an equivalence of frame D2 algebras going from the Vallende algebra to the Linus E2 structure. This is a strong simplification. This situation is a bit more subtle. You have two versions of the result for chains and co-chains, and they behave differently. So the correct statement is really you have here the signal. Here, the cyclic delinear conjecture, which needs a Calabiot structure, and we're saying the Calabiat structure that you have to look at here is the one coming from the modified trace in the tensor ideal of projectives. And yeah, with this, you have a chain and co-chain version of this result. And one key ingredient here is that is the so-called trace field theory. So-called trace field theory. So, what one has to do is that one takes the Nakayama functor of this category, trivializes it relative to a pivotal structure. All these notions is something that we can handle thanks to the work of Fuchs, Schweigard and Scharman. And this gives you a colour BR structure by work of Costello. This is an open-closed topological conformal field theory. Let's call this the trace field theory. The trace field theory. And then the crucial thing is that this turns out to be the modified trace. And then this allows you to do computations with the modified trace and the E2 structure coming from the cyclic delinear conjecture on the Hochschild complex. So yeah, it really is not a topological application of the modified trace in the sense of three manifold invariants, but it sees really the modified trace. Really, the modified trace itself as a topological structure. And that turns out to be kind of helpful. And then, yeah, so let's summarize this again. So, the S matrix maps this Verlinda algebra to the linear C2 structure. The right-hand side depends only on the linear structure and maybe some trace information. This is exactly what the traditional Verlinde formula was about. And yeah, it reduces in the semi-simple case also to the Verlinde formula, but in the non-semi-simple case, it rather amounts to a block diagonalization as opposed to diagonalization. And one nice feature is that this quantum dimension that appeared here, this is in a sense automatically replaced with the dimensions coming from the modified trace. That's a nice. From the modified trace, that's a nice feature. And if you do this in the code chain version and take the zeros quote model channel, then this gives you a generalization of the linear version of the Willinde formula that Azada and Ingo have given. But yeah, generally, this is about E2 structures, so there can be non-trivial brackets. So this is a richer structure. And we have looked at some relatively easy. And we have looked at some relatively easy examples to see that there are actually cases where it's non-zero. However, we cannot compute it really safe for a small quantum group. I don't think that this would be interesting, but this seems to be kind of difficult. Yeah, so yeah, that concludes this short overview. So you're saying that you can't even illustrate it in a simple example, this formula? Because my question would have been, oh, I wish you could illustrate it in, for example, the triplet or the small quantum group. You are well in the formula. Yeah, so I mean, the good thing is that in order to see that. Good thing is that in order to see that the brackets involved here, I mean, if you want to see that they are non-trivial, since they are exchanged through this isomorphism, it suffices if you can say something about one of them. And then in order to at least see that something is non-zero, what you can do is that you look at Drunfeld doubles and then you can look at the Gas Nava bracket for group algebras. Group algebra. For a small quantum group, or the other examples that you mentioned, I'm not entirely sure whether this is known. So there is an article by Anna Lachovska, where she gives the Hochet cohomology of this small quantum group as an algebra, but not as a Gas Nava algebra. But not a segregation of algebra. And I'm yeah. So that would essentially at least give you the G-Valinde algebra for the smaller quantum group as graded as a graded. Graded as a graded algebra, not as Gastnhaba algebra, but at least the product and so on and so forth. You would, the only thing that you, I mean, this thing would essentially tell you you should conjugate it with the S matrix, where of course this is so in maybe not so super easy. So, maybe with regard to the example, because this was asked, I would have liked to play the question back to Tudor after seeing this nice talk. So, thanks, Lucas, of course. This is great. And Tudor, it was very interesting what you said, because, of course, one would expect that at some point at some other place. One would expect that at some point at some other place this also pops up. So, when you play a little bit around with the Hochschule cohomology, we did some calculations, not finished yet, but what you find is, as in other examples, you want to see everything as a module over the X11, of course, right? So it's not interesting that there is many, many copies that you get from acting with X11, but you have very few generators. And for the quantum group UQSL2, you have one generator in degree zero, one family of generators in degree zero, which the One family of generators in degree zero, which is the one you know. And then you have new ones in degree one. That's what comes out if you do this concretely. And those come basically from a punctured torus, but there is something in the principal block glued in. And this, of course, sort of you can go with X of these guys, and then you get stuff in the non-puncture torus in higher cohomology. So my question would have been in your approach to the whole thing. Do you see that? I mean, do you see in UQSL2 that you want to know the structure of That you want to know the structure of this as a X11 module? So X1L of the torus, no, as a structure of X11. And do you see that there is sort of the second generator in degree one that is sort of new and comes from a punctured torus with something in the principal block? The immediate answer is no. Your statement about getting this as an X11 module completely makes sense. I'm just restating that's bulk local operators acting on the state space of the Taurus. Translating that to a punctured torus conformal block is not obvious to me. I think Thomas has said various similar things about needing to look at corresponding functions. May I say something? Please. So if you just play around with Verlinda's formula, in the sense as also Azad and Ingo mentioned it, just by looking at Topo's one-point functions characters of the VOA, what you notice is you get these. You get these quasi-characters. And the idea is that this means you get these modular functions that don't come from characters and the ideas that they come from Torus one-point functions on projective modules. So I think from the VOA point of view, Simon, what you say makes a lot of sense. Yeah. It's somehow what you have these projective modules, and you would somehow like to measure the new potent action of the VRS over zero mode. So you act an operator, a vertex operator when you trace that undoes this nilport action so that you can measure it in a one-point function. And this seems to give. And this seems to give these pseudo-traces that appear under modular transformations. So that sounds related to what you say, Ziman. Yeah, but I think there's a lot of concrete understanding missing in this respect, right? There's a lot missing here. I mean, of course, the starting point of what you're saying, that's a pretty simple idea. I mean, we can know we know that in conformal blocks. We know that in conformal blocks you can always insert a vacuum for free. And then you should be able in a derived world to insert in a sense the good replacement of the monoidal unit for free. And the good replacement of the monoidal unit is its projective resolution. So that makes a lot of sense. And that's also how we started originally. Started originally to construct these derived conformal blocks at the level of just cohomology, not as complexes. But to see that these are really the pseudo-characters as they have been discussed in the vertex algebra literature. I think there are lots of steps missing. Totally correct. This was just Totally correct. This was just the hope what I was saying. Yeah. And I mean, Shimitsu tried to set up and find at least the pseudo-characters in a first step in a categorical setting. And it's completely unclear how you could push this to higher degrees. But definitely, this should be related. And I mean, one observation of Simon Lentna. Observation of Simon Lentna, I like very much, is precisely that already for Trinfeld doubles of finite groups, they have to be non-abelian. And in order to make them non-semi-simple, let's go to a field of finite characteristic. You see that the representations in higher degree are substantially different from the ones in lower in degree zero. Maybe you want to say something to. Maybe you want to say something to this if Simone is still around. Sure, sure. Yes, so of course, the point in this toy cases, I mean, of course, this is work together with Jorg and Christoph. These toy cases with finite groups and finite characteristics basically behave like quantum groups. They're just easy to work with. So again, what happens is the following. So when you are, so what you can do is you can So, what you can do is you can start, and that's not exactly the same thing as a pseudo-character. That's, I think, what Christophe means. You start with a in degree zero with a punctured torus. And in the puncture, you put some irreducible module in the principal block. Let's call it x. Then there is non-trivial extensions between 1 and x. And now, what you can do is you can take the cup product, so a cylinder, a cup product in higher degree between 1 and x. Degree between one and x and cup it to the torus in degree zero with x as puncture. Right, so that's the picture in mind. You have a torus with puncture x, and you have a cylinder in higher collogical degree with one and x on its boundaries. And that you glue together, a cup product, and then you get stuff in the higher totals with one. So somehow the construction collects, and I have not found counterexamples, but probably there is, but some of all the examples I know, the construction. All the examples I know, the construction collects sort of all toros which are punctured by stuff in the principal block, and they are sort of merged together to stuff in higher degree. And we can see that, for example, a typical effect I cannot explain is if you compute the Dirichlet characters, they are typically non-trivial in these other generators, but they are in the examples I know mostly trivial in degree zero. So there's some reasons why they're not, but sort of basically they are. So you typically get SL2Z representations with non-trivial delta. To Z representations with non-trivial Delicate character. And that also comes from this construction somehow. So that's what we see in the examples. And so that's not finished, but I would very much think that we see this in this mapping class groups in the quantum group as well. It's just much more complicated to compute. Also, because those are quasi-Hof algebras, right? Not Hoff algebras. That picture makes a lot of sense. Thanks. So, are there further questions or comments on this circle of questions? Well, maybe one last comment. Well, maybe one last comment. I mean, the exactness of the tensor product, which comes from rigidity, that's of course very heavily used throughout this work, all over. And so it's not directly clear how to extend these structures or how these structures extend if you go to a setting where the tensor product is not exact anymore. But clearly, non-exact tensor products. Clearly, non-exact tensor products are physical. Yeah, so even if we understand all this very well one day, including examples, then non-exact tensor products will be a completely different level of challenge. So there will be enough stuff for our next workshop, I guess. So so maybe if no one else does, I have a very small other question, basically just restating one that Christoph asked already. So people talk about derived conformal blocks, and I know that this should be somehow there, but I've not seen definitions of that. So I was wondering whether this is something to do with chiral homology. I mean, that's maybe. Something to do with chiral homology. I mean, that's maybe what you would think, right? And I've tried at some point to calculate this very explicitly. So for SL2, you get the Vidasoro algebra. I mean, you get really this Gelfand-Fuchs co-homology of the Vidasoro algebra on some surfaces. Or so you can compute this three-close cycle and so on. Are these three things the same? So do you mean that when you say derived conformal blocks? I certainly had chiral homology in mind, and I don't know how to compute anything. So it was actually very exciting. anything so it was actually very excited that um that you guys do seem to uh to have worked out more hands-on ways of like adding decorations and throwing in projective um resolutions and so on and getting something sensible um but yes um see clear and collaborators i think have some recent papers where they Have some recent papers where they took Balins and Drunfeld's definition and actually made it a little more explicit and usable, but it's still hard to do computations. Dimon, I do not need to remind you of the fact that one of the chapter headings in our paper has that very title. Yeah, Derived Conformal Blaze. Derived conformal laws. Yes, yes. Maybe I would like to ask a question to the vertex algebra people here in the audience. There was a paper earlier this year by van Eckerfen and Iluani about the first chirohomology group, where they studied also derived structures in the case of conformal blocks on the torus. Taurus. To me, the precise relations between the ideas we are discussing here and their work is not clear. But it would be very exciting to understand this in more detail. So let me just ask whether anybody here has some ideas or some insights in this respect. So at least it seems that I'm not the only one who doesn't have. I'm not the only one who doesn't have too much concrete insight about it. I mean, the only thing I can say about that paper, of course, after what I said, I read a little bit, and I asked also Jethro. So what they basically do is compute the first cohomology, supposing that some higher stuff is zero. So you get basically something from the Jew algebra, suppose that sort of higher things are not there. So I'm not sure if in general you get the Jew algebra. And what I would think is that sort of one direction is a little bit clear. Is a little bit clear. I mean, if you have extensions, then you can write down stuff in the chiral cohomology, but I'm not sure about the other way around. So somehow one direction seems a little, but this is very, very superficial. So one direction seems to be like doable and the other one I have no clue about, I ask them. But it should be, of course, the same. You would expect this, but I have not found anybody who can confirm this also. I have actually a similar question, mostly probably to Tudor and Du. So in Brasansky-Witten theory, of course, we see derived from the start. So that's basic reason to expect that we should have something derived. But do you see connection between derived category of current sheaves as you guys described in both of your talks and or modifications and derived formal blocks? Uh, derived formal blocks the way they come out from chiral homology or something similar. Um I wouldn't expect one quite like that. Um so um if if you're in um chiral homology is the chiral algorithm. The chiral algebra version of taking Hochschild cohomology and a two-dimensional theory. Let me just interrupt that a little. So if you have a 2D TQFT with a big enough boundary condition, you would want to say that the derived center of the boundary operator algebra is equivalent to the bulk algebra. In particular, if you have a generator for your category of boundary conditions, there's an associative algebra on the boundary, and the center of that, the derived center of that, should be bulk local operators. This, so chiral homology, in my understanding, is sort of doing the same thing, where you have a boundary for a 3D theory. Boundary for a 3D theory that is holomorphic and has a vertex algebra living on it. And then you're roughly taking some derived center of this vertex algebra to produce bulk states. It's a, sorry, you're taking some derived co-center to produce bulk states. I think that's the same derived role played by the Rosansky Witten type derived category. But no, I mean that, sorry, like the sheaves there don't know anything about a chiral algebra or a holomorphic boundary. Yeah, that of course depends on my sorry, that's the distinction I would make. Right, right. Oh, but I'm asking about the role of derived. So of course, I understand that boundary condition is not there. No, no. Conditional one there. No, no, otherwise, like it's clearly the same differential. It's the supercharge that's that's acting everywhere. Exactly. That's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, it's that same supercharge acting on boundary stuff. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. So, in that sense, the origin is exactly. So in that sense, the origin is exactly the same, and the reason you would expect it is the same. I think so. It sounds from what I understand from Shee Lee's talks, but I think it's also related to this paper of Karen and Halawani. When you're building a Hochschild complex physically, you play with descendants. Like, play with descendants and start. Sorry, so I think the picture for generating states is a little different and maybe better. So if you have a 2D theory on a cylinder with a circle boundary, you would generate states by integrating descendants of boundary local operators around that circle at the boundary. That's where the Hochscho tomology classes come from. And in the chiral world, I think you do something very similar. You do something very similar, but you're playing with this boundary vertex algebra and have some sort of descendants that are being integrated over the boundary. Yeah, I can't say it better because I don't understand it better, but I get the feeling that it's just the natural extension of that idea. I would want it to be identical to everyone else's notions of derived control blocks. Tudor, can I ask you a very naive question? Because I'm not so familiar with this notion of topological descendants. So you are getting observables which are n-forms in general, right? Yes. Yes, so they want to be evaluated on n cycles, right? And the Huschel complexes we have, they are non-trivial in any degree. They are not bounded by no means. Yeah? Yes. So how can I evaluate in a physical linear way? Unsymmetric products of you have multiple operators, and so you have arbitrary symmetric products, you have a configuration space of points. Okay, so that's how you are getting the dimension that's big enough, right? Yes. And the reason their descendants is, at least in this context, is that the boundary theory is only holomorphic up to exact things. Exact things. So there's actually some complex that is telling you why the boundary theory is holomorphic. And one can use that to build descendants. And get actual, so you can wedge with DZ automatically, and the DZ bar comes from descent. Okay, and so to really see the descent at work, you have See the sentence at work, you have to look at endpoint configurations then. Yes. Okay. And then there's some complex analysis to do, which is what I learned from C. There's some, yeah, there's, you have to regularize some integrals carefully, which I think hadn't been properly. I think hadn't been properly spelled out before. So, for the questions or comments that are still on your minds here and around. Here in the round. Reynard has a comment or a question. Yeah, maybe this is a little bit off topic, but Christophe, you mentioned rigidity. So my question may be too naive. So rigidity for me means a finite dimensionality. Dimensionality. So the categories we are discussing here, linear categories, the underlying objects are vector spaces. And rigidity, I think, means finite dimensionality of those vector spaces. So other examples may be in the context of vertex operator algebras where you have rigidity without finite dimensionality. Immunisability well let me try to understand the question because obviously a vertex algebra per C is an infinite dimensional object and that wasn't your question right but when people speak about the tensor categories with rigidity yes my Yes. My intuition is that usually all these categories are based one way or another on vector spaces. Usually some vector space with additional structure, like module structure with respect to some algebra. But essential thing that you on the first place, you have a vector space. Yes. So my question. So can one have a monoidal category maybe braided? It would be ideal to have braided where objects are not finite dimensional in any sense, but the category is rigid. At least I couldn't come up at this time of the day immediately with an example. I think I would agree that rigidity is a finiteness property, right? And I would also, let me phrase it in a provocative way. I mean, in a sense, having rigidity in representation categories of vertex algebras is Of vertex algebras is completely unreasonable. A priori, you wouldn't expect it. And the fact that you find it in some well-known categories, like for example, integrable representations of F and D algebras at integer levels. This is a big surprise. And in Huang's proof of the Felinde formula, proving rigidity is the most non-trivial part. Yeah, so in a sense, it's maybe it's in the spirit of your question to say that it's kind of very unreasonable that this a priori infinite system from loop groups in the end realizes for a rational CFT a duality structure that is essentially obtained by abstracting what we see on finite-dimensional vector spaces. Yeah, yeah, but through. Vector spaces. Yeah, yeah, but through the connection with quantum groups, it ends up in finite-dimensional quantum group representations, right? Yes, but look, the story with quantum groups is a bit misleading in my opinion, because if you go to quantum groupoids or HOFL JPOEDs, which are not terribly different, and you can show that the representation The representation category of a Hopf L J pro, it is typically not rigid. Yeah, it has still this type of duality structure that's called codent equity structure that we have seen in Simon Wood's talk. And that's a result essentially that can be obtained by using some 20 years old results of Ross Street. So already, if you, I mean, in the quantum group case, you have this specific. Quantum group case: you have this specific thing that you not have more than a tensor category, you have a fiber functor to vector spaces. As soon as you give up having the fiber functor to vector spaces, which is tying this whole algebraic structure closely to what you have for vector spaces, then also rigidity is, in a sense, naturally gone. Yeah. Yeah, but I. Yeah, yeah, but I have one example of rigid monoidal categories, but they are not braided. So I need a braided and rigid. But non-braided, rigid category could be you pick up a category and the category of monodal category of endophanctors. And then if an endofunctor admits left adjoint, then you Then you have a rigid object, this functor, right? Because you have these exact properties of duality and coduality. Yes. But I don't know examples of end functors which are braided. Otherwise, they behave like finite dimensional vector spaces. I mean, of course, you could take the Trinfeld center of your category. Take the Trinfeld center of your category if you insist on a braiding. And is it rigid? Well, let me be careful. At least if you are working with a finite category that is rigid. But finite means finite dimensional, I would say. Yeah, okay, yeah. Then I know that the Trinel Center is rigid. I would. I wouldn't commit to say that this is necessary, holding in a more general framework, but maybe that's an interesting point to see whether if you take the Trinfeld center, rigidity persists or whether there's anything in your example that where things with rigidity go wrong. But I'm not the most competent person in this round to comment on this, but example of rigid categories with underlying vector spaces are not finite-dimensional. Lying vector spaces are not finite-dimensional. You would find in these axiomatic quantum field theory settings Deployah-Roberts in these categories there and underlying that the spaces are infinite dimensional. These are C-star representations of C-star algebras. I see. But certainly more people here who know this better than I do. Yes, and maybe. Maybe, if you want to go to a related framework, which is more closely accessible, maybe people working on star quantum groups would know examples. This is a type of literature I don't know very well, but there's a lot of deep and very solid mathematical work in this field. So, star quantum groups are just hof algebras with some involution or what? some involution or what yeah with some involution and an involution in the sense of um as you have it on a c star algebra so that's why um but algebraically they are just hoof algebras right or something slightly different i'm yeah but not finite dimensional hoop algebras sorry not finite dimensional no no it's okay but i'll No, no, it's okay, but algebraically we have billions of yeah.
