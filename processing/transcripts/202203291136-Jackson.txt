We have Steve Dexter talking about continuous predators and actions. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I thank the organizers for inviting me to this nice conference. And not only is the conference very nice, but the setting is very beautiful too. So can't ask for more, right? Okay, so I'm going to talk about this. This is a topic in sort of continuous dynamics, but very much related to descriptive set theory and actually related to set theory more generally, as we'll see. That's kind of the connection. That's kind of the connection here. So the question sounds a little technical at first, but it's the proof and the techniques that I think are what I'd like to sort of introduce here, because there's a new sort of proof here that's combining some techniques which individually have been sort of used in recent years, but the combination of using a, to use the technical terms, a hyper apiardicity argument and a forcing argument are sort of different that I'll use here. So we'll use it to prove a theorem that. So, we use it to prove a theorem that I don't know how to prove any other way. It seems like kind of a new technique to do it. So, first, let me just say that these techniques that I'm talking about these individual techniques were joint things that have been developed over recent years with co-authors. So, some methods of Tony, do you have to see the board online? So, because maybe the switch has a prevalent. Oh, because the maybe the switch has a credit here. Oh, okay. Sorry. It's going to be like five minutes to switch. Did we start the recording over there? No, yes, it's starting here, but recorders. Yeah, things are set correctly here. Can read what's can read. I'm on my way, I will uh change the settings. No, no, it's a can read of anything. No, no. Believe me. Tell me tell me what it becomes useful. Um we've been through this and they've been trained. Okay. So I'm new. Are they doing it? They're doing it. So let's wait. Yeah, okay. This doesn't count in the thirty minutes.   Expand 30 minutes quite quite a lot of resets.     We're still recording, we're turning off the recording.
