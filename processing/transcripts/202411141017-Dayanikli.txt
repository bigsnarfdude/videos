On my session work with me, and I'm closing it with a work with him. So, yeah. So, our motivation was related to an economics notion, basically tragedy of the commons. Tragedy of the commons basically states that the short-sighted overconsumption of common pool resources may lead to long-term detrimental results. For example, fishers can fish the feedstocks too quickly, and at the end, the fish stocks. And at the end, the fish stock may die, and they don't have any other fish to basically fish at the end, and they are not going to have any revenues. But in real life, what we observe is that this case is not happening, and there might be different reasons why this may not be happening. For example, there can be some governing laws, or according to Eleanor Ostrom, who actually she won a Nobel Prize regarding this project, that actually the individualistic effort. But actually, the individualistic efforts of the agents may prevent this thing. So, our motivation is basically to put this possible altruism of individuals in the large population games. So, before going into how we can model this, I want to briefly talk about main field game and main field control. Thankfully, Matthew talked about main field game already, so I'll be quick here for the sake of time. So, I want to first talk about the similarities. In the mid-field game part, basically, in the main field game. Game part basically in the mainfield game and control, we are going to look at the infinitely many players, which we assume that they are identical, infinitesimal, and interact symmetrically. They are going to interact through some mean-field interactions, and in this way, basically, we can focus on the representative agent and this agent's interaction with the population distribution. So, both for the game and the control setup, these assumptions are true, but for the game and the control, there is an important difference. There is an important difference. For the game, we are going to assume that the agents are fully non-cooperative and they are looking for a nash equilibrium. In the control setup, we are going to assume the agents are fully cooperative and they are looking for a social optimum. So, what we want to do is somehow we want to combine these two models. So, before going into the details, I want to talk about the mathematical modeling of these two things because we are going to build on these mathematical notions. So, for the mean field game, what happens for So, for the main field game, what happens for the representative player is that the representative player sees the distribution of the population exogenously. So, this mu t is going to be taken exogenously to find the best response, then we need to find the fixed point to basically find the niche equilibrium. On the other hand, for the mean field control, as you see, this distribution is going to be seen as the basically function of the control of the representative player because these people are cooperating. These people are cooperating and they are thinking if I deviate, other people deviate too. So they are seeing their effect on the population distribution. So, this is the main difference in terms of mathematical modeling. And both of these models may not be very good, basically, models to incorporate some kind of interactions through common pool resources. And the question is: why? If you look at the mean field game case, what's going to happen is that the agents are insignificant. To happen is that the agents are insignificant, they don't see their effect on the aggregate. So, at the end, they are going to overuse the resources, and the tragedy of the commons is inevitable. In the main field control case, on the other hand, we assume that agents are fully authoristic or the decisions are prescribed by an outside regulator, a central planner. And this is not a very good representation of the human nature. So, instead, we want to look at a mixture of these models. Either the altruism is within the individual. Is within the individuals, or some people in the population are fully altruistic and some are not altruistic. So, I put some of the related literature here. For the sake of the time, I'm going to skip them, but please let me know if you have any questions later on. In today's talk, I'm going to talk about work in progress. So, for now, we don't have the draft online. We are hoping to have it in the coming months. So, the two population setups we are going to The two top population setups we are going to consider is going to be called mixed individual mean field models and mixed population mean field models. For the mixed individual, we are going to assume that every person has some kind of altruistic tendency and non-cooperative tendency. And for the mixed population case, we are going to assume that some people are basically fully selfish and some people are fully cooperative. So I'm going to start with the mixed individual models. In this ones, what we want to do is that we In this once, what we want to do is that we want to model homogeneous agents, and each agent is going to see the year-on individual effect on top of the population effect. So, mathematically, this is going to happen as follows. In the model of the representative layer, they are going to have the population distribution that I denote with mu T, and also they are going to have the distribution of the year on sitate as I denote with mu T alpha. So, this can be understood as like they see the population effect and also. The population affects, and also they see that they are affecting the aggregates, they have an impact on the, for example, environment. And this is basically going to be a dynamic problem, and we are going to have some state dynamics. The derived is also going to take into account this muti and muti alpha separately as inputs. So, then the mean field, the mixed individual mean field, equilibrium can be defined. Minfield-Nash equilibrium can be defined very similarly to the mean-field-Nash equilibrium. The players are going to find the best response given the population distribution, but then at the end we need to find the fixed point condition since everyone is homogeneous. The difference from the mean field Nash equilibrium is that in the first step when we fix the population distribution, the best response of the player is found by a stochastic optimal control problem. Instead, in this model, it is going to be a minfield control problem. To be a mean field control problem. So then we can write a Hamiltonian as we usually write in this type of problems, and we can introduce the characterization of the mixed individual mean field-Nash equilibrium by using forward-backward stochastic differential equations. So these forward-backward stochastic differential equations are going to have some parts related to the mean field MM field control FBSDs, and also they are going to have a part that is similar to the mean field control FBSDs. Field control FBSDs, and this part is coming from the fact that the individuals see their effect on the also the dynamics and the cost, etc. Then our theorem here is that we give an approximation result. We say that the mixed individual mean field Nash equilibrium is an epsilon Nash equilibrium for the finite Polyer model. And we also look for a special case where we assume that everyone has a constant and same altri. And same altruism level, 1 minus lambda, that is between 0 and 1. Then we say that the mean field interactions are in the form of a convex combination. And in terms of intuition, then we can say that the people are 1 minus lambda level altruistic, so they combine it with their own effect on the population distribution. And we say that they are lambda level selfish, so they don't see the year effect and they take the population distribution as exactly. They take the population distribution as exogenous. Then, how can we include the common pool resources to these problems? We are going to model the common pool resources with an ODE. It is going to have a replenishment and a decay part. And this is going to be the perceived dynamics by this partially altruistic person. So they are going to see that the population has an effect on the decay, and they are going to see also their individual effect on this decay. Then we can basically write the model by including this. Write the model by including this thing. One thing is that we didn't include for now noise for this common pool resource, but if you want to include the noise, it should behave as a common noise because this is going to be a shared state. Then if we extend our state to XT and KT combination, the same technical analysis is going to apply. After this, we can also introduce another type of altruism modeling, which is going to be called mixed population mean field model. Be called mixed population mean field models. In this one, as I said, I'm going to look at fully non-cooperative and fully cooperative people in the same population. So now we don't have homogeneous people. Instead, we need to focus on two representative players, one representative for the non-cooperative and one representative for the cooperative. For these two types of representative agents, we need to introduce the cost function that has the running cost, terminal cost, and the state. Running cost, terminal cost, and the state dynamics. And for the cooperative agents, we need to do the same thing. The difference is that the cooperative agents are going to be seeing their effect on the system directly, but the non-cooperative agents are going to be taking these population effects exogenously. So basically, best response of the non-cooperative agent is going to be found by taking the population distributions exogenous. On the other hand, for the cooperative ones, the cooperative population. Cooperative ones, the cooperative population distribution is going to be endogenous. Then we can basically call an equilibrium mixed population mean field equilibrium if three conditions are set. The first two conditions are related to the fact that the non-cooperative agents are finding a Nash equilibrium given the cooperative agents' population distribution. And the last one is related to the fact that the cooperative agents are settling in a mini Agents are settling in a mean field control optimum given the non-cooperative agents distribution. So, here I put some theorem regarding the characterization of the equilibrium. Basically, we can again use forward-backward stochastic differential equations. We need to have two forward equations for the states of the non-cooperative and cooperative agents, and we need to have two backward equations to basically characterize the derivative of the value functions of the non-cooperative. Derivative of the value functions of the non-cooperative and cooperative agents. So now the dimension of the FBSD system is larger than the mixed individual one. And now we show an approximate equilibrium result here, but we need to be careful because for the cooperative people, we are going to be showing an approximate optimal result. And for the non-cooperative ones, we need to show an approximate equilibrium result. And we also look at a special case where we say that a Case where we say that a constant p-proportion of the population is non-cooperative and the remaining is cooperative, and then they are interacting through the combination of the distributions. In this case, we can add the common pool resources as follows. The important thing here is that actually the non-cooperative and cooperative agents are going to observe different perceived dynamics for these common pool resources because the non-cooperative agents are. Because the non-cooperative agents are not going to see the effect and they are going to put these population distributions exogenously to the ODs. However, cooperative agents are going to see their own effect on this decay, so they are going to observe different dynamics. However, at the equilibrium, these two things are going to be equal to each other, and because of that, actually, these two differential equations, these two dynamics, are going to be the same. So, this wasn't very clear to me. This wasn't very clear to us at first because this is a common poor resource. We thought that they should have the same dynamics, but then the intuition is not very clear because we are saying the cooperative agents see the ear effect, the others they don't see the effect. So in the modeling, they should have different models, but at the equilibrium, actually, they are going to end up with only one common pool resource dynamics. So here is our motivating example. We are modeling the fishers and the fish stock as the common poorer resource. Fissures and the fish stock as the common pool resource. We are going to look at the spatial cases for both mixed individual and mixed population. And for the mixed individual, we are saying that the fisher has the altruism level 1 minus lambda. So for the state, we have the fishing effort, for the control, it is the change in the fishing effort, and common pool resource is the fish stock level. Then we can basically introduce the dynamics for the states, the individual state, and the common pool resource. We have a logistic growth and a dec. We have a logistic growth and a decay, and as you see in the decay, the individual sees the year-on effect on the decay and also the population effect. And we have a cost that has, for example, the fishing revenue and the high effort cost type of terms here. So then we can characterize the mixed individual Nash equilibrium with a forbid-backward stochastic differential equations and we show the existence uniqueness results. Results. The important thing is in the results, when we look at the numerics, we can see that when the altruism increases, when the color is darker, the phishing effort is going to be lower and the fish sutoc levels, as you see here, are going to be higher over time. So they are going to be phishing less if they have more altruism. This is expected. And the next one is the mixed population model. In this one, basically, we have a large population of people, the fishers. Of people of the fissures and the P proportion is non-cooperative, and the remaining is the cooperative fissures. And in this case, we need to give the models for both the cooperative and non-cooperative people. As I said, for the cooperative, they see their effect on the system. For the non-cooperative, they don't see. So after introducing a similar model, we introduced a mixed individual. We can give the FBSD. Sorry, these equations are looking very, very heavy, but important thing I wanted to show. But the important thing I wanted to show here is that at the end, for the common pool resource, we are only going to have one dynamics. We are not going to have different dynamics for the non-cooperative and cooperative agents because it is a common state. And then, if you look at the numerical results, if we check the mixed population one, we are going to see that for this one, for example, or this one, this is the change in the effort, and this is the phishing effort. This is the phishing effort. The dashed ones are for the cooperative people, and the solid ones are for the non-cooperative people. We see that cooperative agents are phishing less to protect the feedstock levels. In this case, non-cooperative agents enjoy free riding. And as a proportion of cooperative agents increases, we are also saying the feedstock levels are higher. And the final numerics that I'm going to show here is the comparison between the mixed individual and mixed population. Here, the dashed 2 ones are. Here, the dashed ones are for the mixed population version, and the solid ones are the mixed individual version, where everyone is partially altruistic. So, when we look at these two models, we see that at the same level of lambda and p, the fish stock level is lower and the fishing efforts are higher in the mixed population case. So, this tells us it is better to have everyone with some altruistic tendencies instead of having a mixture of fully cooperative and fully non-cooperative agents. Fully non-cooperative agents, because in the latter case, actually, non-cooperative people are enjoying free riding behavior. So, here I conclude. Basically, I introduced some new equilibrium notions for the mean field models where we introduced the altruism and common pool resources, and we gave some theoretical analysis and numerical results. And if you have any questions, I'm very happy to answer. Thank you. Thank you very much, Gerce. So we still have two minutes for questions.
