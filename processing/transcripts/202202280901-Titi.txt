All right, fine. So, Idris, the floor is yours. Please go ahead. I'll warn you after 20 minutes by raising my hand. Well, I hope I can see your hand. Maybe just speak. I mean, I'm happy with that. I mean, if you say just alert me after 20 minutes, I have 20. How much I have? 30 minutes, yeah? 30 minutes, including questions. So, okay, very good. All right. Well, again, I would like to thank the organizers for. Thank the organizers for inviting me. And I'm going to talk about something more on the conceptual issue concerning turbulence rather than about like particular problem about like boundary layer or something like that. So it is more about issues with the theory of turbulence and mainly about something more conceptual. So and the title is determining Is determining global dynamics of, say, the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes, and maybe for other equations as well, by scalar ODE, which is something a little bit strange. We discovered it by accident. And let me give you the background. As we know, that in conventional theory of turbulence, that you feed the energy at larger scales, when then the energy is cascading into smaller, smaller scales until they get into the very fine scale where energy is dissipated. Where energy is dissipated. And therefore, the number of degrees of freedom in turbulence, at least the conventional theory of turbulence, asserts that they are in three dimensions the largest scale L divided by the dissipation scale cube. In two dimensions, something similar. So here is the Navier-Stokes equation. And if you think about it in periodic boundary condition with period L and there is a bifurcation parameter or the non-dimensional parameter, the analog of Fremont's number, it is the Of Freyl's number. It is the L to norm of the forcing divided by the viscosity square times L square. L square here is basically the size of the box. So the Gracian number very large. You can think about the Gracian number as Lacrano's number square. So what is known about this picture, namely about the degrees of freedom in turbulent flows, at least in two dimensions, because from the point of view of dynamical systems, in order to talk about degrees of freedom. In order to talk about degrees of freedom and to make sense of this picture, I need to have global existence and uniqueness for a long time. And since in three dimensions, this is still out of reach, so I'm focusing on the two dimensions, which is classical theory. I'm going to talk about a lot of classical results, but at the end, I'm going to mention some new results. So to, in some sense, to make sense of these kind of like finite degrees of freedom, the first work in this direction, at least, was the seminal work of Foyash and Prodi from 1969. Prodi from 1969 about determining modes. So he says the following: Suppose Hm is the span of the first M, the first M eigenfunctions of the Stokes operator. So these are the eigenfunctions of the Stokes operator ordered based on the eigenvalue. And now Hm is the first eigenfunction. Suppose like Pm is the projection of the space of L2 divergence functions into here, into the first. into the first into the first eigenfunction so this is this is maybe i should make it large so it will be here so the orthogonal projections on the on the first fourier modes then the result is that there exists a number m depending rational number or depends on reynolds number such that if you and v are any two solutions of the navigation stock satisfying the fact that the fourier modes the first and Fourier modes of U and V are asymptotic Of u and v are asymptotically in time coinciding. So at t goes to infinity, they go to zero. This implies if m is larger than this m star, which is explicitly can be given in terms of g, implies u minus v goes to zero, which means that if the low Fourier modes, or if you like, is the largest scales of the two solutions coincide asymptotically in time, the final scales will follow suit. The best estimate and The best estimate, I mean, on the number M0 here, this of Grashov. It has been done part of the thesis of my student a long time ago. M of G is like Grashov number. Now, this is nice. One can really move on. And Foyash and Timam introduce another concept, which is the concept of determining nodes. Namely, if this is my word, I divide it into countries. And for every country, I send a reporter. So, this reporter is measuring the velocity and the temperature, whatever. So, here is the domain, the word I divide into countries. And I'm assuming that the country has size less than some number H star. And the idea is I need to find something about H star. So what's the statement? The statement that if U and V are still two solutions of Navier stokes which coincide at these nodal values, not at every moment, but asymptotically in time, for all of them. For all of them, then the difference between the solutions goes to zero everywhere. In other words, observations of the solution at points, enough of them, but I have to resolve at the size of the country. That's why you need the diameter of the domain to be small enough. This determines the solution in a unique fashion. And again, the number of nodes needed is ordered Grashio. Nodes needed is order gratio, but again, I would like to stress that we are not talking about the number. I cannot take one country and put all the points here. This does not help me. I have to spread, in some sense, the reporters all over the place. So, this is the notion of determining nodes. This means that the largest scales determine the solution in a unique fashion. Then, there was a general point of view about, so this is basically, there is another sorry, let me go back here. There is another sorry, let me go back here. Then we start talking about: ah, you know, determining modes is like spectral method in numerical analysis. Determining nodes is like finite difference in numerical analysis. Maybe one can talk about general point of view, like finite elements, projection of finite elements, etc. So suppose IH is an interpolant operator, namely for any function in a space of sub H1. function in space sober h1 into l2 or it is from h2 into l2 such that it's an approximate of the identity for example if you take the nodal values of the function phi and multiply by the characteristic function other words ih of phi is approximation of phi by step functions certainly such an operator satisfying this kind of like property now in other words Now, in other words, H is tells you the resolution of the observation. So suppose I know, this is the general result: if H star, the exists H star depends on Grashov number, such that if the dynamics of the first solution and of the second solution at the larger scales coincide as t goes to infinity, u minus v is going to zero. This is the general framework. In other words, it basically. In other words, it basically tells you in two dimensions: if I know, if I can resolve at the largest scales, then the solutions are determined in a unique fashion. Now, of course, a long time ago, there was a result of Konstantin and Foyash consistent with this, which is basically tells you that, oh, the dimension of the attractor, the long dynamics, is finite dimensional. But here we are specific because we're talking about measurements, not just about the attractor in its generality. Attractor in histogram. Now, inspired by this work, there was an attempt in the 80s in order to basically restrict the Navier stocks because it has finite dimensional attractor to show that it is dynamically equivalent to an ODE. Namely, can one really, if I decompose the solution into the low Fourier modes, like the larger scales, and the high Fourier modes, which is the finer scale? Fourier modes, which is the finest scales. Since I have some evidence that the finest scales are following the large scales, can we find really a law, a closure, if you want, moment by moment in which the high frequencies are following the dynamics of the low frequencies moment by moment. And this is what's called the inertial manifold. Namely, for every P, there is a Q. For every P, there is a Q for every P. For every p, there is a q for every p, there is a q, and of course, if such a law exists, then I can really project my navier stocks onto the law Fourier modes and I get an ODE because I would like this function, if it exists, to be nice and smooth. Now, unfortunately, this program did not work. In other words, in order to guarantee the existence of an inertial manifold, you needed some larger spectrum or spectral gap in the gap in the in the in the stocks operator in other words you need separation of scales and we know in in in turbulence we don't have this thing so it was an attempt and for many equations you have inertial manifold but not for the navigable stocks equation okay now let me summarize what i have shown to you at the moment is that the history of the projection of the exact solution on the law for remotes or the history Four remotes, or the history of the largest scales determine the solution in a unique fashion. This is a nice, beautiful mathematical result. The question, how can I use it? In particular, there is some noise. Somebody has some noise in the background. Can I please ask the people to mute themselves? I'm sorry, I'm disturbed. It's the room mics in at Burrs. One second. One second. Thank you very much. Yeah. So the question then becomes: can we design an algorithm? And this is basically the key point. Can I design an algorithm which allows me which allows me to recover you from the PM or from the history of PM, not moment by moment, but from the history or I from the history of the largest cases. Now, one application that Now, one application that we have in mind is that assimilation. If this is the globe and I have weather stations collecting information at the coarse scales, can I use this information to recover the solution? Well, the first answer was in the case of PM of you, almost maybe 16 or 18 years ago, his work with Olson. Also. So, in case of PM, the first answer was very simple: namely, if I look to the equation of evolution of the high frequencies of the Navier stocks, namely I projection on the high Fourier mode, it is governed by this equation, where in the nano T2CC quadratic, I decompose the solution into low frequency and high frequency, low frequency and high frequency. However, However, I want to find the Q. I know the PM, but I want the Q, namely the complement. The unfortunate thing, say, in data assimilation or this is I don't know the initial value for this equation. This is missing. And therefore, one cannot really integrate the Q if I don't know the initial value. And the simple idea that basically together with Jones, with Oson, we have is: you know what? Is you know what? These pm are given. Why don't I insert them instead of this p and this p? And now I have equation in q only and initialize it anyway and see what happens. And indeed, this is the theorem. So the algorithm says, you know what? Let's look to this evolution equation for the high frequencies only, where I have an input here, the low frequencies in the nonlinearity, and I initialize it are better. And I initialize it arbitrary theorem. First of all, there's no really guarantee at the very beginning that why this equation should have global existence and uniqueness, even in two-dimensional case, because I lose some of the structures because I'm not saying that P and Q are really related in a way that they are. One is the low modes, and this is the high modes. Q tilde is arbitrary initialized, and therefore it has its dynamics of its own, but there is some. Of its own, but there is some feedback from P. So, first of all, we can show that there exists a uniqueness. And the second, and this is the most important, that the Q tilde, namely the solution of this equation, and the Q, namely the high modes of the unknown reference solution, go to zero as T goes to infinity. In other words, from P, we can recover Q via Q tilde. Now, this is nice, but what if the given information here is not the P M which for you? Is not the PM which Fourier. Why? The advantage if you have Fourier, not only that, I know the functions, I know the first derivative, the second derivative, all the derivatives I have. But suppose you give me the nodal values, and from this I can have an interpolant operator. Now, if it's a step functions, I cannot have derivatives, so I cannot put it in the nonlinearity. And as a result, what happens here? Now, so if IH is given, find. So, if ih is given, find you, for example, if you give me the nodal values. And this was the idea with our Aswani and Olson. What we say is the following. I know that if the largest scales of the two solutions of Navier Stokes coincide asymptotically, the solution should coincide. So, this is motivated our algorithm in solving for this equation the W. This is Navier Stokes, but now I nudge. But now I nudge, I put here some parameter nudging in which I nudge the largest scales of W to coincide with the largest scales of U asymptotically in time. In particular, if they are the same, then W is solution of the Navier stocks. So if the IH of U and IH of W are the same, and W solves the Navier stocks, then U and W are the same. Now, the question is again, how do I want to initialize it? Anything. It anything arbitrary, and what we proved in this algorithm that if μ is large enough and H is small enough, namely, you have enough information and observation, W minus go to zero and this is exponentially related. It goes to zero at an exponential rate. Okay, nice. Now, as I said, I don't, in the inertial manifold, I cannot find for every PQ, for every PQ. However, if you PQ. However, if you give me the history of P, I can recover the Q from this algorithm. So I would like to recover the U from the history of P. And I have some kind of like idea how to do it. So the question, can I find a map which gives me the history of P or the trajectory of the larger scales into the high scales? So if you give me P, which is the If you give me P, which is the whole history of the largest scales, can I recover the solution in a unique fashion? And indeed, this was a project with Foyash, Kravchenko, and Jolly at the very beginning. And then later we get another paper joint also with Beswas and Mondaini. And let me tell you the result here. So suppose U is trajectory on the attractor, and I know the low modes or the highs, the largest scales of IH is given. IH is given. Does this determine you in a unique fashion? So, the idea, and this is now I'm going to talk about abstract theory, but bear with me. Let me call X to be the space of all C1 bounded trajectories in the low modes or in the highs, in the larger scales. So, suppose V is given trajectory in this particular space in the ball of radius R. Then I look at these differential equations. Differential equations. This is inspired by my algorithm. So, this is the Navier-Stokes part, and this is like the nudging part. Important point. This is an equation that I would like to solve on all R. It is not an initial value problem. It's an equation. Do you have a solution for an equation? Not for an initial, I'm not solving Couchy problem. So, here is the result. So, here is the result. If μ is large enough and H is small enough, namely, you have enough observations, then there exists a bounded solution for this equation. Very nice. This bounded solution is unique. Wow. I mean, not only that I solved the equation, but the solution is unique. Now, the solution is determining a map because you gave me V, V is in this space of trajectories arbitrary. Then, from this, I for the W for the solution. This, I for the W for the solution gives me a map. For every V, I have a map. For every V, I have a W. For every V, I have a W. Then, when you investigate this W map, it is from this Banach space of all trajectories, then this W is Lipschitz. In fact, it's a frechet differentiable. Now, my goal is in the space of trajectories here to show I have a dynamical system. The space X is a The space X is a Banach space. It's infinite-dimensional Banach space, but it is like all the continuous functions C1 with range in finite dimensional space, like the, this think about it, like the coefficients of the M Fourier modes. So it says in Rn, it's trajectories, but trajectory in finite dimensional space. I would like to define a dynamical system on H, on X. The other observation here that I wanted to show that if V, that I gave you V are battery here, but suppose V is coming from the attractor. So if V is the projection of a trajectory in the attractor, this is if and only if the projection of the W V is equal to V. So it's a fixed point in that sense. All right, so as I said, I would like to define our dynamic. So, as I said, I would like to define a dynamical system. So, give me a steady state, which is a point on the attractor. I want to construct a dynamical system governed by an ODE. And by ODE, I mean that the vector field is Lipschitz. This is what distinguishes it from PDEs. So, here is very simply the ODE. I look at this equation: d V d tau is equal to F of V, but what is F? Of v, but what is f? I take v minus ih of this map w, which I know it exists and it is Lipschitz. I take the x nor of it squared. So therefore, this quantity is Lipschitz. And I take V minus IH of U star. Don't ask me where this is coming from. I have a dynamical system. Tau is a phony variable. So I have trajectories in the low modes and then I let it evolve. And I don't know where it goes. The initial trajectory. Go. The initial trajectory of low modes is not necessarily coming from a solution of the Nadia store. Pietr is 20 minutes up. Thank you very much. Yeah, I'm in good shape. So now, notice that because U star is fixed, is independent of time or anything, it's just, therefore, the time, the tau derivative of it is also zero. Hence, this equation that I introduced to you. This equation that I introduced to you, which has short-term existing weakness, is equivalent to this equation. In fact, I can drop this term. I don't need it. It's just equal to that. Now, it's an OG in the Banach space because you have existence and uniqueness for a short time. And I can solve it explicitly. In fact, this difference is e to the integral of this scalar times the initial value. Well, therefore, if I take the norm here, it's equal to the norm here because this is scalar. So the norm of the solution minus this ih of u star is some number multiplied by the initial distance. Ah, notice that this number theta, and by the way, this is our hero. This is the parameter. I mean, it's an abstract, but it is the parameter I'm going to. Is the parameter I'm going to claim that's doing all the marvelous things. This is a number between zero and one because it's e to negative thing. So, first of all, I have short-term existence and uniqueness. However, I can see because theta between zero and one, if I start with initial zero v, zero, then and I'm inside the ball where I have existence, where we have Lipschitz property, then the distance between v and i is shrinking because it's multiple. V and I is shrinking because it's multiplied by a factor less than one. And therefore, this shows you that you have global existence and uniqueness. Very nice. Now I have this parameter theta. What happens with this parameter theta? Now, theta is monotonic decreasing. And I can see from this relationship, because this is the theta, if you want, this is the theta. I can write V express. I can write V explicitly that the solution of my dynamical system is a function of tau, which is the phony time, and S, which is the parameterization of the trajectory. V, the solution, is theta times 1 minus V 0, 1 minus theta, not identity, this is 1 minus theta. It's a convex combination of two things. The separation of variables, how often we see linear PDEs or lanear equations. Linear PDEs or linear equation separation of variables. Now, theta is decreasing. Therefore, either goes all the way to zero, and therefore, tau goes to infinity, and therefore V is converting to IH, which means I started with initial trajectory V, but then when it evolves in time, it going to the steady state, to the IH of the steady state, therefore the attractor. But if theta goes to something finite, it means that the integral must be going to zero. And if the integral must be going to zero, And if the integral must be going to zero, then I conclude that the Vs of T must converge into something from the attractor. In other words, this dynamics is always even no matter how I initialize it, when it evolves in tau, it converges to trajectory on the attractor. Our hero is theta because theta either it goes to a finite number different than zero or it goes to zero. So let me see what does theta satisfy. See what does theta satisfy? You discover that theta, this parameter theta, satisfying this simple ODE. The theta d tau is satisfying this ODE. So it is a scalar ODE. But I need to find the limit when tau goes to infinity. So I need to find the fixed point of this scalar function. The theta bars are exactly the zeros of this function. This means once I This means once I find the zeros of this scalar function, I find all the points on the attractor. And this is really a surprise to us. And until now, we don't know how to use it. And this last part about this scalar function has been worked with Foyash, Jolly, Lithio, and myself. I stop here, and I'll be very happy to entertain any questions. As I said, this is a surprising result.
