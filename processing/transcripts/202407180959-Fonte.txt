I think HDMI is a development. Thanks for the introduction and thanks for saying my name with the correct accent. I really like your shirt, but I can see that your luggage has not arrived yet. Yeah, yet another one from the tourist. Right, so I want to thank the organizers of this event. That has been great and for giving me the opportunity to be here as well. And what I'm going to talk about is the work that we have done on network modeling of this plastic fluid flow in randomly disorgedia. That I'm pretty sure that you're sick to hear about this by now. There's been a lot of presentations about this topic. About this topic. This was mostly the work of Elliot Sutton, who is the PhD student that was working on this project and was supervised by me and Anne Shuel in Physics in Manchester as well. And it had the collaboration from Kohei Ohi and Yuji Tasaka from the University of Hokkaido in Japan. So we hosted Kohei for a couple of months in Manchester and we had some contribution to this. And it has also the contribution from Mazi Jalal in Amsterdam. From Mazi Jalal in Amsterdam because he kindly hosted Belit for a couple of months in Amsterdam as well. So I guess that I don't really have to go. Great exhaustion in why we wanted to study viscoplastic fluid flow in porous media. Ian gave a great introduction this morning as well, but it has some pain, nice topics, kind of hot topics like CO2 capture in underground. Underground for storage as well. Soil contamination and decontamination and remediation. Soil stabilization as well are injected like foams and grout into the pore structure. But this is really not the motivation for the work that we have done. Believe it or not, it all started just with the flow of mayor's in distribution lines. Meighs in distribution lines of Unilever. So, how did we get into force media work? So, Elliot was tasked with studying how mainlands were distributed in different parts of the pipeline. He studied kind of more trivial geometries, just like the flow in bends. We then got to study as well the flow in manifolds, just basic geometries where Just basic geologies where the flow would enter to one channel and had to split into multiple ones. We did some CFD simulations, we did some experiments on this as well. And the big objective of the work of Ellet was to come up with a 1D methodology to be able to describe how we can predict the distribution of mayonnaise in these complex networks of fluids. So, when we get to this point, we had a very pretty good Point, we had a pretty good and nicely working model, wanting model, and we wanted to try it out in a more extreme case. So we told Elliot, so think of the most complicated network that we could have and really test the limit of what your model is able to do. And we decided to go, of course, to complex and random polis media, which makes me really Which makes me really rethink some of the decisions that I take in life. But it has been great fun and I've learned quite a lot. So this is a project that started potentially like a year, a year and a half. And why has it been quite complicated? So by now, you've all seen that these flows are quite rich in physics and they are quite complex. So one of the The so basically, one of the characteristics of these flows is that they need a critical pressure to be able to flow. So, before that pressure, there's no transport in the pore structure. And as these beautiful images from Vaughan's work show, as we start increasing the pressure gradient in the pore, we start opening one single path in the flow, which will be the path of this resistance, and then we start opening up the remaining. And then they start opening up, remaining of the structure of the fluid behaves as a solid, so it's not yielded. And as you keep increasing, we start fluidizing all the fluid, and the flow is better distributed in the whole network. This comes with a lot of challenges as well. So Elliot also did some visualization experiments in shallow channel that had some cylindrical obstacles inside, but he showed some. Hilly show with some obstacles inside. As you can see here, this is already the steady state of the flow. Hopefully you can see the movement of some of the moving. So these are non-collateral particles that have been dyed with rhodamine, so that we could see by fluorescence the path. And what we see is that we have state and so on. We have signals on the fluid, so this portion of the flow will never be replaced by the flow that has been seeded. So there's no mechanism because they are non-diffusive. So this part will always remain like this. And we see quite strong channelization, so velocities that are much higher in some parts, and channels that will never open. One thing that we really struggled with was wall slip, so that we were never really able to get. Able to get rid of experimentally. And all of these things combined, as we've seen so far as all of this conference, make it very difficult to predict macroscopic transport properties in the flow. Mostly what the engineering are interested in is knowing how the pressure drop will or relates with the flow rate, and there has been some work. So, Peter Cassier saw some nice attempts to find universal dark log, kind of in an analogy to what we get in Newtonian fluids. So, there has been great work on this, but I would understand that the phenomenon is quite incomplete, and that's because computationally try to tackle these problems is very challenging. Simulations are quite costly, and they involve advanced techniques like. Advanced techniques like the augmented branching to be able to track effectively the interface between the parts of the fluid that behave like a solid and parts of the fluid that behave like a liquid. And experimentally, it's also not trivial. As I mentioned, we have the effect of ball slip that we cannot really control. These fluids tend to slip quite extensively in solid boundaries. And as well, measuring pressure. As well, measuring pressures in the positive song also very easy. As I said, there's been quite a lot of work done in this topic. So, we had, I'm trying to summarize the type of works that exist in the literature. So, there's some experimental work where some authors, society and Weisberg, try to do some network modelling. I think that the main takeaway message is that traditional approaches that we normally use for Approaches that we normally use for Newtonic fluids do not really offer very good predictions. There have been as well different works in this topic where people try to come up with generalized equations, Radapson-style equations, to describe the macroscopic behavior of the flow. So Chevalier in France used experimental work to try to fit some parameters to this large equation. These large equations. We have Simeda, who had a very nicely elegant theoretical approach to the work. And then, as well, the work that I showed already from Law and Bauer, who used fancy techniques like Lattice-Woltzmann to be able to get the data to try to estimate, or try to get these expressions. Of course, they are great, but they still require information from the forest media, basically measurements of the premium. The measurements of the premium activity that we were able to describe. And then there has been some work done by other people that presented here, mostly OT, MAC, where they've done some CFD simulations resolved at the pore scale to be able to study, for example, the effect of the void fraction and the slip on the flow. In the same year, they also come up with some geometrical reasoning to estimate what is the first open path leading to percolation in the medium. And more recently, Eman came up with quite an elegant way of a scaling for the flow at the yield unit as well, where a critical yield parameter can be estimated from properties of the fluid, like the Properties of the fluid, like the relation of the point space, of the obstructed space of the meter. Yes? So we had our go at trying to come up with our own network model for this capacity to flow in the network, part of the challenge for that people to have it. What we wanted to do is to focus just on 2D. Focus just on today disordered course media with runner-based separate obstacles that similar to what OT and MAD have done. We wanted to generate the network from foreign-like distillation. So basically we extract the core's connectivity for connectivity by performing a foreign-like distillation. And instead of dealing with these channels just as a straight channel, we really wanted to capture. A straight channel, we really wanted to capture as well the pore dynamics and really solve for the curvature that we have in these in the pore throats along the pores media. Our objective was to get a fast, fully predictive model, so we didn't want to fit any parameters. We just wanted to be able to input the parameters or information on the geometry of the core network, real logical properties of the fluid that are measured independently, and also in. Measure independently and also be able to deal with wall sleak in the wall. So, I'm going to divide my topic into parts. I'm going to first talk about the port scale dynamics and how we solve that part, then how we implemented the network model. And at the end, I'm Laos, we're going to talk about some alternative flow scaling that we were able to get from the results of our network model. Right, so for the port dynamics, this is the basic meaning that we adopted, just the space between the two circles that were the obstacle. By assuming symmetry, we just consider half, so basically just the orange part. The shape of the channel is described by this function, h of x, that you can easily infer from just geometrical reasoning. Geometrical reasoning. And to simulate the flow, we just also make assumptions of steady to the creeping flow by solving the current equation and then the monotony conservation equation. For the rheology of the fluid, we assume the Herschel-Baltic consecutive model, so generic, where we could even potentially change the power law index of that fluid. And the flow in the domain that I'm just showing there is subject to this one final condition, so symmetry in the bottom part, so at y equal to equal to zero. At the walls of the cylinder, we impose the slip velocity, that I will explain in a bit how we dealt with this. And we impose as well constrained integral constraints to make sure that the flow rate is constant in the whole The flow rate is constant in the whole cross-section of the board. We did some scaling to solve the problem, so we decided to use length scale in the x-direction that basically is related to the radius, or the radius of the pore. For the y direction, we use a different scale that will be more representative of shear dissipation. So basically, a type 26 cell that we could use here would be the width or the minimum width of that port throat. And this introduces a new variable to the problem. So epsilon, that normally is seen as an aspect ratio of the channel here. Not claiming that, I'm seeing more this epsilon parameter as a confinement parameter. So how close are those cylinders together? Hypocylinders together. This colours well the velocity and the stresses by the viscous stresses. And to be able to get a good balance between pressure drop and stress at the wall, we introduced an additional factor there for the scaling of the pressure. So when we do this, we obtain the following equations that now have an additional parameter to design non-dimensional form. Design non-dimensional form, and I'm dropping out that this was implicit. They have this additional parameter, this epsilon squared, that appears in some terms. And as a result of the non-dimensionalization, what we get as well is now the definition of a Bingham number that I want to draw your attention to. What is the scale that we use here to basically characterize shear stress in the channel? So you're not using the. In the channel, so we are not using the rigors of the obstacle, we are using the over-throat width or a measure of that poor throat width. And I think you can see where I'm going with this. If we consider that epsilon is a very small parameter, we can try to express the solution in terms of an asymptotic expansion, in terms of powers of epsilon squared. And I'm quoting Jens Hagers here, where the Here, where I said that most of the joy is in the leading order, which is great because that allows us to simplify tremendously the problem and try to come up with an analytical solution for what we think that should be valid as long as epsilon is a small parameter. And that's what we did. So by assuming, by assuming just the meeting order, basically we can make the comment. In order, basically, we can make a tremendous simplification by saying that there are the gradients of pressure in the width of the channel. And that allows us to find an analytical expression where we can calculate the velocity inside the pore throat. That is a function of the shear stress or the stress at the wall. And to deal with wall slip, Wall slip, we considered kind of an oligological law that would be in the form of this power law that depends on the conditions of stress after wall. So tau w it has two parameters, proportionality constant, a power law index, and we also consider there basically a slip yield parameter where you need to overcome a certain threshold of stress for the actual yield, sorry, the slip to occur. Slip to occur. So, this gives us the magnitude of the slip velocity. And since we have a curved channel, we decomposed, basically just projected different components according to the tangent unit factor to the wall that we can calculate from the function that describes the shape h of x. Right. You may be wondering how that can get the whole situation. Wondering how I can get the whole distribution of flow here if it depends on accurate g of x. So I don't really have this dependence of the pressure gradient in the whole domain. So I have to use the final boundary condition, which will be the integral constraint. So that the flow rate is constant in the whole section. And with that, you can come up with implicit, unfortunately, closed form expression for geo-x in the port road. GeoffX in the port route that for a known flow rate and for a known shape of the port, I can then invert numerically or solve numerically with a function like f solved in Python, something like that, to find that dependence of g of x that then I can use to calculate the velocity, or I can then just integrate to get the whole difference of pressures between the inlet and outlet of the door. And this is the And this is the results that we get here, but basically, at medium zero, the intonal limit, we see what we expect. We have the conversion to a channel, the velocity increases, and then it's fast increasing again. When we go to higher values of pingum, we then start seeing the appearance of these yield surfaces where the fluid is not yielded in this center or core of the channel and just yields. Core of the channel, and just here it's close to the walls. And as we increase the kingdom number, then we see that this itself is step closer and closer to the walls of the cylinders. With wall slip, what we see is that since the fluid now can slide in the walls, we see that it becomes much more smoother. The velocity profiles to the point that when we start increasing the pingham number, we actually start. The Bingham number, we actually start getting regions where the fluid doesn't even yield and it's just able to slide as a plug in the walls. And as you increase even further the bingham number, we see that the fluid is just able to completely slide through the walls without even deforming. It works well in some cases, it works less well in other cases. So as expected, what we see is that for small values of epsilon, we get a quite good comparison with the CFD data that we perform with. With the CFE data that we performed with the open form. As this value starts increasing, you see that there is some. So, in the Newtonian limit, this is not really a big issue, or we're not expecting it to be because pressure drop will be mostly due to the smaller pores that we have, or protects that we have in the domain. When we start getting into the yield limit, it will be the path of this resistance that will kind of dominate in terms of pressure drop. So, we are expecting that we will start seeing. So we are expecting that we will start seeing some deviation. I'll show after. So in terms of what we see with the ball slip, the results are also quite good, surprisingly good, I guess, and even better than what we get before. And I think that's because the the flow has smaller gradients in the y direction, so since the flow it is able to slide, we get over even better. To slide, we get an even better solution. So, right, so now that we have this poor description of our poor flow description on how the flow occurs there, we can try to implement this in our model. So, we did the tessellation with OpenCB in Python. One set of equations that we're trying to solve is basically just in that in the Interesting that in the pores we have net zero flow rate at the pore throat. We use the expression that we derived before to relate the flow that goes through the pore throat with the pressure in each end of the pore. And of course, this doesn't result in a linear system of equations. It's a little bit more complicated than that, but we solve it normally. We solved it numerically with Newton-Raphson method we solved in thousands. And luckily, we had data that allowed us to compare the results with our model without us having to come up with that data ourselves. So big thanks to Emma, who is there, who is kind enough to provide us the distribution of the pores, sorry, the cylinders, so that Elliot would not have to count by hand in the capital. By hand and the gate and must be um so uh qualitatively it's quite uh quite nice uh results after low pingham numbers. Uh we see that we have a very similar distribution of flow rate. As we start increasing the wingham number, we see that we start struggling a bit. So this kind of path is similar but not completely. There's also some, I don't know if it's very clear with the projector, but some colors that are not Projective some colours that don't quite match, and we go when we go to very high numbers. We start, we predict a path that is still open when clearly see everything results that don't really show down. But the results in terms of pressure dissipation, or pressure, sorry, pressure drop as a function of Bingham number are still quite good. The Newton only fits quite nicely. Some can forget that this is a log-log scale, some deviation at the higher ping numbers. And I must say that. And I must say that the definition of Bingham and the pressure scale is slightly different from what I used before, so I'm adding book used the radius of the cylinders there and not really the portfolio. And this is great because it allows to get solutions in minutes instead of days. Same for the slips. I mean, conditions that are not very extreme, we still see fairly good agreement qualitatively. At very high ballots of two conditions and kingdom numbers, it's not as great. We still see though a good match between pressure gradient and income, and that's mostly because all the pressure dissipations in this open. Is in this open pore. These opening flows, open pores here, where we have flow, they are basically sliding through with wall slip. That doesn't contribute as much for pressure dissipation. I think that this is numerical. It's not the model. I think that our model will be able to do better than this. And I think it's just linked to the way that we are minimizing the pressure differences between iterations of our solar. Since these pressures are so smaller compared to this one, the solver. To this one, the solver is not able to cope with that. But we are still working on it. And finally, if time allows, I just want to briefly talk about flow scaling analysis that we've did. We've done. So we also used some of the results from Putty and Immark here, where they explored different porosities, different media with different porosities. And in this case, what we have. Porosities and in this case what we have is different curves of this dependence of pressure with the minimum number. But inspired by our scaling in the portal, then we would expect that the pressure that we have in the pore, in the pore network, should scale with this characteristic length scale that is more linked to the pore throat with than the radius of the cylinder network. Of the cylinder necessarily. So, if we use the same scaling arguments that we use for the portrait, what we get is indeed a new definition. What we get is a new definition of a new gradient, a non-dimensionalized gradient of pressure and even number, where this should depend linearly without any parameter only. Parameter only one of so the curves should overlap. If we still want to use the same scaling that MR and OT have used, what you get is that the G should depend on B, but this parameter people, the confinement ratio, should still appear there, which will give exactly the same solution, on the same scaling that Emma has suggested if we assume that epsilon can be calculated from the This can be calculated from the porosity of the L. That's what we did. So we took the results and we tried to express it in terms of this new definition of the pingen number. It works quite well. We have a good match and it starts getting a little bit worse as the porosity starts increasing to very high values. But we also thought that maybe let's explore and look at the whole distribution of poor Of four throat widths and see if we can use a better metric to export this. And that's what we did. So, looking at this distribution, what would be the scale that you would use? You have the whole distribution, you want a metric, what would be the most evident one? We want for the easiest one, just the average and And to our surprise, it works quite well. So, we are able to overlap all the different processes in a single line. And as expected, by defining G and B in this new way, we have no dependence on the geometry of the polar media because they have all been absorbed into the definition of geometry and this as well for, I promise. We did this as well for I promise I'm finishing. We did this as well for the different fluids. So we changed the N, which is the power of index of the hard queen fluid. And we see that with the previous scale, we have three different, or have six different curves. If we use the scale plus by a match, we still see a good match, but still some deviations there. If we use the m average of the minimum polynomial network, we see that it matches perfectly. We see that it matches perfectly at the hyping among these cases. Of course, we're still trying to understand this. And Ralph Hutton quickly basically needs to test this for different portal shapes and for different size distributions as well to see how well it holds. So, just trying to understand a little bit what is going on, I did some analysis of I did some analysis of how that parameter epsilon for well-defined structures vary with the porosity. And what we see is that there's a very good scale and a very good match between the average H-mean with what we would get, for example, in a regular example of packing. I'm not quite sure why it matches so well, but the shape is absolutely the same. So basically, what I'm saying is that, and I'm plotting this. And I'm plotting this against the scaling of MN. I think that the scaling is still good, but it does seem to indicate these results that what we get is a good scaling only in the asymptotic limit when the porosities are small. When we start getting medium that are much more porous, we probably will need to do some different scaling uh arguments or we need to do a correction as well. I will skip the the conclusions and The conclusions are okay to see any questions. So, in terms of the modesty
