Okay, now that's the end of the talk. I wanted to go to the beginning. Can you see my screen? Yes, yes, we can. Yeah, but okay, it's not what I wanted to. Okay. Good. Okay, now the talk is divided into three parts. Into three parts. The first is about how to define spinners in the, yeah, I don't want to say the right way, but certainly a way which could be enlightening for several applications, because spinners and textbooks are often defined in another way. And I just want to Just want to extend this usual view on the usual perspective on spinners by another one. Then to talk about a functor between a Lorentzian and a Riemannian category and a functor between two, let's say, synthetic versions of Lorentzian geometry. And a third, and maybe most important in this context of this conference, I want to present. Of this conference, I want to present a result that was shocking at least for me, because somehow, if you take the von Neumann rule seriously, it turns out that quantization cannot be linear. And let me explain in detail what I mean by that. Now, the first result is about spinners. So, when I wrote my PhD thesis, Uh, wrote my PhD thesis. Uh, I tried to find a way to uh to define spinners in a way. I mean, I was annoyed by the fact that spinners, in fact, yeah, if you if you have spinners, the bundle itself depends on the metric. And this is somehow annoying because you want to to do variational theory and somehow you want to consider, if you want to have Dirac-Einstein theory, you want to have one bundle and maybe the metric on the bundle. And maybe the metric on the bundle could depend on the metric on space-time, but not the bundle itself. So it was, I found it quite annoying and tried to find some fixing of the problem and I couldn't find one. And years later, like more than 12 years later, I understood why. And that's in 2015, where we could formulate like this no-go theory. Formula like this Nogo theorem. And this is, so you would like to have the following thing. You would like to have some universal vector bundle here over the category of manifolds. Like, for example, think of the tangent bundle or cotangent bundle or some tensor bundle. And then for the category of spinning manifolds, you have some, you could have some morphism into this category. Some morphism into this category. And then, if you add a Riemanni metric, you could add here on this side also Riemanni metric connection, whatever, and you could borrow your additional structure here from here, then to here. But so the topological underlying functor would be there. And this is not possible, actually. I mean, you can basically Uh basically, uh it's it's due to um well the two-to-one covering um underlying spin geometry, it's it's just not possible. It has been proven here in this reference, which is somehow a bit disappointing, but there is a somehow a loophole for this Novo theorem. Noble theorem. And this is the following. You just relax your conditions a bit. You don't want to have some universal vector bundle, but well, you take a vector bundle not over the manifold over the space-time, but you take a vector bundle over the symmetric bilinear forms on your manifold, on your space-time. Let's say of signature Rs. I mean, in this case, of signature. I mean, in this case of signature 1, n, say. And this is a bundle. I mean, over every point P, you have the symmetric bilinear forms of signature 1n on that point. This is a fiber bundle. I mean, it's just even an open subset of a vector bundle. And over that bundle, again, you can find a second bundle, which is then the spinner bundle. Well, not over this bundle. Well, not over this bundle, but over the first jet bundle of this bundle. Here, you have this here. You can first go to the first jet bundle of this bundle of symmetric binary forms of a given signature. And then you just remember that in the spinner bundles, the metric and the connection only depends on the first derivative of the metric at the given point. This is basically it. This is basically it. I mean, it's just a reformulation, but you have to, it's, you have to, it's quite a tedious bookkeeping that all of this works. I mean, there is a universal bundle. It sits here. It's a double bundle over M. And you can, if you have a spinner bundle to a given metric, you can actually borrow your, I mean, your metric and connection from sigma bar. So this is possible and it seems to be And it seems to be, say, yeah, maybe close to abstract nonsense, but functors and categories are quite helpful and especially if it comes to things like maximum Cauchy developments. We'll see that in a minute. All of this is natural, so this is a functorial construction here, right? And And then you can define a universal Dirac operator. There is a first-order Dirac operator on this universal spinner bundle, and somehow it is functorial under those spin diffomorphism. And if you have a fixed metric, then it corresponds to the usual Dirac operator. So, this is important, of course, for the Einstein-Dirac equation and for Einstein-Dirac equation and for, for example, the canonical coupling between, let's say, the Einstein tensor and the standard model, for example, right? Seen as a classical field equation. The same is true then. So if you consider Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory in the Riemannian case, that is to say, in a Riemannian signature, then the solutions of the Einstein-Diracy theory. Then the solutions of the Einstein-Dermike-Maxwell equation, you can view them as critical points of a functional defined on a bundle, on a finite dimensional bundle with a Lagrangian density there. So it's, yeah, you can really use all your apparatus of variational theory, which you couldn't before, because the bundle depended on the metric. Depended on the metric. So it was not clear how to define how to use variational theory in that context. Now, in the last, I would say most important advantage of this machinery is that in the Lorentzian case, you can actually speak of maximum Cauchy developments for Einstein-Dirac equations, which was not clear before. I mean, because remember how that was done, right? I mean, this. That was done, right? I mean, this showcase Real Kevoche machinery of using Zon's lemma and puzzling those extensions together. All of this is not possible if you don't have a universal bundle, if you don't have local uniqueness. And so this is a result requiring that you somehow reformulate spinner theory or spin geometry. Uh, spinner theory or spin geometry, the Dirac equation as an equation on a universal bundle. Okay, so this was the first application of category theory in fundamental physics, say, I wanted to talk about. The second one is this link between Lorentzian geometry and Riemannian geometry. Riemannian geometry and different versions of synthetic Lorentz geometry, which is important. Why is it important? I mean, if you look into Berger's book, a panoramic view of Riemannian geometry, for me, as a differential geometrist, it's a very inspiring book, but also for various applications in physics, for example, Einstein Manifolds. For example, Einstein Manifolds, it's quite a useful source and reference. And he writes: Gromov's MM spaces, it stands for metric measure spaces, are in our opinion, the geometry of the future. Which is, I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, which is quite a statement, right? And, but it's true that it was in the Romanian geometry, it was very fruitful to just widen the scope and to consider Romani metric as special. To consider a money metric as special kinds of metric spaces. And also to include rough limits, like of the Einstein equations, say. And also, if you want to include a topology change in Riemannian geometry, it's clear what you do. I mean, you have you can identify Riemann metrics with like metric spaces on your set, and then you have the Gromov-Haushoff metric giving you precise. Of metric giving you precisely a way to consider topology change, which is quite a hot topic, or yeah, quite a hot topic in some versions of relativity. But if you want to formulate this mathematically rigorously, you have to somehow find an analogon or the Grammar force of metric. And it's not there. I mean, we will see that in a minute, that there's also no go. Will see that in a minute. That there's also a Nalgo theorem here lurking, and also for finiteness theorems, like finiteness theorems of Chiga type, saying, for example, with that, this and that curvature bound, diameter bound, and so on, you only have finitely many, say, homomorphism types of manifolds. This does not seem to be so important for physics, but I think it could be if you include topology change, right? And And therefore, for those two aspects, it's interesting to have this perspective of seeing Lorentzian metrics in a more broad context, in a broader context. Yeah, the question is whether Lorentzian geometry and mathematical relativity could become part of this jamboree. Part of this jamboree. Good. And now the first thing to realize is that there is bad news too. There's simply no functor going from the category from Lorentzian manifolds to metric spaces, preserving the topology, say. I mean, if you have the forgetful functor on both sides, and yeah, so you forget the Lorentzian metric here, and you forget the metric here, and you. And you stay with the topologicals, I mean, just keep the topology, then it's just not possible. And it just cannot commute. And that's because if you consider boosts, I mean, if you recall what boosts do already in the two-dimensional situation in R11, what boosts do is just they control, they do is just they contract they they extend one um null line at a point and they they they contract the other one and they con and i mean the group of boosts contracts the the other line um arbitrarily um arbitrarily strongly so um points are somehow sucked in by by this uh by by the zero uh in the game so every neighborhood of the zero would would neighborhood of the zero would contain, I mean, if we had a correspondence to a metric space, then every ball or yeah, every neighborhood of zero would contain every complement of every ball. So that's just not possible. Therefore, this naive approach simply does not work. But what does work is if you, I mean, there are several things. I mean, there are several things that do work. The first one is a functor from Lorentzian manifolds to the category of partial order measure spaces. I mean, this is one version of synthetic Lorentzian geometry you could think of. And this is just, you take your Lorentzian manifold, I mean, the manifold M with a Lorentz symmetric G on it, and then you just keep M and then as a set, say, and then you have the And then you have the order, the partial order given by the causality relation. And then you take the volume form on it, I mean, which gives you a measure on the subsets of M. So those are spaces carrying an order and a measure. And they can be completely unrelated, but yeah, but those two structures. Those two structures are present, and then you can ask, then there is another version of synthetic Lorentzian geometry, and this is almost Lorentzian length spaces. This is, you have a set X, and then you have a function on X, which codifies your Laurentian distance with a sign. So, this gives you, this is, for example, I mean, for example, sigma of X. I mean, for example, σ of xy is, for example, positive if x is in the past of y. And it gives you the Lorentzian distance. That is to say, the maximal length of a causal curve from x to y. And then there's a sign, of course. And such a map, ah, okay, no, there's not. It's unsigned. Sorry, it's an unsigned version. So you have a positive map, a non-negative A non-negative map into the non-negative numbers on the space cross itself. And this anti-symmetric... Okay, I've mixed up two different versions of almost learned length spaces. One is signed and one is unsigned. You can imagine that. So it's, for example, it's anti-symmetric and it's reflective. That means that xx goes to zero, right? I mean. Goes to zero, right? I mean, uh, yeah, because uh, if I if we have a causal um manifold, there is no causal curve from x to x. So the only causal curve is the constant one, and then the maximum length is zero. So that's how it should be. And that function should satisfy the inverse triangle inequality, and then you can comprise all the all those almost random length spaces. All those almost Lorentzian length spaces to the category of almost, yeah, yeah, it should be almost Lorentzian length spaces. So A L L and the morphisms are the obvious ones. That is to say, they preserve the they pull back the function sigma, and they should be with causally convex images. Yeah, then McKenn and Zehman, Robert McKenn and Clement Zehman, in 2019, they obtained the result that we can just mimic the definition of the host of dimension for those spaces, for those synthetic Lorentzian spaces, and we can just replace the balls in the definition of host of dimension measure by just causal diamonds. By just causal diamonds. And so we can construct a natural measure on the objects of this category. So we get a functor from the category of almost variance and length spaces to partial order measure spaces, because we can get a measure. I mean, the order is there already. I mean, just as I explained before, but you can also get a measure. And this is, I mean, if you look at this definition here, it's just the same one. I mean, Just the same one. I mean, you take a sequences of P and Q such that here you, this is this J P K Q K is just the causal diameter from PK to QK and the diameter of those should be smaller than delta and so on. So actually, you can take the causal diameter and this is exactly the same. Is exactly the same definition as in the Hausoff dimension measure, except for the case, except for the fact that we have causal diamonds here instead of balls. And then exactly as in the other definition, you have a normalization constant, and then you have the same term here as you have in the just the sum over the. Just a sum over the contributing causal diamonds instead of balls, like in the definition of Hausdorff dimensioned measure. And this is exactly the same verb if you write it down the right way. Okay, the nice thing is that I found this year that you can go the other direction as well. I mean, given an ordered measure space, a partially ordered measure space, some element in the Ordered measure space, some element in this category POM, you can just recover a local dimension going over some volumes of causal diamonds using logarithm here. It's not very important how to do this, I mean, but you can first recover a dimension, and then if you assume that dimension is constant, or at least not too widely, I mean, if you come from a Lorentzian manifold, then it will be constant. From a Lorentzian manifold, then it will be constant. But the following definition also works if it does not oscillate too wildly. Then you can define the Lorentzian length just as you would define, I mean, yeah, you take causal diamonds to cover the curve from one point to the other. This is not very, um, not a very creative definition. You just have to make sure that the normalization constants are the right ones. And yeah, for Lorentzian manifolds, you can go forth and back, back and forth, and everything of this commutes. I mean, you just have two, say, functors intermediate between two versions of Lorentz, of synthetic Lorentz in geometry, which is a nice thing, I think. And also, you can find another loophole to this Nogo theorem. Theorem forbidding you the way from Lorentz to Riemannian in general, but you can restrict the category of Lorentzian manifolds to so-called Cauchy slabs. I mean, you take the region between two Cauchy surfaces and that automatically forbids the application of every boost, right? Because every boost would bring you outside. Because every boost would bring you outside of the Cauchy slab. So it gets very rigid now. And then we have some, yeah, C infinity, some category on the Riemannian side. This is Riemannian manifolds with boundary and its isometries. And what we do is just, I don't want to go through this very deeply because, I mean, it's not very much on the focus of the. Not very much on the focus of the conference on quantization, but to give you an impression of what happens is you take the Lorentzian distance from a point σ x, you somehow smoothen it with some function f, and that's exactly, that's so that's how you get from a point x to an L2 function on the manifold, on the Cauchy slab. It will be L2 because it's, I mean, such a Cauchy slab is somehow temporarily compact. Somehow temporarily compact. I mean, the future cone of every point is compact. So everything works, it's L2. And what you can do here is you have a map from X to a Hilbert space. So you map the manifold into a Hilbert space. And it turns out that you can take this map, this very map, to borrow the scalar product from the Hilbert space. Scalar product from the Hilbert space. First of all, this maps out C2 embeddings into the Silbert space. They are also injective if you include some other baggage like you have some variations in the constants here and you take some three Lipschitz functions with you. This will be injective. I suppose it, I mean, I have the strong conjecture that it is injective anyway, if you also if you forget this. Anyway, if you also, if you forget this extra baggage here, but it does not matter. I mean, it just so the Lorentz more important is that the Lorentzian bounds, curvature bounds, for example, they carry over to the Riemannian bounds. I mean, this is somehow, this is some sort of a miracle. I mean, it's just a very adventurous construction, so to say. I mean, it's a actually, okay, I mean, it's not a very new idea, right? New idea, right? To say, to map a point to the distance from a point. But I mean, that curvature bounce transfer there, it was surprising, at least for me. And so we obtained Schiger finiteness results. I mean, you have to work for this correspondence between geometric quantities, and you have to pick your Lorentzian geometric quantities not in an arbitrary way. It has to be a bit. An arbitrary way, it has to be a bit you have to work a bit for that, but in the end, it works, and you can get finiteness, uh, finiteness results. And those finiteness results are the first ones in Lorentzian geometry at all. So, it's interesting, I guess. And again, this has been somehow work to escape a nogo theorem. Escape a nogo theorem in category theory, so to say, yeah, for functors. Okay, so last topic. Okay, when it comes to quantization, I have to admit that my deepest love has always been with geometric quantization. And this is because somehow Somehow, yeah, in geometric quantization, what do you do? Your quantum states are somehow what you naively expect from quantum states. They are somehow complex mixtures of classical states, of classical solutions. So that's what you, in a naive picture of quantum mechanics, of quantum theory, you would expect. You would expect. But there are different problems of several problems of geometric quantization. The first one is that if you apply geometric pre-quantization, that is to say you don't apply a polarization, then I guess all of you know that we end up in the wrong space. I mean, we just get complex probability distributions on phase space and not on configuration space, which is somehow awkward, at least if you want. Awkward, at least if you want to apply this to mechanics. And I guess if it doesn't work for mechanics, it wouldn't probably work for field theory. So yeah, we end up in the wrong space. And then with polarization, but before the BKS pairing, whatever this is, I want to go into details here, but you get that the observables you can apply your pre-quantization. Your pre-quantization two is all your quantization. I mean, because you project back to the polarization subspace, the observables you can apply it to are exactly those whose Hamiltonian vector field leaves the standard polarization invariant. And on R to the end, they are at most linear. So, this is a heavy restriction of observables, right? You have only linear observables. This is strange now. This is strange somehow. And then you have no hematicity in general. This was found by Baozu in 1992 for a special case in finite dimensional geometric quantization with the whole machinery. I think with BKS pairing, this version of BKS pairing. And in my case, it was just a result about free. Just a result about frequentization. Yeah, but still, I mean, you couldn't expect that to get better after taking polarization. And with a BKS pairing, Bao and Zhu in the same article found even that the map from F to Q of F becomes nonlinear. It contains nonlinear terms. The question is: so, in the following, I want to argue. So, in the following, I want to argue that this doesn't happen by accidents. This is somehow, yeah, somehow a specification of a general rule, so to say. Yeah. And in quantization, there are already some Novo theorems, which are maybe not very much known. I mean, the Grundelt von Hober theorem. The Guinea Watch-Vernhove theorem is known somehow a bit, but I want to repeat it anyway. So let's take a symplectic fiber bundle. I mean, I should say this here, this result was for pre-quantization of a field theory, right? So of say a field theory of a first order field theory such that you have somehow initial. Such that you have somehow initial values on a Cauchy surface as your phase space. Okay, so take a symplectic fiber bundle. For example, you take a cotangent space, if you think of quantum mechanics, or you take the space of first-order initial values on a vector bundle over a global hyperbolic manifold. Yeah, so this is like for field theory, like think of scalar field theory. Think of scalar field theory or whatever. And then you have the Poisson algebra of smooth functions on M on the symplectic manifold. Yeah, okay, I should have written a symplectic manifold here, not symplectic fiber bundle. But the initial values on a vector bundle over a global manifold are sections of a simplistic Are sections of a symplectic fiber bundle and therefore a symplectic vector bundle and are therefore a symplectic vector space. Now you have the Poisson algebra and you take an open subset of it, of M and you take vector fields over this open subset such that F times P and G times Q are F times G. The Poisson bracket of them is F times G. For example, I mean, this is somehow more, if you want to formulate it sharply, I mean, or more familiar, it's just the usual commutational relations between momentum and position, right? I mean, yeah, constant times one. I forgot to constant here. But smear it out with functions f and p, f and g. And p f and g yeah, then you get that first of all the Golden Baut theorem in a certain formulation says that there is no linear map from X to an algebra of differential operators that is modular constant factor I, a representation of the Poisson algebra X, and such that the representation of the momentum goes to the differential and the representation of the The representation of the position goes to multiplication with x. There's a more abstract version of the same thing by Ahrens and Babbitt in 1973, that there is no linear map with the Von Neumann property, and I will come to the Von Neumann property in a moment, from a Prosum algebra X to an algebra that represents the Prosum algebra, I mean, which is a representation of the Prosum. I mean, which is a representation of the Poisson algebra, modular i, and contains two elements whose commutator is exactly of this form. So, yeah, what is the von Neumann property? The von Neumann property is the following one. It says if you post-compone your observable with some smooth map from R to R, say you square it. Say you square it, or you take times two, or whatever. I mean, then what should happen? I mean, let's do a Gedank experiment. Let's do like some envious colleague of you. I don't know how many of you have a laboratory. I have none, but I think the most of you have no laboratory. But imagine you have one and an envious colleague sneaks in by night and stretches the scale of your measurement. Stretches the scale of your measurement apparatus. What happens? I mean, what measurements do you do afterwards? The only thing that can happen is that the spectrum of results just shifts by this very stretching. That means if the stretching is parabolic, you get in the spectral calculus, you just post-compos, I mean, you take the square of your operator. The square of your operator. If it's to the three, it's uh it's your operator to the third power, and so on. And if it's uh arctan, then it's the arctan of your operator, yeah, in the in this in the sense of spectral calculus. That's the Von Neumann rule. And in my opinion, it has to hold for every reasonable quantization because of this Gedan experiment. I cannot imagine any, I mean, I don't understand a measurement in quantum mechanics completely, but I think every word. But I think every version of it that makes any sense has to have this von Neumann property. And it sometimes people say it can only maybe it holds only approximately, but this makes no sense whatever for me. I mean, it's just it has to hold precisely, precisely to every order. And if it doesn't hold, then it's not a reasonable quantization. But we can discuss this, of course. Anyway, here you could say. Anyway, here you could say this, for example, could hold up to a certain order, right? I mean, it could hold approximately. So this is not really a Nogo theorem. This is also not a Nogo theorem. I mean, that's a commutator of position momentum is a multiple of the identity. It's an experimental fact that could hold up to a certain precision. But the von Neumann rule is, for me, is not a subject of a discussion. I mean, if our understanding, our understanding If our understanding of measurement should persist, then the von Neumann rule should hold. You have five minutes. Ah, sorry. Okay. There is a theorem. There's an Orgo theorem. There's an observation that you can see that almost all quantum theories observables are associated operators in Hilbert space. Also, those theories. Also, those theories formulated in C-star algebras are subject to the Gelfand-Niemark theorem. You find a representation in Hilbert space. It's not canonical, but you can find one. And then furthermore, most quantum theories are linear. For example, position operator plus momentum operator, not appearing in any experiment, but it goes to a position. No, position plus momentum is quantized as position operator plus momentum operator. This is in Dirac quantization, geometric quantization. And zero quantization, geometric quantization, pre-quantization, parasitemts quantization, pathologization, it's coherent state quantization. You pick your quantization, it will be there. Okay, but those two properties are already inconsistent with the Von Neumann rule, or if the Von Neumann rule holds in addition, then you have an abelian algebra of operators, which you don't want to have. I mean, this is certainly in contradiction to it. This would be in contradiction to observations. Observations. Yeah, here's the theorem, and I think it's quite devastating. You take the smooth functions from R to R called D, and you have a set X. So you have a set of classical observables. They are representation of by post-composition of D, a representation space. Then you have a Hilbert space, and you take self-adjoint operators on it. Then you have some subset of it, and it should be D-invariant. Subset of it and it should be de-invariant by spectral continuous spectral couples. And then you have a quantization relation. It does not even have to be a quantization map. It can also be a de quantization, for example. It has to be just a relation between observables and operators. So it's called Neumannian. If a pair of a classical observant and operator is in Q, then for Is in Q, then for all F in D, we have that F after G, F composed with G, and F of K in the spectral calculus is in Q again. And it's linear, again, if this holds, right? I mean, just if the relation is linear. And then the theorem says if Q is linear Neumannian, then the image of Q is abelian. So either the quantization relation can be linear or Neumannian. Linear or Neumannian. Not both of them. Yeah, that's a sad story. Here's an almost honest proof. I mean, just maybe I shouldn't burden you with the proof at the end of a conference, maybe, but it's just to see that this is just an arithmetic calculation between on the operator level, then after quantization, you get the same thing as here between those. And then you apply the, because here the Norman. Apply the because here the Norman rule is applied for squaring, actually, and then you make some computations on the algebra of observables, and then you get that this has to be zero. Then you pick some eigenvector of one operator, which is not an eigenvector of the other operator, and then you get a contradiction by modifying the operator without modifying this lambda. And you just see that this SVV is not zero, it's greater than zero. It's almost an honest proof, it's just. An honest proof. It's just the shortcomings here that there's not always an eigenvector basis of a self-adjoint operator, but there's an canonical work around this in spectral calculus. Now, the last thing I want to say is an experiment. I suggest an experiment to measure the deviations from linearity. If you want to measure observables, I couldn't think of a nice way. Couldn't think of a nice way to measure position plus momentum. But we can measure position times momentum. And this is just by the following preparation. You prepare a coherent beam of charged particles. For example, it can be electrons of a certain beam width. And that's to say you have a certain width and your particles can enter at a certain height from B minus B half to B half. And then you have some momentum uncertainty from. Some momentum uncertainty from minus m half to m half at the at the point of the shot shutter. And then you prepare behind the shutter a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the beam. And then your screen should be not perpendicular to the beam, but parallel to the beam. And then you see that the Lorentz force will make the particles impact on the screen. And by this, you measure Qx times Py, which are commuting operators. Which are commuting operators in the usual setting, but you don't measure Qx and you don't measure Py. So here is just a sketch of this experiment. I mean, this should just give an answer to deviations to linearity. And I couldn't. I mean, I have asked some experimental physicists, but they say they are too far away from this topic. Far away from this topic. So, if you know one, please let me know. No, anyone willing to perform this experiment, which is which does not seem to be very complicated to me, but I think it bears some insights. Okay, so that's what I wanted to tell you actually. Thank you very much for your attention. Okay, so let's start with questions here in Oaxaca. Hi, Olaf. Very nice talk. A question about the first part of your talk. Can you Can you, with the spin manifolds and structures, can you do something similar in the case where you have manifolds with boundary? Yes, yes, it's also possible. I mean, you don't you only have to make sure. I mean, in the Romanian case, for sure, in the Lorentzian case, but But yeah, but yeah, I think so because it's uh this is possible because you have um ah okay, yeah, but you are interested in corners, right? Let's say just for the boundary is certainly possible if it comes to corners. I have to think again, but uh see for the boundary you consider the first jet space anyway of your pi R S, so you can include the the The first differential in the you include some points in the neighborhood in a certain sense. So it's even a light-like boundary should not provide a big problem. It's just corners. I have to think about how bad they can be. For example, cusps could be a problem. But yeah, I have to, it's a nice question. I have to think about it. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Thanks. So we have Felix who has raised his hand. Okay, thanks a lot. So thanks a lot, Ula, for this nice talk. So I'm wondering, well, of course, we discussed this earlier about the significance of this last no-go theorem. And the question, this is very naive. I mean, you only have a relation on these classical observables times the operator algebra, if I understand this correctly. Algebra, if I understand this correctly. Like, for example, what I mean, how does this, I mean, the possible loophole I can think of is that maybe there are not enough classical observables. Is this an issue? For example, you say, well, in this case, suppose there are no classical observables. Do you, in this case, get any contradiction? Yeah, but then Q of C is abelian because it's. C is abelian because it is empty, an empty space of fine, but this, but then, but then there's no contradiction because, yeah, yeah, then there's no contradiction. I mean, of course, yeah, yeah, if they are not classical observables, then then we don't get any contradiction to anything. It's just, yeah, right. I need at least, well, the proof needs two observables because we at least need two operators that do not commute. Two operators that do not commute for different, say, I mean, if it's realistic for different observables, you need two operators that do not commute to make it a realistic. I see. So you need like two classical observables and the corresponding quantized operators do not commute. Then you get a contradiction. Then we would get a contradiction, right? Okay, now I understand this better. Of course, I don't really understand what this means yet. Okay, but thanks a lot. Okay, but thanks a lot. Neither do I, neither do I. Yeah, I should say I'm working on a version of geometric quantization avoiding this, I mean, satisfying the Neumann for Neumann rule, but it's not done yet. So it's much too early to say what comes out there. Or whether that works at all. No. Yeah, we have another question here. Oaxaca. Hello, Olaf. So the question would be just if the same sort of assumptions would be a problem for other kinds of quantization, like deformation quantization or any other assumption, any other form of quantization. Any other form of quantization, some yeah, I mean, this, um, this, uh, I mean, this theorem is completely general. I mean, it just does not refer to a certain quantization scheme. It's just if you have a map between such a thing, such a, let's say, I mean, yeah, this set of classic observables is a, I mean, I didn't specify what the X is, right? It's just a space of. A space of C infinity functions on something, but it can be post-component with C infinity functions on R. And then every map from that thing, I call this a set of classic observables, but of course, quantization do exactly that, right? I mean, they take some thing of this type and they give you some thing of... You some thing of some self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space, right? And therefore, yeah, in this quantization scheme, I mean, not every quantization scheme is actually gives you several joint operators on Hilbert space, but as I said, I mean, you can make many things you can reformulate by Gelfand-Niemark as operators in Hilbert space, right? And therefore, in the end, you get such a thing. you you get such a thing you obtain such a such a map uh in in most cases it's a map because uh this is another interesting question this context uh are there different uh say apparata that give a different spectra for for certain observable but coincide in the classical regime in the in the decoherent regime regime uh uh let's say for momentum or so and i also i couldn't find any And I also couldn't find any experimentalist answering this question. I mean, it's an easy question, but it's yeah, I mean, different. Let's say I have a momentum apparatus one and momentum apparatus two. Do they rep are they represented by the same operator, right? Or I mean, is there a quantization map or has to be there a quantization relation? That's a question. But I couldn't get any physicists to answer my questions. Physicists to answer my questions, this question. But this was not, Jos Antonio, this was not your. No, no, that's informing. I like part of your answer, but if you are more careful in asking less from your quantization, like you restrict to a very small sub-algebra of functions that you want to promote to operators. Is there any chance of being careful like that and avoiding? Like that, and avoiding. Yeah, I mean, here you see it's a subset of the set of smooth things. The only thing I have to ask is that it be invariant under post-composition with C infinity functions. And that I would ask of every reasonable quantization, of every reasonable notion of classical observables, right? I mean, if f is a classical, if say L is a classical observable, then F after L. Then F after L should also be a classical observable, L to the three should also be a classical observable, right? I mean, yeah. If somebody stretches your scale, then your apparatus is still the same, right? Yeah, yeah, but no one says that you should apply the same quantization rules. I mean, I like what you are asking, seems natural, but the usual wisdom on quantization is that it's very fragile. Like, I mean, you are just I mean, you are just showing that it's even more fragile, but that you could choose some generators and quantize those. And I don't know why, but that seems to be the thing to do. Anyway, thank you. Okay. Thanks for your question. Yeah. There are no other questions. Let me just continue on the line of this is Alejandro Koricikai with this line of. With this line of questioning that José Antonio was making, I think I don't want to talk, I mean, take all the opinion of a physicist, but I think there's at least a subset of physicists that have understood for a very long time. I mean, started with these no-go theorems of Vironevald and so on, that there is no hope in having a functor which represents quantization, right? So, I think some people are happy with what Josantonio was saying: that you only take a small subset of classical observers that are enough to generate functions on phase space. And this condition you are asking that you should have arbitrary functions is probably not necessary for that purpose. Yeah, but it's not, sorry, it's not necessary, it's not arbitrary functions. It's not arbitrary functions, it's only that I have a subset that is invariant under scale stretching. Yeah, yeah, this is. I mean, this is somehow, I mean, I couldn't imagine any notion of measurement without that condition. I mean, yeah, because of the Skedung experiment, you know, I mean, just the colleague experiment. So, yeah, I mean, this is showing that this is what you are asking, since your conclusion is that this doesn't work, then probably this is not the case. This doesn't work, then probably this is not the right thing to ask, right? So, I think linearity is not right. No, no, I think linearity is wrong. No, I think, I mean, no, I think the viewpoint of a physicist would be that this is all very nice mathematics and all these no-go theorems are great, but that this is just telling us that the assumptions or whatever we want to impose on this quantization map is not right because quantum mechanics works. Quantum mechanics doesn't care about your quantization methods, right? Methods, right? Because the world is quantum. We know how it works. We have very good experimental verification of quantum mechanics. And if we are unable to find some quantization map, that's on us, that's not on nature, right? So we shouldn't impose our notions of what should be valid or not, just because we cannot find a map. That is my viewpoint on this. That doesn't mean that it's not very nice mathematical work. That is not very nice mathematical work. That's great. And it's very good to have all these logo theorems and understand what the limitations are. But I think the fundamental viewpoint from a physicist would be the other way around. Yeah, but I'd say that, okay, I mean, you can work with mathematically inconsistent objects for a certain while, but after that while you have to come up with some definition, like, for example, the data distribution. Of course, physicists could work with it, but after a while, you could. Sorry. Sorry, but we don't work with mathematical inconsistent. I mean, we work with a Hilbert space and we decide that certain operators that are well defined represent physical quantities that we understand. And then when those calculations, predictions, and everything works fine, then that's your theory, it's consistent. Probably didn't come from a quantization map that was unique, starting from some classical observations. Some classical observable this and that, but that's not but that I'm not sure whether this is true. I mean, whether quantum mechanics is really or quantum theory is really that well confirmed. I mean, at least the class of experiments we are performing is very, very restricted. I mean, for example, think of bound states. I think bound states are quite unexplored. And therefore, I mean, it's always the same class of Of Strei experiment, I mean, like the practice, what is it in English? Felix, Schrei experimenter, help me out. Like scattering experiment. Scattering theory, right? The scattering experiments of a certain class. And we are putting many, many things at hand. So at least from my understanding. So I think I would not 100% agree with. 100% agree with the position that quantum theory works completely well and is completely mathematically consistent. But okay, I mean, we can certainly discuss about this. I mean, this just, yeah, there can be different viewpoints on this. Okay. So there's no more questions. Let's. There is a question from Felix. Okay, yes. just to just so i mean just a short comment i mean i i agree with this kind of bow is not really fully understood and but also agree with alejandro that's kind of it's it doesn't seem essential to also have this quantization map i mean if i have like just a pure quantum theory which is consistent and well defined then i'm happy no matter if there exists like a mapping from There exists like a mapping from classical observables into the operators. Or a quantization relation. I mean, quantization, of course, it's nice to have such a quantization, but it doesn't seem to be crucial for mathematical consistency of quantum theory. So, therefore, in this sense, I agree with Alejandro here. Thank you. So, if there's no more There's no more questions or comments. Let's thank the speaker again. And then there is an announcement from the organizers, so don't go away. Okay, yes. So yeah, with this, basically, we are ending the conference. Are you ending the conference? Well, before saying the final words, there's another chance for a discussion right now. So of those of you that want to stay on, both here presentially in Okaka and on Zoom, we have some more time for discussion now. But anyway, we close the official part of the The official part of the conference now. And so, Professor Malis and I would like to thank everybody for either coming here personally to join us for this conference or on Zoom. And we hope that it was a positive experience for you and that you found maybe some inspiration with something that you haven't seen before or made contact with somebody that. Somebody that maybe you will work on in the future, and hope that this conference has fostered to some extent an exchange that can continue in the future, both in the community in Mexico and beyond the borders of Mexico. Okay, thank you. Okay, so now, as I said, we have some additional time for discussions. So let me see if I can. So it could be either about the talks we've seen today, also about previous subjects that we have seen. So is there somebody that wants So is there somebody that wants to wants to start? Can we have a view here where we see the Zoom participants? Yes. To have here that. This is oh wait maybe like this no um wait like this okay yeah now it's working okay so somebody wants to start or Okay, so let me start with another question for Olaf. Sorry. So yeah, sorry to insist on this question of the non-linearity again, but I mean, one thing that you might be worried about is, for example, if you think of observables that are like characteristic functions. Like characteristic functions on phase space or something like this. And where in the quantum theory, you would expect these to correspond to, I mean, asking a question like, is the system in this part of phase space or not? So basically, that correspond to a yes-no question and where you expect the answer to be a probability. And then, of course, if you have probabilities, you have to respect the have to respect the rules that i mean probabilities for for exclusive questions add and and also inequality relations between probabilities all this has to be preserved when we go to the quantization so so my question would be uh would this uh non-linearity that you're introducing if uh Using if possibly violate probability rules. Could you repeat the question? The last one? Yeah, I. Yeah. Okay. So certain observables in the classical theory correspond to questions that can be interpreted in a probabilistic way, in a sense of a Way in the sense of a yes-no answer. And the quantum theory, what it should give us when we evaluate the corresponding observable is the probability for an affirmative answer. And of course, if, for example, we have two questions that are, for example, is the system in Is the system in a certain part of the phase space, or it is in some other disjoint part, then, of course, these possibilities should exclude each other. And that has to be reflected in the probabilities. Or, for example, if we are asking a more inclusive question, let's say the system might be in region A or B, then the probability should be the sum of the two individual regions. So this kind of basic. Uh, this is the kind of basic rules of probabilistic reasoning should be preserved. And would that be the case if you have such a non-linear quantization rule? Ah, I can see no direct connection between I mean, usually this probabilistic rules, those probabilistic rules, they Probabilistic rules they correspond to unitary evolution, unitary evolutions, right? I mean, this is somehow more connected to the linearity and the form of the operators themselves. I mean, the operators should certainly be self-adjoint linear operators on Hilbert space, but the correspondence between classical observables and quantum Classical observables and quantum observables need not be linear. I don't think there is a connection between this and between the linearity of a quantization map and a probabilistic interpretation. It's more unitarity of, yeah, I mean, of the evolution operator, which is connected to the hermeticity of the Hamiltonian, but not so much. So much, or is there a connection you have in mind? Okay, so I'm not referring to unitarity or not if you preserve total probabilities by unitary. I'm referring to doing measurements and let's say thinking of a measurement that can have n different outcomes. And of course, you want the probabilities for these outcomes to add up to one. So I'm not talking about the unitary evolution. I'm really talking about observing. I'm really talking about observables that correspond to measurements. But I don't, yeah, okay. I don't think it is connected to pro. I mean, but it's a good question. I've never thought of this problem. Yeah.  So maybe you will have to think about this more. Yeah, this is what I said. I mean, sorry, I've never thought about it. I think it I have not an answer right now, but But if I find one, I let you know. Sorry. Yes, good. Because I brought it up because I think that's a very important constraint to satisfy the monetization rule. Okay. Do we have other questions? It can also be referring to talks of previous days or some other subject that maybe has came up with in respect to some talk that we saw or another discussion we had previously. Yeah, we can also, I mean. Yeah, we can also. I mean, it's just really the Congress proper is ended, so it's a completely optional thing, just if there's interest. So that's also, unfortunately, of course, many people on Zoom have cannot be here anymore. And also here in Oaxaca, a sizable fraction of people has had to leave already. Fraction of people has had to leave already. So maybe I have a question to Alejandro, if he's still there. Okay. Yes, go ahead. So because, I mean, you made me curious. So is it you've you've told that there are that you prefer versions of quantum theory without any quantization relation? Is there one? I mean, is there an honest version of quantum theory? Honest version of quantum theory without binding classical observables to quantum observables. I hadn't found one. So if there is one, I mean, maybe Felix model would be maybe a good candidate for this, for this. But apart from this. So I don't think I say that I. So, I don't think I say that I want quantum theory with no mapping. What I'm saying is that some physicists are happy with some very restricted quantization map that just looks at the subset of the algebra of classical observers, which has certain properties and for which there is a mapping. Is a mapping, like a Dirac quantization, say, satisfying these linearity properties and so on. And that's it. This is like a kinematical quantization. The Dirac quantization rule is satisfied for this subset of classical observers. And that's it. And then from there, you build your quantum representation, you have a unique. You have a unique representation of these observables, and there any other observable that was not in this set, then you don't have a prescription on how to represent it in the Hilbert space. But then that's up to you and experimental verification. So there in principle infinite possibilities. So this is what is called the ambiguity. Called the ambiguities in the quantization of certain operators. But then there's no rule, and one has to live with the fact that one has to make proposals and then check whether those proposals represent physically the quantity that we want to model. So that's what we have in practice. And I'm not saying that this is the best. I'm not saying that this is the best we can have, but at least this is a working quantization prescription. And if, of course, I think it's very important to understand the limits, right? I mean, how far can we go? We know that we cannot go all the way to all classical observables because of all these theorems, but it would be nice to see how far we can go. Like these two extremes, very small set or all the. Very small set or all observables. So there should be a point in which this kind of mappings start failing. And as far as I know, I know there is no complete understanding where this boundary is. Okay, thanks. Okay, thanks, Alejandro. Okay, thanks, Alejandro. So then let me ask a question that goes back to Monday, I think, about Ros Antonio's talk. So he was talking about a very interesting way of gluing field theories on pieces of manifolds. And so a question I had for him. And so, a question I had for him was: I mean, since you, José Antonio, have also done extensive work on gauge theory, is that the way you presented it? Does it work for gauge theory in the way you presented it, or does that need additional ingredients? The short answer is that it doesn't. Answer is that it doesn't need any additional ingredients, just it changes, but there is a version for HTR of, I mean, at the same level of work in progress. So you didn't present it, right? No, I didn't present it, but just what happens there is that what you assign values to are not points, but paths or And they were paths modulus on equivalence class, but this will call the in the in the same way, and then the Hilbert space construction would just follow the same logic. So I didn't present it, but at the same level of incompleteness. And just say that another comment related to the relation to gauge theory is that the reason why The reason why I discovered that this thing was possible in the sense of an idea that looks possible, but I have not finished it, was because of work that is finished done with one in gauge theories in trying to understand how to understand gauge theories in little pieces, but not at complete definiteness, but only up to some. Up to some homotopy things. And that was natural to ask in the realm of trying to work in a quantum field theory with a cutoff like that cut off used in lattice-based theories. But so it came from the same mathematics of that. Just this part an idea that I had before, and that was it. So comotopy theory was kind of the central part of that. The central part of that, and some results of understanding homotopy in the sense of gluing pieces. But when one talks about homotopy, we think that it's just homotopy fixes maybe one or two points and then it's up to complete variations with the homotopy I was talking to and the theorems are up to some filtration. And when the filtration was adequate, it was not, it was kind of misleading to think about. Misleading to think about real homotopies. It's more the homotopies of that we have in gauge theories where things kind of you can go in a path and then go back and you get the identity. The same kind of rule is the one that applies there. So it was not a real homotopy, but that filtered homotopy that became sink homotopy that is almost like no condition at all. Okay. Okay, thanks. Another question or okay, so then yeah, so we definitely close now the discussion session and the conference. And thanks again, everybody, for attending. Again, everybody for attending. Thank you.
