So, I'm going to talk about modeling of something called ferroelectric pneumatic liquid crystals. Yaniv yesterday already mentioned liquid crystals. So, those of you who have not familiar with this concept have already seen. Already seen some aspects of modeling. My version of the model is related to a different kind of a liquid crystal, which in addition to orientation, local orientation, local molecular orientation, is also described by spontaneous selective polarization. Selectric polarization. So, locally, this kind of material is described by a pair of a vector p and line segment n. So one is directional, another one is directionless. And one in principle can manipulate the orientation of this couple by applying an electric field, but But I'm not going to discuss it here. So, for our purposes, this is just a material which is described by two fields: a vector field and a line field. As we'll see, in the experiments, it's characterized by the presence of domain walls. And the purpose of my talk is to describe a simple model which captures structures that are observed. Structures that are observed in experiments. So, immediately, I'm going to make some simplifying assumptions. I'm going to assume that vector, polarization vector, and directionless director are parallel at all points of the sample, so I can dispense with the director and describe the material just by a single vector. In principle, these materials can flow, they can Well, these materials can flow, they can have electric kinetics. So, all of that I'm going to forget about. And in fact, I'm going to assume that material is in the form of a two-dimensional finfel. But I will allow the vector, the polarization vector, to be three-dimensional. All right, so we introduced the elastic energy similar to Energy similar to what Yaniev showed yesterday, except that I'm not going to have this vector tau that induced the twist in this talk. So there are three possible modes of deformation of P, splay, twist, and bend, respectively. So these are three modes of elastic deformation. They have coefficients k1, k2, k3. And the relative sizes of those coefficients actually describe the whole story here, are important. In addition, a polarization vector everywhere wants to have a certain value of a certain magnitude P0, which I'm going to impose not as a constraint, but as a penalty. And also on the top and the bottom. And also on the top and the bottom surfaces of the film. So, in this formula, I'm assuming that the film is still three-dimensional. On the top and the bottom surfaces of the film, there is additional penalty which forces the third component of polarization to vanish if this parameter gamma in front is sufficiently large. So that means that the vector. The vector on the top and the bottom surface of the film tends to be oriented parallel to the surface of the film. You can non-dimensionalize a model. In a non-dimensional form, it takes this expression. So there is a, and actually, let me simply not, I don't have time to describe various terms here, but Describe various terms here, but they all come from the formula from the equation on the previous, from the definition on the previous page. Immediately, I'm going to assume that, again, the film is two-dimensional, so there is no Z-dependence of anything here. So, Z-dependence can be dropped. And therefore, in a non-dimensional form, we have this expression. So, if you look at it, it basically resembles. It basically resembles the Ginsburg-Landau energy, the two-dimensional Ginsburg-Landau energy, in terms of a second and a third term, except that in this case, this energy is multiplied by a parameter epsilon, which is going to be important later on. And then the divergence is its own term here. So in this form of the equation, This form of the equation, what I'm assuming that non-dimensional coefficients k1, k2, k3 are ordered in a specific way. That the coefficient in front of a divergence is of order one, and aggressive elastic coefficients are small of order epsilon. And so, in what follows, there is a small parameter epsilon, small parameter delta, gamma and l are of order one. And then everything, let me see if I everything here then depends on who is going to be smaller, epsilon or delta. If delta is smaller, then it forces P3 to be zero, so then your vector field P is going to be going to have values in 2D, so from 2D to 2D. From 2D to 2D. And then this basically looks like a Ginsburg-Landau energy plus some additional term that is due to divergence. So the energy of them will take this form. And on the contrary, if epsilon is much less on delta, then the Ginzburg-Landau term will force the vector p to have magnitude 1. Magnitude one. So P3 then is going to be expressible in terms of the projection of P onto the plane P1, P2. And so then everything again can be expressed in terms of a vector P, script P. And what you get is still something that looks like a two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy, except that it has an extra term that comes from P3, but P3 is dependent on a projection. Is dependent on the projection to the plane script P because of the resulting land constraint. So then, epsilon less than delta or delta less than epsilon, you actually end up working with similar objects, except that in one case, your values are in phi D, in another case in 2D. So, this type of energies have already been studied by By me in collaboration with Peter Stemberg and Ragov. The encounter month a few years ago, we basically looked at a mathematical problem which did not have really any clear experimental or physical, no obvious physical relevance. So it was a model in a search of physical experiment. And in this case, we actually found that experiment. So let me very briefly So, let me very briefly describe what I'm doing here. So, you have an energy similar to what I described on previous slides. It's a Ginsburg-Landau energy where Ginzburg-Landau terms are multiplied by epsilon. So this looks basically like an Alenkan kind of a contribution. And then the divergence term, which has a penalty L of order one. Order one. And I'm interested in what is going to happen to minimizers of this kind of energy when the parameter epsilon is going to go to zero. Very quickly, if L is zero and we divide by epsilon, we recover a Ginsburg-Landau energy, which we know is characterized, minimizers of which are characterized by the presence of vortices. Of vortices. And on the other hand, if we let L go to infinity, so then the cost of a divergence goes to infinity, divergence will go to zero almost everywhere, and then the problem basically reduces to the Villa's giga type energy. So that means that the energy functional we're working with is sort of an intermediate. Object intermediate between Avila's Giga, which is characterized by, with minimizers, characterized by wall-type singularities, and Gisborg-Landau, which is characterized by presence of vortexes. Just a quick comment here. So, one unusual thing for people who are familiar with Ginsburg-Landau here is that certain types of vortices, vortex like this, Niemann. A vortex like this, a pneumatic hedgehog, because it has non-zero divergence, a singularity like this will incur a cost which is going to be of order log epsilons, like we are familiar from the Gizzer-Plan Dauph theory. But vortex, again, a vortex of degree one, where all vectors are rotated by 90 degrees. Vectors are rotated by 90 degrees, for which the divergence is going to be equal to zero. A vortex like that is going to have an energy of order epsilon log epsilon. So vortices of different kinds are going to have radically, drastically different energy associated with it. I'm going to skip this slide. So basically, So basically, let me just say what do you expect from minimizers when epsilon is small. Essentially, in a limit epsilon goes to zero, the only term that remains relevant is divergence. And so you would expect to consider maps that belong to a space H div, which are allowed to have line singularities. have line singularities. And in addition to that, the cost of not the cost, but the normal component must be continuous. So this is a numerical picture which shows both vector u and magnitude of a vector u, which minimize energy, one-dimensional energy. Well, not two-dimensional version of energy that I discussed. Of energy that I described before, and you see it numerically that for small epsilon, you see line singularities. All right, so for the limiting problem, then we expect two things. We expect that because of the presence of the Ginsburg-Planda potential, limiting maps are going to be as one-valued. And number two, because the cost of divergence Divergent square must remain finite. We also are looking at maps in HDF. All right. So again, just skipping the details, we're able to follow the techniques of Decimonic Cohen, Miller, and Otto for the Ivy Lexigiga functional to prove compactness. giga functional to prove compactness and and uh also by restricting considering the maps in hdf but also in bv we can compute exactly what the cost of a domain wall is supposed to be again this is similar to the what you see in the village giga uh in a limit along the line singularity so Along the line singularities, the cost is going to be cubicle in terms of a jump of U on the singularity. I'm going to skip all of these famous well-known references. So in our case, we're able to show that the gamma limit of our energy is going to consist of three countries. Three contributions, essentially two contributions. Divergence contribution persists in the limit, and then along the line singularities, there is a cost associated with the jump of U along the line singularities. Line singularities also can form along the boundary, so there is a cost associated with not matching the boundary condition. And so we're able to prove a gamma limit under this. able to prove a gamma limit under these assumptions. Not only were we able to prove a gamma limit, but we're also able to describe minimizers of a limiting functional. In particular, you can derive the following Lagrange equation that the gradient of a divergence of a minimizing field must be parallel to. Minimizing field must be parallel to a vector u itself. And you can also derive various relationships on the boundary on the jump set. Furthermore, it is quite easy to show that in this case, if we set divergence to be, divergence of a vector field to be this scalar value v. Value V, then both V and the lifting of U satisfy this system of conservation laws that are supported on the same set of characteristics. And these characteristics are going to be as follows. Let me just point out a couple of things here: that divergence is going to be constant along the characteristics, and theta is linear. And theta is linear along the characteristics. And so that means that all characteristics are going to be the lines of constant curvature. And in fact, they're all circles. In a limit when divergence become equal to zero, those characteristics reduce to straight lines like they should for a VLS giga case. And so, with that, I'm sharing here a couple of I'm sharing here a couple of numerical simulations with that. So you can see that you develop walls, you develop crosstae walls. I don't have time to go into details again. This is a counterplot of divergence. And what I want to point out here is that we can actually use Can actually use a method of characteristics to reconstruct analytically the solutions that we obtain numerically. So there are quite a few details of how to do that, but you can reproduce exactly the field that you obtain numerically analytically. So here, this is one quarter of the domain, and you see the And you see the contour lines of divergence, which are actually characteristics. And so one quarter of this picture matches a quarter of matches the picture on the left. All right, so now what does this have to do with these ferroelectric pneumatics? So they are described basically by this energy that I just told you about. And so here I'm going to And so, here I'm going to show you a couple of several simulations for minimizers of this energy when epsilon is a small parameter. And here is the kind of things that you see that if, for example, you have a rectangular domain like this, you assume that on the bottom, the boundary data corresponds to a circularly oriented. Oriented vector field with a center around this point. And then everywhere else, on all other parts of the boundary, the vector field points in a negative direction. So it's basically parallel to x-axis. Then this vector field forms a singularity in the form of a parabolic wall with a defect inside here. Inside here. And again, numerically, you get a wall. This is actually a known fact from the time of the Greeks that in order to satisfy the boundary conditions that the normal component of the vector field is continuous across a singularity, then the singularity must be in the form of a parabola. So this parabola can be obtained both by using method characteristics and by By using method characteristics and by numerics. I'm going to skip this detail. So if we look at the domain for which once again, actually, no, for this domain, we're assuming that the vector field is pointing in the direction of the x-axis. In the direction of x-axis on all sides, and then there is a perforation in the form of a circle, and on that circle, the vector field is going to be tangential to the circle itself. So, this is being resolved in the following way: that again, you have a parabolic singularity with some secondary parabola pointing in the opposite direction. And so basically, this picture is of a magnitude and a projection of the vector onto the domain. And then if you look at the experimental pictures, they are essentially quite the same. You see a parabola, you see a secondary parabola, and you see a vortex. You can do multiple perforations, and again, there is a match between numerics and the experiment. And you can do this for several perforations. And what is more interesting here is that if you have a third component, non-zero third component, then it is possible that along the wall, the third component is going to deviate. Is going to deviate either towards the observer or away from the observer, towards us or into the plane of the film. And actually, what forms is also a point defect where the fur component is negative on one side and positive on another side. And I think my time is up, so probably that's it.
