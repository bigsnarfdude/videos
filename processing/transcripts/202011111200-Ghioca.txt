Thanks, the organizers, for inviting me to give this talk. And indeed, I'll be talking about two conjectures that I think all of us know in characteristic zero. So the dynamical Mordelan conjecture and the so-called Zariski dense orbit conjecture. But I'm going to focus most of my talk on their counterparts in characteristic P. Counterparts in characteristic P. So in positive characteristics. So first the dynamical Mordecai conjecture. Just to set up things for the rest of the talk. A lot of times I'm going to talk about non-negative integers. So I'm also going to include the zero to the positive integers. The typical thing for all of us in algebraic dynamics, the notation for the orbit and for the iterate of a map, nothing spectacular there. There, but just for the dynamical Mord-Delane conjecture, it's kind of useful to talk about an arithmetic progression for which the common difference, the so-called A, in my notation that in A n plus B, I am allowing it to be zero, which is kind of weird or funny, whatever you want to call it, because in that case, A n plus B, that normally infinite arithmetic progression just collapses to a single term. Just collapses to a single term. But I like this kind of convention because then the dynamical Mord-DeLan conjecture, which will be abbreviated at least in my slides through DML, is stated very cleanly as follows. So given any endomorphism of a quasi-projective variety defined over a field of characteristic zero, if I have any endomorphism of X, then I. Then I'm looking at all the n's, non-negative integers for which the iterate phi n of alpha of a given point, alpha lands in the in a given sub-variety v of x. Well, that set, the structure of that set is expected to be very nice. So a finite union of arithmetic progressions. Again, like I said, at least in this company, I'm sure all of us have seen the statement before, so I'm not gonna insist more on. Before, so I'm not going to insist more on this. I'm only going to talk very briefly of what of some of the results known in characteristic zero. There are several technical results known, but I'm going to just mention that it is true the DML conjecture for unramified endomorphism of a smooth variety. It is true also for an endomorphism of the affine plane. And more generally, it is true for the It is true for the coordinate-wise action of one-variable polynomials when the sub-variety v of the affine space is just a curve. But like I said, there are many cases when it's not known. And at least for me, the first or let's say the next interesting case would be the case of an arbitrary endomorphism of A3. I mean, you can argue that. I mean, you can argue that perhaps also other cases are just as interesting, but if you're just focusing on a low-dimensional ambient space, AC3 would be like a natural choice to test the DML conjecture. Obviously, sometimes I am asked, are there known any counter examples? No, there are no counterexamples. No, personally, I don't expect that there will be any counterexample. It's just that it's one hard conjecture. It's one hard conjecture, that's all. Now, what happens in positive characteristics? So, from you know, from the beginning, I should say the statement fails in the statement that I had it before, that all that you get is a finite union of arithmetic progressions for the so called return set, the set of all n's for which phi n of alpha lands on the sub variety. Lens on the sub-variety. And this is maybe like the classical counterexample. Many people came up with this when they first considered DML in characteristic P. I'm just taking an automorphism of the affine plane, which is given over Fp of T by just multiplication on the first coordinate by T, multiplication on the second coordinate by 1 minus T. And then Minus t and then the sub-variety is just the line x plus y equals 1. So then the return set, so the set of all those n's for which phi n of the starting point 1, 1, landing on this line, x plus y equals 1, is no longer going to be an arithmetic progression, but instead it's the set of all powers of p, of the characteristic of the field. And this Of the field, and this comes easily from the fact that you're just solving a kind of simple equation now: t to power n plus one minus t to power n equals one, but you're solving it in characteristic p. So as opposed to characteristic zero, when there wouldn't be too many solutions and in characteristic p, there are many solutions, and they are precisely the powers of p. So I hope. So, I hope this example is clear. As always, please interrupt me if maybe I'm going too fast. I'm trying to maybe coordinate a little bit also if the time, so I know that I'm not flying through the slides. I've got a question, Dragos. I've got a question, Dragos. Yes, yes. Generally, in this DML, the field K, what is assumed about K? Nothing? So, in characteristic zero. In characteristic zero, nothing. And also, in characteristic p, I shouldn't assume anything. Of course, if I assume that k is fp bar, okay, so it's just the algebraic closure of a finite field and everything is defined over a finite field, then the problem is not that interesting because every point would have a finite orbit. So then the intersection of that finite orbit with any sub-variety would be well understood. So the return set in that case, yes. So, the return set in that case, yes, it would be a finite union of arithmetic progressions. But as long as you go to a transcendental extension of Fp bar, okay, or Fp, just like I had there, Fp of T, then the problem indeed becomes quite interesting. You have all these examples which essentially come from the Frobenius. That's kind of the red herring throughout the entire talk. I mean, all of this DML and even DML and even the Zariski dense orbit conjecture. At the end of the day, we're exploiting the type of examples that people such as yourself, Woody, and others, you realize that you encounter for the classical more the length conjecturing characteristic P. So the Frobenius is the culprit here. The Frobenius creates. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So what I want to So, what I want to also say in a couple more examples is that you get even more ugly or interesting, depending on your taste, examples of return sets S. For example, and this is just a slight twist of the previous example when I consider now a line defined by tx plus 1 minus t times y equals 1 and the endomorphic. The endomorphism now of A2, again, it's just an automorphism, is given by this type of multiplication by T2P square minus 1, respectively, 1 minus T2P squared minus 1 on the two coordinate axis of A2. And again, the starting point is 1,1. It's literally just a twist of the previous example because after you untangle this particular example. Know this particular example, you're getting almost the same thing as before in the sense that the return set, the set of all n's for which phi n of um one, one lands on this line, it's going to involve powers of p. But I want to present this example just so you see the powers of p that you obtain, they could be a little bit strange, right? I mean, there exists a constant which is not even an integer constant, it's a rational. Even an integer constant, it's a rational constant in front of p to n. And again, a nice feature: it doesn't have to be p to power n, it could be p to some constant, like 2 in this example. I can make the constant to be arbitrary. If I would have played with p cube in this example, I would have gotten p to 3n and then minus again a rational number. Essentially, this return set, obviously, it's still a set. Obviously, it's still a set of positive integers, which is the set of numbers of the form one plus p squared plus p to power four plus p to power six up to some p to two n. That's the return set. But like I said, if you strictly express it in terms of powers of p, it looks quite different than the previous example, especially with these rational coefficients. And there could be even more. And there could be even more happening. And this example, which again is an automorphism of A3 this time, once you want to construct more and more complicated examples, you have to enlarge the ambient space and also consider some varieties that have higher dimensions. So this time we're considering a hyperplane, so a surface in A3, which is given by that equation. Quite a nice equation. Equation, quite nice equation, y plus z minus 2x equals 2. Again, the starting point is just 111. And this time, when you actually solve the equation phi n of alpha landing on this hyperplane, so you're essentially saying t to power n plus one plus one plus t to power n plus one minus t to power n minus two times t to power n equals to two. Well, those n's. Well, those n's must be now sums of two powers of p. Okay? So it's not even as before, just a single power of p with maybe some constants attached to it. No, this time it's actually two powers of p. You need to have it like this. And again, I just had enough room in my example to accommodate this type of example in the sense that. Of example in the sense that, really, in order to have sums of two powers of p for this return set, you need the sub-variety to have at least dimension two. You wouldn't be able to do this type of example with a curve. And if the sub-variety has dimension two, then for sure also the ambient space has to be at least of dimensions three, because if the sub-variety is the whole thing, then you get all the ends. It's not this return set. Return set. So, all of this suggests the following counterpart of the dynamical Morde-Length conjecture in characteristic P. So, again, the same setup as before with an arbitrary quasi-projective variety defined. Oops, I said the field of characteristic zero. Sorry about this. Characteristic P, important thing. I was sorry about this slides because I was saying dynamic modern length conjecturing positive characteristics. Length conjecture in positive characteristic, but I was saying field k of characteristic zero. No, characteristic p, obviously. Sorry about this, important characteristic p, we're talking now. And we have an endomorphism. Then for any sub-variety, looking at the point, at the iterates for which of a given point alpha that land on that sub-variety, we're expecting to get also a finite union of arithmetic. Also, a finite union of arithmetic progressions, but there should be also these new sets that appeared in all the previous examples. And these sets can be characterized as follows. They are linear combinations with some prescribed coefficients. So those CJ that you see in relation one, they will be given. Okay, so they are fixed. Also, the Kjs, the non-negative. The non-negative integers kj that appear at the exponent, they are also given. If you think of the previous example here, and kj could be 2, like you're seeing in this example. In this example, you have that the k is 2, and then you have the coefficients to be 1 over p squared minus 1, for example. And then the mj's, indeed, they vary among all the non-negative. Among all the non-negative integers. So essentially, you're getting linear combinations of powers of p, but we're allowing here any prescribed coefficients, which could be even rational coefficients. And as I said, at the exponent, you can have this type of twist, not just simple powers of p, they could be powers of p squared or p cube or whatever. Or P cube or whatever, so that's why the KJ's appear here. Maybe there are any questions. Yes. You have a bound for M, conjectural bound for M, like an individual. Yes, I mean, like I was explaining in the previous example here, the M, what Kwai is asking here, should definitely be bounded in terms of the dimension of the sub-variety. So M cannot be more. M cannot be more than the dimension of V. I think this can be even proven directly in the sense that a set like this cannot occur for an intersection with a variety of dimension less than M. So yeah, that's one thing. Yeah. I got another question. Do you have an idea that if you write down any set of this form one that you should? Write down any set of this form one that you should be able to find some way to attain that, yeah. So, I guess Rob Rob was asking again, I'm not seeing everyone. Yeah, so hi, Rob. Uh, yeah, that's a good question. And essentially, what I will be discussing next will kind of give an well, let's say, sufficient indication that the answer to your question should be in the affirmative, which is quite scary in the sense that you can get a really weird set. Really weird sets like this. And yeah, so let me get even to maybe the simplest case where the dynamical modeling conjecture was considered in characteristic zero. And in that case, it was quite easily proven. The case of I was just wondering, did you say that you can get all sets like can you? I mean, subject to some. I mean, subject to some issues. Yes, I can think that I'm expecting this because we can prove that the type of equations one needs to solve are sufficiently general so that almost any set like this can appear. Now, there is no proof exactly to the statement that you're asking that Rob asked. No, it's not, we don't have a proof that indeed we can. Don't have a proof that indeed we can get every single set. That would be quite cool. But is there at least a precise conjecture about exactly which sets you can get? No, no, or at least I'm not aware of. No. Okay. Okay. So, okay. So what I was saying is the case that in characteristic zero was quite easy, in characteristic P, already it's quite difficult. And that's the case of just regular. The case of just regular self-maps of Tori. Okay, so you have such a map, and okay, so why I say regular self-map? Because I allow also translation, so they're not necessarily algebraic group endomorphisms, they're algebraic group endomorphism composed with a translation. So then the conjecture that I previously stated, we together with Pietro and Tom and Umberto, we proved it. And Tom and Umberto, we proved it in the case when the dimension of the sub-variety is at most two, and also when phi is a group endomorphism, and there exists no non-trivial connected algebraic subgroup of the tori, so that phi or an iterate of phi would induce the action of a power of the Frobenius on this proper subtorus. In other words, it's more simple to express. More simple to express it if you want to with linear algebra because the action of phi is like I was saying the composition of a translation with an algebraic group endomorphism which is just given by n by n matrix A with integer entries. And this condition too is equivalent to saying that this matrix A has no eigenvalue which is multiplicatively dependent with respect to P. So that's what we're assuming. What we're assuming. So, if you're just looking at the statement, it seems like quite restrictive. I mean, either you can prove the result for an arbitrary variety V, but assuming that the action of phi doesn't resemble at all the Frobenius, this is, you know, in quotes, I'm putting here in quotes, really what 2 says. What we're saying is that even when you restrict an iterative fire. You restrict an iterative phi on any proper algebraic subgroup of GMN, you don't get the power of the Frobenius. So, really, phi is as far as it gets from being Frobenius. And the other option when we can prove it is when the variety is very small dimension, just at most two. So, on the face of it, especially comparing to what is known for the dynamic. Comparing to what is known for the dynamical Morden-Lengian characteristic zero, it seems like extremely restrictive. The dynamical Morden-Langian characteristic zero for Tori was kind of simple. It was not that complicated, you know, compared to some of the other results that were later obtained. But why is this difficult in characteristic P? And I'm going to explain. First, the strategy. The strategy is quite classical, I would say. I mean, the I would say. I mean, the point is when you have any regular self-map of a tori, you can arrange that for any starting point there exists a finitely generated subgroup that captures the orbit. So the entire orbit lies inside that subgroup gamma. So that's again something standard. And then you have a big tool at your disposal. And this is something that. Disposal. And this is something that Rahim Musa and Tom Scan proved about 15 years ago, maybe even a little more than 15 years ago. I was still at Berkeley at the time. And it's still a very, very powerful result because it gives a complete understanding of the intersection between a sub-variety in their result, in their full result, was for a semi-abelian variety defined of. Variety defined over FP bar, so an isotrivial semi-abelian variety. So the intersection of a sub-variety of such a isotrivial semi-abelian variety with any finitely generated subgroup. And there was a very neat description just in terms of what they called F sets, F standing for Frobenius. For us in GMN, we could just call them P set, the Frobenius being just raising. Being just raising x to power p, but I'm still gonna stick to f set. And the description, as it's written in my slide, is just mixed, it lives in a mixed world of an algebraic, of just a subgroup, which is H, and this products of orbits, or you know, more generally, if you like, sums of orbits, if you're thinking of. Of orbits, if you're thinking of the group action represented additively. So I'm writing it as a product of gamma j to p again to k j and j. And this reflects also what was proven by Woody Khrushchevsky originally for the Morde-Lanc conjecture in characteristic T, in the sense that the special sub-varieties, the ones that Varieties, the ones that have a Zariski-dense intersection with a finitely generated subgroup, they live in this mixed world. They are a combination of groups, but also sub-varieties defined over a finite field. However, going from Woody's theorem to this very precise description of the intersection does require quite some work. And like I said, it's a very, very Like I said, it's a very, very neat result. But this is an important thing because, like I said, for us, we view the orbit inside the finitely generated subgroup. Then, based on the work of Rahim and Tom, we know the intersection of that finitely generated subgroup with the Savariet V. So, then all that you're left is understand what iterates of the given starting point alpha. Starting point alpha would actually land on such a union, I mean, on such a F set, which has the description above. I should say for step three, really the interesting and the difficult case is when the subgroup H is trivial. So, really, in your mind, you can just forget about Hi, just the subgroups of gamma. Just the subgroups of gamma, you could just focus on this type of F sets, okay, which look like this, right? So you have some given gamma j's, you have some given non-negative integers kj, and then you have the set of all this gamma j to p to k j and j. And the question is: okay, for which n phi n of alpha lands in such a given set. Now, what Now, what we could prove with Pietro Corva, Tom Scalon, and Umberto Zanier was the following theorem, which kind of goes back to the question that Bjorn and Rob had before, like, okay, what type of sets of the return sets you expect? And here we can prove the following, okay? So, it's a bit technical with a lot of constants being defined, but what we're saying is if you get a bunch of We're saying is if you get a bunch of positive integers that are less than some given power of p, okay, q is a power of p and I'm saying some of the ci's is less than q over 2. Then you can find an example of an endomorphism of GMN over starting point of a sub-variety. So you get an example of the dynamical Morde-Lang conjecturing characteristic P. Conjecturing characteristic P, for which the return set, so the set of all those N's is precisely the set N that satisfied the following equation. On the left-hand side, you have any given linear recurrent sequence. So any given linear recurrent sequence. And on the right-hand side, you're going to have these linear combinations of powers of Q. So here came this kind of This kind of technical assumption about the coefficient Ci, their sum is less than Q over 2. But at the end of the day, for everyone working with this type of equations, the so-called polynomial exponential equations, just the fact that you have some restriction on the constant Ci, like that one, the sum of the Ci is less than Q over 2 is an. Ci is less than q over 2 is an extremely mild restriction. Solving such an equation is the real difficulty, especially when the right-hand side contains several terms. And I'm going to explain a little bit with some example, this particular equation. So, for example, if P is larger than M, what we're saying in particular is that solving the dynamical model. Solving the dynamical mod-de-lang conjecturing characteristic P just for endomorphism of tori, just for endomorphism of tori reduces to solving such an equation in which the right-hand side is a sum of a prescribed numbers or number of powers of p. Imagine that m is 10. So you have sum of 10 powers of p. And the left-hand side is, well, a linear. Left-hand side is well, a linear recurrent sequence could be just m squared. So, solve an equation like this. This is already open when m is bigger than 5. Not even sure if for m equals 5 is actually solved, but just to be on the safe side, because people are actively working, especially on this type of equation. I said here m bigger than 5 in case people already solve the case m equals 5, but this is very difficult. Five, but this is very difficult equation. So, this is like saying I just want to find a set of all positive integers n for which their square has at most 10 non-zero digits in base P. Can you tell me what is the set of those n's? So, their square has at most 10 non-zero digits in base P. You don't know. What is expected still is that. Still, is that not just when it's m squared on the left-hand side, but when it's any linear recurrent sequence on the left-hand side, and then the right-hand side could be even more general. You could have some coefficients in front of those powers of p. The answer would be, so the set of n, so you're solving in n. So the ni's are arbitrary on the right-hand side, so they vary among all, say, non- Vary among all, say, non-negative integers, but the set of those n's for which u n would have that type of shape, as prescribed by the right-hand side, you would expect it to be a set like this. And then, yes, these type of sets could be as general as possible. Again, no proof necessarily that every single set would look like this. And also, note what we proved was. We proved was just going back here is that you're getting you're actually getting an equivalence between the dynamical Morde-Lange conjecturing characteristic P for endomorphism of tori, so complete equivalence, solving that problem is the same as solving this type of polynomial exponential equation. Now, when you go beyond the endomorphism of tori, yes, it is maybe expected to. Yes, it is maybe expected to get even uglier equations than this, and I'll say a little bit about this next. Maybe there are any questions? I'm a little confused about Ni and Nj. Are they the same or are they supposed to be different? Not necessarily. They are completely arbitrary. So the possibility of Ni equals Nj is allowed. Yes, they could be the same. So when you're looking, for example, So when you're looking, for example, at n squared equals the sum of p n i, you're thinking it this way. For which n, I can write n squared as a sum of n powers of p, but not necessarily distinct powers of p. Okay. Did I answer your question, Zenovi? I I don't know. Did it get maybe stop? I mean, I mean I can't hear you, Zenovi. So if N is of the form that you're predicting. So the NJs are fixed. Then are you making? The NJs are not fixed. No, no, no. The NJs are varying. So what we're saying here is we're looking at those ends for which n squared can be written as a sum of p n1 plus. P n1 plus p n 2 up to say p and 10, where n1 and 10 are just some arbitrary positive integers, say. And determine the structure of the set of the n, not nice, the n. So you're solving in n, the left-hand side. Okay, I mean, exactly like I was saying, just think of this question: can you describe the set of all n's for which? N's for which n squared has at most 100 digits in base two. Okay, non-zero digits in base two. So when you're saying at most a hundred non-zero digits in base two, you literally mean a sum of powers of two, but at most a hundred powers of two. And can you say what is the structure of this set? What is the structure of this set, M squared? I mean, is it something of that sort, the sum of the DJ, P2K, J and J? That's what you would expect. I mean, if M square has at most 100 non-zero digits in base 2, you would expect that N has, I don't know, maybe not more than what, 10 or stuff like this, or 20 non-zero digits in base two. You wouldn't expect. Digits in base two. You wouldn't expect that you have examples of n with a million non-zero digits in base two, but when you square n, somehow miraculously, n squared will have only 100 digits in base two. So yes, this ugly set, the return set, this one here in the bottom of the page here, so the DJPKJNJ, it says exactly this. It says exactly this: that you should have just a bounded number of powers of p with some prescribed coefficients that put together would give you the set of those ends for which n squared or more generally u n has that type of shape given by the right-hand side. So, yeah, if you have at most 100 powers of t on the right-hand side, you shouldn't have. Of t on the right-hand side, you shouldn't have that l here, uh, maybe more than 100 at the you know, at the very most. Okay, okay, so I feel like using a different letter, like instead of instead of AI, and I maybe AI. Will I miss anything if I do that? Oh, no, it's just a letter, yes. Sorry, so okay, this created the confusion, yeah, yeah. So the M. The confusion, yeah, yeah. So, the n on the left and the ni on the right have no connection, yes. Okay, so uh, why, for example, we were able to obtain the result for the self-maps of Tori in, you know, together with Pietro Tom and Umberto. In the case when the sub-variety has dimension at most two, then we're getting that the right-hand side above. The right-hand side above m in the right-hand side is at most two. So you're getting just the sum of at most two powers of t. And describing the set of ends for which this would happen, even for an arbitrarily linear recurrent sequence, that's okay. That's something that you can do. So when the right-hand side consists of few powers of p, that's fine. And it's also fine if you know something about the left-hand side. About the left-hand side, and in particular, since this is a linear recurrent sequence, if you know that no characteristic root of that linear recurrent sequence is multiplicatively dependent with respect to P, which is in line with our hypothesis of that endomorphism phi never restricting to a power of the Frobenius on any proper subtorus, these actually are the same, then the left. Same, then the left-hand side having no characteristic root multiplicatively dependent with p, then you can solve that equation on top. Here, this equation, you can solve it no matter how many powers of p you have on the right-hand side, even like a million powers. So, m is a million. But anything in between, in the sense that you're allowing the linear recurrent sequence to have characteristic roots that. To have characteristic roots that are powers of p, and also m on the right-hand side is non-necessarily 2. That's already a very difficult question. And like I was saying, if you go beyond the tori, you're going to get even uglier equations. Even when you go just to some isotrivial semi-abelian variety, what you encounter there is and essentially the proof that we have. Essentially, the proof that we have goes almost untouched to get that you need to solve now polynomial exponential equations where the left-hand side is an arbitrary linear sequence and the right-hand side is a linear combination of powers of the lambdas. I don't know if there is maybe something in chat. Let me just check chat. Ah. Okay, so a question from Joe. No, I stuck it in chat because it's not relevant. Ah, okay. But I thought it was interesting. I see, I see, I see, I see. Yes, I think there are a lot of interesting things that can be asked here. Already, it's quite difficult, and this is surprising that even for tori, the problem is actually very difficult because it is equivalent with such. Because it is equivalent with such deep questions in the fine-tain approximation. Oops, I hope I. Okay, I thought that I am frozen for a second. Okay, now if you go beyond the isotrival semi-Abelian varieties, things are completely off the charts. I mean, yes, just for abelian varieties of trivial trace, then you actually encounter the classical DML problem in characteristic zero. Problem in characteristic zero, even though you're working in characteristic P, if the trace is zero over FT bar, then the problem is not going to even allow for this exotic return sets. The return sets are just a finite union of arithmetic progressions. But beyond the semi-abelian varieties, just working on this problem, on the projective space, on idea, fine space. Or an idea, find space, I think it's completely wide open. So I think it's a very difficult question, and I hope just the case of Tori showed this. So unless there are any other questions, I'm going to move to the second problem, which I was hoping to even spend more time on, the second problem, but probably I'm not going to have more time on the second question here. So this second question is the Zariski densorbit conjecture. Bit conjecture. Again, so I think Juni already talked about it in the workshop. So I'm just stating it here. So for rational self-map, you're expecting in characteristic zero, either the existence of a Zariski densorbit or the fact that the map is preserving some non-constant rational function. So this is a conjecture. Function. So, this is a conjecture quite difficult. And again, I am at least going a little bit fast in the classical case, the characteristic zero, because I think this is something that pretty much everyone in the audience knows very well. We all encounter this conjecture in various instances, and we've seen that it is quite difficult. That it is quite difficult when the field K, so here we're talking about an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero, when that field K is countable. Because essentially what you can prove is that all you need to do is, in order to find the Zariski dense orbit, you need to choose a starting point that avoids countably many proper sub-varieties, assuming, of course. Varieties, assuming, of course, that condition B doesn't happen. Okay, if B happens, if there exists a preserved rational function, then there is no hope for condition A of the existence of a Zariski-dense orbit. But if D fails, then you would expect A to hold. But when K is a countable field, it is hard, generally quite hard, to guarantee the existence of a point. Existence of a point over that field K of the ambient space, but that avoids this special countably many proper sub-varieties for which you would know that if you start there, your orbit has no hope of being Zariski dense. So, again, just very briefly, some known cases where this holds. So, this was very important. Was very important first. This result of Alice Medvedev and Thomas Canlon. This was an important result for the case of one variable polynomial action on the affine space. A very natural result. So it was cool to know that it does hold already in that instance. It does hold also in the instance of several groups. Of several group varieties, so even group varieties, group endomorphism composed with translation for semi-abelian variety, but also group endomorphism of a commutative linear algebraic group and very important result of Juni that it holds for an endomorphism of a projective surface. So that's I would consider like a really major result. Result. Once again, I don't know. Maybe my personal taste is that the next open and interesting case would be the case of an arbitrary endomorphism of the three-dimensional affine space. Okay, you can argue that perhaps also other cases are interesting, but this is a pretty natural example. And as far as I know, the conjecture is open. Now, what generally people do, and again, I'm going to go a little bit And again, I'm going to go a little bit fast on this. I mean, this is the general strategy. Here is that it always works to replace the endomorphism by a suitable iterate of it. It's also fine to conjugate the map by some opomorphism of the ambient space, meaning both conditions A, the existence of a Zariski densorbit, and condition B, the invariance of a non-constant rational map. These two conditions are also invariant. Are also invariant under the transformations from one and two, meaning replacing phi by an iterate or replacing phi by a conjugate from an automorphism. And then, like I said, the general strategy is assuming condition B doesn't hold, there is no non-constant rational function left invariant by the map, and then somehow use clearly some number theory, some arithmetic, because you're going to be working in a countable field. Working in a countable field, this is the interesting case. Again, the uncountable field case that was proven. But when k is a countable field algebraically closed of characteristic zero, the existence of the orbit seems quite difficult because exactly of that problem that I was telling in the beginning. You have to avoid the countably many proper sub-varieties. Varieties and a priori, they could cover all the k points of the variety if k is a countable field. Now, what happens in characteristic P? So again, the problem comes from the Frobenius. So I wrote there the example for any variety defined over Fp, it might be just as easy to think of it when X is the affine space. Just think of the affine space. Just think of the affine space in any dimension over Fp, and then consider the action of the Frobenius. Okay, so coordinate-wise, if I'm thinking on the affine space, I'm raising each coordinate to power p. So x1 to x1 to power p, x2 to x2 to power p, and so on. Then the Frobenius action is not going to leave any non-constant rational function invariant. But on the other hand, if the But on the other hand, if the field is small, if it doesn't have a larger transcendence degree, at least the dimension of the variety, for example, the dimension of the affine space, if the ambient space is AN, so the n affine space, if this field K has smaller transcendence degree, then no matter what point you're starting under the Frobenius action, the orbit will live in The orbit to live in inside a small sub-variety, exactly a sub-variety which has dimension equal with the minimal transcendence degree of a field over which that point is defined. So you see already that there is something completely different than characteristic zero. You can have now an endomorphism of the variety which doesn't Variety which doesn't leave invariant a non-constant rational function, but nevertheless, if the field is not big enough, doesn't have enough transcendence degree, then you can have a Zariski-dense orbit. So because of this, I thought it's kind of natural to advance the following conjecture. Okay, and it is the same as. It is the same as in characteristic zero. Again, you have a dominant rational self-map defined over an algebraically closed field K, this time of characteristic P. But this time we're assuming the transcendence degree of the field K over the prime field, so over say Fp bar, is at least equal with the dimension of the variety. So then I would expect the dichotomy from characteristic zero. Dichotomy from characteristic zero to hold also in characteristic t. Either there exists a non-constant rational function left invariant by the map phi, or there exists a Zariski dense orbit. And I mean, I kind of thought here that, and it is possible that this hypothesis is sufficiently strong that maybe the conjecture. Maybe their conjecture will be much easier than in characteristic zero, but it's not clear. It's not, at least to me, it's still not clear because, as I said, everything here, the variety, the map phi, are defined over k. So you still have the same issue like in characteristic zero. For example, in characteristic zero, I don't know myself, maybe some other people in the audience know. Some other people in the audience know if in characteristic zero, this arisky densorbit conjecture becomes much easier if you consider the function field case. And for example, assume that the dimension of that function field, the transcendence degree, is at least, let's say, the dimension of the variety. It's not again, not obvious what holds. Now, joint Now, jointly with one of my grad students, a very, very bright grad student, I should add, Sina, we were able to prove this conjecture for regular self-maps again of the Tori. And in any case, we were also interested in making a more precise conjecture that takes into account the Frobenius action, which gives kind of Which gives kind of a counterexample, but this time account for the case when the field K has a small transcendence degree. For example, transcendence degree even one. By the way, as a parenthesis, if K would be just FP bar, then the whole question is vacuous here. I mean, again, every map over Fp bar, over Over fp bar, over variety defined over fp bar, all the points over fp bar would have finite orbits. So you can't even talk about the conjecture. But when the field K has at least transcendence degree one, you would expect to have, if not a dichotomy, maybe a trichotomy. And this is the conjecture two, let's say, that we advanced. And this time, the field K, like I said, has any positive transcendence degree over Ft bar. And this degree over ft bar. And then for a dominant rational self-map over k, we would expect one of these three conditions to hold, either the existence of a Zariski densorbit or a non-constant rational map left invariant. And then the third case should account for this type of counterexample that I showed initially for this conjecture using the Frobenius action. But you have to be careful. I mean, this counterexample. I mean, this counterexample is the Frobenius action can be embedded into the dynamical system. So that's why we say, okay, if neither A nor D holds, then there should be something resembling the phrobenous action on a smaller piece of the variety. And that's why we have some sub-varieties Y and Z, and then some birational automorphism of the intermediate sub-variety. The intermediate sub-variety Z, such that, well, Y is the trivial piece, the piece, the sub-variety defined over FQ, and its dimension is at least two. Then the intermediate piece Z is invariant under an iterate of our map. And then I'm denoting by, let's say, phi, the little phi, the restriction of that iterate on z. On z. And then finally, on y, this twist, this conjugate of phi by this birational automorphism to is the Frobenius. Okay? So if neither condition A nor B holds, so if in some sense the Zariski-densorbit conjecture fails in characteristic P, then this conjecture too predicts that it only fails because you have. Only fails because you have the action of the Frobenius on a small piece of it. Now, we prove this conjecture again for rational self-maps, I mean, sorry, for dominant self-maps of Tori, regular self-maps of Tori. And I actually had quite a few more prepared regarding this case and also some examples here, but I see that my time is up. That my time is up, so maybe I should stop here. And if there are some questions about this result, I'll talk some more. Thank you once again. All right, so let's thank Ragos for the talk. Can you show the complete statement of the theorem? Ah, okay. Ah, okay, sorry. Yes, so it is exactly like the conjecture predicted, only that for now regular self-maps of tori, the condition C can be phrased a little simpler. I mean, you don't have that intermediate variety, sub-variety z, you just have a sub-variety y on which a twist of an iterate of phi acts as the Frobenius. acts as the probibius. Okay, that's what we're saying. And the twist is just by a translation. Okay, so you're conjugating an iterate of phi by a suitable translation, and then that conjugate restricted on this connected algebraic subgroup of GMN of dimension at least two, it has to be dimension at least two, you get the action of the Frobibles on it. The action of the phrobinus on it. Okay, so a small piece of it, on a small piece of it, it's the action of the phrobenus. And again, in much more down-to-earth terms, this condition C for Tori can be phrased as follows. Again, you have the action, the phi action to be the union, I mean, the composition of a translation with an algebraic group endomorphism given by some n-bin matrix A. A matrix A, and then that condition C is equivalent with the existence of two distinct Jordan blocks which have some eigenvalues lambda one and lambda two, which could be the same eigenvalue, but the Jordan blocks are distinct. That's important. And then there exists some positive integers L and M for which lambda one to power L is lambda two to power L equals P to power L. So that's condition C. So you know if you go in You know, if you go into the nitty-gritty of algebra, of linear algebra, this is the same as saying on a two-dimensional sub-Tori, you're actually, you know, an iterate of the map acts as the Frobenius, as a power of the Frobenius. Okay, so let me look at. Uh ah, so uh Bjorn, I guess, answer to Joe. Oh, ah, okay, so that's a different okay. So, is there any uh question? Okay, Moshe. Uh, so I wanted to ask about the conjecture, the dynamic model. I mean, if if your if your data is defined over Z, for example, you could try to compare different piece. uh try to compare different piece and do do do you expect like the the data in the conjecture to to be uniform somehow in the ah very good question so you're saying okay essentially you have like a z scheme and you're looking um on each fiber kind of right i mean that's yeah uh i don't know i don't know if uh tom'callon is present here i think uh tom would know better this type of thing Better this type of thing. I wouldn't expect a lot of change. So I would expect uniformity, but just because the DML, even in characteristic zero, so the classical DML is so difficult. Yeah, maybe I wouldn't venture to say, yes, there should be complete uniformity. But yeah, I think it's a very good question. And I would expect uniformity. Yeah. In the structure. Yeah, in the structure of that, you know, P set, so this one here in the conjecture. So that's what. Okay, where was it? Here. Yeah, here. So the M's, the M's shouldn't vary wildly with P. Yeah, I would, yeah, I would expect that. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Okay, thanks. Other question? Another question? Yeah, so actually, I have two questions: one speculative and one for clarification. So, I'll start with the speculative one. Do we know any examples of dynamical systems in characteristic P where you'll obtain something like these P sets, where you'll get something involving of the Frobenius, which where the endomorphism in question. Endomorphism in question doesn't come from an algebraic group and also is not literally the Fermanius or a conjugate to the Fermanius or something. Yeah, yeah. So that's, and I think long, long ago, I think we talked this, and I'm, you know, the kind of person with kind of, you know, bold conjectures here. So I expect no, the answer, no. So I expect that every time when these weird pie sets occur, is every The piece sets occur is actually because in the background you're having some algebraic group lurking that is indeed connected with the Frobinius. So just like you said it, and I also mention it in my slides, if you're having even in characteristic P the endomorphism of an abelian variety, but of trace zero, then you don't get these sets at all. You only have arithmetic progressions as the return set. The return set. So I would be surprised somehow that you have these return sets where there is no group action present. But again, it's always tricky. What do you mean present? I mean, you have to define it, you know, it's a cover of another cover of just a piece of it, essentially the way I was phrasing the conjecture for the Zariski-dense orbit conjecture, right? So it's complicated, the two. So, it's complicated to state it, but if you allow this type of exclusion, so no piece of the map or of the ambient space resembles a group action, then yeah, I wouldn't expect this piece. Okay, and the second question is just a clarification. So, in your condition C, I'm a little confused as to why it's about sub-varieties as opposed to quotients. It would seem that what you really seem that's what you really what you need to avoid is that there's some kind of a quotient of of x where the map looks like for banius which is what you in the case of in the case of splits tori or something then it's the same thing it's the same thing i mean i yeah i mean i maybe we should talk this separately i mean i i it's not clear to me why it should be a quotient uh the issue but maybe you're right Issue, but maybe you're right. Maybe it should be phrased a bit differently. I mean, it is true that I formulated this conjecture having in mind a lot the case of just, you know, Tori and abelian varieties more general. That's how I thought about it. Okay, but like I said, I don't see it immediately. Why should be a caution? Maybe we can talk. Maybe we can talk, maybe even by email or I don't know, separately. Sure. Yeah, okay. Other question? Right, so if there's no more questions, let's thank Ragos again. And we have a coffee break. I don't know. So do we still have the link over there, Shishan? I can do it here. We could also stay in this room too. I don't know if it's. Yeah, we can probably just stay in this room. Let me just stop the recording now. So, what do you do during a coffee break? during a coffee break.
