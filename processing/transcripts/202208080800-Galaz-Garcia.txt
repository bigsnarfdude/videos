Thank you. Yeah, well, thank you everyone for joining the talk. And as Andrea mentioned, so I will talk about group actions by isometries on metric spaces. So this is a two-part talk, so I will give the first part, and Catherine Searle will give the second one. So we have decided to focus on I have decided to focus on the Riemannian part, but just pointing sort of extensions and possible directions to more general metric spaces. In particular, as Andrea mentioned, right? So there's all this theory of RCD spaces and or spaces with Ricci curvature bounded below that, well, one can try to apply all these ideas of group action. All these ideas of group actions. So, so okay, so I hope everyone can hear me okay. Yes, yeah, okay, great. Thanks. So, okay, so let's start. So, what's the plan for the talk is, right? I mean, I want to start like very general, some sort of general discussion about what kind of ideas enter, what kind of problems one looks at. And so, this is some sort of metadata. So, this is some sort of meta discussion in which hopefully one can use it as a template for generating problems or try looking at things that one can apply in not only in the Riemannian case or Alexander or RCD, but also in other cases. And then I will talk about basic definitions and group actions and then focus on reminding manifolds with positive sectional curvature. That was sort of the first case. That was the first case studied in the Riemannian setting. So, okay, so okay, so what is a general strategy, right? So this is just, it's not geometry necessarily, but just like a mathematical point of view. If you have some space, right, or a category, and then you have the isomorphisms, right? So those are the symmetries of the space. And then, well, you would like to first or as a First, or as an aid in understanding the structure of these spaces, is we look at those that have symmetries. And well, one, so here one can interpret, well, what are the symmetries? So you look at the group of isomorphisms. And well, so a very nice situation is when the group of isomorphisms is a Lie group. So here. So, we want a compact Lie group. So, here. So, in general, I mean, you have compact and non-compact Lie groups, but if you have what's nice about having a compact Lie group is that it lets you, it induces a metric on the orbit space of the action, right? And then that lets you do, well, you have a how. Well, you have a Hauser space, and well, for non-compact Lie groups, the orbit space may not be Hauser. So we will be mostly working, well, not mostly, but we will look at the case where we have compact Lie groups, okay, by isomorphism. So the first thing is, well, to look at spaces that have such actions. So then, what kind of ingredients do we have in this problem? So we can choose. So we can choose where we have a leg group G here. Then we have a class M of spaces, right? They can be, for example, Riemannian manifolds, or befalls, Alexander spaces, or other types of spaces with some structure that is invariant under this Lie group action. And then one can also choose. Can also choose how the group is acting. Maybe it's acting freely, or maybe it's acting with fixed points. So there are all these choices that one can make. And then one gets a class of spaces with a group action, with a certain type of group action. And then one can ask, well, several questions. So, for example, as I said, one can have in some sort of the most regular case. Most regular case of you have a Riemannian manifold in which the group you want the lead group to be acting by isometries. Maybe the next best case is when you have some mild singularities like orbifold singularities, but you can still use smooth tools. Then, well, you can generalize to Alexandro spaces, RCD spaces, and well, maybe more general spaces. But what all these spaces have in common is that what All these spaces have in common is that well, you have metric spaces, and then well, the base case is that you want the Lie group to act by isometries. So, and well, why would you want to do this? So, well, one way is that it gives you a way of like systematically exploring a large class of spaces. If you just take all Riemannian manifolds, say, All Riemannian manifolds, say, with positive sectional curvature. This is a class that's not well understood. And then this imposes some extra structure on this class of spaces via the action. I will talk more about that. And then this is useful in classifying the spaces, and maybe also you could hope to construct new examples of the spaces you're working with. So, I mean, using I mean using symmetries or group actions to construct examples of spaces is a standard tool. And this has been sort of pioneered in the Riemannian case by Carsten Grove, as Andrea mentioned, right? And so this was named the Grove program, which aims at classifying positively curved manifolds or manifolds with non-negative sectors. Manifolds or manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature with group actions. But as I mentioned before, right, the success of this philosophy is that you have a lot of freedom in choosing what the class can be. The geometric hypothesis enter here, and then you can choose the Lie group. Can choose the lead group. Maybe you want abelian groups in which you look at torus actions, or and then here you can choose what kind of action. So you have a lot of freedom and according to that, well, you get different results. So if there are questions, please feel free to ask. So, okay, so what So, okay, so what is a so we will focus on metric spaces. And first, so what is a group action? So this is just a quick reminder. So if you don't remember, so right, so we have a metric space and then we have a Lie group here. And then we have a map from G cross the space to X. And then this is. To x, and then this is an isometric action, right? If the identity fixes all points in the space, then you want this associativity condition. And then if you fix an element G in the group, this induces a map right here from your space to the space, right, that sends a point. That sends a point, you just act on it by this element, and then you want that to be an isometry. So that's just this is the this is where the structure is preserved. And so, right, so probably the simplest example or one of the simplest examples you can think of is you take a this is the rounds here in R3, and then you just And then you just rotate it around its one axis by uh so this is this gives you a circle action on S2. So here I'm just so imagine this this point and this point right lie along an axis and then you just rotate. So this is S1 is SO2. So this is an orthogonal as the circle acts by orthogonal. As the circle acts by orthogonal transformations of the rounds here, and that is an isometry. So, I'm thinking of S2 as the, say, you can fix the radius to be one as the unit round sphere. And this is a Riemannian manifold, it has an induced distance, and this action is preserving the distance. So, one quick question. Yes. Do you don't impose Do you don't impose continuity for the map phi? Yes, yes, yeah. So, good point. Yes, I want this to be continuous, yes. Yeah, thanks, thanks, yes. Yeah, maps are always will always be continuous, yes. Thanks. So, okay, and so what we have now is metric spaces with an action. With an action, and going back, so actions besides being there are isometries, and well, they're also homeomorphisms. And then, well, we can think of spaces, topological spaces with continuous actions. And then there, the equivalence, the notion of equivalence is equivariant homeomorphism. So, this is the weakest equivalence notion. If you have extra. This notion: if you have an extra structure, I mean, the strongest would be that they are actually the spaces are isometric, right? But maybe they're, but if you just care about the action, this is the first thing you look at. So, an equivariant homeomorphism, then it's a homeomorphism between the spaces that preserves the group action. So, this means if you act on a point, it's the same as first applying the First, applying the homeomorphism and then acting by the element of the group. So now if you have, for example, if these are smooth manifolds, say like Riemannian manifolds, right, you could have here one could also ask maybe you want equivalent diffeomorphism, right? So you preserve more structures. Structures. So, but in general, well, the first thing you can try to prove is that the spaces are equivariantly homeomorphic. So, okay. So, well, once we have this point of view, right, so we have a group, we have the class M and we have the action. So, so. So we look at this class, and then one of the basic questions you can ask is to give a topological classification. So that means classify up to, you know, I wrote isomorphism because perhaps you have further extra structure that you want to see that it's preserved. Like, for example, diffeomorphism, if these are smooth manifolds, all the spaces in your class. Spaces in your class M. For example, if you have, if M is your, say, Riemannian manifolds with positive curvature that have, say, a circle action, then the question would be: well, classify all such spaces up to isomorphism. And these usually, so then you would say, well, You would say, well, you would like to say they're diffeomorphic to some well-known spaces, say the sphere or complex projector space. I don't know, but maybe in the process of carrying out this classification, you see that there are some spaces that have not appeared before. So, this is a way of exploring this big class of spaces in a more controlled way. Controlled way. So, as an example, so this is actually one of the first theorems in this whole story. So, this is a Shanklanger theorem. So this was proven in 1989. So, here, so the theorem says that, well, you have a close simply connected four-manifold, Riemannian four-manifold, with Minion for manifold with positive sectional curvature. So closed here, that means compact and without boundary. And here you want an effective, don't worry too much about that. I will explain what that is in a second. So the point here is that you have an isometric circle action. And the theorem says, well, under these hypotheses or these classes, Under this hypothesis or this class of spaces consists of just two elements. The topological classification is up to homeomorphism here, and it consists of, well, it's the four sphere or complex projective space CP2. And well, and then it was well, the way this was proven is: well, you look at the orbit space. Is well, you look at the orbit space, and then you can compute some information there about the fixed point set. And then one proves that the order characteristic of such a manifold is two or three. And then using Friedman's work, well, that implied that the space has to be homeomorphic. So it was, well, sort of conjectured that this should hold. That this should hold up to diffeomorphism, but then, well, that's true. It turns out, so FinTouchell sort of independently or before there was a lot of work on just D-group actions on smooth manifolds. And then, so there's a classification for smooth four manifolds, simply connected four manifolds with circle actions. And then from this, it follows that well, any circle action, any smooth S1 action must be by diffeomorphisms. And sorry, any space that emits a smooth S1 action that is homeomorphic to S4 or CP2 must actually be bifomorphic. So using, you just plot. So, using you just plug in this with Shankleiner statement, and then one can improve this up to up to diffeomorphism. So, so well, so then this says, okay, here the topological classification in this case is complete. So, in particular, I mean, this is improving, getting diffeomorphism classifications is important in the Classifications is important in the sort of smooth category, right? Because, for example, in higher dimensions, you can have spaces that carry many non-equivalent diffeomorphic smooth structures. So, if you can actually nail down the smooth structure, well, that's a very strong result in general. So, what is the next? Well, another basic problem is actually it's now class. Is actually now classifying the actions. So, this is the equivariant classification problem, and this means once you have the space, you want to classify up to equivariant homeomorphism, at least, all possible actions on a given space. And this usually, so this problem, so this usually involves determining a complete set of invariants for the action. Of invariants for the action, so you want to compute some invariants that depend on the action in such a way that two spaces that have the same invariance must be equivariantly homeomorphic or diffeomorphic if you're with smooth manifolds. And conversely, every set of invariants can be realized by some action. Action. So now, in the case of the Kleiner result, right? So this question translates to understand or classify all possible circle actions, isometric S1 actions on S4 or CP2. And then this has been solved completely. So it serves. Completely. So it's sort of, it was a long story. So when you see this work of Groven Sterl, and then of myself, and then Grove and Wilking finish sort of all the remaining case. And then the statement tells you, well, that the action has to be linear. So it has to be equivalently diffeomorphic to an action by. So, here this would be by orthogonal transformations, and here by CP2 with Fubini-Studio metric. So, these spaces have canonical actions, canonical metrics, and those metrics have an isometry group or isometries. And then this statement says that the metrics are equivalent to metrics arising via this. Arising via these canonical metrics. Now, why is this? Well, this is in a way it's nice because it well, this completely solves both problems, but it's also worth mentioning that both S4 and CP2 and they admit non-linear circle actions. So they have smooth circle actions that are not equivalent to orthodox. That are not equivalent to orthogonal actions in the case of the four-sphere. For example, so what this theorem also says is that, well, those actions can never arise by symmetries of a metric with non-negative sectional curvature, in particular of positive curvature. So, these two statements from dimension four, then this is sort of the whole story is complete and this is. And this is somehow an archetype of sort of the type of understanding one would want for these classes. So now here, this result has also been extended to orbifolds by John Harvey and Kathleen Searle, so actually quite recently. And for Alexandro spaces, one of Alexandro spaces, one has to assume an ector hypothesis on quotients of three-dimensional spaces with positive curvature that is automatically satisfied in the orbifold case, but in the Alexandro case, it's open. But if one assumes that, then one gets an extension of this result. So here one gets the spaces that arise are a little more complicated, but one can give a It but one can one can give a description so okay so so now so this is the uh kind of the universe of spaces that one can look at and uh well in in some sense inspired by Riemannian geometry and and now I want to focus on more results for Riemannian manifolds but of course one can go to I mean usually well one for Usually, well, one or things of Alexander spaces, but one challenge here is that you don't have well, immediately have like smooth tools, which here in the in the Orbifold case, that may give you some sort of things are a little more controlled. And then, well, one can, this looks more like the Riemannian world, right? Now, here for RCD spaces, for example, I think. For example, I think the topological identification is difficult, right, or not as regular as Alexander spaces. Nevertheless, one can still recover some things. And this is, I would say from this, well, this is quite unexplored, the RCD case. So, okay, so well, so going back, we have the group action by isometry. The group action by isometry. So, the first question one would like to answer is: well, when is the group of isomorphisms an isometry group? And this is a fundamental result for Riemannian manifolds. So, this is the Meyer-Stingrow theorem. So, it's early in the 20th century. So, the hypothesis here is we just take a Riemannian manifold. Take a Riemannian manifold of dimension n, and then well, the theorem says that the isometry group is a Lie group, and then also the Lie group is the isometry group is compact if the manifold is compact. And one also has this bound. So this is the isometric group is bounded above by n times n plus one. above by n times n plus 1 over 2. So if you look at this number, this is the dimension of the orthogonal group of O n. So in particular it's the isometric group of the round n sphere. And so and then once you have this, you can ask, well, what can I actually classify the spaces that have The spaces that have maximal, whose isometry group has maximal dimension. And this is the next statement. So if the isometry group has maximal dimension, then the space is actually, so this is a very strong conclusion. It's not only diffeomorphic, but it's isometric to the sphere, real projective space. So these are with constant sectional curvature. Sectional curvature, Euclidean space or hyperbolic space. So here with constant negative curvature, it doesn't necessarily have to be one, minus one. So now here, this already has is an archetype for resolve I would like to prove also. So here what So here, what do we have? We have some invariant of the isometry group, like a numerical invariant, and then you bound it above by a number that is sort of, that is usually realized by the most symmetric space, or the most symmetric spaces, which are these. And then, well, the first, once you have this upper bound, This upper bound that is sort of realized, and you want to see what's happening when this inequality is actually equality, and then try to classify that case. And that is also a sort of systematic way of approaching these problems. Then you can ask, for example, what happens if for the next lowest dimension and so on, right? And then Right, and then usually more spaces appear. So now, for this statement, so the same statement holds for Alexander of spaces. So this was Fukaya and Yamaguchi proved that this was a Lie group. And then with Guijaro and myself, we got the dimension bound and the so that this has to be. So, that these have to be actually Riemannian manifolds like Britain space, round sphere, round projective space, and hyperbolic space. And for RCG spaces, then this was proven more recently by Sosa and Guillaro and Santos Rodriguez. So, and but this is the case for also for other types of spaces with weaker curvature conditions. But this is the very first thing you would like to know: is, well, is the idea. Like to know is, well, is the isomer fission group actually a so okay? So, more definitions about an action. So, so now we have here I assume that this is a Riemannian manifold with an isometric group action, D-group action, compact D-group, and fix a point, right? So then the So then an orbit is just a set of points that are acted upon by the on which the group sort of acts. So you take a point and then you apply all the elements of the group and that's an orbit. So that's a smooth submanifold. So then if you look at the set of orbits, that's the orbit space. That's the orbit space. And now, an important fact, as I mentioned earlier, is that the orbit space is going to inherit a metric by looking at the distance between orbits as subspaces of the Riemannian manifold as a metric space. And now, if you take a point, the point, the isotropic group, is a set of elements. Is the set of elements that fix that point. And now there is, so now you look at all the possible isotropies, and then you can look at, so if you look at the isotropic groups along an orbit, one can see that they're all conjugate. And then you can, you have the orbit types sort of according to conjugacy class of the As a class of the isotropy, and then there's a theorem, the principal isotropy theorem, that says that, well, up to conjugation, there is a smallest isotropic group, and conversely, that, well, equivalently, that means that there is sort of a largest orbit. So, and now an action is effective if the intersection of all the isotropic groups is the identity. So, this is so the only So, this is the only element that fixes everything is the identity. So, one usually wants to look at those because if not, you can always, if the action is not effective, you can sort of, you have the ineffective kernel of the action is called, and you can mod out by that, and you get an effective action. So, we will assume that the actions are effective. So, again, going back to this example. Going back to this example, just rotating the sphere. So here the remaining manifold is S2. Here, this is the circle. And we're just rotating. So we have, so for example, this point, these two points are fixed. So the isotropic group is the whole group. Then, if I take a point, say, that's not. point say that's not in one of these sort of north or south poles then the uh right its orbit is is this so all the orbits of points here are going to be this circles and the isotropy here is trivial and then we have uh here I drew the orbit space which is you can think of it well each point here is an is an orbit point here is an is an orbit so so i can sort of this uh interval here so intersects the the each orbit at a single point right so that's going to be uh the orbit space and then here this the blue point corresponds to this uh equator orbit and then all the orbits in the interior are principal orbits right Principal orbits, right? And then you have these two fixed points. And so this is a very simple situation that already contains a lot of information or sort of what that will happen in general for a certain class of spaces called cohomogeneity one spaces. So those are spaces whose orbit space is one-dimensional. So you can see here for So, you can see here, for example, that the well, this is sort of things that you already know, but you just interpret them in a different way. So, right? So the S2 is the union of this, of two hemispheres, right? And so say it's north and south. And then, but what is a what is this hemisphere? It's a two disk, and this two disk is a This two disk is a neighborhood of this fixed point of the South Pole. And conversely, well, not conversely, but similarly, the northern hemisphere is going to, it's a two disk, and it's a neighborhood of this point here. And then, if you in the orbit space, this looks like, well, if you cut the orbit space in these two halves, so this the premier. The preimage of this here is this northern hemisphere, and the preimesh of this here is the southern hemisphere. So, S2 is then just a union of two disks. But you can say that it's the union of two neighborhoods of these special orbits, the North and South Pole. And then this is going to be the case more generally for these spaces. More generally, for these spaces that have whose orbit space looks like an interval. And to mention that, we have a state of theorem. But before that, let me just say that, well, the other thing that you want is the existent principal isotropy. So this also holds for Alexandro spaces. This is also work of myself and Guijero, and RCD spaces. So this is also in this joint work with. Joint work with Kel, Andrea Mondino, and Sulce. So, if you see, then we already know for Riemannian, Alexandro, and RCD that the isomorphism group is a Lie group. You have principal orbits. And then in the Riemannian case, you have a very, well, it's a fundamental result called the slice theorem that describes the structure. So, a tumor neighbor. Structure so a tubular neighborhood of an orbit in terms of the group action. So, what this theorem says is: well, you take the point, then you take a tubular neighborhood, a sufficiently small tubular neighborhood of the orbit of this point, and then this is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a disk bundle, so it's you can. You can sort of the isotropy acts on the this is the normal disk to the orbit and then you have an associated bundle to an action here. So what's I mean what's important here is that the picture okay so so look at the at this picture. So here we have the this would be the orbit. This would be the orbit. And now, at this point, the tangent space decomposes a space tangent to the orbit. And then on the normal space, which would be like here. So on that normal space, you look at a disk, a normal disk, and then that's going to be the fiber of this bundle. Of this bundle, but what this is saying is that, well, this is linking here, you don't see the action, but here the action and the isotropy are showing up. So, but this describes the local structure around an orbit in terms of the isotropic group. And now, if you look at this, so this is going to be a disk. So, this is going to be a disk. And what is a disk? So, you can think of a disk as a cone over the sphere. So, here, in this case, this is a circle, and the disk is a cone over the circle. But if this is higher dimensional, here you have a ball, and this would be a cone over a round C. Over a round sphere, and now in the Alexandro case, we also have a slice theorem. And the situation is, so the generalization is that here, instead of taking the disk, you're going to take a normal cone. So, this is a neighborhood. So, this is a neighborhood of an orbit in an Alexander space. And then, so the theorem says that the Turan neighbor, a neighborhood or a small metric neighborhood of an orbit is this bundle. But now here, the fibers are cones over a positively curved Alexander space. In particular, in the Riemannian case, right, this is this, this is called. This is called normal spatial directions. This is always a round sphere. So, this is always a disk, a ball. But in the Alexander case, you can have other spaces, for example, a man space or CP2 or many other things. So, but on the other hand, so this is going to be a cone bundle over the orbit. So, here you see also maybe. So, here you see also maybe why it's also helpful to look at actions is that this is actually a manifold, and then sort of the topological singularities are coming from the normal part. So, okay, so then this is okay, so then Fernando, can I ask you if you want to say slightly more details over what you mean with the. Details of what do you mean with the star with the cross gx? Uh, say how does yeah, so this is uh right. Uh, let me see. So, let me see if I can see if it is here, the smooth setting, say, as you wish, right? Uh, so yeah, so here, I mean, what you do is that you have G cross D, and then you can write this as a quotient of. You can write this as a quotient of gx. So you have an action of the isotropy on the normal space by okay so that will okay let me let me Yeah, so maybe before I write this, maybe this is it's better to write something else. Okay, so right, okay, so here you have the point, right? Yep, and then you look at the tangent space. So So so here the uh you have the tangent space to the the tangent space to the orbit yeah and then you have the orthogonal space and the uh so this would be t x t x orthogonal and now the I don't know. And now the if you look at the isotropy, so the isotropy of X or the orbit, it fixes the point here. So then what you have is that the isotropy acts on the acts on the tangent space by differentials. And then it acts here, it fixes. It acts here, it fixes this. So it's going to fix that, and then it's acting on the it's going to act on the normal space. And then the so then what you have is that then, so you have an action of, so you look at g cross the x normal. X normal and then you quotient by an action. So you have an action on G and here. And this is what I mean by this bundle. So here, the base of this is going to be G sub X, which is the orbit. Okay. And if you change point on the orbit, is there any relation of this says? Of this SA space right, so it's it's the it's oh, I'm sorry, it broke a little bit. I could not hear your the rest of your question. Now, if if you change point along the orbit, is there any relation of the splitting at different points of the same orbit? So the actions are conjugate, yes. Uh, so it's the Get yes, uh, so it's the same, yeah. So, the right this structure is preserved, good, yeah, right. Thanks. So, oh, thanks for your, yeah, you're welcome. Thanks. So, right, so, so here, for example, in the Alexandro case, this part would not longer be an Rn, but it would be like a tangent column, it's a colon. So, so oh. So, okay, so right, so now going back to this idea with the invariance, right? So, in the Meyer-Steenrod theorem, one had the dimension, right, and you had an upper bound. And then in the maximal case, one could give a least optoisometry of the spaces. And then, well, this sort of systematic way of Systematic way of studying spaces with actions. You can ask, well, I not only want manifolds that have an action, but I have manifolds that have a big action, a large action. So this was promoted by Karsten Grove for manifolds with positive sectional curvature and non-negative sectional curvature. But it is, it's a question or it's a philosophy that makes sense. Of philosophy that makes sense in general. So, here now I want to mention three invariants or three types of actions. So, the first invariant is the co-homogeneity. So that's so this is the the dimension of the Of the orbit space. I think, okay, that's working. So, what's the dimension? So, this is the co-dimension of the principal orbit, of the largest orbit. So, for example, in the where was this in this picture, so the So this circle is a circle, it's co-dimension one. And then the orbit space is an interval and it's one-dimensional. So this action has co-homogeneity one. So that's the so then for cohomogeneity zero, that means that the orbit space is zero-dimensional. Is zero-dimensional. So, if in particular, if its space is connected, which we will assume or have been assuming, then it's a homogeneous space. So, cohomogeneity zero is homogeneous. It means that you just have one orbit. Now, another invariant you can associate to an action is it's the symmetry rank. It's the symmetry rank. So the symmetry rank of a here we have a Riemannian manifold, the metric is fixed. So the symmetry rank of that space is the rank of the isometry group. Then what you can ask is if I have a class of manifolds, for example, positively curved Riemannian manifolds, closed Riemannian manifolds, do I have a bound on the symmetry rank? So the rank of the isometry group is the dimension of the largest abelian subgroup in particular. This will be sort of, you can interpret this as looking as torus actions and then computing the maximum symmetry rank for a class is asking what is the dimension of the largest torus. Dimension of the largest torus that can act on such a space. So I will go to that in a second. And then the third invariant is so here. So, okay, so we have an action, and then maybe that action has fixed points, meaning it's a point that is fixed by the whole group. But so, given that you have But so, given that you have fixed points, what could be a notion of having a large action? And one answer is the fixed point cohomogeneity. So, here you have manifold and an isometric action with fixed points. And you want the you look at this number: the dimension of the orbit space minus the dimension. Minus the dimension of the fixed point set. You look at the largest, the fixed point set consists of usually sub-manifolds, and then you look at the largest dimensional manifold there, and then that's the dimension of the fixed point set. And well, you subtract one so that when you have fixed point homogeneous, which I will mention in a second. Mention in a second that means that the here, going back to this picture, that the isotropy has to act transitively on the normal sphere to the fixed point cell. So, what this how one could think about this is that you have Is that you have a large point here? So, okay, so let's continue with, right, so spaces with low cohomogeneity, as I mentioned, this is homogeneous spaces, is cohomogeneity zero. So, cohomogeneity one, so if you have a space that is a reminder manifold and has a cohomogeneity one action. And has a co-homogeneity one action, one can write it as a union of two disk bundles. Like the sphere is the union of, in this picture earlier, is a union of two disks. So that's that's trivially, so a disk is trivially a disk bundle, right, over a point. So you just glue those two disks. And this is the general picture for these spaces. And for Alexandrov spaces, this is work of myself. This is work of myself with Catherine. One can write them as a union of two cone bundles over two manifolds, over two orbits. So this gives you a very sort of, it's a flexible structure, but it's at the same time sort of not too flexible. So you can really say what the man what the structure is. What the structure is. And now, once you, well, these are also structured results, and then one can ask, can one classify them? So both equivarially and topologically. And this has been done. So this is also a long story. So this is for manifolds, they have been classified up to dimensional seven. So, this is work of Mustard, Neumann, Helser. And for Alexander spaces, that we did it with Catherine up to dimension four, and then with Maso Mezai up to dimension seven. So here one gets more spaces than in the Riemannian case, but not too many, right? So why, but but but but it's still. But but but uh but it's still rich enough so that uh some things that are uh sort of different from the manifold case arise. For example, you get spaces that have the same homology as a sphere, but they're not the sphere. You also get actions that are not equivalent to smooth actions. So here, let me just this is me summarizing these comments I have made. Uh, comments I have made. So, if you have a cohomogeneity one action, so here we have an action with one-dimensional orbit space. Here I am assuming that the space is simply connected. And then this forces the orbit space to be an interval. And now, here you have these special orbits that I wrote that have here in this picture: is G mod K minus and G mod K plus. minus and g mod k plus so this is i draw it like the sphere so sort of to evoke the same structure and uh the orbit space these endpoints have isotropy k minus k plus and the interior points have principal isotropy h and then these neighborhoods of the of these orbits g mod k plus and g mod k minus are these bundles and they're glued along And they're glued along this principal orbit. And then what, so then the manifold decomposes as a union of two tubular neighborhoods, which by the slicing are these bundles. And one has, this is a very useful thing. One has this group diagram. So one has the group, one has these two special isotropic groups, and then the principal And then the principal isotropy. And one has this restriction that the principal isotropy, sorry, this let's call them singular isotropy groups, principal isotropy have to be spheres. So all these now in the in the Alexandrov case, what one gets is that these have to be That these have to be positively curved Alexander spaces. So, okay. So now, just this is a lot of stuff in one slide, but it's maybe just to emphasize that these paces have been very useful. And then they have been really sort of classified here. Uh, so uh, Grove and Siller proved that they all have a positive Reacher curvature if and only if the fundamental group is simply connected. So, this is a reminding case. So, for example, one could ask this also for Alexander spaces or R C D spaces, but there one is missing a slice theorem. Now, if you have coordination to singular orbits, then you have non-negative You have non-negative curvature, and this led to the construction of non-negatively curved metrics on exotic semi-spheres. And this was recently sort of finished. Goethe, Kerin, and Shankar proved that all exotic semiospheres have non-negative curvature. Then, with positive curvature, there is so Catherine has classified them up to dimension six, then Up to dimension six, then Verdiani in even dimensions, sort of the possible spaces that can support such metrics. And then Grove, Wilking, and Siller also in 2008 completed this classification. And then one has to ask, well, these are the possible spaces. Can I actually put those metrics? We all construct those metrics. So this was done by Grove, Virginia, and Ziegler in 2011 and also by Dereko. And also by Derico. So, this is kind of the this program sort of fulfilling its promise, right? So, you reached one, you managed to construct some examples. And so now another invariant is the symmetry rank. So, here you have a you look at this is the largest torus that can act on a manifold. Here, Can act on a manifold. Here, one can bound the dimension by this is m plus one over two. And now, here, if the symmetry rank is maximal, then you have a sphere, a real or complex projective plane, or a land space. And well, the actions are also linear. That's not very difficult to see. It's an observation myself. And now, low-fixed co-homogeneity, we have Cohomogeneity, we have fixed point homogeneous manifolds. So you want this number to be zero. So this is sort of these are the largest such actions. And what this means is that the orbit space has boundary, and at least one boundary component consists of fixed points. And then this, if you assume that the manifold has positive. That the manifold has positive curvature lets you sort of also classify the spaces. And this is a theorem of Grogan-Sero. And here, I'm assuming this is simply connected, fixed-point homogeneous. So this means the orbit space has boundary, a fixed point set component. And then you get sphere, complex projective space, quaternionic projective space. Quaternionic projector space or the Cayley plane. So that's what's important is that, well, you can really say what these spaces are. On the other hand, maybe you can also see that these hypotheses are quite strong, right? Like they really, you don't get so many spaces. Nevertheless, you get, in the process, you understand a lot about the structure of these spaces, and that can sort of maybe. That can sort of maybe help you construct new examples. And so, now, more recently, Harvey and Sero generalized the maximal symmetry rank result and fixed point homogeneous result to Alexander spaces with positive curvature. So, you also get the same bound in the symmetry rank, and then you get more spaces, but they're not very wild, like or before. Or be false. And now, in all this, I'm running out of time, but we're almost done. So, the fundamental observation is that if you have sectional curvature bounded below by k, the orbit space has is an Alexander space with curvature bounded below by K. So, if this is positive, the orbit space is going to be a positively curved Alexander space, and that imposes a lot of restrictions on the. Of restrictions on the structure, and that is how many of these results come about. So, this is not true for if using Ricci curvature, although for RCD spaces, we also proved in this paper with Martin Kell and Giamondino and Gerardo Soza that the quotient sort of has R C D K but n but the same dimension as the The same dimension as the space. So the situation is slightly different, but still you have some lower curvature bound. And to finish, just let me point out some sort of possible directions that you could look at. So, well, you can ask for other curvature. Of course, I mean, there's lots of things to do with all the spaces that I already mentioned, but there are also other, this approach can be used for other notions, for example, positive intermediate. For example, positive intermediate Ricci curvature. There's recent work of Moyer. Then also other metric spaces. As I mentioned, most things are for Riemann and Alexandrov, though the first basic results exist for RCD spaces. But here we also have other results for other spaces, also spaces that look like orbifolds. Then maybe this is also quite interesting or Also, quite interesting, or I think promising if you look at other interpretations of symmetry, right? So, you can have local actions, and these are important in collapse. And you can also look at foliations, like there are these singular Riemannian foliations that, so if you have an action, you have a decomposition of the manifolds of the manifold into orbits, and that is an example of a singular Riemannian foliation, but then you can just. But then you can just look at spaces that have such decompositions. Maybe they don't come from actions, but they still have a certain structure. And then one can ask, well, how much of all this theory of transformation groups or group actions can I still keep in that case? And what's also maybe interesting is that it's a little more flexible, and then you could potentially get even more examples like of spaces. And these here. And this here, for example, with Markov Radeski. So he has done a lot of work on this. We have a paper where we generalize Taurus actions. And also Diego Coro and Adam Moreno have worked generalizing, for example, these fixed point homogeneous results. So there are many directions one can go. Directions one can one can go. And I hope, well, this is hopefully an interesting overview of these problems. And then Catherine will talk more about non-negative curvature and other things. So well, so thank you very much. Gracias, yeah. So thanks. Okay, so any questions for Fernando? Thanks all Fernando for this very beautiful introduction, which gave us a lot of information and it will fix a lot of notation useful for the next talks also. Thank you. Thanks a lot. So if there are no questions, I have a couple. So one is very naive. So about the Mayo steel. So about the Mayenster, one of the first few slides about the Mayenstein rode and the classification of say maximal spaces with maximal isometry group. So you have the sphere, you have the Eubican space, you have the hyperbolic space, and then you have the RPN. So what is special about RPN with respect to other quotients of the Of the sphere or of the green space or of the epolic space. So one could guess that. Right, so I guess, well, RPN is as well, this is an attempt at answering your question. So, well, I think the mod Z2. So, Z2 is a very small group, right? So, it just has to, so it commutes. So it just has to so it commutes with the the uh so you take in uh so you you on RPN you still have uh so commute the isometry group is going to be also uh the same dimension as the one for the sphere so it means that the the action descends to the uh to the uh to the real projective space so I guess one way of thinking about it is that So, I guess one way of thinking about it is that if you have other spherical spaces, the fundamental group is going to, you will have elements of the isometry group in the random series that do not induce isometries on the quotient. So, that's the right thing. Okay, thank you. And then another question is about, can you give, I know if maybe Catherine will say about being. Maybe Catherine will say about a bit more about that later, but the slice theorem. So, what are the main ingredients of it? Say and say why it is possible to generate it to Alexandro spaces and say what would be missing for doing it in RCD. So, what are so what is really key for doing it in Alexandrov? I guess you need some topological thing on Alexandrov. Right, maybe I'll answer them. I can give Catherine and John Harvey everything, but I mean, maybe I think the key thing is the theorem of Perlman that if so, so imagine that the act the group is trivial, that is acting is trivial. So then the slice theorem says that a neighborhood of a point is a in the in the reminder in the manifold case, it's a The in the remaining in the manifold case is a ball, but in the Alexander case, it says that the neighborhood is a cone, it's a cone over the space of directions. And that is Perlman's theorem. Right, and that I think is the main challenge for R C D V spaces. Yes. Yeah, right, yeah, thanks. And for the next slide about, say, when you Next slide about say when you talk about homogeneity zero, one space and the classification, is the slice theorem a key tool for proving in the homogeneity one case in a real manifold is a union of these bundles and in the space is a union of con bundles. Is the slice theorem a key tool for proving this kind of results? Right, right. So this is a slice theorem, yes. So, this is a slice theorem, yes. So, yes, so in particular, this picture is via the slice neuron. So, that's right. And for the Alexander case, yeah, that's how also you can get it. Yes. Right. So, so, yes, I mean, the slice term is very powerful. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you for your questions. Thanks, Sandra. Fernando? Hi. I would like to ask you a question. Maybe, well, more of a general doubt I have. Usually, when we are trying to classify group actions, we assume that the lead group that is acting is compact, right? That's a very good thing. Right? That's a very good thing to assume. Now we only assume, for example, in dimension one, it's just a circle, essentially. In dimension two, it's a torus. But is at all interesting to consider if we multiply, for example, the circle with a discrete group? For example, the Coxeter group of Bounce Lag Solitar group. Right, yes, yes. I mean, you can also. Yes, I mean, you can also, if you, I mean, you have, yes, I think that's also, so you can sort of weaken the, maybe you don't want the whole thing to be sort of, as you say, like you have a like maybe T1 cross ZK or something like that. So that would be less, in some sense, less symmetry, right? So something that perhaps I went Something that perhaps I went through very quickly is that, so once you have these invariants, for example, you can then start going down, right? So, first you have the largest action, then maybe the next largest. And one way also of decreasing the symmetry is by considering sort of discrete actions. So, there are also results for here. I always assume that it's a Lie group, right? That it's not discrete, right? But you can also assume that it's discrete. But you can also assume that it's discrete, yeah. So the the challenge there is that, I mean, when the when the group is not discrete, then you the orbit space is automatically lower dimensional. So then that, in some sense, you reduce the dimension of the problem that you're studying, right? So you go at the orbit to the orbit space and with if you have discrete actions, maybe you don't always have that. But yes, there are also results in that direction. That, but yeah, there are also results in that direction, yes. So, that's yeah, because well, the thing that got me thinking about this was that in the case of a circle of a torus, the isotropies are, well, just essentially three kinds of isotropy. However, when you multiply by a different group, maybe a discrete group, you will get different isotropies. Or maybe they just can't occur for another reason. But I was just wondering if the isotropies can be different, then the Different, then the types of orbits maybe potentially can be different too. Yes, right. So, yes, you can ask those questions and yes, they're worth looking at. I mean, for example, you can ask, for example, what's the discrete, the largest discrete abelian group that can act, and so on. All right, thanks. Thanks, Claire. All right. Thanks. Thanks, Claude. Thanks. Okay, so if there are no more questions, let's thank Fernando again. Thank you very much. Okay, so.
