Because I tend to uh think about spatial aspects all the time. Um okay, so uh first I'll start with thank yous in case I have to cut short because I tend to baby on and uh so that's it. So this is a variety of works that have involved a variety of people, including Amy, who's here. And I'll point out another person who was motivating in this, she was not involved. In this, she was not involved in any of the papers that I'm going to be talking about, but I'll explain where she comes in. Okay, so if you've suffered through my talks already, you've seen that quote. I always bring it up. This is Tusididis, one of the first historians, and this is an explanation of how some disease that was called the plague made its way into Athens. And I like this because as I work on This is because as I work on spatial epidemiology, you can see that this is essentially 2,500 years old, and there is a description of a spatial tenfold spread of a disease. It started in Ethiopia, went into Egypt, Napia, Persia, and then it made its way into Greece. So nothing that I'm going to talk about is new. And it's like one of the first historians actually noticed that there was this spatial-temporal aspect. Okay? Okay. Okay. Um okay. I'll start with a few random observations and they're really sort of random. That's why I'm sort of putting this disclaimer there. And then I'll talk about modeling introductions and how they relate to the spatial spread process and why I think they're important. So a few observations. The first one is this one. This is, I'm plotting the percentage of jurisdictions. So in red, it's the number of projects. So, in red, it's the number of provinces and territories, the percentage of provinces and territories, and in blue, it's the percentage of health regions in Canada that reported, so that's essentially the first year of a pandemic, that reported a case in a 21 days period prior to the point that I'm showing. Okay, and what I want you to really notice, what I'm interested in here, is this movement, this change. Is this movement, this change in the number of either the provinces or the health regions that are reporting cases? So there was an initial very sharp rise in the number of jurisdictions reporting cases, but then it dropped and then it came back up. And what I'm going to be interested in here is in the fact that this coming back up, these are reinforced. Back up, these are reintroductions potentially into a jurisdiction. And so, of course, you can say, Okay, probably I'm not looking back enough, but you can tweak things and, for example, look 40 days back instead of, so that would be a long period without seeing any cases. And of course, it's going to take a little time to refresh. Of course, there's less variation now because I'm looking much further in the past, but you can still see that. But you can still see that some provinces, for example, were not reporting cases and suddenly they're re-reporting cases. So they could be experiencing silent transmission chains for 40 days. But it's also very likely that some of those local jurisdictions also were not experiencing any cases and then were experiencing them better again. And so that's going to be part of my topic here. What happens? What are the conditions? What happens? What are the conditions that make it that a case sort of transforms into a bunch of cases in a jurisdiction? So typically, every time I do this, I have trouble leaving this page. This is something that I have not yet understood how to master. Another point that I want to make is that introductions don't always That introductions don't always work. So, I'm going to call introduction or importation. It's when someone comes with the disease from another location, another jurisdiction. That person comes bearing the disease and makes their way into a new jurisdiction. That's an introduction. Whether that introduction is successful or not, then varies. The introduction is successful if that person that If that person that came from outside the jurisdiction bearing the disease actually transmits the disease to someone. So, of course, these introductions can be detected or not, successful introduction, they are going to be detected or not. They could very well not be detected. But in terms of the process of disease propagation, that's the important part. Do I have local propagation once I am in a new jurisdiction? And here we Jurisdiction. And here, this was data we looked at from long-term care homes in four countries in Europe, I think. Well, four, I think, I think, four places in Europe, about 400 and something houses. And what's important here is that's really the thing that I want to focus on. It's okay, there were a few cases, most, about three, four. Most, about three-fourths of the time, importations were successful. But there's also a fourth of the time when a case came into a long-term care home and that didn't go any further. And that's going to be important because, in the spread process, that's really determined. If, well, if I'm thinking at the scale of a long-term care home, that's one thing, but if I'm thinking about a global space. About a global spatial scale, you are going to be propagating only if you do develop a disease within your location. Okay, I'll come back to that. But as I said, a few random observations to begin with. One of the reasons I started thinking about this is that I'm here somewhere, and Manitoba has quite a few isolated communities. These are communities that are But I think it's more than 350 kilometers. I mean, it depends, there's several levels, but they don't have access to any road. The only way to get there is to fly in or to use ice roads, which still exist, but probably won't exist for long because of climate change. But okay, so you've got a bunch here. You see that I drew the road network, and you've got a bunch of places that you see, but I'm not connected. Bunch of places that you see, but are not connected to anything. And those places are particularly vulnerable because they are not equipped to deal with severe cases. So if you're in one of those places, and even further away, because I just point out this is a sort of Zoom, these are the communities in Canada that are eligible for what's called a Nutrition North retail subsidy and the Harvesters Support Grant. So, this is the community. So, this is the communities I was showing you in Manitoba, but these places, for example, also in northwest Ontario, essentially, if you have a medical urgency here, you're flown to Winnipeg. Likewise, this is the Kivai region in Lulavut, and there's actually a hotel in Winnipeg for people that come to the that come with people that get evacuated out of that region for medical states. States. Okay, so these places, for example, if things go bad, typically local, there's usually a nurse, there aren't necessarily doctors on site. If you need evacuation, you need to be mede-vaced. The weather is not always pretty. So it's much more dangerous, let's say, to have those places. Advocacy places, and that's where the collaboration with Amy started. And we had also discussions with people from Yukon because this is a bit the same situation that is experienced in these communities there as well. It's quite isolated. Well, when you think of St. John's or Whitehorse, there are decent hospitals and things like this. But it's still quite isolated. The situation is quite different. And there is a paradoxical thing. There is a paradoxical thing also when you think about isolated communities. Here I'm showing you the residence time in months of people. So I don't know if you've ever done lake modeling. When you model a lake, you have a thing called the residence time of water in a lake. This is how long it takes, theoretically, for the water to be completely washed out of the lake. This is how many months it takes for the entire population of Toronto. For the entire population of Toronto and Winnipeg to fly out of Toronto or Winnipeg. So, on average, it takes five months, if you're thinking so, in terms of Winnipeg, for example, where 800,000 people, it takes about five months for 800,000 people to fly out of Winnipeg. I don't know what's wrong with the White Horse data. So, normally, when you see that type of data in travel thing, that is data. Travel thing that is data from official airlines. So typically, that means, for example, a low cost came in or some travel interruption took place. This is 2015. So I don't know if there was something at that point. But what you can see, this is Red Sucker Lake. So Red Sucker Lake is here, I think. And the other one is this one. This is Talluri Lake. And you can see that the outer. And you can see that the average residence time there is one month. So these are small communities, but it means essentially every month, well, of course, it's not every person that moves, but every month it's like every person in the community actually makes it out of them. So this is a 300-people community, but every month 300 people fly out of Tadunile. Yep. Is that because they're traveling more or because they're flying more? They're flying more. Exactly. No, no, but for example. Exactly. Yeah, fly no, no, but for example if you if you would tra so yeah, train in Canada. Okay, uh it wouldn't take you down to that level. This is a characteristic of isolated communities because people rely more on places that are distant because there is less locally. Okay, but yeah, no, no, no, I agree. I should have made that disclaimer. I should have made that disclaimer. Probably Toronto, Winnipeg will be somewhere around here. But you will still see this gradation the more isolated, typically, the more the short of a residence time. But there is another component, and that's where my other person comes in here. So my friend that I cited, she's a CLC1 in immigration futures. And so I was talking about our travel restrictions and so on. And she's always And she's always saying, What about the refugees? And so, this is another dimension. So, as a country, we close our borders and we close our borders officially to lower our introduction rate. But that's not necessarily the case. Okay, so part of the idea of the work that I'm going to show is try to understand a little bit how introductions work. Introductions work, what drives them, what's their contribution in the overall spread? Because that's going to be important when you're thinking about broader closures. And this is essentially what is the length of a stochastic period. And I'll come back to that. I won't talk about control or whatever. So in terms of model, I'll start with a very naive model. I like naive models. So I'll show you a little simple. So, I'll show you a little simulation. I was trying to do NetLogo, but I'm really bad. I tried to, actually, the other day I thought, oh yeah, I'll try to get ChatGPT to write some code to do a nice... And it did, but I couldn't get it to produce something. So I made my own little ABM read by. So three localities that are sort of connected linearly. Okay, so you can only move from here. Only. So you can only move from here to there, from there to here, or here to there, etc. And I've got an initial infectious person here. People are moving a bit around. I don't remember if I make them move around. I can probably see. But there's infection that happens, and I want it to focus on this. So what happens is, okay, there's propagation that takes place in a place, and then at one point, there's going to be a jump. Okay, that jump is an introduction. Okay, that jump is an introduction, that's following the introduction, it goes on, and that place, if you think of it as the middle place, this is the place of emergence, this is an intermediate host, and at one point, this intermediate host becomes an exporter in turn. Okay, so that's the process that I'm going to be focusing on. But you can see that essentially, this is how spatialization is going to happen. Okay, that's how it is becoming. That's how a disease becomes mobile. It gets a hold on somewhere and then it jumps over. So essentially, the process in a very naive way is something like, okay, I have emergence or re-emergence somewhere. Disease gets amplified. And at one point, there's exportation that happens. This goes into another location where that process repeats or not. Okay, and that's going to be important. Okay, and that's going to be important. But if the process repeats and the early amplification takes place, then exportation can happen and the chain continues. And that's how the disease starts to get mobile. So we modeled this way. The first idea was to try to understand the introduction event itself. So to do that, we used, so I did my PhD in a control theory lab, and in control theory, they do that all the time. They think of Do that over time. They think of a device, they throw a signal in entry in the device with a certain characteristic of signal, and they look at what characteristic of the signal goes out. And that sort of characterizes the device. So what we did is we threw a spike train of stimuli, which were infected individuals, and I'll note here that the size was only one here. Systematically, Here. Systematically, I'm not throwing multiple individuals, I'm just throwing one infectious individual at a time. This is a Poisson process. I control the speed of the rate of the Poisson process. And then this is a continuous time Markov chain that is immobile until it is stimulated by one of those introductions. And what happens then is you have a rate of introduction here, and that knock of chain actually transforms these introductions. Transform these introductions into essentially three possible outcomes. I think we did it better. I'm going to play with two. Maybe there's an unsuccessful introduction. I keep on throwing cases at the location, but nothing happens. The system doesn't react locally. Or there's a minor outbreak, or something big happens. And so we plotted plenty of things, but I'll just show you one. This is the average number of days between importations. Number of days between importations, so that's one over the rate of the Poisson process. And this is the effective reproduction number in the location that is subject to the stimulation. And what you can see is that, so this is the proportion, the color here is the proportion of successful introductions. So this is the number of times out of all the simulations we did for each parameter value pair where we actually get a successful introduction. Successful introduction. I'm not looking at how successful it is, I'm just assessing whether it is successful or not. And you can see this is 40%, 50%, 60%, etc. This is 99%. So if introductions, and remember, it's only a single one. I'm not playing with a number of introductions at a time, just one introduction each time. So if introductions are essentially here, they almost always lead to a secondary case in the location. Secondary case in the location. But at the same time, we plotted the attack rate. So it's a composite attack rate in a sense, but we're not looking at the entire duration of the epidemic. We just looked at, I don't remember, it was 90 days. So over 90 days, how many people get the disease? And you can see that if you're doing a good job controlling, so if your local R0 is small, then the final size stays quite small. Stays quite small. Whereas if you're not controlling well, this final size obviously gets quite large. So the epidemic slowballs once it gets there, and there's quite a lot of success of local transmissions. Okay, so then the other thing we wanted to look at was the contribution of introductions. And I'm not going to talk about this problem of border closures. I won't talk about it. But the idea was: okay, we closed borders, we interrupted travel. And one of the questions here became, okay, but how efficient is it? What does that mean in terms of propagation? So to look at this, what we looked at is an importation layer. So the idea is, I'll do it with a two-patch printer population, very simple one. We've got an exporter. Simple one. We've got an exporter, but it's that emergence location. Yes, I know. So we've got an exporter and cases are happening there. And then there's all of them are connected. Okay, I'm just showing the ones that are important, but the susceptible can move to the importer. Everybody can move there. But in the importer, I'm distinguishing between the introduction layer. So this is where I'm. Layer. So, this is where I'm putting people that came from outside the jurisdiction. And I'm putting everybody goes their merry way and interacts there. Okay, so this is the whole population, but in the whole population, I'm distinguishing between individuals who came from outside and individuals who are there. And because this is a continuous time mark of chain, I can track every single event. So, what you get is something like this. So, here, this is the exportation layer. This is the exportation layer. So, for those of you who know Unix, this is time zero. I decided to take it in temporal. So, I went for time zero. So, this is the exportation patch. And here I have a little epidemic going on. And you can see, you know, that's one of the cool things. I can see D is for detected. Okay, I should have mentioned this. We have two pathways. Here I'm focusing on whether the cases are detected. Focusing on whether the cases are detected or not. I don't care whether it's asymptomatic or symptomatic. What's important is the idea was COVID. Am I detected or am I not detected? So here you can see the light blue are the undetected individuals. I took quite a low detection percentage here. The darker blue are detected cases. These are the introduction fencets. So these are the individuals who at one point made the move into the introduction layer. Into the introduction layer. This is introduction, infection spark, sorry, in the community, in the porter, by introductions. Not a lot. This is just one. And this is introduction, infections in the community by community members. So this is essentially a failed introduction. Now, things can get a bit more agitated here. So I've got a slightly bigger epidemic in the exporter. Bigger epidemic in the exporter, these are the introductions. And you can see, I'm allowing even detected individuals to move here. So there's a few detected individuals, there's a few latent individuals who travel, a few undetected individuals. These are the contributions of the introduced people to the infection in the community. And here you have a few minor outbreaks about how happening, but I've chosen a few examples. But I've chosen a few examples, of course. I have plenty of simulations. So you can see after a while things start to pick up. So these are cases that are in the community only. They're generated in the community by community members. These are generated in the community by importations or introductions. And now, this is the typical case. I've got an epidemic going on here. I've got a few introductions. These introductions generally These introductions generate some cases, but very quickly, infections in the community by community members completely take over. And if you summarize on average, what you see is something like this. So here I'm showing the percentage, this is the number of infections, but this is the percentage, that's what I want you to focus on. That black curve is the percentage of transmissions that are taking place in a community. Place in the community because of introduced cases. And you can see that, of course, at the beginning, if you don't have an epidemic in a place, you need it to come from elsewhere. And that's the seed of your local epidemic. But very quickly, so this is a low travel r uh the uh left is a low travel rate and uh right is a high travel rate, okay? But you can see that in both cases about twenty days even 20 days, even before, about 20 days into the introduction, that's when the local contribution of introductions peaked. And if you're thinking about what happened with COVID, most of the time when we took decisions to close borders, we were way past this because these are all the cases. I'm not saying they're detected or not. This is like the entire epidemic. Probably we were closing borders at this point or something like this. At this point, or something like this, or closing borders or interrupting travel, etc. Let's switch to the next topic. Sorry, I'm rushing through three topics. But the next one is actually some questions that were asked here. So part of the introduction process is how successful it is. And it can be a sort of mixed result. So I'm showing you several epidemics. Several epidemics. One in Orange County, which is close to New York City. And here it's essentially from the day of introduction, there was quite a nice outbreak. Then things mellowed down and then there was a second outbreak. But essentially, it's very close to a large city, probably people leaving the city to go elsewhere. Okay. Jefferson County, that's where my co-author on that paper is located. So that's where Lou. So that's where Louisville is. And you can see that here you have something that probably an SIR model or something like this would work quite well. I suppose. Winnipeg, we had a level outbreak at the beginning of the pandemic, but it was nothing much, and then we had two waves. But what really, and we were discussing that the other day, what really bugs anybody who's trying to do some fitting Who's trying to do some fitting is something like this. So, this is the middle of nowhere, Wyoming. And they had, so if you look at it as a NEPI plot, that's what the initial stages looked like. So, if you're trying to fit an SIR model or anything like this here, that enormously long period of almost nothing happening breaks everything. So, I know the discussion was: did you manage to do it? Discussion was: Did you manage to do it? No, I didn't manage to do that. So I'm just pointing out that these periods happen. I'm interested in how long do they go for. And so what we did, yes, I wanted to illustrate, there's also a spatial aspect. So this is data from, I come from here somewhere, and this is data for influenza. It happens with a variety of diseases. And if I focus on the initial stage, you can see that that thing is going on like this. And perhaps these are two. And perhaps these are two neighboring regions, and you can see that sometimes they bounce up and down, and maybe it's those introductions. But we were wondering: okay, first of all, how long does this thing last? And second, is there some sort of cross-correlation from neighboring locations that are throwing in these cases in there? So, what we did is we looked at the simplest model possible, we looked at an SIS model, continuous time Markov K and SIS model. Model really simple. The only thing is, we gave it a little twist. We said, okay, so if you look at a continuous time marker chain or a discrete time for that matter, you've got i equals 0, that's an absorbing state, and you know that with probability 1, because there's an absorbing state, you'll end up there. So, okay, I'm going to have an epidemic of sorts, perhaps. But, okay. What we did is we said, oh, yeah, but when you look at these graphs, You look at these graphs, when things start to explode, yeah, that's essentially when approximated by an SIR model. So that's the deterministic phase. And before that, we have a stochastic phase. So we put a threshold that essentially represents at what point do I switch from this undecided going around phase to I have a deterministic epidemic where an SIR model will work well. Model will work well. So we put this threshold i-hat there, and what we looked at is essentially something like this. So I don't remember what I-hat was there. Here I have a few trajectories. The blue ones are absorbed at the disease-free equilibrium, remain there. The brown ones are absorbed at the top threshold. So I'm calling those deterministic. And what I'm interested in is, well, and you can see. Interested in is well, and you can see I have some red ones that haven't left that box at the time, of course, they will leave it. But the idea is, well, how long do I stay in this box? Because this box, I mean, inside, really inside the box. How long do I stay positive but less than the threshold? And so, of course, there's some discussion to be had about what value you take for the upper threshold, because The upper threshold, because if you make it too big, essentially it's like if you didn't have any. If you make it too small, you're absorbed in one of the two thresholds very quickly. And so there's a, I'll pass on this, but we did some approximation using a multi-type branching process, and we compared the probability of absorption in zero with a Markov chain and with a multi type branching process, and we set ourselves a threshold on this, and that's what allows us to determine what the threshold is. To determine what the threshold is. And what you see is something that is not really proven here. Okay, this is the mean duration of that stochastic. So I understand it's complicated to tell us how you chose the threshold, but what's it based on? Like just R0 or a single number all the time? So you compute the multi-type branching process approximation that gives you, you can compute the probability of absolute. You can compute the probability of absorption in zero. And then you run the Markov chain and you see how long it takes to be absorbed in zero. And as you change that threshold, that mean duration changes. And so what you do is you give yourself an objective, like I want an error of 5% between the multi-type branching process approximation. Branching process approximation and the type that the time that it takes me with the Markov change, and you take one that works for your whole parameter region. I think we end up using 30 something. Okay, but it's one number for the whole parameter region. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It should be. No, no, no, you're right. And I mean, technically, of course, it should depend on parameter values. But we didn't do that. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, as you see, I mean, it's slightly shifted, so that's interesting. The mean duration, and if you think about it, Duration, and if you think about it, it makes complete sense. It's slightly shifted to the right of R0 equals 1. Because there, the disease doesn't really know what to do. It's sufficiently close, but just above of R0 equals 1, but it's quite likely to go down to 0, but it doesn't really want to because R0 is larger than 1, but also it doesn't really want to explode because R0 is just a bit larger than 1. And then we looked at a bit of operation, I'll be done in a minute. We looked at the same version. Minute, we looked at the same version, but looking at two patches because here the idea was: okay, so I have two locations that are undergoing that process. Does the fact that the two are connected, so you can imagine that one is going towards zero and the epidemic is going on a bit here, and so that one that is going towards zero is reseeded by the one that is not going to zero. And what we get is, so these are awful, there's about a billion simulations in each. About a billion simulations in each of these pictures because we can also compute how many simulations we need to be to have a precision level we want. And what you can see is that it's a bit like I was saying before. This is a case where one of the locations has a large R0 and the other has an R0 that I vary. And that K here that I'm varying, no, I'm not varying, I'm varying here and there, but this is the proportion of the total population that's located in. Population that's located in one of the locations. And that's the move rate between the two. What I just want to point out here is that you see that the largest, the longest duration is for an R0 slightly larger than one. This is something we don't test a lot. Just to finish, what was wrong with what I did? When my model is bad, and as someone who spent his life doing metapopulations, I should do meta-opulation. Metapopulations, I should do metapopulations. Because, of course, the chain of propagation that I was showing you is never like this in real life. You don't have a chain of patches that are connected like this. What's going to happen is that when that guy starts exporting, it might infect another location that might become an exporter, in which case, remember that the frequency of importations is really determinant in your importation of a case. Importation of a case. And so the fact that you're connected to two locations is increasing your risk of importing cases. And that's it. Questions?
