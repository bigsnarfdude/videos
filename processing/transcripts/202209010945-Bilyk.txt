It's a great location, a great conference. Okay, so I will speak about the discrete minimizers of energy integrals, and let me first introduce the main objects that I will be dealing with. So the main objects will be energy integrals. So these are objects of this type, right? So case some kernel. Let's say omega is a compact metric, space metric is not so important. For the purposes of this. For the purposes of this talk, the kernel K will usually, most of the times, be continuous or bounded. Although, of course, in many interesting examples, such as the Reese energy, you have singular kernels, but I will not talk too much about this case. Already, if it's bounded kernels, there are many interesting questions. And the question then is. The question then is: so here μ is a probability measure on the set omega, it's a regular Borel probability measure, and you want to look at this quantity and you want to minimize it over such probability measures. So basically, the way to think about it is if you have a unit charge on omega, where the particles, so to say, interact according to the kernel K. Interact according to the kernel k, you want to find the equilibrium distribution. And one particular example that I will be interested in is what if omega is the sphere? Your kernel k is rotationally invariant, just depends on the relative position of the two particles. And it's then one of the standard questions, the most natural questions is if Questions is: Is the uniform measure a minimizer of this energy integral? Right? So, again, if you think about some norm, some good interaction, then you expect that the particles will locate themselves uniformly on the sphere, that minimizing energy will lead to the uniform distribution. So, you want to ask the question with whether sigma is a minimizer, whether it's a unique minimizer, and other questions in this direction. I will talk about this case. I will talk about this. This case is luckily, at least on this fear, is easy to understand. The biggest part of my talk will be devoted to the opposite situation, when the uniform measure is not a minimizer, when something opposite happens, when the minimizers are very non-uniform, in particular discrete. The minimizer of the energy becomes a discrete measure. But for now, let's for a moment concentrate on what happened. Moment, concentrate on what happens with this question here. Okay. All right. So, and I apologize, my slides are a combination of typed and handwritten. Sorry. W? No, not necessarily. Okay. But Omega is compact, and we assume that it's continuous, so it doesn't matter. So, so it doesn't matter, you just can move it by a constant, yeah. And this will actually arise right now. So, here, this is a um brief introduction into positive definite functions. Actually, tomorrow there will be two talks about positive definite functions, which I'm looking forward to. So, yeah, everybody knows this. The foundative kernel is called positive definite if for any set of points, the gram main. Points, the gram matrix generated by this kernel is positive semi-definite. Okay, it's actually equivalent, so more relevant to our case. This definition is equivalent to saying that the energy with respect to this kernel of any measure new, any signed measure new, is non-negative. So nu is a signed measure. This equivalence is very easy to understand just by weak star density of discrete measures. Discrete measures. You can pass to all measures then. Okay, all right. So there are a couple very simple things that you can say about the minimizers. So if mu is the minimizer of the energy integral here, then first of all, you know that k is positive definite on the support of mu up to constant. So positive definite up to constant. There exists a Positive definite up to constant. There exists a constant, so it's positive definite. So, this is something that's not very hard to prove. And there is also a standard fact from potential theory that if you compute the potential, that is, you integrate with respect to mu just once, the function that you get is going to be constant on the supported mean. Okay, so these implications, just like this, they go one way, but you can revert them actually if you add one. Actually, if you add one more condition, and that condition is that mu has full support. So with this condition, you can revert this implication. These two conditions together would imply that μ is a minimizer. Okay, well, this immediately translates to the sphere, okay? Because if you are on the sphere and And your kernel is rotationally invariant here, okay? Then this condition here is by rotational invariance, it's automatically satisfied, okay? If your measure is sigma, by rotational invariance, you integrate with respect to sigma, the result does not depend on x. And then that tells you that the fact that sigma minimizes the energy is equivalent to the fact that this kernel is positive definite. This kernel is positive definite on the sphere up to constant. So, this is just an equivalence. And also, this is an old result of due to Schoenberg from the 1940s: that this is equivalent to the fact that the expansion of f into corresponding Gegen-Bauer polynomials is positive definite, is positive, has positive coefficients or non-negative coefficients. And here, this starts from n equal to one because this is all up to a constant. All right. Actually, it turns out that these two conditions together, so full support and the fact that the potential is a constant, imply even much more. This is a copy of the theorem from the recent paper with Ryan Matski and Alex Plasouk. Okay, so if Okay, so if suppose you have a kernel that satisfies these two conditions that I just mentioned. So it's the potential is constant. So we call it K invariant. And it has full support. So then I don't want to go over everything, but then it turns out that there are 10 different conditions, or you can say even more, that are actually all equivalent to each other. Are actually all equivalent to each other, and let me just mention some of them, at least some groups of conditions that turn out to be equivalent. In particular, positive definiteness up to a constant is equivalent to conditional positive definiteness. Okay, it's well conditional positive definiteness means that this inequality is true for measures with mean zero. In general, this without additional conditions here, the implications. Additional conditions here, the implication works only in one direction. Only one implies two, but not necessarily vice versa. Okay, then you have a group of conditions related to energy minimization. Okay, and it turns out that they're all equivalent being a local minimizer. And I will not go into details in which sense I mean it, but being a local minimizer is equivalent to being a global minimizer over all probability measures. And it's equivalent to being a global minimizer. And it's equivalent to being a global minimizer over all signed measures of mass one, so which is not even a non-compact set. Then there are convexity properties. And it's interesting that you have, again, you have a local property, just convexity at this measure mu. It's equivalent to convexity everywhere. And you also have, well, this representation. Okay, so I won't go too much into. Okay, so I won't go too much into details. I just want to mention that, yeah, here it seems, I wouldn't put any money on the fact that any particular implication here was not known before. Many of these implications, if you dig through various papers, are known. I haven't seen anywhere where it was observed that all of these things are really equivalent. So I think some of the implications might be new, but mostly probably because. Mostly, probably, because people overlook them. So, naturally, some implications do not require any conditions here. So, here in this diagram, the black arrows are the implications that do not require any additional conditions. The squiggly arrows are the ones that require this k-invariance, the fact that the potential is a constant. And the dashed lines, and there are only a few of them here and here, are the ones that require full support of the measure. And then that puts the whole thing together. Then you have all these conditions equivalent. All right. So yeah, this was a little bit of a detour because this all, in particular, when you're on the sphere, this applies to the uniform surface measure. Surface measure. Okay, and I really want to talk about the case when it's not the uniform surface, when minimizing energy does not lead to uniform distribution. Okay, well, let's actually go back here and I want to show that there is already something you can say about minimizers just from this basic knowledge. So, this on the sphere for rotational invariant kernels, there is a certain dichotomy. There is a certain dichotomy that appears. Either sigma is a minimizer of the energies, either uniform measure is a minimizer, or if it is not, then a minimizer cannot be supported on the whole sphere. It must be supported on a proper subset. Why is that? Because if it's supported on the whole sphere, then by this implication here, your kernel has to be positive definite on the supports or the whole sphere, but then if it's positive definite on the whole sphere. But then, if it's positive definite, on the whole sphere, sigma is a minimizer. So, already you have this thing where if sigma does not minimize, so if the kernel is not positive definite, then minimizers necessarily have smaller support, not the whole sphere. All right. So, let me now briefly talk about discrete energies. This is a very interesting and very closely related. Is a very interesting and very closely related topic, although in this talk I mostly concentrate on energy integrals. So, discrete energy by discrete energy, I will mean an expression like this for some finite set of points in omega. I like to normalize it this way because then this definition is compatible with the definition of the energy integral. So, this is just the energy integral with respect to the average of Drag masses. Average of Dirac masses. And well, and of course, you can do it only when the kernel is non-singular, but again, in this talk, it is. Yeah, there are all sorts of questions that you can ask about discrete energies. Naturally, the questions about discrete energies are more delicate. Of course, if you understand everything about the discrete energy, you can just pass to the limit and understand everything about the energy integral. Integral. Okay, and there are many famous examples of problems about discrete energies like this. So one of the most famous, so here the kernel is singular. This is the so-called Thomson problem that goes back to 1904. What would happen if you put n electrons on the sphere? They interact according to the Coulomb potential. What would be their equilibrium position? Equilibrium position. And the exact answer to this question is known only for a handful of values of n and for five points. This was a computer-assisted proof not so long ago. There are all sorts of extensions of this problem. It's for five points, I think. For five points, I think it's a, if I'm not mistaken, it's a square, square pyramid. No, this is a triangular bipyramid. So you have a triangle on the equator and two and two poles. So there are basically two there are two candidates. So this and the square pyramid, square-based pyramid was appropriately chosen base. And it turns out that for some range of, so if you put a power here, so for some range of powers, So for some range of powers, it's the square pyramid. For some range of powers, it's triangular by pyramid, but there is no short proof of that. So the proof that exists required computer-assisted computations. All right. Yeah, so there is an extension to other values of S and to the logarithmic energy to higher dimensional spheres. Yeah, again, specific solutions for discrete. Specific solutions for discrete energies are known only in very few cases. Notice that you can also, and this will be interesting for our case, you can take s less than zero. Okay, in this case, only the difference is that you either put a minus in front or you maximize them. So actually, let me stop on that question. So this is known as the Fayette problem, the sum of distances. So if you are in the sphere, you want to maximize the sum of distances. Basically, such objects with some domain omega and some distance. Domain omega and some distance, not necessarily Euclidean. They come up very often in metric geometry. And these things help you understand the structure of your metric space. This particular problem is closely related to the so-called spherical cap discrepancy, which I will not define here, but basically it's a measure of equidistribution of a set of points with respect to spherical caps. Okay, some sort of L2 average. And there is a fact known. And there is a fact known as Stolarsky invariance principle, which is an identity, actually. So it's written here. So the difference between this discrete energy and this energy integral with respect to sigma is exactly up to a multiplicative constant, the square of the L2 spherical cap discrepancy. So it's a very, very interesting topic, which it's a subject for a totally different talk. A totally different talk. But it's interesting. It tells you that minimizing del 2 spherical cap discrepancy is exactly the same as maximizing the pairwise sum of Euclidean distances. It's an interesting property. Okay, but now since we're talking about discrete energies for the Euclidean distance, let's look at what's known about the continuous, about the energy integrals with respect to the Euclidean distance. So I assume that I assume that omega is a compact set in Rn. And we look at such energy integral. So we put some power alpha on the distance. So this was studied initially by Bjork in the 50s. And there is an interest in phase transition. So you know that between for alpha between know that between for alpha between zero and two you have a unique maximizer okay for alpha greater than two all the maximizers must be uh discrete okay as and uh they have at most d plus one points where in the in the support where d is the dimension so this is a this is the first example that i'm showing where we have the fact that minimizers of or maximizers of of energy Maximizers of energy have to be discrete. So this could be easily now translated to the sphere. And on the sphere, you can say even more. On the sphere, well, first of all, when you're between zero and two, you have a unique maximizer, but your energy is rotationally invariant, so it can only be sigma. invariant so it can only be sigma the only rotationally invariant measure on the uh on the sphere right um you could also prove it alternatively you could look at this function and see that it's negative definitely expanded and gegenbauer polynomials but this would have been more complicated here it's just an easy consequence okay uh when alpha is greater than two not only you just have discrete minimizers but the minimizer or maximizers sorry but the maximizer Maximizers, sorry, but the maximizers just collapse to equal masses at two opposite poles on the sphere. So, those are the only, and that actually easily follows from this phase transition. In this phase transition, when alpha is equal to two, any barycentric measure, so many measure with center of mass at zero is a maximizer. And that's very easy to see because you can just write. You can just write, I'll just use the law of cosines. And then when you integrate an x and y, this will split. And you will see that you maximize when the center of mass is zero. All right. So it's an interesting example where you see one phase transition between two very different behaviors. Two very different behaviors. You have the case where the uniform measure optimizes the energy, and then you have once you pass the transition point, you have just discrete minimizers, maximizers. And of course, at the phase transition, which is natural to expect, you have a whole zoo of different optimizers, which include things from both sides, of course. There is one. There is one we recently noticed that there is a simple, a nice application for this. You can also state a simple corollary for a corresponding energy on the Heming cube with the Heming distance. So the Heming cube is just negative one to the D. And the Heming distance is just the number of the coordinates where the entries differ, right? And you can express it. Right, and you can express it actually as the up to a constant is the square of the Euclidean distance if you view this as a subset of Rd, and actually it's embeds into a multiple of the sphere. And then you can actually use the previous results to say the following, that if you can consider this energy integral now, you have a phase transition at alpha equal to one, because we have a square here, it's at alpha equal to one. Alpha is at alpha equal to one because things work very similarly as they do on sphere. Again, you have for alpha less than one, you have the uniform measure on the Heming cube. For alpha greater than one, you have mass one half at opposite poles. And otherwise, at the phase transition, you have all barycentric measures. So, this is very simple. It's just a cute application. Let's actually return back to the sphere. Actually, return back to the sphere. So we have this condition. So we have this property that comes back to Bjork. And we see that there is a phase transition at alpha equal to 2. So one reason that you have this phase transition, at least heuristically or philosophically, is that when alpha is large, and here it turns out that 2 really means large, your current Your kernel here is very, very small near zero. And it's the repulsion that's encoded in the kernel is very, very weak. That's why it allows the points to the particles to collapse into the same position. So this is one of the main players and what's responsible for the fact that you have discrete minimizers, but turns out that it's not the only one. But it turns out that it's not the only one. It turns out that it's not about only about the degree of the repulsion. Okay, and here is another result. Let's look at the geodesic distance. So this is a result that a few years ago we obtained with Feng and with my former student Ryan Matski. Okay, so we look at the exact same energy integral where we have replaced the Euclidean distance by the Jeodes. The Euclidean distance by the geodesic distance on the sphere at small scales, the behavior is equivalent. But turns out that in this case, you have a similar phase transition, but it happens at alpha equal to one, not at alpha equal to two. So when alpha is greater than one, you have again the same behavior, opposite poles. When alpha is below one, uniform measure is the unique maximizer. Measure is the unique maximizer. There is a slightly different behavior at alpha equal to one. It's not all barycentric measures, it's all symmetric measures, centrally symmetric. And actually, one way to prove it is a certain different version of the Stalarsky principle. So you can prove this identity that if you look when alpha is equal to one, if you look at this energy integral, if you look at pi over two minus this energy integral, it's Two minus this energy integral, it actually equals this discrepancy. Let's look at what so we're doing. So we're looking at the measure of a hemisphere minus one half. And we square it and then we integrate it over all hemispheres, overall centers of hemispheres. So this is really a discrepancy of hemispheres with respect to the measure mu. And yeah, if the measure is symmetric, then of course this. Matter is symmetric, then, of course, this quantity on the right is zero. And then this energy integral is maximized. All right, so okay, so in general, we will look at two types of different interaction kernels. Although, on the sphere, it might Although on the sphere, it might not be so important in the end, but if you're in some other domains, especially if you're on an unbounded domain, that gives you totally different, very different behaviors. So you have repulsive potentials. So these are potentials that look like this. So here, R is the distance between the two points. So the interaction becomes weaker as points move away from each other. Then you have the so-called attractive-repulsive potentials. Potentials, okay, where the interaction becomes weaker at first when points move away from each other, but then it becomes stronger there too far. Attractive-repulsive potentials arise very often in physics, in actually also in sociology, and in biology, in different population studies. Actually, since Qi quoted some philosophers, I think it's also quote some philosophers. It makes sense. I will also quote some philosophers. So, this is from Schopenhauer. He has this parable about the porcupines, where the porcupines they try to get closer to each other because it was cold, they wanted to get warmer, but then they start to prick each other and then they try to get away from each other. So, this is really an example of a attractive-repulsive potential. So, here is the same. So here is the same. This is from the original edition in German, the Stachelschweine. And it's also, there is a Wikipedia article about this issue, the so-called hedgehog's dilemma. It was also, apparently Freud also mentioned it. So more generally, this explains why this may be relevant in the study of populations. Relevant in the study of populations because, uh, well, the population may individuals in a population may want to stick together in order to share resources, help each other, but also may want to try to disperse in order to have space. In particular, I think from this point of view, it makes sense that sometimes for these attractive-repulsive potentials, you will be seeing discrete minimizers. I think, in some sense, this is. I think in some sense this is similar, at least philosophically, to the formation of cities or clans or tribes where certain when some parts of the population collapse and essentially a point. All right. Of course, well, if we're talking about attractive-repulsive potentials, if you are in a compact domain, If you're in a compact domain, you already have the attractive part. You have this just from the fact that you're in a compact domain, that you cannot escape from a compact domain. So very often, just repulsive potentials with weak repulsion will already demonstrate the same behavior as attractive repulsive potentials. But let me now go back to this result of Bjork that I mentioned a few slides ago. Slides ago. And let's recall that there was this phase transition at alpha equal to two, where you transitioned from a unique minimizer to maximizer to for sure having just discrete maximizers. And so the transition is at alpha equal to two. And that's an interesting point. So Bjork's proof was. Bjork's proof was it didn't allow much room for perturbations of this result. It was very geometric. It used the structure of the Euclidean distance. But I want to mention another result, which is much more recent, so 60 years later. So this is 2017 by Caria, Figali, and Patakini. So here you will, once I explain the results, you will immediately notice the similarities. The similarities. So here they are all on all of our Rd. So this is a non-compact domain, but you have an attractive-repulsive potential, which looks like this. So these properties here just mean that it looks like that. So the result states the following: that if you have this behavior near zero, like minus r to the alpha here, for alpha greater than two. Alpha greater than two. Now you're probably recognizing the similarity with the previous slide with Bjork's results. So you have repulsion of the order r to the alpha where alpha is greater than two. Then all global minimizers of this energy integral are discrete with finite support. I actually want to, by the way, I have until about 25 or half. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I have more slides than needed, but I can always stop earlier. So. Stop earlier. So, okay. I want to actually give you an idea of the proof of this result because it's pretty interesting. Also, what's interesting is that it appears they didn't know about Bjork's result because Bjork's paper is not cited in their paper. But the idea is the following. So, assume, we'll prove it by contradiction. Let's assume that there are There are that the minimizer is not discrete, so the support has an accumulation point. So let's assume you have an accumulation point, so there are points approaching it. Choose a sub-sequence of points that approaches it almost along a single direction. So let's and now for simplicity, let's assume that it does approach along a single direction. So now let's say we let's just say we have three points on the line. A line okay, and let's say that these distances are one and r2. Okay, so I will take just these three points and I will put some masses in these points. So I will consider a measure that's just supporting these three points. And we know that the kernel has to be positive, if this is a minimizer, the kernel. Positive if this is a minimizer, the kernel has to be positive definite on the support. So, in particular, it has to be positive definite on these three points. Okay, in particular, now if I apply, if I take any measure, say any measure with mass zero on these three points, I should get a positive quantity. So now you optimize this over the choice of masses at these three points. And I won't do the computation, but once you optimize, you get this inequality. Get this inequality. Okay. All right. Well, when you get this inequality, but then you have this behavior. So it behaves roughly as negative r to the alpha. Well, assume it depends, it's actually r to the alpha. Alpha. So you have this inequality here actually fails for alpha greater than two. So that's the idea of the proof. Of course, there are That's the idea of the proof. Of course, there are lots of limiting procedures that you need to do, but this is the main idea. And actually, this idea is also lurking somewhere behind the scenes in Bjork's proof. Okay, so it's an interesting thing that you have, yeah, you have this fairly recent result, which list partial. Least partially replicates Bjork's result. But again, so this goes with the same philosophy: that when you have this weak repulsion, you have discrete minimizers. There is one more result that I wanted to mention that goes, that is along the same lines. So, this is also a fairly recent result by Lehman McCann. So, here we're also on Rd, and the potential is special. Is special. The kernel is the so-called Leonard-Jones potential, but with positive powers. And the coefficients here are chosen specifically so that the minimum of this function is at one. And this term really tells that the behavior near zero is negative r to the alpha, just like in the previous example. So here, if you have weak repulsion and alpha is greater than or equal to two, includes, so this includes two. Includes two, okay. And if beta is large enough, and they even have some bounds, then not only do you know that the minimizer is discrete, you actually know what the minimizer is. The minimizer is going to be the unit simplex scaled so that each distance is one. Each distance corresponds to the minimum of the kernel. Okay, so yeah, that's also an interesting result along the same lines. Now, let me. Now, let me go to the sphere, and I have a little bit of time, so at least I will tell you about at least one more very interesting problem, also along the same lines. So on this sphere, there are many interesting potentials that have the same, this sort of the following properties. So it's an attractive-repulsive potential, which is even, an even function, and has minimum at zero. Has minimum at zero. And in a sense, such potentials are, I like to think about them as orthogonalizing. So if you minimize energies with some potentials, with such potentials, that may lead to some sort of orthogonal structures. And there is actually at least one example that I will show where we do know that that happens. And there are some conjecture where we don't yet know that it happens, but we strongly believe it. Well, notice that actually. Well, notice that actually, if you work with such potentials, since the function here is even, really a proper setting for it would be to go to the projective plane, projective space, and then do things on the projective space. And on the projective space, this would just be repulsive potential. Just keep one part. But it's more geometrically intuitive if you think about it being on the sphere. So before I move to the next example, since I don't have too much time, let me. Since I don't have too much time, let me jump forward a little bit and I'll show you one important example where such potentials arise. And this is the so-called frame potential. Okay, so this is well, frames were mentioned several times already in this conference. So here we have a unit norm tight frame. We have a unit norm tight frame, so that's essentially an over-complete orthonormal basis. So it's uh it allows for representation of vectors and standard orthogonal expansion, but with some constant here, or you have the Parseval's identity with a certain constant here. And it's an old result of, well, fairly old, 2003, almost 20 years, by Benedetta and Ficos that be in a tight frame. Be in a tight frame is actually equivalent to being a minimizer of this discrete energy. So the kernel here is the absolute value of the inner product squared. So if you're in the real case, then this works both in the real and the complex case. If you're in the real case, then the absolute value is not needed. Actually, The lower bounds for this, this goes back to Welch, for example. This is a famous inequality known as the Welch bound. This works in the complex case. And actually, for when k is equal to one, this becomes exactly the frame energy. And the right-hand side in this case becomes one over d, one over the dimension. One already dimension. Okay. And you can notice that since the right-hand side is now independent of n, that means that you can also pass to arbitrary measures. You can pass to measure to energy integrals rather than discrete sums. And actually, you can, once you have the case k equal to one, it's quite easy to get the general case for arbitrary k using the so-called tensor power trick. Called Tensor Power Trick. So that's a very common technique. Terry Tao has a blog entry about it. I think there is a WikiTrick page dedicated specifically to that trick. So basically, you just look at symmetric tensors, and that's the dimension of the space of symmetric tensors. And then it becomes the same bound. However, this bound is actually sharp in the complex case, but it's But it's not sharp in the real case. And in the real case, you can use what I have just said. So you have these absolute values don't matter anymore. And you have the energy with respect to the kernel t to the 2k. That's a positive definite kernel, just because t is positive definite. And by Schur's theorem, any power is positive definite. Okay, and since it's positive definite. And since it's positive definite, then this energy is minimized by sigma. And you can compute this integral. And this integral gives you this quantity. And this quantity, of course, when k is one, you get the same thing. You get one over d. But when k is greater than one, then this is a better bound. This is a larger quantity. So in the real case, Welsh bound is not. Bound is not sharp. And there are very interesting things that happen in between. So, okay, so we have the following. If you look, and again, notice that the right-hand sides here are independent of n, so you can have the same bounds, of course, for well, and this is this is for the energy integral. Okay, so if you look at the So, if you look at the arbitrary power here, so as we just discussed, when you have an even integer, when the power is 2k, then we have sigma as a minimizer. So everywhere here, sigma is a minimizer, but also you have discrete minimizers. So, and why you have discrete minimizers? Well, one way to understand that, well, here we already know that you have frames, unit norm side frames. Frames, unit norm type frames are minimizers. But a more general way to understand why you have discrete minimizers is that when t is 2k, when t is even, your kernel is a polynomial. And there exists spherical designs. And spherical designs, just by definition, give you the same value as sigma, as the uniform measure. That's the definition of spherical design, because your kernel is a polynomial. Okay, so since sigma is a minimizer and spherical designs give you the same thing, they're also. Designs give you the same thing, they're also minimizers. So that means that at even integers, you have a whole big family of minimizers. What happens, at least experimentally, is that between the even integers, you have only discrete minimizers. And for p between zero and two, this was actually proved by Ehler and Akuzo. Proved by Eiler and Okuzo, that only the orthonormal basis is a minimizer. It's actually very easy to deduce that from the knowledge that we have about the case P equal to 2. But other cases were not quite clear. The conjecture is that all the minimizers are discrete. Okay, and well, one thing that is known that, and this is the result of This results by myself, Alex Glaziering, Ryan Matsuki, Josiah Park, and Alex Plasuk. And I'm sorry, I accidentally, so this should be Matsuki. So when there exist so-called tight designs, I don't want to go into all the details about tight designs, but when they exist, uniform measures on them. Uniform measures on them give you discrete minimizers on the whole range of p's between two consecutive even integers. And one important property that's used here about tight designs is that tight designs are designs of sufficiently high degree. And at the same time, the pairwise distances between points take few values. Okay, so that's an important property that's here. 600 cell is not a A 600 cell is not a tight design, but it's almost a tight design. And then, with some additional computations, you can also prove this for the 600 cell. But this list exhausts all known tight designs. So, unfortunately, these are the essentially the only cases in which we know that for non-integer p's, minimizers are discrete. And can I use one? Can I use one or two more minutes? We have a coffee break after this, right? Okay, thank you. Sorry. I'll go back and I want to mention one more problem, which is of the same type, and I'll mention it really quick. So this is also known as the Feystott problem, although Feishtot posed it for the discrete energy, but it's easy to translate it to energy integral. So the problem is the following. Problem is the following. Now, our kernel is the acute angle between points. So, you take the minimum between the angle and pi minus the angle. So, think about your points as think about the lines generated by the points and take the acute angle between the lines, or non-obtuse. In other terms, you can think about this as a geodesic distance in the projective space. So, this is the function kernel. So, this is the funct kernel that looks like this, depending on the angle. Okay, the conjecture is that, and as I said before, that you in such cases you optimizers should probably bring out some orthogonal structure. So, here the conjecture is very simple, that it should be the orthonormal basis, measure uniformly concentrated on elements of an orthonormal basis. This should be the maximizer. This is not known. There are just This is not known. There are just some bounds known, but the conjecture is still far from being resolved. There are some interesting recent developments. So in particular, I want to talk about this result. So it is known that if you take, if you change the power here, it is known that there exists a phase transition. So somewhere between one and two and strictly. Somewhere between one and two, and strictly less than two, there exists a phase transition so that after that phase transition, indeed, up to certain symmetries, the minimizers, the maximizers of the energy are the conjectured orthonormal basis. This result is why I wanted to mention it. It has an interesting history, and I'll stop with this slide, I promise. So, the history is the following. Lim and McCann proved this result with some alpha D. They just proved that there exists a phase transition somewhere. Exists a phase transition somewhere. And of course, alpha d equals one, that would be the phase thought conjecture. If it happens at one, that would be um so once they posted the paper in the archive together with the same collaborators, Glazerinaski, Park, and Lasuk, we realized almost immediately that you can prove that result much easier. And you can actually get an effective bound for alpha D. An effective bound for alpha d and our bound was two, but it was including two. So we wrote we wrote it to them, and then they realized that you can actually move it down a notch. You can show that alpha d has to be strictly less than two. And basically, the idea is that the proof actually showed that for alpha equal to two, up to symmetries, the or Up to symmetries, the orthonormal basis would be a unique minimizer, maximizer. Yes, but they could show, and this is again quite natural, that at the phase transition, you must have more maximizers. So that meant that the phase transition has to be somewhere below. So what ended up happening is that they wrote a paper, and there is an appendix on the paper written by us with that argument. With that argument. Okay, and I will be happy to talk to anybody and give more details. I know I didn't give almost any details in this talk, but I just wanted to show all these examples where you have discrete optimizers of math energy integrals. And I'll stop here. Sorry, I abused your attention by a few minutes. Apologies. Thank you. Well, thank you, Dima, for a very interesting talk. Are there questions? Talk or other questions? Yeah, so this last series, I have one question. So, is it a cheat if you pull it for one hour and then this result will be automatically achieved for figure out? I think so, yes. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah, I think you're I think you've the conjecture is alpha d is yeah, the conjecture is that alpha d is equal to one, yes. Conjecture is that alpha d is equal to one. Yes, yes. Yeah. Other question? Yeah. Yeah. About this Thompson problem. So I know that it's over, but with other powers, is it stolen from some powers? I don't think any other powers are better. No, I think so you can see that if I go back to that slide. Well, if the next. Well, if the next slide. So, for example, for the log, the same things are known. Well, if you're on S2, for power minus one, which corresponds to the sum of distances, the same things are known. And this essentially, this is so-called universal optimality because certain configurations are optimal for all. All for all absolutely monotone kernels, let's say, or completely monotone, depending on how you write them. And that's why those configurations, they would work for pretty much any kernel like this. But at the same time, we don't know any others. So we don't know, I don't think any configurations that are known for some powers S, but not for R. Some powers S, but not for others. Uh I I don't I don't I don't think for some sequence of n is going to include well you know that they're good that these results of course asymptotic results exist so you know that they will be uniform uh that this will be uniformly distributed and even uh you know things about the second term so you know the first term will uh will be like the energy of the of sigma if you're in the even non-hypersingular case and Non-hypersingular case. And the second term is known, and there are conjectures about the next terms. And in particular, in terms of the logarithmic energy, this is a very popular topic right now. There is a lot of work on the next order term in the optimal logarithmic energy. All right, so asymptotic results are known, but in terms of specific configurations for low values of n, very little is known. A little bit more is known if you talk about. Bit more is known if you talk about the packing. So, if you take s, if s is infinity, so when s is infinity, this becomes the best packing problem, right? This essentially becomes the l infinity norm. So, you maximize the minimal distance, right? And in that case, more is known. In particular, I think in any dimension, it's optimal packing on the sphere is known between D and for all n between d and 2d. 2D and some others are, I think, known in some specific cases, but it's a little bit easier to examine. Further questions? Maybe also from the Zoom community? Yeah, I have a question. Hi, Laura. Hi, hi, Dima. Nice talk. Thank you so much. Yeah, I have a question about the Welsh inequality for frames. Frames, which I was not aware. So, you said something. So, you said that it is sharp, right? It is known that the bound is sharp. And yes, I was aware of the sharp bound for k equals one. Of course, this is the frame potential. I was wondering if the minimum of this sum is attained for frame for tight frames also when k is not. Also, when k is not equal to one? It's actually a little bit more complicated. So, for example, when k is equal to two, so basically, well, you would need complex designs because essentially what would happen here is that this lower bound is actually the energy of the uniform measure in the complex projective space. Complex projective space. So, in a sense, this inequality is the same as this inequality, only in the complex case. And so, you would need complex projective designs. And the case k is equal to 2 is actually very interesting. Those are the so-called maximal equiangular tide frames. And in particular, for k is equal to 2, so for power 4 here, this energy is closely connected to this problem about. Connected to this problem about there's this long thick pollen, well, which are actually the maximal equi-angular tide frames. So there's a big conjecture known as Zauner's conjecture when those objects exist. The conjecture is that in the complex case, they exist for all dimensions. So basically, the conjecture says that in all dimensions D in the complex case, you can choose D unit. Case, you can choose D squared unit vectors so that the angles between them are all equal. Well, absolute values of inner products are all equal. Right. So, and this for d equal to four, for power equal to four, sorry, this is related to Zauner's conjecture, because if such objects exist, they would be minimizers of this energy. But more generally, of course, projective designs. Of course, projective designs would be minimizers. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, I think we should. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I really apologize. Coffee break is something serious which we should not yes, absolutely. So we will start again at 11 with the talk by Ligor Konso. Yeah. Until then, there is a break. Until then, there is a break. Thank you. And thanks, Dima.
