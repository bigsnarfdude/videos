So, yesterday I talked about, yeah, I wrote this plan, which consists of three sections, and yesterday I talked about cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras. And today, I would like to start from a short section about singularity categories of mainly of commutative things. So we are mostly to cover denote by R the commutative ring and for some to avoid some technical difficulty I will assume it is local commutative so RM is a commutative let's say orange yeah Natalian I don't know I don't know what I said. Nutarian, local ring. Yes. And yeah, I'll start from the fundamental definition. Let's say our module, a finitely generated R module is a coin macaulay. Also, it says the maximal coem if some numerical invariance coincide, namely the depth of M equals the current dimension of R. Okay. And I will denote by CMR, the category of maximal column-Colin modulus over R. Yeah, it is a two extension flows subcategory of mode R. And so it is a nice exact category. And I don't want to explain what depth is, but to explain it, I would like to make a comment on why we consider this category of colour modules. Of code modules. Okay, so maybe question. And yeah, my answer, yeah, possible answer would be true. There might be several possible answers, but today my answer would be because it has a nice duality. So, yeah, for example. So, yeah, for example, in finite dimensional algebra case, we have the standard duality over the base field, which gives between the left module and right modules. And this is possible because we are in the finite dimensional setting, and there's no way to hope for such thing in an infinite dimensional case. thing in the infinite dimensional case. But in the yeah, but we if we district the Kohn-Makole case, we have something analogous to this, namely the canonical dual. Yeah, then we get the yeah, but then duality. And yeah, this is yeah, where this yeah, for example. Yeah, where this, for example, if you know low cordiality, this condition implies that this, yeah, the direct canonicality sticks to this category. Okay, so this is one explanation of Kohen-McCole modules. Okay. Yes, so yes. So do you assume Gohanstan is? Let's say. Let's see. Uh, okay, maybe our is coin macode. Okay, yes, let's see. Ah, yes, yes. Yes, yes. Okay, so yeah, maybe I should. Yeah, this is this will be the category we will be interested in, but let me give some more basic facts on commutative rings. So there are some well known hierarchy of local rings, and I will pick three of them in the That's so got Legira and Borenstein and Goen McCole. So regular means that R has a finite global dimension, or more precisely, the global dimension is equal to the crude dimension of R and only. Of R and Orenstein means that it's defined as the injective dimension of the free module viewed as a module over itself coincides with the dimension. And yeah, coin McCollum means that R itself is Kohn McColl as an Royal. But yeah, I don't want to write this. And the hierarchy is that regular implies Korean style and Korean. Regular implies Goldenstein and Gorenstein implies Weim Gold. And representation theoretically. This regular means that this category of Kohen-Makore module we are interested in is somehow trivial, namely, they are only projective modules in this category. And yeah, this Korenstein test is this category CMR is a flovinius category. So for yeah, in the finite dimension algebra case, this regularity This regularity corresponds to semi-simple in the sense that the module category is just every module is projective. And this Gorenstein corresponds to self-injective in the sense that the projectives and injectives coincide. And injectives coincide. And the coin McCore corresponds to arbitrary rings. Yeah. So this is the hierarchy of commutative rings, and we'll mostly be interested in Golenstein case. Yeah, commutative Golenstein case. Okay. Yes, you're not just requiring the index dimension is finite, but also that it's as small as possible. Ah, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, because we are distributing the commutative case, yeah, yeah. Yeah, thank you for the remark. Okay, so I should give. So, I should give examples of what kind of foreign timings we'll be interested in. And yeah, so for simplicity, let k be a field of characteristic zero. And first of all, for regular case. For regular case, yes, we have that the power series wing is regular. Yeah, and as dimension equals the number of variables. Yes, and somehow this should be like this, but yeah, anyway. And for yeah, let's look at another example. Well, let's consider the finite subgroup of GLS. Finite subgroup of G L N A. And we can look at, and this acts on this power series wing by a change of variable, by the linear action on its variables. Then we can we often look at its invariant subring. Then it is in this invariance of link, yes, we can ask when it is going to die. Then If it's Korean style, then uh yeah, and this is the case when uh G is a finite subgroup of S L and A. And in particular, from this third Gorenstein example, we get one of the most fundamental examples of commutative Gorensteinings, namely the simple singularities. So, yeah. So, yeah, in particular in dimension two. So, we consider the finite subgroup of SL2 C. So, yeah. So, this is classified by the ADE Linking diagram. And we can consider the, yeah, we consider the invariance of link. Variants of link, which is the invariant link of the power series in two variables. And this has the explicit description as the hyper surface singularity described in the following way in the Is these equations this one for AN and several things for E6, E7, E8, which I do not remember except for E8. Yeah, this is. Yeah, so this is the yeah, most fundamental example in for commutative things. Now we are and now we would like to define what singularity categories are. Yes. So it is not a good idea to define singularity categories only for commutative links. So here I would define it for any mutarian links. So let lambda be the anatary ending, then it's a singularity category is defined as the Velde quotient of the bounded derived category of lambda by the perfect derived category only the bounded part of the category of projectives. Category of projectives and today I will denote it by Sg of lambda. Okay, so our first remark is that the singularity category vanishes if and only if these categories coincide. Which is the case that precisely when lambda has finite global Lambda has finite global dimension. And yeah, this is thought to be lambda being regular or smooth or I don't know, but not let's say non-singular. And yeah, and in this sense, this category lambda measures how singular lambda is, and that's why it is called the singularity category. Category. It's not exactly true. I mean, there are rings of infinite global dimension, but data examples, you know, even commutative rings. Yes, yes. So, yeah, yeah. Okay. Thank you. More than that, one often finds it in the literature. So it makes sense to your right. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah. For example, local is in commutative local is in or yeah, finitely generated over a figure or yeah. Okay, so similar local is better because then it includes final dimension algebra. Finally, very much more ideas. Okay, so the first result I should mention is the one due to bookbytes. And yeah, so it all the commutative current styling. I don't know, but yeah, let's see. Yeah, let's put this for safety. Then, yeah, we had this category of OMACOLE modules, which I said to be a for Venus category. So we can consider it stable category to get a triangulated category. Triangulated category. And on the other hand, we have the triangulated category, another triangulated category as the singularity category. And in fact, they are triangle equivalent. So, in this sense, this classical Koen Magore representations and these triangle-related categories. Triangle-related categorical construction coincides by this theorem. Yeah. Okay, this is the end of some reminder about commutative things. And I would like to discuss some common structure which arises in the in the yeah, both in this uh commutative algebra and finite dimensional algebras. Finite dimensional algebras. So I would like to recall what I did yesterday. So we are given a finite dimension algebra A, and we constructed some so-called B cluster category of A. Of A. Which was a declavial triangulated category endowed with a decluster verticing object. Yeah, so this was the important point. And what I like to discuss in this section is that we can also get these kinds of categories from the commutative side. Yeah. Okay. So first of all, we want to have some collaborative triangulated category, and this is indeed always the case for by the classical result by Australian lighting duality. So let our let's see, just local commutative. Commutative Gorenstein local ring and suppose that R is an isolated singularity in the sense that any localization at non-maximal ideas. Localization at non-maximal ideal is a regular. Then this singularity category is dimension minus one kilobya. As a triangulated category, and yeah, so this is the classical result, and we can somehow drop isolated singularity using enhancements, but yeah, I will not talk about this today. Okay, so the next uh property that the Property that the cluster category had was it is endowed with a decluster during object. And I would like to introduce the corresponding notion for commutative rings. The definition due to some Yama and micro rings. So let R be yeah, yeah, just one colour ring, but yeah, let just the Gorenstein. The Gorenstein link, commutative Korenstein. And we say that module M, Koen Makore module M is a CT module, which stands for cluster tilting. If it satisfies the Holland condition, namely the additive closure of M coincides with the category. Sites with the category formed by objects in Kohen Macaulay module X, such that the omp from M to X is a quant Macaulay as an R module. And this is equivalent to the condition which with X and M interchanged, I think. So, one remark is that, yeah, so this looks somehow quite similar to cluster uthing setting, but and in indeed, if R is an isolated singularity, then this homespace thing one Macaulay Is equivalent to the usual X vanishing condition. So X one from dimension minus two, I think. So uh this uh In this case, CT module is exactly the cluster tilting of the correct dimension. Dimension minus one cluster tilting. Second one in particular. One can notice that in dimension three, it corresponds to a two-cluster torture object. And yes, by this Auslan direct and duality, it corresponds to two columnial setting. Sorry, dimension in dimension three. Yeah. And yeah. And yeah, this is. And yeah, this is yeah, yeah. And this is the setting where, yeah, the categorification of cluster algebra is important. And yeah, also in dimension three, this very active subject in birational geometry. And this coincidence is one of the reasons we can. Yeah, there are many good things can happen to me. Good things can happen immediately. Yeah, okay. And another remark is mainly for experts is that, yeah, if you know non-commutative prevent resolutions, this is somehow special case of NCCR. So CQ module is exactly the non-commutative graphant resolution given by Cohen or Core modules. By calling a core body, yes. Yeah, I would just write like this. Yeah. Um, okay, so yeah. So yeah, so I hope that I have said enough about that this cluster the thing like object in Calabia triangulated category is one of the biggest common structure in commutative algebra and finite dimensional algebra. So I would like to explain some results which there are in fact equivalences between yeah The cluster category and finite dimensional cluster categories and singularity categories. So, in fact, there are many equivalences between across the categories. Categories in your ID categories I would like to saying somehow four types of equivalences, which somehow in different Which somehow differ in flavor. So the first one is the most fundamental one, which somehow follows from the work of Alexander and I stated explicitly in Amir Yama writing. So this is the most fundamental one. So from the commutative side, if we take as a two-dimensional We take as a two-dimensional simple singularity. So for in type A3, it is like the polar series ring divided by x to the 4 and y to the square and d to the square. And yeah, so let q the dimension quaver. Of the corresponding type. So in type A3, it was wrong. Yeah, maybe I don't have to write this, but yeah. And for the singularity category, we know that the AR requiver of the singularity category is obtained from the Is obtained from the Machia equivalent of the corresponding finite subgroup. And it consists of three vertices and double arrows like this. And from the quiver side, we take the one cluster category of KQ, which was the orbit category of KQ by the Hauslander eigenstruct. Q by the Oslander Lichen translation. So it also looks like, yeah, this, the Oslander lighting waiver volted by, yeah, this. And yeah, we can see that they are in fact same. And actually, these are actually equivalent as triangulated categories. Yeah. And this is the most. And this is the most fundamental result in this direction. Right, so the house lines are not basically muffin known as Hades. Basically, must be known as those out of the categories, like the AIL computing strangling structure. Um, maybe I should say so, yeah. Okay, so this is a most uh yeah, easiest case, and it is, yeah, somehow natural to try to extend this. Try to extend these types of equivalences to quite general singularity and quite general cluster categories of finite dimensional algebras. And we can indeed do this by, yeah, and yeah, we do have a method to construct such an equivalence with the joint work isosamiyama. And so we start from And so we start from a graded thing and positively graded commutative Orenstein isolated singularity of dimension, let's say d plus one. And of simplicity, I assume that. And for simplicity, I assume that our degree zero part is a field. And suppose and and yeah, and yeah, I should say that and I assume that uh is the um the Gorenstein parameter of The Gorencht time parameter of which not by P is non-zero. So I don't want to write the definition of this cornerstone parameter, but it is an invariant of a graded ring, which somehow measures how fine the gradings are. Yes, so and we assume that it is non-zero. Yeah. Yeah. And we suppose that there is an equivalence between the graded singularity category and the bounded draft category of a finite dimensional algebra A. Yes. Okay then. Then we can construct from this equivalence an ungraded version of this equivalence with the right-hand side replaced by something like the cluster category. So CDA, and I will write it as not exactly the, it is not exactly the cluster category, but Which color I have? Right, I will denote it by one over e. It doesn't look quite different. Ah, it's yellow. So what it is that it is the, well, so it is the triangulated tau of the orbit category whose, yeah, and normally it. Yeah, normally it is the cluster category is orbit category by the shifted cell functor, but here I take the pth root of the shifted cell functor. Yes. Yeah. So if it's something yeah whose pth power is the shifted cell functor and so it is somehow like the z mod p quotient of the cluster category and yeah Category, and yeah, so anyway, we can get balance between the singularity category and somehow cluster-like category. And this is the statement of the So I should give one example. And yeah, so we have the assumption that we should have an equivalence between gradient thing and the derived category. And this is somehow relative, yeah, at least compared to building an equivalence like this, it is relatively. It is relatively easy, and well, yeah, there are many types of this result, and I would like to explain one of it. So, example: let R be a quotient similarity. Let's see. I want the dimension to be. I want the dimension to be d plus one. So yeah, I take the finite quotient singularity of in dimension d plus one, which is an isolated singularity. And I put the grading to be everything to be one. Then r is a Then R is a graded Gorenstein ring of Gorenstein parameter D plus 1, yeah, in this case. And then there's a known result by Yamatakahashi that the graded similarity category is Singularity category is indeed equivalent to some derived category of finite dimensional algebra. And using that theorem, we can deduce a equivalence between the ungraded thing with a cluster type category. And we saw next type, so it's it will be the third type of result. So it's the first one, it's the second one. So it'll be the third type of results with the correct and young, which is somehow more general or quite general setting. So let R be a commutative Orenstein isolated singularity and of the And of dimension b plus one and suppose there is a there is a cluster tilting object of the correct dimension, so D cluster tilting object n. So yeah. So it and let gamma be the endomorphism ring of M and take the idempotent of it corresponding to the projective module. So, yeah, the cluster tilting object automatically contains. The tilting object automatically contains the projective module, so yeah, we can do it like this and let and define a DG algebra by the DG quotient of gamma by this idempotent E. And then the statement is that first pi is a d plus one collabial dg algebra, which makes sense to define the cluster category. Yeah. Namely, there's no positive cohomology and H05 being finite dimensional. Then we can construct its cluster category, CPY, and this is in fact equivalent to the singularity category of R. So, in this way, we can realize the singularity category with cluster tilting object as a general cluster category of R. And this is somehow more conceptually summarized in the diagram in the following diagram. So we have, yeah, as the construction of the cluster category, we have the Laudier quotient from the perfect derived category to the cluster category. Yes. And which is given by the quotient by the finite dimensional derived category. And yeah. Yeah, because this is obtained as a quotient in the DG sense of this endomorphism ring of the cluster Telting object, we have also a V quotient functor from the derived category of the to its perfect derived category. To its perfect derived category. And it also localizes into the bounded derived category of modules over R by inserting N. And yeah, it also contains the perfect derived category of R as a full subcategory, and this localizes into the singularity. This localizes into the singularity category, and the statement is that these are equivalent. So yeah, some text example was one before the other. Differs from Glavia? Yes, yes. Gamma and Pi are both deeper than Glavia. And yeah, like in the case of usual modules, we have the kernel is isomorphic to this one. And yeah, I think there is some similar geometric picture of this diagram, but Picture of this diagram, but yeah, yeah, this is the algebra-like version of this. So, okay, I'd like to talk about the final types of building such equivalences. So, namely the recognition theorems, yeah. So, yeah, this is somehow a Morita-Feib theorem for collabial triangulated categories. So, the first result is due to error on lighting. So, given a regular calabria triangulated category, and suppose there is a Here is a two-cluster built-off object such that its endomorphism ring is hereditary. Yeah, awesome. Finite. It's a quick reverse. Okay. And then this triangulated category is. Category is equivalent to the two-cluster category of the yeah, this quaver. And this is quite strong in the sense that this is a just a general triangulated category, which is not even assumed to be some singularity category of commutative rings or like that. And mere the existence of cluster tilting object with some special hereditary, a special endomorphism ring input complete. Endomorphism ring input that completely determines the structure of this category. And this is the first recognition theorem. And there's some generalization between myself, and which is somehow decalabial version of it. So let's see the algebraic decalabial triangulated category. And suppose there is a And suppose there is a D plus the tilting object such that it's endomorphism ring of not of T itself, but we have to shift a lot up to D minus two. And I assume that it is hereditary and also non-linking. So, if t equals to this is just the endomorphism itself, then So then the statement is that it is the d plus the category of this quiver and but modeled by b minus pass order d minus one automorphism of this category. Yeah. Yeah, so this is a statement and yeah this is So in the remaining minutes, I would like to uh describe some some of my recent results, which My recent result, which can be seen in many ways. But for example, yeah, for example, applying this theorem, giving an example of this, example of commutative rings, this can be applied or more simply can be seen as a construction of non-commutative crepant resolutions. Yeah. So, okay. Okay, um yeah, okay, so I would like to start with some example, yeah, some yeah, uh basic definition. So let A and B be two Z graded rings. And their segre product is a graded ring of whose degree i part is the tensor product of the degree i parts of the each of these algebras. And I already know that one is shop of b and this is the coordinate ring of the cell. This is the coordinate ring of the segular embedding of these varieties. And I will like to quickly write the theorem. So let's consider two commutative rings, which is positively graded, positively graded. Commutative Gorenstein normal domains with the same Polandstein parameter. which I know by Q. And yeah, this having the same Golenstein parameter ensures that the segregate product is again Golenstein. And we suppose that over each R1 and R2, there is a graded COM module which gives a cluster tilting module. Module such that its endomorphism ring is so this is the ungraded endomorphism ring of a graded module. So it is has a natural grading, and I assume that it is positively graded. And then the conclusion is that we take the segregate product of some shifts of M1 and M2 and adapt up to 0 to P minus 1. Then it is a Kohen-Macaulay module over our segregate product. And it is actually indeed a a C G module over it. So yeah, in this way we can reproduce these cluster dieting objects or in other words in CCRs or things like that. And as an immediate consequence, we have this. Consequence. We have this some trivial example where these CT existence of CT modules are satisfied, namely these RL are just polynomial rings. So we can deduce the existence of a CT module over segregate products of polynomial rings. So let Si be a polynomial ring, like zero i1. I one I zero x i to d i be a polynomial ring with degree of x i j to be a i j which is assumed to be positive and suppose that we need this Coren's time parameter to be the same so this Be the same. So, is in the polynomial in case the Borenstein parameter is the degree of the sum of the determinants. So, Aij sum up to J equals zero to di is is common for all I then. Then the segreg product of this have a in CCR. So let's assume that we have a M of it. But that's all that. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I should. Yeah, thank you very much. Yeah, thank you very much. Any questions or comments? In this last theorem, you need to agree different M1 and M2, what does M2? But only on one. Yes, yes. And so if you did it on M2, you'd get a different answer, and it would be another. Yes, we can give a different cluster tilting object. Cool. Any other questions or comments? Sorry, just a technical question. What happens in the thinking case? I hope, yeah, the same holds, but yeah, I just don't have a proof. And in the dinking case, we know that we can show that T has finitely many decomposables. And yeah, at least we can understand the structure of its category. Can I just ask a very quick question? Can you give us some sort of intuition for what these segregates kind of are? Like, you know, they're abstract things, right? So, in terms of what do you actually get out? Like, what sort of geometric objects do you get out? Well, I don't know if I'm correct, but for the most fundamental case, it's the secret product of Of polynomial rings in pure variables, which are three-dimensional A1 single AT. And so, yeah, in fact, we have these two kinds of objects, which is directly going to resolution. Great. If there's no other questions or comments, Les, thanks to speaker again. Thank you. And we resume at three o'clock. Good.
