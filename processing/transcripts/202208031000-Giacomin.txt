Professor Jacobin from Quince University, and he's going to be talking about recent advances in polymer viscoelasticity from general rigid B-drought theory. Okay, so I want to begin by thanking the people at Veris for this great honor to be invited here today and to express my regret for not being able to be in Mexico. Express my regret for not being able to be in Mexico in person. Can everybody hear me clearly? Can you all hear me? Can anybody hear me? How about Andy? Andy, can you hear me? I just want to make sure people can hear me. Yeah. Oh, good. Okay. Okay, good. So the story I'm going to tell today is about Today is about a new way of looking at viscoelasticity in polymers. And the worked examples for this lecture were developed during my sabbatical leave in Reno in collaboration with James Hanna at the University of Nevada at Reno. Now, why would I do a sabbatical at Reno? Well, James Hanna would be the first reason, but the second reason is my grandson. You see, my grandson lives in Reno. Oh, I need to learn to advance the slides here. Learn to advance the slides here. Not working today, I just need to click. Okay, good. Now, the year 2020 in Reno was an unusual year. The lights went out in the city of Reno because of the pandemic, and there were stories about this hotel room here, which that particular hotel room, that light never went out, and there were stories about it in the paper every day. So, every once in a while, we'll take a break from the dry lecture and talk about the university campus, which was silent. University campus, which was silent and vacant. My wife and I were living on it, but there was hardly anybody else there for the sabbatical evening. And I've gathered my photos of that vacant campus into various colors, and I've started with the blue series for you. Now, if you go to the history of explaining viscoelasticity in polymers, it didn't start. Polymers. It didn't start out as it looks today, where we attribute viscoelasticity to entanglements. No, it turns out you can explain most of the stuff that we observe in the lab, both in the 1950s and since another way. And it's a way that Kirkwood came up with. And his idea is: what matters is the orientation of the polymer, not its entanglement, but its ability to orient and its ability to. Orient and its ability to orient is confirmed by the fact that it is longer than it is wide. And he considered the rigid dumbbell to be the simplest version of that. Now, most people think, well, we need to put a spring in here, but it turns out things get much worse if you put a spring in here. He managed to explain quality, at least qualitatively, all of the observations that we make in the lab for polymers just based on their orientation, although the mathematics is complicated. Complicated. All of his life's works were gathered in a book called Macromolecules and Reformatted, and so we normally cite to this book instead of to his contributions to the literature. And then Professor Bird in the 1970s created a course based largely on ideas like this, and he called it macromolecular hydrodynamics. When I was at Wisconsin, I taught that course. And this is the original set of course notes for that, which became the dynamics of polymeric liquids, the two-volume set, which was The two-volume set, which was published in 77. I draw your attention to Ola Hasiger, who took these ideas far further than Kirkwood's. Instead of confining himself to the simplest structure about which hundreds of papers have been written, the rigid dumbbell, he allowed that rigid structure to change. And in so doing, he developed a theory where you can design the macromolecule from by. From by replacing it with a bead rod structure. And the textbook treatments, chapter 13 in the first Egypt edition, chapter 16 in the second edition. If you come to the end of that chapter, you come to this fascinating bit of theory, which I never managed to master. Even when I took the course with Bird and Di Pablo at Wisconsin, when I took that course myself as a professor, I never managed to master the end of chapter 16. Master the end of chapter 16. Indeed, it was my graduate student, Mona Tanso, and her courage that took us through my problems with Chapter 16, and I've got that figured out. Thanks to her. She prepared these slides for us, by the way. So, this is all about a scale above the atomic scale where we replace the macromolecule with the beadrod structure, you sculpt it, as you will. Structure, you sculpt it, as you will, as an artist would to contain the key features of the molecule at atomic at the lower atomic scale. And when you do that, all assemblages of masses, including macromolecules, have moments of inertia. And if you find the principal moments, then you can classify them either as prolate objects, oblate objects, or asymmetric objects, the ones in between. I say asymmetric object. In between, I say asymmetric because there's no circular cross-section to this thing rotating in the middle. Our theory is not about the thing in the middle, it's for macromolecules that are either prolate or oblate. Yeah, so for example, we can do branch structures like the red one here, but we can't do branch structures like the blue one. The blue one's an asymmetric structure. I1 is not equal to I2. And of course, And of course, each bead has a mass, and the sum of all their masses should be equal to the molecular weight of the macromolecule. And each bead has a diameter, and we apply a Stokes flow resistance to each bead. And that's how this theory works. I'm not going to go into the calculation of the orientation distribution function. We're going to go straight to the complex viscosity when we get there. But here's a really important thing that Mona noticed, and it's why. That Mona noticed, and it's why I couldn't master the end of chapter 16, or why I think this theory never went very far in the 70s. It's because you need to standardize your definition of L. So in the textbook treatments, you'll see they gather the literature together and they have a separate column in the tables, meaning of L. But if you change the meaning of L, then you cannot add branches to a structure, for instance, and compare the two structures. So Monas settled. Mona's settled on the shortest distance between any two beads of the macromolecule, macromolecular structure. And if you call that L, you really do have a theory where you can design macromolecules from scratch and compare them. Let's look at this, for instance. If you have a four-bead ring, that's a square, and L is the distance between those two beads. But if you add a bead in the middle, it changes. And that's what I mean by a universal definition. What I mean by a universal definition of L, and now I want to gather together my pink flowers. You see, that campus was silent and empty, and I would gather pictures as I walked around the campus every evening. Now, let's go to the method. The method's a little hard to understand. So if you have students that you would like to teach this to, you might want to go to a chapter Mona published just last week. Mona published just last week in a new book that AIP Publishing publishes. And this book is written, shall we say, for the graduate students. So the parts of chapter 16 that we found hard to understand are made understandable in this chapter, we hope. And that's the new book. Now, let's see how the method works. Well, you have some set of masses. Well, you have some set of masses that you've sculpted. You need to find the center of mass and subtract that first, and then calculate. Oh, then you then need to find the principal moments I1, I2, and I3 for a symmetric structure. I3 is just this. And then the theory for the complex viscosity comes out as follows. There are variables, we call them the orientation constants a, b, and nu, and then the relaxation function just depends on a, b, and nu. You can see. On A, B, and nu, you can see A contributing to the direct delta function component and B and lambda to the vanishing exponential. When you do this, you classify all macromolecules in terms of their lopsidedness. Here's a spherically symmetric structure that'll give you a constant viscosity, and eta double prime will be zero. Other extreme is the one Kirkwood envisaged. Everything in between is what our friend Hasiger imagined. Hasseger imagined. And so it's this quantity 2b over aν that decides how lopsided the macromolecule is. And in turn, that decides the shapes of the parts of the complex viscosity curves. Of course, all such structures will have a relaxation time, and then every bead in there has a bead friction coefficient. And therefore, there's always a characteristic relaxation time, the one you would associate between the two nearest beads of the macro. Between the two nearest beads of the macromolecule. And then what you learn is the relaxation time is just a function of that orientation constant ν, which brings us to the red flowers and berries on the UNR campus. I said we're just focusing on oscillatory shear flow. That's for two reasons. One, it's the love of my life. But secondly, for this theory, we haven't taken it any further yet. We don't have the equations for the steady shear viscosity. The equations for the steady shear viscosity or for large amplitude oscillatory shear flow, we're working on those now. But for the complex viscosity, of course, we're just working on the bottom side of the Pipkin diagram here, where the Weisenberg number is small and the Deborah number can be whatever you wish. And then from that relaxation function, of course, we can calculate the stress response in oscillatory shear flow and the coefficients eta prime and eta double prime. prime this coefficient here oh eta double prime is the polymer contribution of course to to the stresses in the suspension now you see what i mean like when you do a little work here on the equations you can see eta prime and eta double prime just depend on the macromolecular lopsidedness now here's mona tanso as i said she's the one that prepared the slides and the worked examples for this lecture This lecture are the ones that James and I cooked up in the hallways of the pandem of UNR during the pandemic and specifically before our building closed and locked. And so the reason we got interested in this, of course, is because anything with a relaxation time also has a rotational diffusivity, one over six lambda, and so we could. We could see that the rotational diffusivities of viruses matter. And this is what governs whether or not they will dock in front of the targets on our cells. And that first step is important for attachment and then later for infection. Now, we didn't know how to handle the coronavirus when we started. So we said, well, we proceeded with courage there. You know, we said, Mona, you'll figure that out eventually. Let's start with the tobacco mosaic virus. Start with the tobacco mosaic virus and see if this works at all for simpler viruses. And so, indeed, we calculated the rotational diffusivity using a shish kebab-type structure. And then, indeed, we knew there was data for that virus, plenty of it. And so we found good agreement with the data, and that was encouraging. We then went to, oh, and then of course there were measurements of the rotational diffusivity as well and our estimates of those from. Our estimates of those from our theory agreed with the measured values. I bought a new car during the pandemic. New car has an operating system, and you know, in those days, you couldn't do anything else except go out alone in your car. So here I am, you know, at night editing my journal on the operating system of the new car, which has its own operating system. Now, we got interested in this virus because in the old days, like when I was In the old days, like when I was younger, that was considered nature's rigid dumbbell. But the microscopy since improved, and the Gemini virus is now understood to be this way. It is a bead structure, a set of osculated beads. So we thought we would do it both ways, the old way and the new way. And we found that the details, of course, matter. And so that was important going forward. So that was important going forward. That's what we learned from the Gemini virus. Cactuses interest me because we don't really have them in Canada. We have them in Wisconsin. Bob Bird once brought me to Cactus Bluff and the cactuses in Nevada flower spectacularly and that happened on the quiet campus too. Now here's another virus. You see, we're getting closer to the coronavirus. This one has spikes on it. So we thought, well, let's look at that. This is the common cold. It's also used. And cold. It's also used in our flu shots, for instance, to carry the goodies into us each year and so on. So it has spikes, but as a very regular structure, and this is where the services of a professional geometer such as James Hanna come in, physical geometer, he could write down the positions of those beads. And once he did so, then Mona could proceed with her calculation of the diffusivity. The diffusivity and her estimates of the relaxation time of the system. And this encouraged us even further, which brings me to the yellows. That was quite a year for color, quiet color on the campus. All you could hear, for instance, is sometimes in the background the noise of an air conditioner. I want you to look at Mona's movie here. This is the spike on a coronavirus. And if you look at it from Coronavirus. And if you look at it from top view, you can see it's hollow. Now you can see her manipulating it. Look at it from the side, you can see it's equidimensional. It's about as wide as it is long. That kind of surprised us. And you can also see that it's triangular because it's a trimer. It's an assembly of three proteins here. Each one is colored, so you can see the threeness here. So we replaced that whole thing with. So we replaced that whole thing with one bead, and I'll tell you about that today. But we eventually wrote a second paper, and the second paper replaced it with three beads. Here are some of James's handwritten stuff that I don't think he wants me to show you. Here's a picture of James himself, which I'm sure he doesn't want me to show you, but you can see the advantages of being at UNR. We're well beyond just being able to see my grandson from time to time, but we're But working with James was a privilege. Now, here's how we did it. With our theory, all the beads have to be the same size. So if you have a capsid, you need to bead the capsid, and that's what Mona did here. And then we're replacing all the we're replacing all of the spikes with single beads. Let's, oh, and then of course, these spikes are charged. The spikes are charged, so we needed to position them in some way. And so, here's how she did it: she said, Well, they're all charged identically, and they're embedded in a lipid membrane. They can move away from one another. And so, the solution to that problem is the solution to the Thompson problem, and it already existed. So, we took their positions as the solution for the Thompson problem. And then, from the literature, we estimated about 74 spikes. Spikes. And so you can see this polygon is well understood. And then Mona took all of those positions and calculated it. Now, the solutions for any other number of spikes, that's what she's got on the x-axis, are also known for the Thomson problem. And so this curve was a lot of work where she's doing it over and over again for different numbers of spikes. After all, when it infects you, it has 74, but it keeps. 74, but it keeps trying to latch on to your cells. And so, an infected patient, the averages can be as low as 20, for instance, as these things try and fail to infect us. In other words, we have a distribution of rotational diffusivities after infection. And there's a summary graph of our work. And there, of course, is the slight elasticity that. That comes from the structure of the coronavirus. If you're wondering about the size of these things, it's about half the size of an adenovirus, the coronavirus is, and of course, much larger than a tobacco mosaic virus or than a Gemini. Which brings us to green. Now, let me check my watch. Oh, plenty of time. So So, remember, I told you that that bulb, that structure that we looked at for the spike as a triangular bulb on the end of it. Remember, we looked at that. And so that really changes the physics when you introduce that in the following way. You see, we've modeled each spike as a triangle now. You see? And so that's a rigid structure. So So, when this repels the things around it, for instance, it also twists. And this was a new thing. You can't just use a pre-existing solution of the Thomson problem, but we collaborated with Freed and Chauresia at OIST. They're experts at doing calculations like this, and they gave us the positions of all the beads, and so they co-authored our next paper on this subject. And then you might ask, does that matter? And the answer is that it. matter and the answer is that it does. If you model them as triangles, now don't get me wrong, the qualitative behavior is the same, but as you can see, the dimensionless rotational diffusivity decreases with the number of spikes. But that triangularity matters. And the elasticity that you get from that. Get from that structure is a little bit lower, too. Now, if you happen to die of the virus, then the coroner might want to do a determination. And one of the steps that they do is to make sure that whatever you were infected with is not all the same. And that kind of surprised me because the pictures that you see, the idealizations of this virus are all the same. Are all the same, but the fact that this has different shapes that has a name, it's called pleomorphism. And if what you're infected with is not pleomorphic, you're not infected with the coronavirus. So here's a bunch of structures, and you can see some are indeed perfectly circular. Most are not. You can see the spikes, what they call the corona, right, of spikes around each one of these. Spikes around each one of these visible under the microscope. Then here's the thing: when you take a slice of something that is ellipsoidal, you can't tell if it's oblate or prolate. Of course, an oblate one will have a few cross sections that'll be circular, but the rest will be elliptical. So will a prolate one. So we still don't know, believe it or not, the physics of this virus. We still don't. The physics of this virus, we still don't know whether those are oblate, prolate, or a mixture of the two. We just know that they're not all spherical. If you think carefully about the geometry there, what you also know is we don't actually know if any of them are spherical. So Mona got busy on this problem, again, with our collaborators at OIST. We haven't done the triangular ones yet because that's a more complicated problem. We might eventually get to that, but you can see here she's doing a You can see here she's doing a prolate one. Oh, from the distribution of shapes, she knows how prolate they might be. Okay, that's the most prolate they might be, you see. Or how, oh, and of course, there's our spherical one. We like this rotation thing, not just because it's cool, but it helps us define the molecular coordinate delta three. That all of these are rotating about that molecular coordinate, which we have to install as part of the method. To install as part of the method. And here's a prolate one, more like a hamburger, if you will. And then she also determined which that's as prolate as it can get there. And then each time you do worked examples on this, you deepen your understanding of this fascinating method of Hasiger's here for molecular design. But one important curve here is. One important curve here is I3 versus I1. Where are you on this plot? And so this plot occurred to Mona here. As you're changing the shapes of the viruses, you're changing the positions on the I3 versus I1 plot. Remember, I1 is equal to I2 for spherically, sorry, for axisymmetric objects, such as the ones covered by our theory. And then here's the complex deposit. And then here's the complex, the parts of the complex viscosity, both the viscous part and the elastic part. And what we learned from this is that the more the less spherical the virus, the more elastic the liquid will be in suspension. And of course, the rotational diffusivities of the particles. Rotational diffusivities of the particles each here is labeled with the actual particle that she studied is a strong function of its shape. In other words, this thing, when it infects you, is very well equipped to hold itself somewhere, somehow, in front of a target for the right amount of time. And remember, to infect us, it needs two adjacent spikes to line up. The target is that way. It's not one thing, it's two things. It's not one thing, it's two things. So the targets themselves are not circular. They are rectangular, if you will. They're longer than they are wide. In other words, it's a complicated docking, if you will, if you think of it like a spacecraft trying to dock onto the space station. Haven't mentioned the zero shear viscosity, but that of course is also a function of the structure of the particle. I've just talked about shapes. I've just talked about shapes of viscosity curves and the relaxation time or the rotational diffusivity. When you look at this stuff under the microscope, there's something even more interesting. Pay attention to this when you see images of this stuff, but you almost never see, I should say, you'll never see an image that has just one free part, just free particles in it. They're almost always in. Particles in it. They're almost always in clusters. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of them that are not in clusters. But my point is, in these images, you also have clusters lurking there. And I find that image interesting because the physics are not well understood here. I mean, if the spikes are all identically charged, why would they interdigitate into clusters? And so that problem fascinates me now. Obviously, the simplest relevant problem is just going to be to Going to be two interdigitated spheres, and Mona is attacking that problem now, amongst her other things to do. She's working on two interdigitated spheres. But again, obviously by clustering together, they broaden the spectrum of rotational diffusivities that they need to use to do their damage. Now, let me introduce you to another. You to another unusual idea, I think. When we think of hydrodynamic interaction, at least the way I was trained, we think about macromolecules interacting with one another hydrodynamically. But in general rigid bead rod theory, and possibly more generally, that's less important than interaction within the macromolecule itself. And I say less important because the macromolecule. Important because the macromolecule is always closer to itself than it is to other macromolecules. And so, looking after one without the other doesn't make much sense to me. We're just looking after what happens within the macromolecule here. And what is this about? You remember I approximate the hydrodynamic drag on each bead with Stokes flow. But if the beads are too close together, then those two velocity fields, vector fields, Velocity fields, vector fields, will interact with one another and affect one another. And that's a concept that OCIN looked after. And of course, the interferences between two vector fields is described by a tensor field, and that field is called the OCIN tensor. Although there are other approaches that are covered in DPL for doing that too. And then my collaborators are collaborators. Then my collaborators, our collaborator PAC in Korea, tackled this daunting problem and discovered the most amazing thing. And that is that when you incorporate hydrodynamic interaction, your expressions for the complex viscosity mathematically have exactly the same shape. So only the lopsidedness changes, which causes the most amazing. Causes the most amazing conclusion here, and that is that macromolecular lopsidedness depends upon the hydrodynamic interaction. And now you see if we go to data, for instance, the discrepancies that we were seeing before with data can now be explained by just adding this one additional concept here. And for example, this problem. This problem here is resolved with hydrodynamic interaction. And I can tell you that colleague PAC in Korea is a remarkably bright person. I never thought I'd live to see the day where you could add hydrodynamic interaction to general rigid bead rod theory. And now we're having a lot of fun with it. And Mona is incorporating that into our studies of the coronavirus. The coronavirus. Year 2020 in Reno, very special for me because Graham, baby Graham, had a brother at the end of that year. And so that's baby Mason. And that brings me to the white flowers. Nearly at the end here. Yep. I think, Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time, right? You can finish, Jeff. That's actually. That's why I'm going to finish. I will just show you one last concept then here. So some of you may be aware that in industry, they have generalizations. If they make enough observations together, they'll say, oh, look, there's something we can use here, even though we don't understand it all that well. It's an empiricism. And they use it for measuring the amount of branching in polymers. So Mona decided to task. So, Mona decided to tackle this. By the way, most important paper ever published in the Rheology Bulletin is the Van Gerh-Palman paper. Now, they noticed that if you make a plot of delta, for again, we're sticking to complex viscosity here versus G star. You get a curve that doesn't depend on temperature, it doesn't depend on molecular weight, doesn't depend on many things other than the amount of break. Depend on many things other than the amount of branching. And so you can use the Van Gerh-Palbin method to measure the amount of branching. And Mona decided to see what General Rigid Biedrod theory had to say about this empiricism, and my group has tackled other empiricisms as well. In so doing, she looked at that quantity A nu came up, you see? And then she plotted this chart and she. And she could show that all axisymmetric macromolecules either lie on the blue branch or on the red branch. She wrote down the parametric equations for delta and for eta star, the things on the axes of that graph, you see, and then found that what mattered was the orientation constant b, and of course the dimensionless frequency lambda omega. Frequency Lambda Omega. And that's all that mattered. And then she actually went to Van Gerp and Palman's data and indeed explained it qualitatively, not quantitatively, but qualitatively. And then she looked at both kinds of branching. Prolate branching. Indeed, she was able to explain the amount of branching as a function of the quantity B, you see? And And oblate branching. And of course, she's using the structures, the actual branch structures that are drawn here. And I just wanted to finish with that last concept here, but we're able to explain some of the mysterious and useful empiricisms that are used in the polymer industry for measuring, for instance, the amount of branching. There's a completely different method. There's a completely different method called the coal-coal method that another student of mine, Stacey Coombs, has tackled and also explained that way. I'll finish with one other idea here, but there are things that do matter that you can't necessarily control in a commercial polymerization. But you can see here, if you change the branch position, leaving everything else the same, that matters. And so this is why these empiricisms. This is why these empiricisms are challenging to work with: is because although things like temperature and molecular weight don't matter, there are other things lurking under here that do matter. And for instance, the branch distribution, if that's not held constant, that will also matter, and so on. That's why these methods are so difficult, I think. I would call them imperfect, and every once in a while. Call them imperfect, and every once in a while they're difficult to work with. And I guess I wanted to finish with that idea, Mr. Chairman. So I think we're open for questions now. Let's thank Professor Jekomin for a very wonderful talk. I've learned a lot about coronavirus. We knew it before. So thank you. The floor is now open for questions and Now, open for questions and let's see if there is something on the chat. You can type your questions in the chat as well as you can unmute yourself or raise your hand on the on the Zoom. So well, liked your photo pictures a lot. Didn't realize that you're taking such really, really beautiful photographs. You should share your photographs of LSH. You should share your photographs of LSU campus too, Jeff. I never saw those. That is also a beautiful campus. I have fond memories of my visit to LSU. Okay. So let me start with this. These generalization of the rheologies, you keep it mostly for complex polymers also, or you are also looking into some of these sheared. Looking into some of these shear thinning and shear thickening type of fluids that are typically used in the field? So far, I've just looked at polymers, but Mona has an interest in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, and so she has begun to study other materials that are pasty and so on. Hasty and so on. But that's an interest of hers, and it's in its infancy just now. So question would have been then, how does that rate dependence, a strain rate dependence enter into your models? Do you have any suggestions on that? Well, first of all, you're getting way ahead of me there. Let me tell you what we still don't know about. We don't know about the shape. We don't know about the shape of a steady shear viscosity curve yet. Okay. And we're hard at work on that. So there's an equation. It's equation 18 in the Hasiger paper. I've been studying that equation, trying to expand it to the next term for years. And PAC is nearly there, I think within weeks even. I think within weeks, even of getting the next term in that expansion. When we get the next term in that expansion, we will have the steady shear viscosity curve, and we will also have expressions for large amplitude oscillatory shear flow behavior. So, what we have done is, you know, one of the things Professor Bird was famous for was bridging. Famous for was bridging between macromolecular and continuum theory. So we have, McMona has taken his method and followed that bridge to the corrotational Jeffries model and then followed through on its consequences. So we do know, for instance, if you follow that approximation, how Approximation: Hanching affects LAOS and so on. You can see I'm avoiding your question there. The very, the much more complex systems, we're not there yet. We're still attacking suspensions of polymers, but that includes stuff like viruses and so on. And so but we're not quite ready to. Ready to tackle a material with a yield stress, for instance. I think that'll be something that when Mona goes on to a faculty position, she'll want to initiate. Well, thank you, Jeff. Well, I can assure you that was because of my naivety about that field, not because I knew anything in depth about the business. In depth about the viscoelasticity. But let's thank Professor Jekomin about it. And let me announce that we have a short coffee break. But after the coffee break, there will be a stimulating panel discussion with our panelists, Professor Benevu, Professor Ni, and Professor Vinuusa. And online, we'll be joined by Professor Andy Woods. So these are going to be mostly questions about current state of the art perspectives. State of the art perspectives, current barriers for the technologies for the societal problems. And if you could stick around, Professor Jacomene, you brought in a very interesting problem, like this coronavirus problem, how you approached from a research perspective of modeling these polymers and their viscosity to connecting it to something which was highly relevant at that point of time. So if you could join in, that will be, we'll truly appreciate that. Be will truly appreciate that. And the questions are prepared by a couple of my colleagues when we were organizing this one. And so we will have some in-person participants, panelists, and then a few of the online participants. And we'll start the panel discussion at around 11 a.m. If you have time, is that okay? I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, I have a practical problem. I'm in a hotel room here, and I'm supposed to get kicked out at noon, but I'm just. Kicked out at noon, but I'm just going to stay here and hopefully I can participate. But if you see me, if you see me disappear, you'll know why. It's because the housekeeping has caught me, you know, overstaying my welcome here. So I'm sorry about that, but that's the best I could do for arranging to give this lecture. So anyways, I'm going to try and stay around for that. Okay. So we'll take a short break and we'll resume at 11. Okay. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
