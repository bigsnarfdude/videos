Yeah, she hasn't heard it. She's solitar, but I gotta say, I mean, no, I mean, there's only crazy point about it. Let me do that. All right, well, I am pleased to introduce Max, who's going to be speaking about the surgery. Is that right? Great, yeah. Thanks a lot. It's great to be here. And I also wanted to thank the organizers for making it possible to have at least a conference, which is part in person. It's really great getting to talk to everybody. That being said, since we're in person, we have the afternoon off. Since we're in person, we have the afternoon off. It's Wednesday, so hopefully we can try to finish a little bit early. But I'll try to at least beat the dreaded bell. Maybe we won't finish it really exactly, but I'll, you know, hopefully. So this talk is called Surgery, Exact Triangles, and Involved Floor Homology. And everything's joint work with Kristen Hendricks, Jen Hahm, and Ian Zemke. So, and the goal for the talk is really. And the goal for the talk is really just to explain what's in the title. So we'll just recall what involved fluoromology is and then make the statement of the surgery exact triangle by the end of the talk, and also a surgery formula for it. So yeah, the thesis statement is really that if you have a knot that you understand well enough in a suitable sense, then you really can compute the involveative floor homology of surgeries on it. And hopefully I'll try to convince you of that by the end of the talk. Where suitably understanding your not is doing a lot of work in that sentence. All right, so let's just recall the definition. Maybe not recall, but define it. So it's volume flowology. So this is defined by Hendriks and Manalescu back in 2015. Which comes from the following. So let's say we have a closed-oriented Y, as usual, three-manifold, and let's say it's equipped with a self-conjugate spin C structure S. And the involutive floor homology of this pair is just the ordinary Huguard floor homology of Y viewed as a chain complex. Complex and it inherits some action. So map from Cf minus Y back to itself. And to say what this is, we have to just recall how the Hygard floor homology of Y is defined. So if you actually want to calculate the Hygard floor homology of Y, you have to choose some Hagard splitting. Say we've got our sigma, alpha handlebody, beta handle body. But this is not a very good list. But this is not a very good blue. Well, maybe to give it a little bit more feel of being a beta thing. There we go. So we've got our alpha handle body and our beta handle body. And y has been cut along some surface so that it's being realized this way. And once you have the description of y as a Hagard splitting, once you've cut it up along sigma in the middle, then you can calculate from this data the Hagar chloromology. The Hagar floor homology to y. But, you know, there's an obvious, well, or not so obvious, depending on how one thinks about it, symmetry in this diagram, which is that you can just declare betas to be alphas and alphas to be betas. So you have your beta handle body, and you can just decide that you're going to call it an alpha handle body from now on. So you could just change the color on it. It used to be viewed as a alpha, or as a beta is now being viewed as an alpha. It still has the same name, but we're viewing it as. Use the same name, but we're viewing it as a different color. And this is a Higar splitting still describing the same manifold. But if you write it in terms of this data, you sort of interchange the data into alphas. But you can check that this operation of flipping everything over, it induces a map on Cf minus of the two sides. I haven't done a great job of giving myself enough space, but you can imagine Cf minus there. But you can imagine a CF minus there. So, you know, the floor homology that you would have calculated with respect to one Higuard splitting, you have a map to the floor homology that you would have calculated with respect to some other Hegard splitting, which is just turned upside down. But we also have access to naturality for Hagar chlorhomology, which says that no matter which Higar splitting you choose for your three-manifold, you're getting back the Hagar fluoromology of Y. So you So you asked Thurston and, I mean, it was known since the beginning by Ajwaf and Zabo that the homology of this output, its isomorphism class, is well defined. But you asked Thurston and Zemke show that there's actually, you can define some sort of abstract canonical Cf minus of Y, and for any particular Huguard splitting, you have a canonical homotopy equivalence from the floor homology computed with respect to that Huguard splitting back to that of Y. Back to that of y. And this homotopy equivalence is well defined up to one further homotopy. And similarly, this is a Higard splitting for the same thing. So you have a homotopy equivalence to Cf minus of Y again, again using their naturality math. So, you know, this is some kind of abstract morphism that's defined by doing possibly many Hygard moves and counting. Guard moves and counting polymorphic triangles and many steps along the way. But you know that eventually the composite is going to be some homotopy of ones. But now you can, instead of doing a map between two different floor complexes for different things, this composite going from Cf minus Y to C F minus Y is something that sends one chain complex back to itself. So if you sort of unfold this diagram and go from the left to the right, that's the iota defined by Henry. That's the iota defined by Hendrixmith and Manweskmore. So, yeah, this iota is defined over there. But iota is really only well defined up to homotopy, because these vertical arrows are really only well-defined up to homotopy. And the output that, or sort of the theorem that they prove about this, so theorem Hendrix and Analyze group, is that this is an invariant of the manifold. Invariant of the manifold y. It doesn't depend on the choice of Pagar diagram that you started off with to take the so-called conjugate. So this pair of a chain complex and an endomorphism of the chain complex is actually an invariant of your manifold. And usually this piece of information is packaged a little bit differently. So sometimes it might be phrased as HFI of Y. Y. So, this is the so-called involutive floor homology of Y. And you can write it as the mapping cone. So, this is the homology of the map 1 plus iota. So, HFI of y, it has a module action by f of join u just by c of minus having a module action by very C of minus having a module action by a variable u. And it also has this mysterious q action that takes you from the first factor in this mapping cone to the second factor. So this is module over f of join u q mod q squared. But usually it's often more convenient to think about this sort of underlying chain complex, although the two points of view are ultimately Two points of view are ultimately equivalent. And the other important fact about IOTA is that if you apply IOTA twice, that's sort of the same thing as saying that you took your alpha-beta handle bodies, interchanged their roles, and then interchanged the roles again, with the result that the composite shouldn't really be doing anything. And indeed, part of their theorem is that iota squared, so if you do it two times, it's homotopic to the identity map. And you don't know that it's exactly the identity because you've had to use these naturality maps as part of the definition. But in any event, this is the setup. But you can already see from the setup that it's going to be very hard to compute for the following reason. So, right, the ordinary floor homology of Y, it's no problem. You're just counting holomorphic disks. You do that all the time. But these vertical maps, you know. Maps, you know, they're constructed in many pieces. So the naturality maps are built by choosing a sequence of He-guard moves between two He-guard splittings for the same manifolds. So first you have to choose a sequence of moves to whatever other choice of Hegard splitting you have as your canonical one. And then for each of those moves, you have to compute some count of holomorphic triangles. So it's not just counting holomorphic disks anymore. It's not just counting holomorphic disks anymore. You have to count holomorphic triangles, and you may have to do many separate counts. So, calculating iota from the definition seems very difficult, and I don't know if I at least have never seen an example where it's done explicitly beyond like S3 or something. So, yeah, that's somewhat disturbing. Okay, so at least initially we might believe this is a very hard to calculate invariant. So now if we believe that, we should also ask what it's good for. If we believe that, we should also ask what it's good for. So, in principle, you know, one would hope that it's good for more than what I'm about to say, but more on that in a second. So, one application, and this is what was originally done by Hendricks and Manalescu, or at least one of the sort of original ideas, is that you can use involved Hebardo homology to study the homology of Bordesl group. So let's let theta 3z be the set of integer homology three-spheres. Integer homology three spheres where we identify any two of them if there's a four-manifold co-bounding them that has the homology of a cylinder. So this is the homology of the horizon group. And it happens to inherit a group structure. And like exactly like what Irvine was saying in the last talk, you know, you have this yoga of constructing. You know, you have this yoga of constructing local equivalence groups out of things. And Hendrickson Manalescu, and also Hendricks and Manelescu and Zeki. Yeah, I'm going to have to. People are only going to get three letters in their names after some point, probably. But they construct a homomorphism from the homology cohortism group to some abstract group whose elements are just chain complexes that look like they could come as the involved floor chain complex. Come as the involuntary floor chain complex of a three-manifold. So this is the local equivalence group of my other complexes. We'll just use the Argot iota complex for a chain complex that looks like it could be the Hygard floor chain complex of some. Floor chain complex of some manifold. And this map is just sending a three-manifold y to the so-called local equivalence class of its involved floor homology. So, I mean, IOTA is part of the information everywhere today. And I mean, this map wouldn't be very useful necessarily, except that we have sort of the first calculation result we'll mention today, which is really the second. The second calculation result proved overall. So, theorem, this is Hendrix Millsman is empty, which is that the involved floor homology of a connected sum, so i to y, is homotopy equivalent to the tensor product of the two pieces, where you just take the tensor product involution on the two pieces. The two pieces. So that at least tells us that in some situations, if you already know the invoid of Hegard core homology of 2,3 manifolds, then at least you can calculate the invoid core homology of their sum. And that shows that this is a homomorphism in particular. So there's some group structure on chain complexes making this thing into a map of abelian groups. And you can also soup it up to be a map of partially ordered abelian groups if you want to make things really complicated. If you want to make things really complicated. So, and this lets you prove all sorts of things about the homology cobordism group that you wouldn't be able to prove using just ordinary Hugar floor homology. So that's at least the principal application one has up to this point. And I should say that, you know, invoil of Hygard fluorhomology looks like it should be very powerful in the following sense. So the ordinary Hygard floor homology of a manifold. Ordinary Hygard floor homology of a manifold is just some module over f adjoin u, over f adjoin u. So it lives in some kind of module category over this not very complicated rim. And in particular, the category of f adjoin u modules is boring. Like we can classify all f adjoin u modules and they're not that interesting. And it's also easy to tell what the maps are between two f adjoin u modules. But when you have an But when you have an ephagoine U chain complex along with a homotopy involution, it's no longer possible to classify them or really say anything about the overall category of chain complexes with involution. Somehow the algebraic data that you get out of involutive fluorohomology lives in a much more complicated place than where ordinary Hegard fluorohomology lives. So that makes you think that involutive fluorohomology should be much more powerful. But the problem is that Hygar fluorhomology is already so powerful. The problem is that Hygard floor homology is already so powerful that there's very little you can ask for to make it better. At least. Depending on your point of view. So Hegard floor homology of a knot already detects the knot venous, and volunteered floor homology isn't going to give you some sort of better detection result than what you already have. So it's generally an interesting question to see, like, what more can you say using involved a fluorohomology that's not already accessible to EGR fluorhomology? To hear cornology. And you think it should be possible to do things like that exactly because it lives in a place that's so complicated. Yeah. Matt? Yeah, go for it. Yeah, I asked a question. So this is sort of embarrassing since I've been hanging around you guys for a long time. But how much of this is supposed to capture IT2, equivariant, cyberquen? Is this like halfway between? Between? Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. I mean, it's like halfway between ordinary and pin 2. I mean, it definitely is not supposed to capture everything. Like, one thing is it doesn't really remember coherently the Rockland invariant. So, pin2 floor homology, one of its best features is that you can read off the Rockland invariant from the PIN2 floor homology of a manifold. And that's like the principal thing that's missing from Envolute Floor. And is there conjecturally a pin to the version of ABA floor model gene? Yeah, there's a conjectural version. I mean, rather, not that one exists, like not that there's like a model that's written down that is conjectured to be it, but it is conjectured that there is a model that you could write down. Sound good? Yeah. Yeah, actually on the Pinto subject, I should say that there's also a map associated to Pinto monopole floor homology that lands at the same group, which is conjecturally the same as this map. So there should be some strong agreement already at this stage. But on the subject of things you might want to do within volume of floor homology, Fluorhomology associated to a cobordism, you also get maps on involutive fluorhomology, although that's not obvious. And you could ask if sometimes the maps on Hygard fluorhomology for a cobordism are vanishing, but the maps on involutive fluorhomology are non-vanishing. So questions like that, we don't have the calculation tools at the time, or at the moment to actually do, but you know, you can sort of hope for these things. So I don't know. I don't know. I guess I'm just harping on this question. You really should be able to do more within Lloydo floor homology, but at the moment, we're mostly limited to the homology coverts and group. All right. So what are some other calculations that we have access to, though? So I said. Sure. Francesco has this paper about involved molecules being a strategic contact geometry. Yeah, I guess that's a true. Yeah, that's a term. Where you show, you know, so if you have like a more than a V2 plus a greater than zero, the map on ordinary agent. That's not necessarily the case in the world. So you can't, do you feel that you can't feel that the same thing is true? That is almost definitely true, but we don't have a proof at the moment. So yeah, I mean, that's the next sort of thing you would want to look at is covering. Sort of thing you would want to look at is coborisms that have b2 plus equals 1. You should be able to really say something. But it's still tricky. Yeah. But yeah, this is the question that I hope to allude to. Yeah, but you can do that. Right. So the first calculation, though, that predates, this is in some sense the second calculation tool is a large surgery formula. And I left that dot up on the board. And I left that not up on the board for a while because, well, it would take too long to get to it at the end, but I wanted to leave that as an example where you could probably use the involve the involvement surgery formula to calculate the involveative fluoromology surgeries on that knot. So that's at least one example where, you know, you can sort of calculate these things on occasion. So, you know, we're one for one, I'm calculating things around. If you think it random or not, we're pretty good ratio so far. Gratio so far. Alright, so in addition to having a void of fluorhomology for a three-manifold Hendrickson manois, we also define a void of fluorhomology for knots, and they show the following thing. So let's say, say, K is a knot in an integer homology three-sphere. Then Cf minus of the surgery, if N is sufficiently large in the so-called zero-spin C structure, is structure is homotopy equivalent as a complex with involution to the A0 complex that's usually used in the large surgery formula. So if you write down CFK as a diagram in the plane, A0 minus is just everything in the lower quadrant. And if you use the formulation that Ian was describing on Monday, A0 is just the set of all A0 is just the set of all generators of not four homology that live in Alexander gradient zero in the flavor over u and v. But yeah, more classically it looks like this. But Hendrix and Manelescu show that the not floor involution in this lower quadrant is exactly the involution on the large surgery. So this tells you that if you know the involution on not fluorohomology, then you can actually do Then you can actually do computations for large surgeries, at least in the zero-spin C structure. So that's pretty useful. And the proof of this is also sort of somewhat illuminating because it's essentially just the ordinary proof of Auschwath and Zabo that identifies the large surgery complex with something coming from not fluorohomology, made compatible with the involution on the two ends. Evolution on the two ends. So it's not totally, it doesn't follow immediately from Anjou Ponzapo's argument exactly because the definition of biota K for a knot is somewhat more complicated than what happens for a closed two manifold. And then the final sort of preliminary calculation tool is Ethereum as MP for involved in knot floor homology, which says that CFK of the connects on the two knots with their involution is also computable. Is also computable. So iota of the connected sum is the tensor product of the pieces, with iota essentially coming from the tensor product of the pieces. Already with these three theorems, you can sort of do some calculations because if you have any knots where you can actually calculate the involution, then you can start summing them together to get more complicated knots. Together to get more complicated knots, and you're always allowed to do large surgeries on whatever you've produced that way. So that at least, you know, in a fairly algebraic way, if you have simple knots, you can calculate some stuff. Any questions before we move on to the next surgery formula? Let let's state some surgery stuff. Let's see. Right. Yeah, I should have also mentioned that you can do the calculations for three manifolds, which are almost rational plumbings, and that's through the die of the nano-speed. There's a relatively simple description. So if y is a ciphert space, for example, or an AR1, cipher integral homology is the three-sphere, then Cf minus of Y, equipped with its involution, has an explicit description. And you can use that to show that the image of ciphert spaces That the image of cipher spaces in this local equivalence group give you a Z-infinity subgroup. So you can generate, or you can distinguish many classes just using their description. But if you want to do more calculations with this theory, you remember back to how we do calculations in hemp floor homology. And one of the principal tools is indeed just using Oshwa-Nzabo's, just say the integer surgery formula. And that's what I want to talk about here. So, Ethereum. So Ethereum, let's let K and Y just be some frame knot. Then there exists an exact triangle. Or an exact sequence, whatever. Relating the Hebrew employee of floor homology with different surgery coefficients. Homology with different surgery coefficients. Goes back to the HF5, minus 1. So where y0 and y1 represent the different surgeries with respect to the framing that you've selected. And this is a generalization of the theorem of Hendrix and Lipper. Generalization of the theorem of Hendrix and Lipschitz that established the exact same result but for half. And then the main component, though, that you want in order to have a surgery formula for integer surgery timing not is the following variation, which has a very similar proof. So if k and y and y is an integer homology 3-sphere, then you have an exact triangle of the following form. The following form. So it's sort of the same thing to start with, but where you have to use twisted coefficients, which I'll explain in a second. Then you have the floor homology of some large surgery, or of some surgery of whatever size you want, followed by a large surgery. The proof of this is complicated, and maybe we could say a few words about it at the end, but for the moment, let's just accept that assumption. But for the moment, let's just accept that as some statement. So, this is meant to be just a version of Aja Hanzabo's original surgery-exact triangle that they used to set up the integer surgery formula. So, there's a theorem of Aja-Hanzabo that there is an exact triangle where you just leave out the eyes. So And everything is supposed to be minus. Indeed, that's, so this exact triangle is part of the machine in there. But once they have this exact triangle, they're able to observe that it tells you a lot of information about Yn in terms of other pieces. When you have an exact triangle, what's really happening is that one of the pieces is being identified as the mapping cone of the other two pieces. But in particular, once they have this exact sequence, you can say HF minus of Yn is some kind of homology of a mapping cone from Cf minus of Yn plus M to Cf minus of Y. to Cf minus of Y. And these twisted coefficients just correspond to taking many copies of so if you're not working involutively the twist just results in you taking many copies of the Higher polymology of Y instead of a single copy. So in particular this is equivalent to just n copies of Y. But the thing is that this napping cone consists of two pieces. This napping cone consists of two pieces you already know. So if you choose M very large, this is just the large surgery that you've already identified. The large surgery was identified in that panel, which I unfortunately already erased. And this term is just the fluorohomology in the ambient manifold in which you're doing the surgery. So once they get to this exact triangle, that allows you to rephrase what you're looking at. Rephrase what you're looking for, the surgery, in terms of two-chain complexes that you already know. And they're able to identify that mapping cone as something coming from not floor homology. So they show that this first term, Cf minus, of Ym plus M is just the A complex, so that Ian was referring to on Monday also. And this term is what you would call the B complex. This term is what you would call the B complex. And the map between the two of them is a map that's determined just by not floor homology. So DN is determined by the not-fluorhomology. So it's determined by CFK and not K. And so that provides kind of a roadmap for what you're supposed to do once you have an exact. What you're supposed to do once you have an exact triangle, this format in the involutive setting. So, the proof of this exact triangle is really identifying HFI of some surgery as the mapping cone of a map from the large surgery back down to the ordinary floor homology of your manifold. The first exact triangle. identifies CF minus of Ym with involution, so CFI minus, with the mapping column of the large surgery to some number of copies of Y. So and right, these are two pieces that we already understand. Understand. And, you know, that's pretty good. Unfortunately, though, it's more difficult, well, it's pretty difficult in this situation to figure out exactly what the mapping between them is this time around, which we can see in a second. But first, are there any questions on, I don't know, what's on the board at the moment? Yeah, no point. Oh, so yeah, that's a great question. So it basically is a direct sum. It's just a kind of funny direct sum. It's essentially the embalitative fluorhomology of y with some number of copies of the non-employed fluorhomology of y. So it's as boring as possible without being obvious what it is. Is that sort of? Yeah, you should just imagine it as one sort of copy of the involvement of fluoromology of the three sphere and then a bunch of towers where Q acts trivially. Minus Y towers or something? It depends on the parity of N and M. It's extremely annoying, but it's about equal to M towers. Okay. So, all right. So, all right. When you're on that board, you're pretty happy at this point. But you can recall that there's something a little bit dishonest about the statement of this panel. So it's sort of a riddle for the experts, I guess. But the ordinary floor homology of a surgery is not actually determined by CFK or the NOTK exactly. So it's only determined by the NOTK. It's only determined by the not floor homology of your underlying knot if you're in an L space, because there's this additional issue of the so-called flip map, which shows up also in Heaven and Levine's surgery formula. So the same problem is about to show up over here, which is that it's a lot easier to identify this mapping cone that you get with something coming from not floating homology if you're inside of an L-space. And now, I guess. And now, I guess I'll state what exactly happens there. But first, let's note what kind of thing this mapping cone is. What does this look like? So, the two pieces are themselves mapping cones. Right, the CFI of something is just the mapping cone of one plus I. And And now we have a map between the two things. So it's, you have two separate mapping cones at the ends. But this is, you know, where iota complexes become algebraically annoying, which is a map between two iota complexes. On the top here, it's just the coordinates and maps. On the top here, it's just the cobordism map in Hegrad fluorohomology. So this is just Cf minus of some cobordism. And on the bottom, it's the same map. But a map on involved fluorhomology is a pair consisting of a cobordism map on the ordinary fluorohomology along with some witness that remembers that iota commutes with cobordism maps. So it's been known since almost the beginning of Huguard fluorhomology that cobordison maps are conjugation invariant. But now the map between these two things has to involve the witness. Between these two things, it has to involve the witness to conjugation invariance. So, this map on the top is exactly the map that shows up in Achafonzabo's surgery formula, but there's this extra map in the middle that is very hard to identify with something coming from not floor homology. And yeah, in principle, once you have the exact triangle, you get to this stage, and then you have a very hard time identifying what this homotopy is going to be. But you can see that the Is going to be. But you can see that the involvement floor homology of a surgery actually depends on this sort of new piece of information of a homotopy realizing conjugation of variants for cobordism maps. But skipping at, I guess, unfortunately, leaving out all the geometry, if you're in an L-space, you can. If you're in an L space, you can identify explicitly what that momentopia is. So the theorem. If y is equal to S3, just for convenience, that mapping cone can be identified as follows. Well, you have the large surgery. Well, you have the large surgery complexes as before. So A minus, which is just the direct sum, running over all the AS complexes, which I guess Ian told us about on Monday. You have this direct sum B running over all the BS complexes. And the involution in the two columns. And the involution in the two columns is just the involution coming from not floor homology. So this is 1 plus A over K in some sense. You have to suitably normalize what you mean, but it's essentially just the not-floor involution. And then you still can't say that the square is going to commute exactly, but the moments of the in-between, you can say it factors. You can say it factors. So you can either factor it through, there's two maps that are the components of the Audboth and Zabo differential, which I won't state the definition of. But they also appeared in Ian's talk. But you can factor the homotopy through one or the other of these two maps. It's up to you. So you can say that Hn is actually some map F composed with, let's say, H. And you can also say a little bit more about F. From the exact triangle on the floorboard, you actually know that this mapping cone, for some choice of homotopy, is the involved floor homology of the search route, which is what you're looking for. But once you know that HN factors through like a particular map here, you can Like a particular map here, you can start calculating things explicitly. And the upshot is that is the following statement. So if k is not an integer homology 3-sphere, you have a surgery formula. So then Cf minus Yn K in the zero spin C structure is identified with, I guess we should call this this diagram star. And you can write that diagram down in the way one is used to, right? You have your A0, A1, and so on complexes. You have the maps between all of them. All of them. And now the involution is just going to move you between different components. So the dashed arrows are the involution on the snapping cone complex. Except that there's also some arrows that go really far away. So the involution mostly preserves the A and B sides, except there's also a morphism from A1 over to B negative 1, A2 over to B negative 1. Negative 1, a2 over to be negative 2, and so on. So this is just part of the integration. But it turns out that for the most part, that doesn't matter. So and the local equivalence class of Cf minus I minus Y and K is just It's just A0. So in fact, even though the surgery formula looks very complicated, you have all these homotopies flying around, you can just do a little bit of algebra to check that the A0 term is going to split off. So there's a map from this large complex down to A0 and a map going back in from A0 into the From A0 into the large complex. And both of these maps are iota-equivariant. So if you're only interested in doing homology cobortism, the surgery formula says you get the same answer as you would have had for large surgery. So that means that you suddenly have the ability to calculate any knots, K, for which you could have calculated the invoyed floor homology. Now you can calculate surgeries on any connected sum of. Surgeries on any connected sum of those knots. I don't know. And I'll just state some examples. So if you take a bunch of torus knots and just start randomly summing them together, remarkably you can get interesting outputs. So let Kn be some appropriate sum of torus knots. Torus knots. Then it turns out that the plus one surgeries on all these Kn's, so sort of artfully selected sums of torus knots, generate a Z infinity subgroup of theta mod out by the set of, or the homology, the subset of the homology. The subset of the homology cobordism group generated by all almost rational plombines. So this just says that once you're allowed to start surgering on sort of weird combinations like this, you can find manifolds that look maximally far from what Diane Manalescu showed that almost rational thumbed manifolds look like. So any surgery obtained this way on some choices of torus knots is Is not going to be a combination of any set of almost rational plugins. So, you know, this says that even with a relatively simple class of knots, you can get out from the surgery formula interesting looking complexes overall. Yeah, I think that maybe is a good application to end on. So I think I'll stop there. But yeah, thanks. Questions? So, uh can you get a formula for the DMAR? Uh yeah, I I mean the formula is maybe not uh uh super uh satisfying I guess. Satisfying, I guess. The formula for the D invariant is mainly just the claim that it doesn't depend on n, exactly as you might expect, I guess. So the d lower and d upper invariants of this are just the v0 lower and v0 invariants of k, which are just defined as the d lower and d upper invariants of this A0 complex. But you can also ask about finding the d lower and upper invariants of rational surgeries or of Rational surgeries or if you're looking in the other spin C structure, if you have the two-and surgery, and there you have much more explicit formulas. Thank Matt for sticking to the schedule and giving us a very thoughtful Alright, so we're adjourned for the rest of the afternoon. There's beautiful weather, there's beautiful mountains outside. Those of you from the U.S., not the virtual participants, but those who are here will need to deal with getting an antigen test before we leave. And I checked, I guess there's a testing service here at Pam. There's also testing at Calgary Airport. Calgary Airport, which may seem like last minute, but it is a fallback. I think you will need, they say you need about 30 to 60 minutes to get to end it, the rapid testing result. So at the airport. Click here is that. Click here says fifteen minutes. Yeah, it's it's it usually is fast. I was told by the local gentleman who did it because you heard about it, you know. I would be nervous, but they say it's 60 bucks at the airport, so it's probably the same cost. So 70 bucks. Okay. The research is like the price for a piece of mine. I said it was a while ago. I'm not counting on your remote. There's a relation between you can get the flip map from, if you remember, both the non-embodiant and the free. Yeah, I remember that. That was so like you can really start to it might not resolve this issue, but you can at least start to exit. Yeah, I mean I started because unfortunately not everything is not updated here. That's fair. I mean you were right so it was going to be a little bit different. That was it I was just like I mean that was cool actually I wanted to talk more about tonight like there's I'm interested in the weird mystery that you're trying to do, like not stuff. It seems to be share a lot of properties and it has like the And then that like the search encode just makes me look more sure. Except for like really funnily enough, the thing that is actually been blushing. Oh yeah, actually. Well, is that you answer it? What I'm saying is I don't have a specific question. But just I really want to come back and spend more time with you. There's very basic questions. I don't know if you have a two-dimensional action. Yeah, as opposed to the brain intelligence. And your fruit is generated by time, which is the same thing. So the two, the two second space is like, yeah, one three. And that ends up being a subspace. That ends up. So, like, one thing that I think is recently proved that it's invariant, like, one thing I tried to do is carry along as much of the information as I can already let it dig into variants, keeping track of this evolution. And also, knowing that the three-num evolution, keeping that along for the other. Yeah, you want to do it. So, I want to do more. Yeah, you want it? So like I want to do more questions about one thing I want to do. We know what our test is going to be from my perspective. That will have a lot of stock should be talking about online. Lower stress. In particular, in some sense, that's why it comes absorbed as a psychological. Well, that's a more natural thing. And there's a generalized conjugacy. It comes absorbed into the picture. But if you're trying, you still need it. And this is dying of value crazy. You just find a way to carefully sub it over the idea. Which seems like I think I want to say. I think I want to remember to talk more and understand more. It's not totally nice. I can't give an explicit formula as far as I know. I mean, there's some people who are not. But I've never actually written it or anybody else. Totally Chris Errol just like, oh, yeah, the consequences now. We only heard that makeup. It probably wouldn't be too hard to recover that rage. Because it's ultimately this thing. Actually, it's all cometh. Any other things? And it's all the SU31. You know, the work that needs to go into it to do what you want is to figure out what's the To figure out on what's the conjugacy class of just intersecting the football, I guess, and figure out whether it's irreducible, a sort of what I wanted. Yeah, that was crazy. It was bad. Like, there's always more. I can totally get right into the second one. I guess that's the same thing at all. I don't want to use it. I guess that gives you a full time in your picture. So yeah, so the way I think about, I mean, I love the way you explain it, but the way I sneak cheated through this explanation and just think, oh, it's you know, it's the group of mods that stable different places, like two diarrhea. And you know that there's sentence on a couple of planning. I think there isn't one in the arrow. There are three complexes. Well, no, I think there might be two. I don't know. I think there's. I don't know. I think there's a kind of feature for us you want. You know, there's some side alive, but I don't see why you wouldn't have that. And then there's an irreducible. There's cancelling the CPU. Sorry, my C. What is this? I think it's good. Also, I was going to mention. Yeah, I think you are clear to most people. Most people just meant I was going to mention the laser complexes that were very close to the sound. Actually, we never calculated the involvement. I see the air displays I copied from not going off to the well it's just SU3. I guess you constructed a bunch of. It's really just SU3, it's very much like. Just SU33. It's very much like SU3. But it's not. Well, it's a three-fold. SU3 is a cover, a three-fold cover. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, if you're a fan of the volume of fluorophonology, the way I thought about this, we actually worked for other chlorosnots too. I mean, we could conceivably work for other human acts. But not all. Yeah, but not all of that. And when I ask one thing, what's the easiest way to irreducible components? Especially to say the two is a Taurus note. The KONs are basically the same thing for Urban Southern. And you can kind of describe it. You can describe S-U-M. Describing SUM character bread of those guys in terms of like what the polytops that appear in the complexity. Oh, oh, oh, what kind of complexity? Yeah, I mean, like, what's the feature of the complexity? So basically, the idea in H23 is to use the other use of the standard vertical presentation. Almost two generators XY, XYX, XYXY. But the other generation. Maybe that's because it gets your right stuff out of it. And then it gets them in the arms and the slides. So then you have to think of the Beridians as words in that. But if all you really care about is what you're saying. If all you really care about is what type of you know how you really need to know as well how does this thing intersect with your monitor maker and that's not that hard to work out but anyway so the idea is the myodas just like you use control that if x and um whenever you describe plumbing you can describe if your presentation is x y x squared is y'all. You want to see that kind of looks like that. That element, x squared, that has to be central. Otherwise, your actual representation is necessarily reduced. And this is maybe multiplication. So if you want to get an irreducible, that has to be central. So then you can work, you can sort of write down all the possible conjugacy classes that can go to that element can go to. That goes to a central element, so x squared goes to a square root of a central element. Square root of a central element. Why? I think in this particular case, they actually end up having to be that central element is actually one. You don't know if omegas are going to be a moment. You don't get it reduced for omegas equals to something other than one. And so then you say, okay, so differentials in your staircase. I can conjugate X so that it really is. So this is the tau generator minus one. And I can conjugate every almost rational point in LBC. So now let me see. You can just calculate the surgery, you get a u to the 1 relative to x because x isn't using up all the conjugation. And now I just want to sort of think about what are the variants live for its conjugacy class. What are the possible elements I could get for x times y? times y. And that ends up nailing. Like if I know the conjugate z plus y, then I actually nail everything down. And I think like there are other ways to think to justifies or explain this. I think it's another way to think of this is also the trace of X and the trace of Y and the trace of X Y. Is there anything interesting that you could say about it in the case of the X? That you could say about it in that. I don't know anything about outweighing class, so it's sort of like that's linearly reminded. So it's easy to see these kinds of things in SL2 or in SU2. Anyway, so what I'm interested in is what is the possible for me of finding the product. These are recommended format, but for you, and then you can. Is there any invariant extraction? Some will be allowable. And it's sort of like I'll fix X to be this. It's not exactly what it is. So here X Y and Alexander publicly. Yeah, and that's out of triangle. So you get a triangle of irreducible, I guess you through your representation. And then the really kind of interesting thing is how that limits to the reducible. And the reducible, the next stages will be that same YouTube press you want, and then how those limit them. I'll show you the code. So this is how I pictured the trace condition. So this is this is 1. This is omega. This is omega squared. Omega is e to the 2 pi over. Be able to 2. And so my abelians will be all of this. Sorry, I didn't, I don't think I understand this. Ah, so this picture is just parameterizing the, now it's parameterizing the trace of the meridian, or the conjugacy class of the meridian. Okay. And I'm saying there's each point in here corresponds to a unique abelian SU degree representation of the component. Representation of the non-component. And this is true for any non. Just because the abelians, an abelian representation will factor through H1. So the abelians, like the familiar picture, you know, I thought of this in the context of SU2. And the familiar picture in SU2 is that you have an arc of abelian. You have an arc of abelions of this arc of irreducibles attached at these roots of the Alexander polynomial. That familiar and maybe the
