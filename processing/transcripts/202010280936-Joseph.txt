About a birational lifting of the Lalan-Kwervoros involution on dick paths. Yes, thank you for attending and thank you to the organizers for inviting me to speak. This is joint work with Sam Hopkins, who's going to give the next talk after the short break, building off of some of this. So let's start with dick paths. So a dick path of semi-length n is a lattice path. Semi-length n is a lattice path from 0, 0 to 2n, 0 that consists of n upsteps and n downsteps, such that it never goes below the x-axis. So here's a dick path with 10 upsteps and 10 downsteps. And it's well known that dick paths are counted by Catalan numbers. So one statistic we'll look at on DICPAS is the number of valleys. So here we So here we have dick paths with four upsteps and four downsteps. So there's 14 of them. And I have them grouped together by number of valleys. So like this one here has two valleys and there's six of them with two valleys. And one thing that we notice here when we look at the dick paths by number of valleys is that that statistic is symmetrically distributed. And the Narayana numbers count dick paths by number of valleys. Dick paths by number of valleys. Another statistic we'll look at is the major index of a dick path. So this is defined similarly to the major index of a permutation. Basically, we look at all of the values we have and we add up the, so first we label the positions from left to right. And then here we have a valley in the third, starting in the third position, the eighth position, 11. Third position, the eighth position, 11 and 15, and we add those together. So this path has major index 37. So again, we'll look at our example where n is 4, and I have, when we look at the DIC paths by major index, we also observe that this statistic is also symmetrically distributed. So the Q-Catalan numbers count DICPADS by major index. And I mean, if you know. And I mean, if you know like the Q-Catalan numbers, you may know that their coefficients are symmetric, but it's still not obvious how to give a bijective proof that the major index statistic is symmetrically distributed and same for the number of valleys. So that's where an involution that Lalan and Krevor studied comes into play. So they defined an involution on, so this dick sub n is a number, is a set of dick paths of Is a set of dick paths of semi-length n. Basically, it takes a path with v valleys to a path with n minus 1 minus v valleys. It takes a path with major index m to a path with major index n times n minus 1 minus m. So the way that this involution works is that you take your dick path and you, every place you see a junction of consecutive upsteps, you draw a southeast line going from there. Southeast line going from there, and every place you see a junction of consecutive downsteps, you draw a southwest line from there. And then you mark the points where these southeast lines and southwest lines intersect. And then LK of P is the unique dick path. It's drawn upside down here, but where the valleys are at these marked points. So this red path drawn upside down is LK of P, where P is this blue path here. So yeah, so here N is. Yeah, so here n is 10, 10 upsteps and 10 downsteps. So n minus 1 is 9. So we had this blue path with 4 valleys. This red one has five valleys, which is 9 minus 4. And n times n minus 1 is 10 times 9. That's 90. So we had a path with major index 37. LKFP has major index 90 minus 37, which is 53. So in this talk, we're going So in this talk, we're going to consider a different set of Catalan objects. We're going to consider anti-change of the type A root coset. So in this talk, we're going to be focused in type A only, but Sam's talk after the break, he's going to discuss a conjecture in other types. But the type A root poset, there's several ways. There's several ways to name the elements, but the way that we'll be what we'll be calling the elements in this talk are the intervals of the set of numbers from 1 to n ordered by containment. So here's an example. Here's what the root process at A4 looks like. And so there's a natural bijection between DIC paths of semi-length n plus 1 and anti-chains of an. So there's a shift in the index. There's a shift in the index. So, actually, what we're calling n is going to change at this point in the talk. So, here we have a path with five upsteps and five downsteps, but it corresponds to an anti-chain of A4, where the way that this bijection works is every place you see a valley, you include the point right up there, the element right up there in your anti-chain. So, the number of valleys of the dick path is the cardinality of the anti-chain. Of the anti-chain. And the major index of the DIC path can be read off just by looking at the anti-chain. Basically, looking at our example from before, here's the corresponding anti-chain. And we had, yeah, we had a valley here starting with the third step. That 3 is just 1 plus 2. So you can find the major index. We're just adding up all of these numbers. And here, yeah, that's what we got earlier. This has major index 37. This has major index 37. So, yeah, we're going to call the major index of the anti-chain just the same thing as the major index of the corresponding DIC path. And we can actually describe the Lalan-Crevorus involution, which I'm just going to call LK involution from now on without drawing the dig paths just on anti-chains. And the way this works is basically: let's take this last. Let's take this last example we had. Let's look at the second coordinates, the set 2, 4, 6, and 9, the second coordinates, and take the complement of that from the numbers from 1 to n. So that gives us 1, 3, 5, 7, 8. And then we'll do the same thing with the first coordinates, 1, 4, 5, and 6. The complement of that in the set of numbers from 1 to 9 is 2, 3, 7, 8, 9. So the new anti-chain has these as the first coordinates and these as the second coordinates. Coordinates and these as the second coordinates. So this is LK of A, which gives us what we saw before. It's this red dick path with major index 53. But this was studied by Panushev. He called this the dual anti-chain of A, and he was apparently unaware that this same involution was, this is the same as the one studied by Lalan and Crevoras on DICPASS, through a natural bijection between DICPAS and anti-chains of the root process. RootPoset. So, yeah, so a few things are more obvious to me with this anti-chain description. First of all, the fact that this map is an involution is obvious as well as showing that the symmetric properties of the cardinality, which is the number of valleys and the major index. So, we're just going to focus on this map on anti-chains of the root postet and. And another reason we're doing that is because on root process, row motion has been shown to have nice behavior with homomessity and periodicity and cyclic sieving and so on. So yeah, so rail motion has been mentioned in several talks in this conference already. So order ideal rail motion has come up and so is anti-chain row motion. And so, as anti-chain row motion, they're just two ways of looking at row motion. So, we're gonna focus on anti-chain row motion. So, you saturate downward and then take the complement and take the minimal element. So, this three-step process sends anti-chains of a poset to anti-chains of that poset. That's row motion. So, here's an example of row motion here. And on the type A root process, so in this example, Type A ruposa. So in this example, we have A3. You see there's an orbit of size 8, an orbit of size 4, and an orbit of size 2. I believe Tom in his talk on Friday showed the diagram with these same orbits. So one thing you notice is that, so here n is 3. When you do row motion n plus 1 time, so four times, you get a horizontal flip of the original one. So this is just a reflection of that one. You start with one that's already symmetric around the center. That's already symmetric around the center vertical line. You do it four times, you get back to the start. So, therefore, if you do it two times n plus one times, that's the order of row motion on this poset. And this has come up in talks before, but row motion can also be described in terms of toggles. So, this goes back to Cameron and Fonderfloss described order ideal row motions as toggling order ideal. Order ideal toggles from the top to the bottom of the postet, but you can also describe anti-chain roll motion by doing anti-chain toggles from the bottom to the top. So yeah, that's something I proved a few years ago. Jessica Stryker had also noticed that independently. So yeah, so we can start with, we can do this just rank by rank. So if it's in the anti-chain, I take it out. The anti-chain, I take it out. If it's not in, I put it in, provided I still get an anti-chain. So here I can take this one out, but I could not put these two in because they're because of this element. I wouldn't get an anti-chain. So now, when I move up to this rank, I can take this out and I can put this in and get an anti-chain. And then once I put this one in here, when I move to the top, I can put it in. So that's the that's what anti-chain row motion. That's what anti-chain row motion does to the original anti-chain. And that's the same thing we got through this process. So, yeah, so row motion is a cyclic group action that's been studied a lot. And Sam and I have both been interested in looking at dihedral actions that generalize these cyclic actions that have nice properties. And that was part of the motivation for this work. So, yeah, Pyanushev showed this in 2009 that if you do row motion and then LK, it's the same thing as doing LK and inverse row motion. So we get a dihedral action generated by row motion and the LK involution. And so row motion has nice properties on the type A rupoxa, not only in the combinatorial realm, but also in In the combinatorial realm, but also in the liftings to the piecewise linear and birational realms. So, our goal was to find a lifting of this involution such that these four main properties we have generalize. So, yeah, the fact that it forms a dihedral action with row motion, and also the homomessity of the cardinality and the major index. If we have these properties, then If we have these properties, then it's a nice action in these higher realms as well. So, piecewise linear and birational dynamics have come up in previous talks, but I'm not going to go through all of the details about the piecewise linear. I'm going to kind of move ahead to the birational, but I mean, you can associate an anti-chain with its indicator labeling that has zeros if it's not in the anti-chain and one if it's in the anti-chain. And then, if you take the convex hollow. And then, if you take the convex hull of that, you get Stanley's chain polytope. So, basically, we can define toggles, piecewise linear anti-chain toggles that are basically just a fractional version of what we were doing before. I'm not going to go through the details here, but there's a definition of the piecewise linear anti-chain toggle, which Einstein and Prop looked at piecewise linear and birational dynamics, focusing on the order. Dynamics focusing on the order ideal perspective in 2013. But basically, we're going to detropicalize to come up with the definition of the birational anti-chain toggle. So when you detropicalize, you replace max with plus and plus with times. So this minus the max of the sum becomes divided by the sum of the, yeah. Of the yeah, of the product, and then when you uh you know, of course, when you replace plus with times, the additive identity zero gets replaced with the multiplicative identity one, but one, there was a one in this definition, that's nothing special with regards to max and plus. So to get the most general version, we just replace that with a generic constant, c so again, um, tau i is just the composition of the toggles of every Composition of the toggles of everything of rank I, birational anti-chain row motion is now doing the birational anti-chain toggles from the bottom to the top. So to do this toggle at this element that's labeled u, we look at the maximal change. That's what this MC means, maximal change through that. So, and take the product. So we have UXZ. So we do C divided by that. So that says. By that. So that sends that changes that label to C divided by UXC. This one in the middle, we have two maximal chains there. So VXZ and VYZ. We add up those products and do C divided by that. So when you toggle the bottom row, you get this. Then you compose the toggles from the middle row and then the top row. And this is one iteration of bar motion, birational anti-chain row motion. When you do it a second time, Second time you get something uglier, but then when you actually compose it four times, you get a horizontal reflection of the original labeling. So yeah, anything that you prove true at the birational level holds true at the piecewise linear level and then also at the combinatorial level, but not vice versa. So it's surprising at first when things generalize, when these combinatorial properties generalize the other way. But Grinberg and Roby, they. Way, but Grindberg and Roby they proved it for the order ideal by rational row motion, but it holds true either way. You can convert. I mean, the question is: are you looking at the anti-chain where you're when you include the elements of the valleys of the DIC path? Or are you looking at the order ideal that's everything below your DIC path? You can, here we're just focusing on anti-chain land, but if you do bar motion n plus one times, you get a reflection across the center vertical line. We saw that. Across the center vertical line, we saw that here, and then so therefore, if you do it two times that, you get the identity. So, that property we saw earlier holds true at the birational level. So, let's go back to our goal. You know, we wanted to find a lifting of this Lalan-Crevoras involution. And hopefully, if we lift it, we have all of these nice properties that the combinatorial realm still generalize. That would be a nice lifting. Be a nice lifting, and that's what we have. But it's not obvious how to do this because if you think about like these other realms, there's no dick paths to draw. And we had another description that involved complementing a set of coordinates. And if you don't have an actual anti-chain, you can't do that. So it turned out we were able to do this by realizing that the LK involution is equivalent to a map called row evacuation that can be defined on any graded postset. On any graded postet, and that's defined in terms of toggles. So, this allows us to lift LK to these higher realms. So, I'm just going to use the term higher realms now to refer to piecewise linear by rational collectively. So, basically, the term row evacuation is because row motion and row evacuation satisfy a similar relationship to promotion and evacuation that goes back to Schutzen-Berger on. Schutz and Berger on linear extensions of a poset. Row evacuation is always an involution and it always satisfies this property. So, together with row motion, it forms a headeral action. And there's an order ideal, definite order ideal row evacuation map. And equivariantly, you can look at the anti-chain row evacuation map. Sam's going to mention, I believe he's going to mention both of them in his talk. But basically, again, Tau. Again, tau i is a composition of all anti-chain toggles of rank i elements. You start by toggling everything from the bottom up. So that's just actually row motion. Then you do that again, but without the bottom rank, then you do it again without the bottom two ranks all the way up to the top. And that gives you an involution. And so this is when we restrict to the post at AN, this gives a natural way to define the button. Natural way to define the birational LK involution to be row evacuation, where we do these composition of toggles on this poset using birational anti-chain toggles. Piecewise linear, use piecewise linear toggles, and so on. So two of those things we saw before we get for free because they're true for row evacuation. They just use products, properties of toggles to show these two properties. To show these two properties. But that begs the question: okay, what about the nice properties we had for the cardinality and the major index? Do those lift to the birational realm? Well, what does cardinality and major index mean? Let's do a piecewise linear example first. So if you had an anti-chain where you just had zeros and ones, the cardinality would be the sum of all of the labels. So in this fractional version, that makes sense to define the piecewise. That makes sense to define the piecewise linear cardinalities to just be the sum of all of these labels. So here's a generic labeling in the chain polytope, and here's another one. Here's another one that's just LK, piecewise linear LK of this. And when we add up their cardinalities, we see that we get 4, which is exactly what we observed in the combinatorial realm, because this is A4. And the major index, the piecewise linear major index, you need to multiply. piecewise linear major index, you need to multiply the label by i plus j. So this 0.5, we times it by 2, this 0, we times it by 3, this 0.1 and 0 we times it by 4, and so on. And we see the major indexes add to 20, which is 4 times 4 plus 1. So we seem to observe this same property, but if we can prove it at the birational level, that it holds true at the piecewise linear and combinatorial. And here we observe this on A3, that the one. That so one advantage of using the birational realm is instead of looking at just a sample orbit at once, we see rational functions describe the whole orbit. And here this proves those properties on A3. So here I have the cardinality. I've replaced plus with time, so it's just the product of all of these labels is c cubed divided by the cardinality of this, the product of the labels, the birational cardinality. So that means. Cardinality. So that means that on the, if I did piecewise linear, remember C just replaced one when we detropicalize. So when I tropicalize, I get three minus the cardinality of this and piecewise linear. And for the major index, that times i plus j becomes an exponent, and we get the major index of this is c to the 12th divided by the major index of this. We see these properties holding true. And in fact, before we discovered that. Before we discovered that the LK involution was real-motioned in the combinatorial realm, I was just asking, hmm, is there a birational lifting? And I was looking for things like I wanted it to line up with the combinatorial realm and I wanted it to satisfy these properties and basically figured out what these labels had to be on A3 and A2 and A4. And then was like, okay, what's the general pattern? And that's how we stumbled upon row evacuation working here. So Sam and I proved. So, Sam and I proved these properties of the cardinality and the major index homomesses lifting to the birational realm. And in doing that proof, we yeah, so in doing that proof, we actually found some more refined homomesses, these HI statistics that we hadn't discovered before, where basically Where basically that like h3 is the sum of the indicator functions of all of these elements with second coordinate three plus all of these elements with first coordinate three. So this three three actually appears twice in this sum. And we were able to prove that this was homomestic also in the birational realm. And that ended up being the key thing here because so here I'm in the tropical land or I'm in the I'm in the tropical land, or I'm in the combinatorial realm. Cardinality and major index are both linear combinations of these H statistics. So if you can show these are homomessic, then you can show that these are homomessic. So in the birational realm, homomessy has a different definition where sums get replaced with products. I mean, Sawichi talked about that in his talk. Yeah, so one thing I found interesting. So, one thing I found interesting was that, you know, Sam found these statistics, these HI statistics, and I immediately looked at them and said that, oh, these are defined exactly the same way as ones that myself and six others found to be homomessic on a toggling action on non-crossing partitions five years ago, where we were interested in proving arc count homoci, but we ended up writing the arc count as a linear combination of statistics that are defined. Combination of statistics that are defined this same way, and those ended up being the easier ones to prove were homomessic. I mean, the homomessy of these HI statistics for row evacuation, for the LK involution is obvious in the combinatorial realm, if you think about it. It's just from this alternate description of the LK involution on anti-chains that we saw earlier. But it's not at all straightforward how to do this in the bioreactor. At all straightforward, how to do this in the birational realm. And what a couple of things we ended up using was an embedding due to Grinberg and Roby of the AN into a product of two chains. And then when we were in a product of two chains, we were able to use the birational Stanley Thomas word that rotates under row motion. But one thing I found, and something we had kind of observed before we figured out why it was happening. kind of observed before we figured out why it was happening is that when you have a statistic that's homo messic for row vacuation on a poset whether you're an anti-chain land or order ideal land it seems to be also homo messic under row motion and it doesn't happen for all statistics but it we were able to show that certain statistics including ones that are linear combinations of postet element indicator functions if it's homomestic for row evacuation is also homomestic For row evacuation is also homo messic for row motion, using a similar argument to Einstein and Propp's recombination. It doesn't go the other way. We have homo messages for row motion that don't hold true for row evacuation, but yeah. So therefore, it's easy to show that cardinality is homomestic for row evacuation. So therefore, it's homomestic under row motion. And that was originally a conjecture of Pan Yushev that Armstrong, Stuff, and Thomas proved. Armstrong, Stuffin Thomas proved that was an early example to motivate the broader study of homomessy. We also get major index homomessy for row motion, but Chimprop had already come up with an argument for that last year, writing it as a linear combination of other statistics that are already known to be homomestic for row motion. But I don't think that anyone had discovered these HI statistics, which are obviously homo messic for row evacuation. Homomestic for row evacuation in the combinatory realm and not as obvious in the birational realm. But they, therefore, they also happen to be homomestic for row motion on anti-chains of this poset. So yeah, here's H2 on A3 looking at those three orbits from earlier, and we see that this statistic is homomessic. It has average one on each orbit. And I just want to finish briefly with discussing an unsolved condition. Discussing an unsolved conjecture that basically goes back to Panushev's paper and lifting that to the birational realm. So yeah, in Panushev's paper, he describes this OI invariant that's barely his name for his wife, Oksanda Yakimova, that found this, that is invariant under both row motion and the And the LK involution. Basically, the way this works is you take your anti-chain and you look at the order filter generated by that anti-chain. So, of course, this anti-chain are the minimal elements of this order filter. But what happens when we remove an element, one of these minimal elements? Obviously, we lose that as a minimal element, but do we gain any new minimal elements? And here we gain two new minimal. And here we gain two new minimal elements. Okay, so that's for the red one. Let's look at the other element of our anti-chain. When we delete that from the order filter, we don't get any new minimal elements because this one is already above that. So 2 plus 0 is 2, and that's what y of A is for this anti-chain. And so that's invariant under row motion. As you see here, these are the three orbits of row motion on A3. Of real motion on A3 that we saw earlier, but it's also invariant under the LK involution. And so we said, hmm, could we lift this? Well, it's not obvious how you might do that because if you don't have an anti-chain to sum over, you can't sum over the elements of the anti-chain. Okay? Well, we could sum over all of the elements of the poset if we. Poset, if we let this thing we're summing be zero, if it's not in the anti-chain, and that might not seem like it helps us, but we're actually able to find an equivalent description that's just in terms of the max and plus and minus of the labels. And that allows us to lift it. So I can't go into details of this, but I'd love to talk about it in my breakout room later on. But yeah, we found like here's the birational OI on. On A3, so I can't describe exactly how these are found. But all of these, all of these, we need to wrap up. Okay, yeah, I'm wrapping up. Thanks. So all of these, the last thing I'm going to say is all of these V plus W, all of these factors that appear here occur in repeated iterations of row motion. So first we looked at like basically using Jim's linearization idea, figured out like on this post that what would be the a Y invariant that would The y-invariant that would match up with the combinatorial definition. Then we found the general pattern. So we know our general pattern lines up in the combinatorial realm, but we don't know how to prove this invariant under birational realm motion or LK. So thank you all. And I'd like to ask, see if there's any questions. Well, first let's thank Mike. Okay. Okay, and maybe a couple of quick questions for Mike. Have you tried the grasp parameterization to prove that OI is invariant? It feels like how hard could a determinant identity be. Mike, is there any other? You've got this description of LK at the birational level as a long product of toggles, but for these other maps like row motion, the liftings of row motion on anti-change or rotor ideals, we have liftings of the three-step description as well as the toggling liftings. So, do you think there's any hope for a kind of transfer map version of lifting? Version of lifting of description. I mean, there's it's not like as nice as the three. I mean, there's a I mean, there's something where like you can kind of, if you have the labels for LKL on like A3, you can kind of like then do that and then do like bar motion and like do something for the new elements at the bottom and get like the labels for A4. The labels for a four. I mean, it's not like, I don't know anything that's really like much nicer than what we said, but like if I uh Sam agrees with you in the chat, yeah, I think. Yeah, I think these discussions should continue in the breakout room that we'll be setting up for Mike. So let's thank Mike again before we go on with the next talk.
