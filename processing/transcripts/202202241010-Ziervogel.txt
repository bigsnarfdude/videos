For having me. This is really exciting for me. And indeed, we will shift gears and talk a little bit about more about biology and the interactions with microplastics in these next 20 minutes or so. Let me see if I can. Yeah. So here's my outline and I'm Here's my outline, and I structured it this way that I will start out. I just have a couple of slides giving you a brief overview of the role of microbes in the fate of marine particles in general and marine snow in particular, because this is something that I've been really excited about throughout my career. I started working on marine snow in the Baltic Sea as a PhD student back in Germany. Student back in Germany, and I've been carrying this all the way. And then at one point, actually, in the recent time, I made this path towards microbes and microplastics. And I will explain to you how that happened. And then I will talk about two case studies that we've conducted in my lab in the last year. First one is interactions between phytoplankton, marine snow, and microplastics. Phytoplankton marine snow microplastics. So, you know, focusing on the theme of this workshop, you know, looking at transport pathways of microplastics in the ocean. And then the other one, and this is, you know, still work in progress. First one actually is also still work in progress, but the second one is even more work in progress. We're looking at, we're interested at bacterial responses to photo oxidation of microplastics. So here we're focusing on the dissolved organic matter that is produced following photooxidation. Produced following photo oxidation of plastics in the ocean. Yeah, but again, I would like to invite you to this journey on microbes and the ocean. And this is a fantastic schematic of this paper from Raina 2018, emphasizing the life aquatic at the micro scale. And that phytoplankton and bacteria, you see them in this drop of water here. A drop of water here. They're really like in the middle of this picture and they're driving energy transfer in the water column, CO2 fluxes from the atmosphere into the water. Of course, through respiration, we are releasing CO2 again to the atmosphere. And we also know that microbes, once they're transferring organic matter, they add to the refiratory carbon pool in the ocean, which is, of course, a key. Course, you know, a key factor in regulating our climate, really. And we also, you know, we always talk, we are, you know, microbial oceanographers. We always talk about the biological pump, right? And you know all about this, but I still want to put this up here to emphasizing the key aspect of the biological pump, which are marine aggregates that we call marine snow. Again, here in the center of this schematic. Again, here in the center of this schematic, I'm very excited about this that all these things are in the center of these schematics. But quickly, a biological pump is the pathway, the biological pathway of atmospheric CO2 into the water and then the transport of this, the removal of the CO2 from the atmosphere towards deeper parts of the ocean. And of course, phytoplankton here plays a key role through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis. They produce dissolved organic matter. They're getting grazed upon heterotrophic bacteria, recycle the dissolved organic matter through the microbial loop. And at times, the biology, biological particles in the surface ocean, they tend to flocculate, aggregate, forming millimeter-sized sinking particles that we call marine snow. And this material is. And this material is laden off of freshly produced organic matter, and the sinking particles transport the organic carbon to deeper parts of the ocean, into the ocean's interior. Of course, during this transfer, this material gets remineralized by heterotrophic bacteria. But we know that, for example, in the North Atlantic during the spring bloom, the efficiency of this biological pumps. Efficiency of this biological pump. So, the material that gets transported and exported from the out of the airphoric zone can be very high, up to 50% of the net primary productivity can sink through marine snow, again, into the ocean's interior. And my work, I'm an experimentalist like Margaret, and I've been studying marine snow in the lab using roller tanks where marine snow forms to. Marine snow forms due to differential settling of particles and the stickiness of particles under non-turbulent conditions. So we make our own snow in the lab and then we study microbial processes attached to these particles. And in this case here in this paper, we measured the remineralization rates of organic carbon, which was orders of magnitude higher in the particles in the snow compared to the ambient tank water. Compared to the ambient tank water. But then in 2010, the deepwater horizon laws bill happened. And I was back then I was a postdoc at the University of North Carolina. And we went out there, we got funding. And, you know, we studied the area around the broken wetland and ground zero, we call it. And we actually saw these large particles, these large aggregates. Particles, these large aggregates, you know, first they were floating at the surface, but then, you know, gaining density and then sinking through the water column. And we quickly realized that this is some sort of marine snow and called the marine oil snow. And it turned out that this material is, these sinking aggregates were, you know, were rich of organic matter and also of hydrocarbons and oil. And we conducted Oil. And we conducted again, we conducted lab incubations with roller tanks. And we studied the microbial community of these aggregates. And we found out that these marine oil snow particles were hotspots for oil degrading bacteria, which of course meant that during sinking, these oil-degrading bacteria would further degrade hydrocarbons in these sinking aggregates and then release. know release this dissolved material into the into the water column and you know this is of course very important of the fate of oil I've been studying these oil aggregates again since 2010 and recently I was looking into the well you know a couple of years ago actually I was looking into the into the literature and found out that that marine snow may also play an important May also play an important role in the fate of microplastics in the ocean. So, that really got me interested in this concept. And this is when I started trying to get funding for some preliminary work that we've started last summer in my lab. So, really in the last, let's say, eight to 10 years or so, there have been some studies looking at marine snow, both in the lab as well as. In the lab, as well as in the field, and then collecting the material and looking at the content of microplastics. And there's even one very recent modeling study that was published in 2020 in Frontiers. And this group, they looked at the overall marine snow composition and concentration in the ocean and The ocean and compared that to the concentration of the microplastics in the surface, and concluded that marine snow can actually be a potential important export process, sinking marine snow can be an important export process of marine plastics in the ocean into deeper parts of the ocean. So, again, this all got me really interested, especially this one page. interested especially this one paper here in top of the you know top right um of long et al because that work was um to the best of my knowledge uh so far the only one that looked at sinking rates of marine snow with plastics and so um let me guide you through this paper uh real quickly um what they did was they used roller tanks like i do in the lab they formed marine snow with plastics they used um They used microplastic beads of two microns in size. They were fluorescents, so that enabled them to use flow cytometry, actually, to measure the amount of microplastic beads that were incorporated into snow particles from agrocultures. They measured the sinking of these aggregates in these sinking cylinders. And here in the middle are some of the results that they found. Found and yeah, sorry if that's a little bit too small, but I can guide you through this very quickly. On top, the upper panels, the other results, sinking velocity rate or sinking rates on the y-axis over the size of the particles on the x-axis. And the solid markers are the aggregates with the microbeads, and the open markers are the aggregates without the microbeads. The microbeads. And you can see that there is, well, first of all, in the first instance here, the first treatment, this is one of the cultures that they were looking at. They found a really nice plot or they found a really nice distribution here with size and sinking rates. Interestingly, the aggregates with the microplastics showed somewhat lower sinking velocities than those without microplastics, but only for the Microplastics, but only for this one case here. Then they looked at other cultures and they found different patterns. So, all of this is really interesting, and I thought it was fascinating and really sparked my interest, especially because I still had open questions after I finished reading and studying this paper. And, you know, some of them are about the aggregation and sinking behavior of larger microplastics on a millimeter scale. Microplastics, so on the millimeter scale, for example, again, they were you know looking at two micron fluorescent speeds here. So, what about larger particles? And then also what really you know, I realized when I read this paper, what they didn't do, and of course, this was probably hard to do with the two micron efflorescent speeds, they did not really compare the sinking rates of the plastics with the sinking rates of the plastics. With the sinking rates of the plastics once they're incorporated into marine snow. Because this is really what, I guess, what we are all really interested in. So, how does marine snow change the sinking rates of microplastics in the ocean? So, I came up with some major hypotheses for my work, for this first case study. We formulated that microplastics act as co-agrels. That microplastics act as coagulation kernels for algal cells in the ocean, accelerating the formation of plastic-containing marine snow. And we actually call those aggregates marine plastic snow maps. You know, we coined the term marine oil snow moss, and I'm trying to coin this term now, marine plastic snow maps. All right. The other one, incorporation into marine snow enhances sinking velocities of marine plastic snow. Velocities of marine plastics through the water column. So, again, this goes to the question: what happens? What's the difference between marine plastic sinking once they are incorporated into the snow particles? So last summer, we started this work. And this is a case study one. And we looked at interactions between phytoplankton, marine snow, and microplastics using post-consumer HTPE, five millimeter. Five millimeter squared particles. We basically used grocery bags and cut out these five millimeter squared particles and worked with three different phytoplankton cultures. They are isocrysis galatonema and Eumeana huxle. They're important for ocean productivity, important species. Now, in experiment one, this is a small. In experiment one, this is a small volume experiment. We used 50 milliliter centrifuge tubes to compare the aggregation and flocculation of these cells with and without the addition of the mycoplastics on a roller table for a week or so. We then moved over to the larger roller tanks over a liter to produce more aggregate. More aggregates for sinking velocity experiments, which is the second part of this study. So let me come to this in a minute. First, I would like to show you the results from our first experiment on the aggregation efficiency of these cells. So, interestingly, and I should say, I guess not really surprisingly, is that marine snow formed in all of the treatments with or without. With or without microplastics. So, and here are some examples, pictures of our tubes. You can see here, after the eight days, this is the final time point, you can see this flocculent material at the bottom of the tube that we call marine snow in both treatments. Down here, you see the microplastic pieces in red, and among this are the marine snow particles. particles. So we measured what we measured here is the aggregation efficiency over the eight days of incubation of these cells by means of optical density of the solution in the tubes. And what we found was that there was no measurable effect of the microplastics. The microplastics with respect to aggregation efficiency. So, this plot here on the y-axis is the aggregation efficiency in percent. And we have the treatments without microplastics and the treatments with microplastics. And I'm showing the mixed culture, I'm showing you the results of a mixed culture experiment and monoculture. And yes, they are species-specific responses. So, the mixed culture, they aggregated more efficiently. Aggregated, more efficient than the monoculture. But again, in both cases, with and without microplastic pieces. What we did find, however, was that in the tubes where we added the microplastic pieces, we found marine snow formation after 24 hours of the start of the incubation. Whereas in the treatments with the mycoplastics, those snow forms are formed. Those snow particles actually only formed at the end of the experiment, which is interesting. And it's an observation, and we're still working out the whys, why this happened. But I have some ideas here why this would happen the way it did. But yeah, so that was interesting. So then the second. Was interesting. So, then, the second part of this experiment, we moved over to the larger tanks, and like you can see here on the left side, the roller tank 1.5 liters in volume. And we made a lot of snow and actually three different parts of snow particles. So, in the treatment without marine plastic, we found these really nice, made these really nice marine snow particles here in the picture on the left. On the left. And then, what was interesting, when we added the microplastic particles, so some of the microplastic particles were covered with a thin biofilm here of the algal cells, you know, in the picture B. So we call those microplastic with cells. And then in the picture C, you see a nice marine snow particle that incorporated this red piece of plastic here. We call this marine snow. Plastic here. We call this marine plastic snow maps. So A, B, and C. And we did our sinking experiments in the cylinder. And this is the overall summary figure here of these sinking experiments. And what I would like you to realize is here that the plastic, I want to focus on the sinking of the plastic. Okay, so on the left down here, So, on the left, down here, we have the marine plastic. So, I should say, some of the plastic pieces weren't visually covered with any kind of biofilm from the algae. We looked under the microscope, they kind of stayed clean, so to speak. You know, I'm not talking about bacteria. They probably had, very likely, had bacterial biofilms, otherwise, they wouldn't have had these sinking velocities. But still, the algal cells didn't really. The alga cells didn't really cover it that well. But so, those are the plastic pieces without the cells. And here, up in the top right are the marine plastic snow particles. So, not surprisingly, they were larger, as you know you could have seen in the picture on the slide before that. And they also had higher sinking velocities. In fact, the sinking velocity doubled. Doubled compared to the quote-unquote naked marine plastic pieces. And then other things that you can see here, we had the marine plastic snow with the cells, and they had a huge, wide range of size and also some range of sinking velocities, which is another story. It's interesting too. And then the blue triangles here are. And then the blue triangles here are the marine snow particles without any plastics. And they weren't that big in particle diameter compared to the marine plastic snow, but they had on average somewhat of a higher sinking velocity, but you can see the arrow bars here. They kind of overlap. So that was sinking in an unstratified water column. And now we took this a step. We, you know, we took this a step further and we thought about stratification in the ocean. So, you know, again, if you think about sinking of marine particles, they often, especially in the coastal ocean, hit some sort of density layers during their transit through the water column. And we've done previous studies, actually when I was still back at UNC on marine snow, and we found some really nice patterns there. Some really nice patterns there with marine snow and microbes and how they interact with density layers in the ocean. So we conducted these experiments here as well in the Mandel lab at UNH and using a shadow graph system. So you can see here on the picture, and I don't want to go into much detail, we've talked about this earlier this week, how all of this works. Here, just some two. Here, just some two or two pictures of the sinking particles on the left zone. B is the microplastic particle sinking, and C is the marine snow particle, is a marine snow particle sinking. So we wanted to know what the effects are on water column stratification on vertical transport of marine plastics and the marine plastic snow. And I'm showing here the results. So there's a lot of, you know, a lot of information on this slide. You know, a lot of information on this slide, but on the left, you've the left is the left part of the slide are the sinking experiment sinking results that I've shown earlier. So, this is unstratified water. On the right, you see the weighted average sinking velocities in the stratified water column. So, we followed the particles through the density layer and all the way down to the bottom of the tank. And then we measured the time it took them to sink. The time it took them to sink through this space and calculated and weighted average sinking velocity. And what's really interesting to me anyway is that suddenly the marine plastic snow, you can see here, their sinking velocities, they go down all the way down to the level of the marine plastic, the naked marine plastic particles. And also the marine snow particle, by the way. Also, the marine snow particle, by the way. So, this really means that these particles, these porous aggregates, they spend more time at the density layer or getting through the density layer than the marine plastic, naked marine plastic particle. And so, this is, you know, this is really interesting to me anyway. So, that they kind of, if you think about stratified water columns, these two. Water columns, these two types of particles, they will have very similar sinking behaviors to the water column. All right, let me summarize this quickly. We formulated two hypotheses. First one was that microplastic act as coagulation currents for algae, accelerating the formation of marine plastic snow. And we found that algal cells aggregated more rapidly in the presence of More rapidly in the presence of marine plastics compared with non-plastic control. And we also showed that aggregation efficiency with and without marine plastics were comparable among the same other treatments. Second hypothesis: incorporation into marine snow enhances sinking velocities of microplastics through the water column. That's an interesting one because, you know, I Because I would say yes, in some instances. But we showed the effects of the stratification layer here. So marine plastics now were double the size and had two times higher average sinking velocities compared with the naked marine plastics in the unstratified layer. But then again, we've discussed the stratification issue. So, what are some of the conclusions here? Sorry. Here, sorry. That yes, marine snow may accelerate the downward flux of marine particles under certain conditions. But this might change if we look at stratified water columns. And something that I'm really interested in is also that the marine plastics, the formation and sinking, because they are so similar to marine snow, which are one of the major food sources for hyotrophic levels in the ocean center. Levels in the ocean's interior. These marine plastic cells may actually get incorporated, rapidly incorporated into food webs. And it could be a pathway of plastic into hyotrophic levels. All right, so the case study two, and this is, I'll go through this more rapidly because this is really, we don't have that many results yet on this. Many results yet on this work. So, we all know that photo oxidation is important with the fate of marine plastics. These plastic pieces leach DOC, and we're interested in how this DOC from the plastic may get incorporated into the microbial loop and general responses of these microbes. And we conducted bottle incubations, and this is. And this is new, I think, because we've done a system comparison. So we took samples from offshore Gulf of Maine, coastal water Gulf of Maine, and adjacent river. And so we're looking at these three different microbial communities and how they interact with the DOC. Because previous work has not done that yet, to the best of my knowledge. To the best of my knowledge, so our hypothesis here is that biodegradation rates of the DOC will differ among these three different systems. And again, some results here. This is the DOC from the plastic. The black dots here are the bottles where we added the plastic DOC. And you can see that we start out with about four to five times more DOC. With about four to five times more DOC in the water. And this DOC in the plastic bottles or the amended bottles decreases over time. And it, you know, compared to the unamended water, this DOC remained more or less on the same level. So we are concluding that this decrease in DOC is due to a Is due to microbial respiration of this material, and we have the bacterial cell counts in these bottles. You can see the blue triangles here, and yes, the number of bacterial cells, there was bacterial growth in these bottles and following, somehow inversely following the fate of DOC. Most of the DOC may actually be comprised of Be comprised of carboxylic acids, which make up fatty acids in the ocean. And there are just a few papers that looked at the composition of this material. And this is interesting to me also, because I'm very interested in patterns of microbial respiration, especially the rates of hydrolytic enzymes in these patterns. In these pathways. And as you can see here in this schematic, a bacterium, which is in the center of this picture, needs these ectoenzymes to break down polymers, which are shown as these pearl chains here, because they cannot take up these polymers directly. They can only take up one pearl at a time, so to speak. And so these enzymes, they are substrate-specific and And release these pearls from the chain for the bacterium to be taken up. So we were asking the question: can we detect some lipases here that are responsible for fatty acid degradation as an indicator for plastic DOC degradation? And the answer is no. It's not that easy. I was hoping it would be more straightforward, but you can see here, those are the results. And you can see here, those are the results of the light pace activities that we measured in the bottles. And the blue bars is the unamended seawater. And those rates were actually higher or at the same level compared to the orange bars. But there was some, you know, some peak here at the beginning of the experiment, and then these rates leveled off. Very similar to the fate of the DOC. But again, given the patterns that we found in the unimated seawater, it's really hard. We found in the unimated seawater, it's really hard to tell. We did some correlation analysis here, and again, you know, lipases, yes, they actually correlate in the amended sea water, but given the patterns that we found in the unimended seawater bottles, it's less conclusive. So, what we found, we applied a first-order First order decay model on the DOC panels that we found. And we came up with a number of 72% of this DOC is actually labile, which is a lot. You know, usually DOC from a phytoplankton bloom is only 50% labile or so. So 72% is a lot. So these critters, they are capable of chewing up all this DOC more or less. But what about the system comparison? I'm really excited. System comparison, I'm really excited to look at the open ocean results, you know, more oligotrophic, less nutrients, and less activity also. And then, and what does this elevated respiration of this extra DOC mean for the microbial loop? People have not looked into that to me, to the best of my knowledge, in a lot of detail. So, what about the consequences for nutrient cycling in oxygen? Nutrient cycling and oxygen because they are using up all this oxygen in the water. And it's interesting to follow up on this. So here are my acknowledgements for the first part, the sinking of the marine snow particles. I'd like to acknowledge two undergraduate students, excellent undergraduate students actually, from the University of Puerto Rico at Maya Guiz, who spent their summer last year at UNA. Who spent their summer last year at UNH, Astrid John Sepata de Jesus and Jubel von Pigam. And they are, they actually, so Astrid presented this work at AGU last fall, and Jubel will show a poster on this, um on this work at the Ocean Sciences meeting next week, actually. And both Tracy Mandel and I, we were mentors for these two students, and we worked on this together. For my DUC, For my DOC case study, I'm very thankful to Aaron Stubbins and his lab from Northeastern University here in Boston. And I would also like to acknowledge my funding sources, which is entirely internal so far. So I haven't really been successful with external funding yet on this research as the core initiative here at UNH and the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering. With that, With that, I would like to thank you all for your attention and bring an open postdoc position to your attention as well in my lab. It has a caveat though, it's funded by NSF and I can only support US students that graduated from minority-serving institutions, actually. So it's targeted to So it's targeted to this group of students. But anyway, if you know somebody who would be interested in working on marine plastic snow maps or other aspects of this exciting research, please contact me or if you have any other questions, use my email. I need to say that I won't be able to participate in the second half of our discussion later. So meet the meeting. The meet the speakers. Unfortunately, I have another appointment that I couldn't change, but I'll be in the first part of the discussion. So I'll stop sharing now and thank you for your attention. I hope I. Yeah. Well, how about the time? Was I? We've got six minutes for questions. It's okay. I actually have a question. It's okay. I actually have a question, so I'm because I'm in charge. I'm going to go first. So, you talked a lot about how you were interested in knowing whether marine snow affects the fate of microplastics settling. But I'm wondering, are people studying or interested or think that potentially microplastics could be affecting the rate of marine snow settling? So, like slowing down the biological pump by adding buoyancy. I that's a good point, actually. Point, actually. I don't think so. I don't think that people have looked into that. But this is an excellent point. Okay, because you showed that one of your marine snow with microplastic was larger than the regular marine snow, but also settled slower. Yeah, but there was on average. So it's, and you know, honestly, and I, you know, I didn't mention it, but. And I didn't mention it, but these results are only from a handful of aggregates. I think we have four to six aggregates per type. And given the error bars, I would say that they settled at a somewhat similar rate, which actually was surprising to me too, because we used pretty big plastic particles. And these particles, you know, natural marine snow is very porous. Natural marine snow is very porous. And if you incorporate these plastic sheets into your aggregate, you change the porosity of the sinking aggregate. But yeah, it wasn't measurable in these sinking experiments that we did. So that's why I focused a little bit more on the difference between the microplastic itself and the marine snow. Microplastic itself and the marine snow microplastic, and not that much between the marine snow. But it's definitely, you know, it's definitely worth thinking about this. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, let's go with Francois. Yes, thanks, Kai. That was a great talk. I had two questions, actually. One was, you mentioned that the marine snow with the plastics formed faster. Yeah. And we've been trying to model the formation of marine snow. Uh, model the formation of marine snow, too. So, I was wondering if you had any hypotheses as to why that would be the case. I think so. The plastic pieces, they are surfaces for the microbes, right? And I've done these experiments as a postdoc looking at mineral surfaces and bacterial attachment and the production of sticky exopolymers. And so, I think. And so I think that what happened here was that these plastic, once they get mixed into the culture with the diatoms and the bacteria, they were colonized by microbes that continue to producing exopolymers much faster than in the treatment without the microplastic, where there were no surfaces for these microbes to begin with. So, and if you have more exopolymers, unfortunately, we did not measure the exopolymers. Did not measure the exopolymers in the culture, in the experimental tank. But if you have more exopolymers, you accelerate the formation, there's a flocculation of the cells. So this is what I think happened. Okay, great. Thank you. And then my other question was just about the effect of stratification. If I understood correctly, what you did was going from one layer of constant density to another in a fairly sharp way. I was wondering if you'd. I was wondering if you thought that would also happen in a smoother density gradient, basically, if the effect would be similar if they were just like roughly constant density gradient instead of a transition from one to another. So you're saying if it's not stratified? No, if it's stratified, but if it's not so sharply stratified, the density is changing over a much longer length scale. Right, right, right, right. So actually, um, Right, right, right, right. So, actually, so I can tell you what we observe because I showed you the results from the stratification, but we have, I think, 31 PSU at the surface and then 37 at the bottom. We started out by doing freshwater zero and 37, and just to see if we can see anything. And so, the difference is there. The time, the residence time of these particles at the transition layer was substantially higher. I don't have the numbers in my head, but it was substantially higher in these more sharper transition. So I'd say, you know, if the resonance sum of these particles at the layer, you know, decreases with our two experiments, I would say, yes, it would go even down, but there would still be a lot of time. it would still it there would still be an effect uh visual um it is as you know if you if you want to if you want to set up those experiments it's actually um it's not so trivial to uh to produce these these these you know these uh stratified water columns so that's why we're exactly why i do simulations yeah exactly i understand so but you know my answer is yes um you'll definitely see some see a uh an effect but it would be less um But it would be less of an effect. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the great discussion. Kara, are you okay if you wait till the gather to ask your questions so we can. Yeah, I'm sorry that I went over time. Oh, it's great. It's really.
