So, I would have liked to be in Benff right now. I've never been there myself. So, maybe just for the sake of today, let's imagine that we are. So, it's a pleasure to be speaking here in Benff today. Apparently, this is Ben from the photo. As I said, I haven't been there myself. Right, so let's start by taking a step back at Taking a step back at modularity theorems that have been proved previously. So, as most of you will know, all elliptic curves over their rational numbers are modular. This was proved by Wiles for semi-stable elliptic curves and then extended by Broy, Connor, Diamond and Taylor in 2000 to all elliptic curves of irrationals. So, since then, the natural question was: can we extend this to elliptic curves? We extend this to elliptic curves over any number field, and there were some intermediate results for specific quadratic fields. When finally in 2015, there was a big breakthrough by Freitas, Lehung and Siksak, who proved that all elliptic curves over all real quadratic fields are in fact modular. And more recently, Dereks, Najman and Siksek proved the same thing over cubic fields. Over cubic fields. So, yeah, the obvious next question would be: how about quartic fields? And what I can say is that, well, maybe not for all quartic fields, but at least for all quartic fields that do not contain a square root of five, elliptic curves over these fields, totally real quartic fields, I must say, are modular. So, this is a project I've been working on for at least a year now. year now as a PhD student in Warwick supervised by Samir and I should also give credit to him for a lot of very useful conversations and many great ideas and insights that he's given me over this time so thanks for that Samir right so I want to sort of give an overview of how theorems like this are proved to start with so we'll start by consequence So we'll start by consequences of modularity lifting theorems. And really, so I'm going to, these are actually three theorems, and they almost prove modularity already over all totally real fields, but just not quite. So consider a totally real field K and an elliptic curve E over K, and let's assume that it's not modular. Then, and I think this first theorem was proved by Wilde. Theorem was proved by Wiles and others. The image of the Mod3 representation of this elliptic curve has to be contained in either a conjugate of the Borel subgroup at 3 or the normalizer of a split Cartan subgroup. At 5, we can say a similar thing. Under the assumption that the square root of 5 isn't in a field, the image of the Mock 5 representation is contained in a conjugate of the Borel subgroup. So there's only one choice. Group. So there's only one choice. And finally, if this algebraic number, zeta seven plus zeta seven inverse, this is an algebraic number of degree three, if that's not in our field, then the image of the mod 7 representation will be contained in a conjugate of either the Borel subgroup or an explicit index to subgroup of the normalizer of a non-split Cartan subgroup of GL2F7. At seven. So Jack Thorne proved the second theorem, and the final one was proved by Kayan Swami for the choice B7 or the normalizer of a non-split parton. And then Freydis, Lohungen-Siksek extended this to say, well, actually, in the case that you're in a normalizer of the non-split parton, you're already in an explicit index to subgroup of this. Okay, so as I said, this almost proves modularity. This almost proves modularity in the sense that analytic curve satisfying these conditions has to be very special. And the sense in which they're special can be sort of parametrized by modular curves. So these three properties are parametrized very nicely by modular curves, some of which we know. So suppose that we have a non-modular elliptic curve over a totally real field of any degree. Of any degree not containing these two algebraic numbers, then what this theorem says is that it gives rise to a k-rational point on one of four modular curves. So the first one is where the image of the mod 3 representation is contained in a conjugate of the Borel subgroup for both 3, 5, and for 7. And this B stands for Borel, and I'll denote this curve by XB3, B7. This curved by x b3 b5 b7. In fact, 3 times 5 times 7 is 105, and this curve is nothing but x0 105. Now, then there's the other option, at 3, that in fact at 3 we're contained in the normalizer of a spit carton. And I'll denote this by an s. Josh I not sure so these are the four options now while's already um sort of a similar thing uh for for for him he was he was looking at rational points and so it sufficed for him to work with sort of simple Suffice for him to work with sort of simple modular curves here. So, for example, he had to look, I think, at x015, which is an elliptic curve with a finite Modav√© group. So, finding the rational points was not the most difficult part of his work. But in our case, we have to find all the points over all the quartic fields on these curves. And in order to be able to have only finitely many quartic points, for example, you need the curves to be complicated, hygiene. To be complicated, hygienus. And then, of course, that complicates computations. So, that is sort of the challenge of questions like this. So, from now on, we're going to try and think about quartic points on these curves. Okay, so let's give you sort of an overview of the work involved first. So, I won't be speaking very much about the first two curves. So, recall the first one was X0 105. This is genus 30. This is genus 13, and the second one has genus 21. So, finding the quartic points on these curves was certainly a computational challenge and quite a lot of work, but the methods involved were fairly elementary in a sense, which is why I think for today it will be more interesting to focus on the final two curves. So, where we have the E7 component at the prime seven. At the prime 7. So, in fact, what we study, mainly we study the curve xb5e7. So, we forget about the component at the prime 3. So, a quartic point on these two big curves on the left will always map down to a quartic point on XP5, E7. So, it will be interesting to study. It suffices to study the quartic points on that. And to study these, actually, it turns out that I needed sort of two new ingredients. Needed sort of two new ingredients which might be interesting in their own right as well. So there is this curve xb5NS7, where NS now stands for non-split, normalizer of a non-split carton. And so this is a degree two quotient of the B5E7 curve. Just to go back to part three, so because this corresponds to an index. This corresponds to an index to subgroup of a normalizer of the non-split cartel. So, one of the things that is useful is to study the quartic points also on this further quotient curve, which is what I did. And to study these, I used a general, I call it a generalized relative symmetric Chaboty method. So, a Chaboty's method is classically a method for computing rational points on curves in certain situations, but it can also be used to compute. But it can also be used to compute all points of a certain degree and also relative to a map. However, for quartic points, so I should say that this was developed by Semya Siksak in 2009. For quartic points, this didn't quite work. And it turns out we needed sort of a generalized version of this that can deal with quartic points in a better way. And this is part of ongoing joint work with Stefan Gajevich and. With Stefan Gaiavich and Pip Gutman, that we're trying to see how general we can make this relative symmetric shabby. But certainly general enough to work for this curve B5NS7. So this is one sort of interesting thing. And then the second ingredient is that we need a method to compute modular forms for general congruent subgroups. So this, for example, this curve XB5E7, the corresponding congruence subgroup is. The corresponding congruent subgroup is quite nasty in a way. For example, it doesn't have the space modular forms, it doesn't have an action of the HECA operators on it. So sort of standard methods for computing the modular forms don't work. So while I was working on this, Zawina published a paper, at least put it on the archive, where he does this exact thing by computing. Exact thing by computing pseudo-eigenvalues for Edkinlaner operators. But I've done it in a different way. Because what do you do when you're in Warwick and you need to do a computation with modular forms? Well, then you go and ask John Cremona. So that's what I did. And John actually had some ideas and he'd even thought about this sort of thing before. And we managed to make this work using modular symbols. make this work using modular symbols. So it's sort of the same idea that the same method that works for computing modular forms on gamma naught of n doesn't just translate to any congruent subgroup, but with some adjustments we could make it work. And in fact I think this works for any congruent subgroup. And also in certain situations, especially in mine, I think it probably also is a bit faster than some. Is it a bit faster than Sardina's algorithm? All right, so in the next part, let me sort of try and tell you a little bit about how these two ingredients sort of where they're needed. Okay, first maybe, if you haven't seen this before, you might be wondering, well, how does one study How does one study all of the quartic points at once on a curve? It seems a bit magical when you haven't seen this trick. So here's the trick. We consider a curve x, and we consider instead its fourth symmetric power, which I'll denote by a four in brackets here in the top, and the rational points on this four-dimensional variety. So we can think of them as four sets of points in X. As four sets of points in X, but maybe more convenient is thinking of them as effective divisors of degree four. And the rational points are the divisors of these forms. So we could have a sum of four rational points on X. We could have on the bottom here, we could have a quartic point on X and then all of its Galois conjugates, or any combination of lower degree points, as long as the combination is fixed by the absolute Galois group. So, in particular, this allows us to study the quartic points, and we sort of get the rest for free, the lower-degree points here. Well, still, this is a four-dimensional variety, but the way we study it is actually the same as we study rational points on the curve. So, if we fix a degree four divisor D naught, then we can make this sort of able-Jacobi map by mapping our effective degree four divisor to the class. Effective degree four divisor to the class of the difference with d0. We get a map to the Mordawei group of the curve X. And any method that which we use to study rational points by studying the Mordawe group of the curve can also be used to study the rational points on this fourth symmetric power. And this is very useful. And so for all of the curves that all of these four curves that I need to study, this will be the starting point. Will be the starting point. All right. So, first, let me now define Etkin-Lehner involutions. So, these involutions will be very important for me because they exist on all of these curves that I've been studying. So, on the modular curve, so if we have Borel at Q, but we have a modular curve. Uh, but we have a modular curve that might have some other level structures at primes different from the prime defining Q, then this curve will have an Etkin-Laner involution, WQ, which given an elliptic curve E and a subgroup E of order Q, what it does is it maps it to E mod H and then the Q torsion of E, modula the subgroup as new subgroup. As new subgroup, and then the prime to q torsion, sorry, the prime to q level structures is transported along this isogeny. And so this w of q gives us a map defined of the rational numbers on a modular curve like this. And this is an involution. So applying it twice, we get the identity. Okay. So now I'd like to look at this curve XB5E7, which will be very Which will be very important for us. So, recall that this E7 corresponded to an index 2 subgroup of the normalizer of a non-split carton. And we obtain a diagram like this. So, on the top here, we have XB5E7. This is a curve of genus 15. And then on the left, we have XB5NS. We have XB5NS7, which I've mentioned before, and this is a degree 2 map between them because the index between the subgroups is 2. And this B5 NS7 is genus 6, and its model wave group has rank 2. And then on this curve, we have an Atkin-Lanier involution, W5, and we can take the quotient by that, and we get another degree 2 map to a curve that I'll call C. And this is hyper elliptic of genus 2. And this is hyperolytic of genus 2, and the model group also has rank 2. Okay, so then on the right, we have a genus 5 curve X, which is the quotient of the top curve by Etkin Lehner. And then we have the middle curve. And so this, recall this map on the top left from E7 to NS7 has degree 2. And so it has to be a quotient by some involution. And if we call this phi 7, then this... 57, then this influx of 57 commutes with the edge container, and so we can take its product and take the quotient by that. And that gives us x1, and this is a curve of genus 8. So this is a nice diagram that we get. All right, so now what I'd like to do is study this curve on the left, xb5, and s7, and in particular the quartic points on it. Right, so I'll call it x for now. Right, so I'll call it X for now, because it's convenient. And the idea will be to apply this Chabotis method. So recall we have this degree 2 map to C, quotient by Edkin Lehner. I'll call it rho. C is hyperliptic of genus 2, and both of the Morda Vais groups of X and C have rank 2, so they're infinite. Now, C being hyperliptic and also having infinite Morda Vais group means it has many quadratic points. many quadratic points. And all these quadratic points, well, in fact, infinitely many for multiple reasons. And all of these will pull back to quartic points on X. So X will have infinitely many points of degree 4. So this might look like a problem. On the other hand, if we study, for example, XB5E7, this has genus 15, and it really is too big to study computationally. But we can sort of work around this. Can sort of work around this. So, if we look at the rational points on the fourth symmetric power, and so in there we have this infinite set of pullbacks of degree two effective devices on C, because the quadratic points on C were infinite. And then we have a finite set consisting of pullbacks of rational points on C and also rational effective degree two divisions on X. So, if we look at what's left here, then this set is in fact. Then this set is in fact finite, and we can compute it explicitly. And we find that each of its points are defined over a field that either contains square root of five or isn't totally real. So the way we compute this is using this generalized relative symmetric Shadowty method that I'm developing with Pip, Gutmann, and Stefan Gaijovich. Okay, so this is quite nice. So there is this interesting. So, so this is quite nice. So, there is this infinite set in here in the sort of the quartic points, but the rest is finite. So, how are we going to use this? Well, maybe first let me just remark for those of you who know, the reason this works is because six minus two is at least four, six being the genus of the curve, two the rank of the model weight group, and four the degree of the point. I think you faded out there again, Joshua. Okay, so why is this useful? So it's useful because of the following key lemma that I'd like to go through quickly. Your sound dropped out for a couple of seconds there. Okay, is it still there? Now, now you are, but we missed the last bit of your last slide. Okay, so I'll go back to this slide. Thank you very much, Niels. So let's see. So what I was saying is that I was explaining this theorem. So we can compute the quartic points on this curve, the degree force. This curve. The degree four effective divisors that aren't the pullback from a degree two effective divisor on C. So this is an infinite set, and if we exclude this infinite set, there are finitely many points left. And we can compute those explicitly using this generalized Chabotis method. Okay, and those are all defined over a field that doesn't contain root five, that contains root five or isn't totally real. Is my sound still okay? Totally real. Is my sound still okay? You're good. Okay, thank you. And what I was saying is this works essentially because six minus two is at least four. And six being the genus for the curve to the rank of the Modern group. And for the degree of the points we're looking for. This is a condition of Chaboty's method. And sort of the realization of me realizing that this inequality held. That this inequality held was sort of the starting point of this project when I thought maybe there's something possible here. Okay, so why is this useful? It's because of this key lemma. So suppose that we have a curve x over the rationals, and we have two commuting involutions, v and w. Then we get a diagram like this. We can look at the quotients. And now suppose we start with the point P on the top curve, x then. On the top curve x that is of degree 4, but on the very bottom it has lower degree, so it's defined over a rational or quadratic field. Then, in fact, this point has to map into a quadratic point. So the image has to be quadratic or rational on one of the three intermediate curves already. And this is going to be quite, this is a simple lemma, but this will be quite important for us. So here's the So, here's the diagram again that we looked at before on the top XP5E7. So, we want to study the quartic points on this top curve. And what we've just shown is that we can assume that the image in the bottom curve is quadratic. So, what this lemma says is, well, in that case, the image has to be quadratic on one of the three intermediate curves. However, the left-hand curve corrects. However, the left-hand curve parametrizes elliptic curves with some level structure, and elliptic curves of a totally real quadratic field are already known to be modular. So we can forget about that one and focus on this X1 and X2. Now for the left-hand curve, B5 and S7, when we did shabble T on that, when we studied this quartic point, we made use of a nice planar model that was computed by Le Hung and Derek's Neussman and Sigsack. And there it's Najman and Sigsec. But for X1 and X2, we don't have a model like this. And so, also, we don't have knowledge of the rank that we did for the left-hand curve. And really, we can't use the same trick as we did for that. So, we really sort of need a, I mean, in order to study the quadratic points, the starting point will be a model, like equations for the curve. And a priori, we don't have them. And so, for that, what we need to do is compute modular forms and obtain a canonical model via this modular symbols approach that I developed with the help of John. And it's important that we get a canonical model because the modular forms will help us in Chaboty's method as well as differentials. So, these modular forms were not defined over the rationals, but the curve. But the curves, as we already knew before, they were defined out of the rations. Okay, now this model and these modular forms can be used to study the quadratic points on both of these curves using Chavoti's method. That alone is not enough because we don't have enough knowledge of the Mordave groups of these curves. But using, so recall we haven't yet used the information at the prime three. And using this extra information that And using this extra information that we are Borel or Split Cartan at three, we can sort of speed up our sort of improve this study of the quadratic points and finally decide, so this works. And we find no exceptional quadratic points on X1 and X2. So I say exceptional because the bottom curve C has six rational points, and they come from six quadratic points on X1 and X2, but there are no others. Are there no others? All right, and so that works, and that was the final piece of the puzzle. So, yeah, thank you all for listening.
