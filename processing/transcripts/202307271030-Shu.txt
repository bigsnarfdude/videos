Invitation. It is really my great pleasure to speak here. So, today I'm going to discuss my ongoing work with Jose Carrillo on the interaction energy minimizers on bonded domains. So, at the beginning, let me first introduce the problem we are going to study. So, we studied this interaction energy function, which is Energy functional, which is a functional on some probability measure rho here. So here we restrict on a bounded connected open region in R D, which is denoted as capital D here. So then in our energy function, we have two terms. The first term is an interaction energy term, which is quadratic in rho. Row. So you can imagine that suppose we are dealing with an unparticle system, then you have a pairwise interaction potential, which is W here. If you take rho as the empirical measure of those n particles, then this is just the total interaction energy. And if you send the number of particles goes to infinity and get to a continuum model, then this is. Continuum model, then this is what you'll see for the interaction energy. And also, we allow the possibility of some external potential, which is denoted as capital U here. So in the literature, people have studied the interaction energy on the whole space in a lot of references. So our focus here is this bounded domain. So instead of putting the Rd here, Of putting the Rd here and allow row to be anywhere in Rd, we only allow it to be supported in a bounded domain. And here, although we denoted this D as an open region, when we consider the support of rho, we have to allow the rho to be supported on the closure of D. So later we will see this is to guarantee the existence of energy minimizer because the closure of D will become The closure of D will be compact. Okay, so I see in this conference, most talks are about time-dependent problem, and my talk will be just on a steady-state problem, which is energy minimizer. So, I think maybe let me just say a little bit about the connection between time-dependent problems and the energy minimizers. The energy minimizers. So, in collective dynamics, there are a lot of models which have an energy function which is monotonic in time. For example, there are many models which are what are signed to gradient flows of some energy function. For example, if you take this interaction energy and consider at least formally. And consider at least formally the weather sine 2 gradient flow, then what you get is the aggregation equation. And there are also some other examples. So if one wants to understand the long-time behavior of such an energy distributive model, since the energy is monotonically decreasing, then at least intuitively one expects that the density row will converge to some energy minimizer. Energy minimizer. So, if you want to understand the long-term dynamics, I think to understand the energy minimizer is maybe the first step to do. So, and also another reason to study the interaction energy minimizer is that although this energy function looks very simple, there are indeed a lot of phenomena to discover for energy minimizers. For energy minimizers. Then let me discuss the basic assumptions on our energy functional. So many of those are very similar to those assumptions people have studied for the whole Swiss energy minimizers. For example, for the interaction potential W, I think the minimal assumption are locally integrable bonded from below and lower semi-continuous. Continuous and for just for convenience, we just assume the external potential u to be continuous. So, under these assumptions, a standard argument will tell you the existence of energy minimizers because here under this assumptions on W, one can show that this energy function is actually lower semi-continuous with respect to the weak convergence. The weak convergence. So if you take a minimizing sequence and then take out a weakly convergent sub-sequence, you can show that this sub-sequence will convert to an energy minimizer. That's very similar to the case of the whole space, and even easier because here the domain is compact. So we don't have a possibility of escaping to infinity for this minimizing. Infinity for this minimizing sequence. Okay, so that's the existence which is very straightforward. And for the uniqueness, let me just say a little bit. The uniqueness of energy minimizer, sometimes it is true, sometimes it is not. So one can guarantee uniqueness if you have certain convexity assumptions, which is called linear interpolation convexity for this quadratic part. Quadratic part of the energy function. So I think later I will say a little bit more about the uniqueness. But anyway, that's not the main focus of today's talk. Okay, so now comes the question. All this kind of existence and uniqueness problems for bounded domain is very similar to that of the whole space energy minimizers. So today, let me focus on something which is Today, let me focus on something which is slightly different from the whole space case. So, before that, let me give you a brief literature review. There have been so many papers on the whole space energy minimizer so that I cannot give a full list here. So let me just give some previous literature here about bonded domain energy minimizers. So, the work of Bernhoff and Topaz in 2000. And Topaz in 2011 and Federico Kokchik in 2017 studied some special cases of bounded domain energy minimizers. In particular, they have studied the Newtonian repulsion together with some confining potential and also the Morse potential on the half space. So that's a little bit different because the half space is not compact. Half space is not compact. But there is one phenomenon which is the same as our bounded energy minimizer: that they have already observed numerically and also proved by constructing explicit examples that concentration of mass on the boundary can happen. So, in particular, that means although the boundary has a lower dimension than the whole space, there can be a positive amount of mass. Be a positive amount of mass concentrating on the boundary. So that's one very particular feature of bounded domain energy minimizers. There is also a work by Messenger and Federico in 2020, which studies the same interaction energy, but together with an entropy term. And people have also studied time-dependent problems about those interaction energy unbounded domains. Interaction energy on bounded domains. The work of Federico, Huang, Messenger, and Sun in 2018 studied the corresponding aggregation equation. And they can start with entropy term and then take a zero diffusion limit to obtain the well-posedness of the aggregation equation on the bounded domain. And let me also mention some works which are on aggregation. Which are on aggregation models on manifolds. So that's very closely related to our boundary domain energy minimizers. So on one hand, both restricting on bounded domains and on manifolds are just some kind of external restriction of the probability measure, and both of them can be approximated by some sequence of confining potentials. Sequence of confining potentials. And on the other hand, you will see that for some situations, if you consider a bounded domain minimizer, you can prove that mass has to concentrate on boundary. And the boundary, for most cases, turns out to be a manifold. So that somehow our boundary domain minimizers can be transformed into a minimizer on manifolds. Okay, so the main. Okay, so the main question I'm going to discuss today is: how does the singularity of the interaction potential affect the mass concentration on the boundary? Okay, so previously the concentration of mass on the boundary has already been observed. So now the question is: how can we decide when does such concentration appear? Up here. So let me show you the following numerical simulation, which is a particle gradient flow simulation. And when you take the particle to be a lot of particles, then you can actually see more or less whether you have a concentration on boundary for a continuum energy minimizer. So here we take a 2D case and we take the We take the bounded domain as an ellipse. So the interaction potential is purely repulsive and it is a power law potential with power equal to b. And we also put an external potential which is quadratic and the center is at the point minus one zero which is here. Okay, so then we take different singularity power b here. Singularity power b here. Recalls that in two dimensions, the case b equals zero, the logarithmic potential is the Newtonian interaction potential. So if you take the repulsion to be less singular than Newtonian, you see that there are a lot of particles lying on the boundary, and there is even a gap between those boundary particles and the interior particles. Particles and interior particles. So, this is a very clear indication that in the continuum minimizer, there will be a positive amount of mass concentrating on the boundary. And if you look at the Newtonian case, the boundary behavior is pretty much the same, although we no longer have the gap. And this is actually the Newtonian case is actually what previous works have considered. They showed that there can be a concentration. A concentration of boundary. However, when you go to the case of more singular than Newtonian, the situation becomes a little bit different. You see that when you get closer and closer to the boundary, the density of the particles becomes larger and larger. Although in the particle model, sees a lot of particles on the boundary. It is not really clear. It is not really clear whether this amount of particles will stay at a positive level when you make the number of particles larger and larger. So to further investigate this numerical phenomena about whether this has a concentration on boundary, what we do is the following: we take different number of particles from small to large. From small to large. And then we counted the proportion of boundary particles. So for the less singular than Newtonian case, you see that this proportion of boundary particles almost stay the same. So then it's reasonable to believe that if you send the number of particles goes to infinity, this will still be a positive level. So that this is the amount of mass on the boundary. On the boundary for a continuum energy minimizer. However, if you look at the more singular than Newtonian case, when you increase the number of particles, the proportion of boundary particles decreases a lot. So then it's very reasonable to believe that if you further increase and this will further decrease and maybe it converges to zero. So even Even if you see a lot of particles on the boundary, it may still happen that in the continuum model, you don't have any mass concentrating on the boundary. It is just this higher density is just because you have a continuum density, but it is very high near the boundary. Okay, so see, there's also numerical evidence. There has been some numerical evidence, but not convincing enough. So that's why we still need. Up. So that's why we still need a very careful theoretical study. So now let me just outline our main result. And I think it is helpful if we compare with some previous results on the regularity of whole space energy minimizers. So people have known that the behavior of the energy minimizer has a lot of relation with the singularity power. With the singularity power of the repulsion of the interaction potential. In particular, if you assume that the interaction potential is almost power law with power equal to b, then to make it integrable, b has to be greater than negative the dimension. And we will focus on the case where b is less than 2 because for larger values of b, it is known that very likely. Very likely the energy minimizer will just be a few Dirac measures. So, for the case of more singular than Newtonian, that is when the power is smaller than 2 minus D, the work by Carrillo Delgadino-Malette in 2015 showed that the whole space energy minimizers are holder continuous, so they have pretty good regularity. Good regularity and at 2 minus t, the Newtonian, a well-known example is Newtonian with quadratic confinement. Then the energy minimizer is a characteristic of a ball. So in particular, it has discontinuities. And this is a typical situation of the Newtonian case. And once you pass the Newtonian and go to less singular than Newtonian potentials, then in principle, In principle, the support of the energy minimizer may collapse onto a lower dimensional set. And this is indeed the case. For example, for 2D energy minimizers, there are examples which are like a one-dimensional Dirac ring. So an important result on this range is by Balak, Carrillo, Laurent, and Rao in. Laurent and Rao in 2013, they gave a lower bound on the host of dimension of the support. The lower bound is 2 minus b. That means when you just pass the 2 minus d the Newtonian, the dimension can only be a little bit smaller than the whole space dimension. But when you get close to b equals to 2, then the dimension can be got close to 0. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that's the behavior of the whole space and remaining matters. So, our results, bounded domain remaining matters, have two parts. The first part is when you have more single-than-Newtonian potential, what we can prove is you cannot have any mass concentration on the boundary. This is kind of reasonable because you have observed from here that when you have more singular. When you have more singular interaction potentials, the minimizer tends to be more regular. So, here, when you have very singular interaction potentials, then concentrating on boundary is kind of a singular behavior. So, it's reasonable to see that when you have very singular interaction potential, no mass concentrates on the boundary. So, this is pretty much not really the same as the whole continuity result because. Continuity result because we have some explicit examples. I will show you that even if the minimizer can be holder continuous sometimes in the interior, the holder norm can blow up near the boundary. So this is like this situation. You have the density getting larger and larger. Actually, in our explicit example, we can show that the density goes to infinity near the boundary. So that this continuity, we don't know whether it is true. Continuity: We don't know whether it is true in the interior of the domain, but at least it is not true on the whole domain. Okay, so that's the more singular case we can prove no concentration on boundary. And then for the Newtonian or less singular case, under reasonable assumptions, we can prove that some mass has to concentrate on the boundary. So, compare with the whole space energy minimal result of this. Space energy minimal result: this also gives something interesting. For example, if you consider the range of b between 2 minus d and 3 minus d, that actually tells you the host of dimension is greater than d minus 1. So the dimension can drop by at least at most a fractional amount less than 1. However, if we know that for bounded domain, many matters. That for bounded domain, many matter, some mass has to concentrate on boundary. The boundary has a dimension d minus one. So that means the bounded domain minimizer can actually break the whole staff dimension lower bound for the whole space mini matter. This lower bound is no longer true for bounded domain minimizers. So, from this, you can see that for both cases, by By adding this bonded domain constraint for interaction energy, the regularity behavior of the energy minimizer can actually change a lot. So this boundary domain constraint has really a significant impact on the behavior of energy minimizers. Okay, so in the rest of the talk, I'm going to discuss our main results together with a sketch of There is a sketch of proof. So, first, I'm going to do the Newtonian or less singular case in which we want to prove a concentration of mass on the boundary. Okay, so the first question is, what are the reasonable assumptions? Because suppose you consider an interaction potential which is repulsive at short distance, but attractive at a large distance. At a large distance. Or if you consider a confining potential, then even if you do that on the whole space, you have some energy minimizer which is compactly supported. And if that fits into the domain, then that whole space minimizer will also be the bounded domain minimizer. Then it can just stay away from the boundary. So those attraction or confining potential can drive. finding potential can drive the mass away from the boundary. So if we want to prove something about concentration of boundary, we'd better avoid those things. So we focus on purely repulsive interaction potentials. By purely repulsive, I mean we first assume the potential interaction potential is radial and C1 away from zero. We have to do away from zero because we need to allow singularity at the origin. Singularity at the origin. And also, the gradient of the potential is always pointing inward. So, this is a purely repulsive interaction potential. And in particular, one case we really care about is the smooth perturbation of power laws. So, I will use this shorthand notation of a power law repulsion with power B together. With power b together with a perturbation of class CK, and at the same time, I'm going to assume the external potential is also CK. Okay, so now let me first discuss the one-dimensional result because the proof is relatively easier. So, in one dimension, we take no external potential and we assume the interaction potential purely repulsive. Action potential purely repulsive and leap shit, then we can show that any minimizer has to have a concentration on boundary in the sense that the mass on the boundary is strictly positive. Okay, so if you think about perturbation of power loss, then if you take the singularity power to be between one and two, then this Lipschitz assumption is actually satisfied. Assumption is actually satisfied. So that's exactly Newtonian or less singular potentials. One other thing I need to mention here is that even if here we can guarantee some mass is on the boundary, it is not guaranteed that all mass has to be on the boundary. And actually, we have some examples showing that even under those nice assumptions, it can still happen that. It can still happen that some mass is on the boundary and some mass is in the interior. Okay, so to prove this result, actually all our results in this talk, the key tool we are going to use is the Euler-Lagrange condition. So for simplicity, I'm only going to formulate the Euler-Lagrange condition with the extra assumption that the channel extra assumption that the generated potential W convolved rho plus u is continuous. So to treat the more general case, we have to use a lot of modification arguments. Okay, so suppose this generated potential is continuous, then the Euler-Lagrange condition is actually a necessary condition for rho being an energy minimizer. This condition says that the generated potential has to be a constant on the support of rho. A constant on the supporter row denoted as C naught, and the generated potential has to be greater than or equal to C naught on the whole domain. So for bounded domain minimizers, we only care about the generated potential on the domain, whatever outside is not important to us. So this Euler Lagrange condition is very intuitive because if you have somewhere the generated potential is very small and Generated potential is very small and unsupported, the generated potential is large. Then you just take a little bit of the mass where the generated potential is large, you move that to another location where the potential is small. You can show that if the amount of mass is small enough, then you necessarily decrease the total energy. So that's why we have this necessary condition for energy minimizer. And you can see here that suppose we have enough regular energy, let's say if Legality: Let's say if the generated potential is C1, then we can take a gradient to see that the gradient of the generated potential, that's actually the total force, has to be equal to zero on the support. Okay, so another fact I'm going to mention here is that if one have the linear interpolation convexity, then this Euler-Lagrange condition is also a sufficient condition for the energy minimizer. Condition for the energy minimizer. So, here let me explain a little bit. The linear interpolation convexity just means that if we take two different probability measures and we do a linear interpolation, we want to require that this energy function along the linear interpolation is always convex. And this will simply imply that the energy minimizer is the energy minimizer. The energy minimizer is unique. And this concept on bounded domain and on whole space are slightly different because on the whole space, if you just consider the interaction energy, there is a translation invariance. So we basically only need to require that the energy is positive if we put in a signed measure with zero mass and zero center of mass. With zero first-order moment. However, here, when we put either a bounded domain or an external potential, then this breaks the translation invariance. That means you have to require that for all zero mass sign measure, which is a little bit stronger than the linear integral convexity on the whole space. Okay, so now let's prove our 1D theorem about the concentration. About the concentration of boundary. So, of course, we can assume the domain is just the unity interval, and a very simple argument will tell you there cannot be a vacuum near the boundary. You cannot have zero to epsilon being vacuum. So then we do a proof by contradiction. Suppose there is no Dirac mass, no concentration at this boundary point zero. Then we consider the total force which The total force, which is gradient W convolved rho at x equals to epsilon, where epsilon is some small number to be chosen. And we choose this point to be inside the support. Okay, so the total force at this point has two parts: one coming from the right, one coming from the left. Okay, so we have a purely repulsive interaction. That means Interaction. That means for any force coming from the right, it is pushing towards the left. And since you have a lot of mass here and the purely repulsive assumption is actually effective, this pushing force is actually of size order one. However, when you look at the force coming from the left, which is generally pushing this point towards the right, Since we don't allow any direct mass at zero, if you shrink the epsilon, the amount of mass in the interval zero to epsilon will convert to zero as epsilon goes to zero. We can make that arbitrarily small. And W is Lipschitz. So gradient W is in R infinity. So if the total mass here is small, the total force it can produce is also small. So you have one other one towards the left and another. Left and another small force towards the right, that means the force at this epsilon cannot be balanced if the epsilon is small enough. And that leads to a contradiction with the Euler-Lagrange condition in the gradient form. Okay, so this proof is pretty short. And then let me come to the multi-dimensional result about the concentration of boundary. Again, we are seeing. Concentration on boundary again. We assume the external potential equal to zero and the purely repulsive interaction potential. Now we assume a stronger assumption that we are indeed dealing with a smooth perturbation of a power law with Newtonian or less singular. Then we can prove the same result. Okay, so when do we need this extra assumption? Now we can only deal with perturbation. Only deal with perturbation of power laws. This is because the power law has a nice Laplacian structure. The Laplacian power law is still a power law. And if you only do a smooth perturbation here, it was C2 perturbation on the power law potential, then it will not change the singularity structure of the Laplacian W near zero. And this is very important to our proof. Although this Although this is the same singularity structure near zero, this perturbation can actually be perfectly large in the C2 norm. So if you're away from the origin, then we don't have any restriction on the Laplacian W. In particular, we allow it to transign. Actually, if we assume a stronger global assumption that the Laplacian is always negative. Is always negative everywhere, then we can prove a stronger result that all mass has to concentrate on boundaries. This is a very simple argument because the generated potential W convolved rule has negative Laplacian, so it is a subharmonic function, and we can apply maximum principal arguments. But generally speaking, if we don't know the sign of Laplacian W, then this is a trickier problem. Okay, so Okay, so if you try to mimic the 1D proof, if the power turns out to be between 1 and 2, then basically the same 1D proof will work. But the problem is when you have higher dimensions, then being Newtonian or less singular actually allows more and more singularity as dimension grows. And when we are dealing with a singular potential, then this argument by using the Lipschitz property. By using the Lipschitz property of W cannot work directly, you have to do some modification on that. So, in the most general case, our proof starts from a Moray estimate of the energy minimizer inside the domain. So, a Moray estimate just means, okay, for any ball of radius epsilon, if you consider the mass in this ball, it is bounded by epsilon to a certain power. Epsilon to certain power. And here I have to mention that this Moray estimate only works for the mass inside the domain. For the mass on the boundary, this doesn't work. Okay, so this is where we use the singularity structure of Laplacian W. It is a negative power law of power b minus two. So suppose you have too much mass. Too much mass in the interior concentrating in a ball of radius epsilon. Then the singularity of Laplacian W tells you that inside this whole ball bx epsilon, the Laplacian of W convolved rho has to be very negative. And the C2 perturbation on the W will not change this fact because it only gives order one contribution. So if you have the subharmonic generated potential in this Harmonic generated potential in this ball, then this will cause some trouble with the Euler-Lagrange condition with the maximal principal arguments. Okay, so then one consequence of this Moray estimate is that based on this, we can prove the generate potential is C1 because inside the domain, if you are taking a point inside the domain, Taking a point inside the domain if you consider W convolved row but with row part inside the domain, then you use the Moray estimate and the boundary is away from that, so it will not change the regularity. So then we get the C1 property that allows us to at least computing the forcing gradient W convert rule as in the 1D case. Okay, so then we need to do a very similar To do a very similar calculation. So, here we still do a proof by contradiction and we assume no masses on the boundary. And for one direction, for one direction, say x1, we look at the lowest point in the support, and we can show that this has to be on the boundary. We say this is our region, and we can take a very close, we can take. We can take some point very close to here, which is in the support row, and we calculate the force very carefully at this point and try to derive a contradiction. Again, for all the mass coming from upward, this gives an order one force downwards. So we just need to prove that for this thin layer below this point, you can only provide a very small force upwards so that we can get a contradiction. Words so that we can get a contradiction. So, to analyze the force coming from this layer, in principle, this layer can still have order one mass. We have to be very careful. First of all, we cut into two parts. One part is inside the ball centered at this point x star of radius, the same order as the thickness of the layer required, capital R here. So, inside here, since the force is, since the interaction for the Fourth is since the interaction potential is singular, we have to be very careful because if you have very small amount of mass near the X star, if the close, the distance is close enough, you can still have a very large force. And also here, the force is very effective upwards because if you're here, it can even be vertical. Okay, so now we calculate the generated potential. I mean, Potential, I mean, the force dot with the E1 direction, then this is what we get. And then you see the similarity is almost b minus one, because we have x1 here and b minus two here. Then what we can do is we do a dielectric decomposition along the radial direction. And in each layer, it is just a small ball. We know that from the Moray estimate, on a small ball, there cannot be too much. Small ball, there cannot be too much mass here. Then this will tell you: okay, if you just have a little bit of mass in this layer, then it can only provide a very small pushing off course. And then we just do a dielectric sun. And for the outside the blue region, the mass can be large. However, the force is However, the force is not very effective because if you're coming from far away in this layer, the force at this x star is almost horizontal. That means here, this x1 is much less than the norm of x. So it's better to estimate this x1 just by this r instead of estimate by the norm of x. And we can again do a dyadic decomposition and the Moray estimate to deal with the blue part so that finally we can prove. Apart so that finally we can prove this layer only provides a very small force. Okay, so now let's come to the more singular than Newtonian case. So first of all, let me do the one-dimensional result. So here we have to assume that it is actually a C1 perturbation of a power law which is more singular than Newtonian. Then we can prove that. Can prove that no mass concentrates on the boundary. And this result actually allows the presence of attraction or confinement as long as they are C1. Because the mechanism is kind of when you have a very singular repulsive potential, it is just not energy preferred to push anything on the boundary, even if you push. The boundary. Even if you put some attraction or confinement trying to push it towards the boundary, if you are close enough to the boundary, this effect is negligible. This singularity will be. Okay, so if you look at this result and you see, if the power is between negative one and zero, then the interaction potential is equal to infinity at zero. So the result is trivial because anything on the boundary will make the On the boundary, will make the energy infinite. However, the non-trivial case is here: if the power is between 0 and 1, then this is indeed a non-trivial case because the energy of a Dirac mass is still finite. So, again, to prove this result, we need to utilize the Euler-Lagrange condition. So, here, let me use the shorthand notation Vρ to denote. Vρ to denote the generated potential. We calculated the difference of the generated potential between zero and epsilon, where of course we do a proof by contradiction. We assume a Dirac mass at zeros and try to derive contradiction. So here, zero is already in the support. So the Euler Lagrange condition tells us this quantity has to be non-negative. Then we need to separate this quantity into Quantity into several parts. So the contribution coming from this direct mass is a negative quantity to this difference on potential. And this quantity has other negative epsilon to the power b. So this is negative. So we have to have other parts trying to have positive contributions balancing this negative contribution. And since we are dealing with a potential A potential which is almost repulsive power B near the origin. If we take epsilon small enough, we can basically view the interaction potential just as this power law. Okay, so suppose you are between zero and epsilon over two, then you are closer to zero compared to your distance to epsilon. That means you are having negative contributions. Having negative contributions. And once you pass epsilon over 2, then the distance to epsilon is smaller. So you are having positive contributions. However, if you are really far away from all this epsilon order, if you are greater than large constant c times epsilon, then those positive contribution can actually be neglected because our potential is assumed to be. Our potential is assumed to be C1 away from the origin, and if you are far away, then you can do a derivative estimate on this difference in potential. And actually, this contribution is very small. So the main contribution comes from the mass between epsilon over 2 and C epsilon. And in this part, if you have a unit amount of mass, it actually contributes to order epsilon to the power B. Order epsilon to the power b. So that means to balance this direct mass and negative contribution, you have to have a positive amount of mass in this middle region. That means between epsilon over 2 and C epsilon, we have a lower bound on the total mass inside here. And this lower bound is independent of epsilon. And now here comes. And now, here comes an important trick that this actually leads to a contradiction because we can take a sequence of decreasing epsilon n. So by making this into a geometric series decreasing fast enough, we can make sure that all those epsilon n over 2 to see epsilon intervals are disjoint. So that will tell you you have infinitely many of those disjoint intervals. Each of them has a dense. Each of them has a density, have a mass lower bound, then rho has to have infinite mass, which is a contradiction. Okay, so this can be partially generalized to multi-dimensions. And here we need a lot of extra assumptions. We need the boundary to be at least C2. And we also need to assume that this given minimizer has the whole boundary in the support of the minimizer. Of the minimizer, then we can prove that no mass concentrates on the boundary. And let me also mention that if we know the sign of the Laplacian of the interaction potential, then this assumption can somehow be guaranteed. So the proof of this is pretty technical. The basic idea is the same. We just need to do this kind of potential difference between one boundary point and one nearby point. Point and one nearby point in the normal direction. And then we have to do some kind of average trick on the whole boundary to handle the extra singularity coming from the higher dimension. So at least we need a notion of the normal direction and the tangential direction. And this is why we need the boundary to be C2 because now we can build a tubular neighborhood. And then to do the estimate, I have to separate. And then to do the estimate, I have to separate between the near interaction and the far interactions and do many different estimates. I don't think I have the time to discuss here. So finally, let me come to the relation between whole space and bounded domain minimizers. So there is a trivial relation between them, which is if you take a whole space energy minimizer, which is compact supported, and if it fits. Complex supported, and if it fits into some large bounded domain, then of course it is a bounded domain minimizer. But there is one more connection between those two versions of minimizers, which is more intricate. So let me formulate the problem in the following way. Suppose we start from a bounded domain, we start from a whole space minimizer and the energy denoted as E star, and the potentials W star and U star. And u star. Then for the whole space minimum, the part of the Euler-Langrange condition tells you the generated potential on the whole space, it has to be constant on the support of rho. Okay, so then let me do a formal argument. We take the negative Laplacian on this equation. Formally, we will get negative Laplacian W converter rule plus negative Laplacian U star is equal to zero on the support of rule. Okay. Okay, so you see, suppose we call W as negative Laplacian W star and U as negative Laplacian U star, then this is precisely an Euler-Lagrange condition with W and U. But you see, this is only part of the Euler-Lagrange condition because we also need the generated potential to be greater than this constant, which is zero here outside the support of row. However, suppose we are lucky enough that Suppose we are lucky enough that we choose the domain to be precisely the support of row, then we no longer have this problem because this is already everything on the boundary domain. Okay, so then suppose we further assume that this new potential W has the linear interpolation convexity we need, then the Euler-Lagrange condition will also be a sufficient condition for the minimizer. Then that implies the same row as The same row is a bounded domain energy minimizer for those new potentials and this particular domain. So if we summarize this as a theorem, of course, we still need to deal with a lot of details here. We assume that the simple case where we only deal with some power law potential, which is less similar than Newtonian, on the whole space. The whole space. And we assume a C2 external potential. If you take the whole space, minimize rho for W star and U star, and you take the boundary domain to be precisely the support of rho, then rho is also the minimizer of a new energy on the boundary domain, where the new potentials are obtained by taking a negative Laplacian of the original potentials. We also need a technical assumption that generates Technical assumption that generated potential is continuous. Okay, so I think this connection is deeper than the trivial one I have described because here we are actually connecting the boundary space energy minimizers and whole space minimizers with different interaction potentials. And this result can be partially reversed if we are considering radio energy minima. That means. Radio energy minimizer. That means if you start from a radio bounded space, bounded domain energy minimizers, which is on a ball, then you can somehow formulate the same rule as some kind of whole space minimal. Okay, so this is an application to produce an explicit examples of bounded space minimals, bounded domain minimals, because, okay, on the whole. Okay, on the whole space, in the literature, there have been some explicit energy minimals. If you take the power law with power between negative d and 4 minus d and a quadratic confinement, then it is known that the unique energy minimizer is like r squared minus x squared to certain power. And suppose we focus on the case of less singular than Newtonian, then we can apply. Than Newtonian. Then we can apply the theorem to say that by taking Laplacian of W star and Laplacian of U star to obtain a new power law and a constant external potential, then this row is still the minimizer on the boundary domain if the boundary domain turns out to be the ball of the correct radius. To make this consequence clear, we just do some risk scaling. Do some rescaling. We first change the index of b to b plus 2. So now we have this power lobby in b. And then we rescale the domain to be the unit ball. Then you see what we obtain is that this 1 minus x squared to certain power is actually the unique energy minimizer on the boundary domain, the unit ball with the power law potential, which is more singular than Newtonian. So, of course. Than Newtonian. So, of course, here the constant external potential has no difference with the zero external potential. So, then we get a very nice result. This argument works for at least 2D, but by a slightly different argument, we can show that 1D, this is still true. And here, you observe that this power is actually a negative power. That means for this more singular than Newtonian interaction. More singular than Newtonian interaction potential, the energy minimizer on a bounded domain has actually a growth to infinity of the density near the boundary. So the typical behavior is like that. For whole space minimeters, we have Lipschitz continuous and characteristic function and growth near boundary. And via this Laplacian argument, we go from whole space to bounded domain, and the singularity power changes by two. Power changes by two, and here you see the same kind of thing will serve as a boundary domain minimalism for more singular than Newtonian potentials. And if you do bounded domain and you pass the Newtonian, then you start to have concentration on the boundary. This is a very reasonable challenge of the behavior. So finally, let me just mention a preliminary result about the boundary growth phenomena. Boundary growth phenomena. So, this turns out to be a pretty general phenomena. And now, what we can prove is in 1D, and we can only deal with part of the more singular than Newtonian case. Suppose to do that with perturbation of power law, C1 perturbation of power law, and purely repulsive and no external potential. Then we can actually prove that, in the sense of the accumulative density, it actually has. Density, it actually has the correct power near the boundary. We conjecture that the same is true for the other range of the power because that's what we see in the explicit example, but currently we don't have a proof. This proof, the idea is not very hard. It is using the concept of total repulsion function we introduced in our previous work. Introduced in your previous work for particle models. It turns out to be a very powerful tool in 1D. So if we consider at location X, what are the total pushing force between the left and the right? And then the Euler-Lagrange condition will imply that this function is constant in X. And you see, if you take the X to be very small, then part of the density is only on a very small. A very small interval, and somehow to make this into a constant, you have to have a very high density near the boundary. So, that's the basic idea. That's all of my thoughts. Thank you. Thank you for your talk. Are there questions? So, I wonder in the multi-dimension case, let's say, suppose. Let's say, suppose your potential is just a little bit more singular than Newtonian. Then, without the external potential, do you always expect the density to grow to infinity somewhere approach? You mean, let's say suppose we are in 1D and Newtonian is equal to 1. So, let's say Fb is equal to 0.9. So, your result is already stronger than what I asked. Stronger than what I must be, right? But I wonder in multi-D, so you have shown that there can be mass concentration, right? Okay, so in multi-D, currently we don't have this boundary growth result for multi-D. I think it is hopeful to get a multi-D result in the radio setting up because along the radio direction, you can still build this kind of functions. Functions. However, in the general multi-D case, we have no clue about how to prove. Even if it is just a little bit more singular than Newtonian, you know that for Newtonian, it has a concentration on boundary. And if you do a soft argument, you can show that if you send the power from the more singular side converging to the Newtonian, then the energy minimizer will more or less. Energy minimizer will more or less converge into something on the boundary. But if you fix the power there, you may still have no growth at all, I think. We cannot rule out this possibility. Other questions? Just a second. Okay, just a second. Okay, so analysis can say something about how concentration depicts three of the arguments. So, I mean, even in a 2D case, basically, one can say it's not the same to have kind of boundary curving outward versus a boundary curving inward. Because, I mean, so I'm wondering if you know, is there something about let's say a little bit more? Is there something about let's say a little bit more about how things concentrate depending on, for example, the curvature of the boundary? Okay, that's a very interesting question. So actually, we also have another result I didn't discuss here is that if you look at the less singular than Newtonian case, I mean strictly less singular than Newtonian. And we already know that there has to be some mass on the boundary. If you further assume that the domain is convex, then we can prove that there is a vacuum layer between the boundary and the interior support. Okay, so I think in the numerical simulation, we already kind of observed that, but for the proof, we can only deal with purely repulsive without. Is like purely repulsive without any external potential. So you see, here this is less singular than Newtonian. You see, we can actually prove this kind of gap. Although that's not exactly in this simulation, because here we have an external potential. So when you have external potentials, you see here, very likely the support of the boundary part and the interior part will have an intersection at this point, more or less. Point more or less. But we can prove if you have a convex domain and no external potential, then this kind of touching cannot happen. So I think about the curvature of the boundary, I think this is the only thing we know currently. Questions? Well, it doesn't seem Well, it doesn't seem to be the case, so let's thank everyone again. Thank you. Thank you very much. And we are meeting to march with the colours of the city. That's a personal page. Yeah. That be noticed. Procedure.
