Yeah, well firstly let me thank the organizers for the opportunity to be here and to give a talk. Like Payload, it's my first time in India and I'm super excited for the week. Yeah, so I want to talk about some recent work of mine, which I put on archive in September on HACC principle for Kuma varieties. So So, throughout the talk, K is going to be a number field. Please say the back if you can't read my writing, and I'll try and write larger. Okay, and we saw already in the first talk today, so if x over k is a variety, then we say that x satisfies the Hasse principle. Which I'll always abbreviate as HP if having a point over every completion of K guarantees you have a K point as well. So So, condition of having a point everywhere locally, I'll abbreviate as X ELS for everywhere locally soluble, and X satisfies the House principle if this is enough to guarantee that there's a K point. And we saw already in the first talk, sort of some lovely results on giving instances of sort of families of varieties that do or don't satisfy. That do or don't satisfy Alhazbin's point. I want to talk about a particular family of varieties today, so namely Kuma varieties. So, let me start by saying what I mean by that. So let's take A to be an abelian variety over our number fields. And maybe let me just fix some notation. So I'm always going to write the dimension of A, denote that by G. Then, well, the Kummer variety associated to A, this is essentially the quotient of A by the action of plus minus one, except dimension two or higher, this will be a singular variety, will be singular. Be a singular variety, will be singular with the images of the two torsion points in this quotient. And you want to take sort of a suitable designularization of this, or for the purposes of this talk, I want to. And you can get that just by blowing up once at each singular point. So, sort of as a quick example, if you do look at the case where dimension is one, so this is an elliptic curve, quotient by plus minus one, you just get the projective line. This is already smooth, and g equals two. This is already smooth and g equals two. Um, sort of of interest to this talk, let me just say this sort of classically known that you get k-free surfaces this way. Okay. Okay, so this is sort of basic instance of a common variety. And this, of course, not so interesting for the point of view of the Hash principle because Belium variety always has a point, the origin of the group law, and so similarly this quotient will as well. This quotient will as well. But you can sort of twist this construction and then get some varieties where it's interesting to ask about the existence of rational points. So you do that in the following way. I guess I'll call these generalized commercial varieties. So we still have an ability variety A over K. Still have an abelian variety A over K, but then we sort of add some extra data, which is a class inside this H1 Galois cohomology with coefficients in the two torsion of the abelian variety. And what this group parametrizes, or one way to, one sort of set of geometric objects that it parametrizes is two coverings of the abelian variety. So from this, we get a two covering. Say y alpha. So, what is this? So, some variety maps down to the abelian variety, and this sort of variety and this map is supposed to be a twist of the trivial two covering, which would be multiplication by two on the abelian variety. So, supposed to exist some isomorphism, which is not part of the data over k bar, making this diagram, diagram commute. So, it's a twist of your belien variety. So, it's a twist of your abelian variety, has this sort of particular structure. Okay. And you can check the multiplication by minus one on the abelian variety. If you transport it across this isomorphism over the algebraic closure, you'll get an involution iota on this two covering. On this two covering, there's towards the end of European variety. And using commutativity of this diagram, you can check this involution is actually defined over k, and then you can just repeat this sort of Kummer variety construction to get an interesting sort of generalized Kummer variety over K. So we're going to call x alpha, which is sort of common variety associated to this two covering, which you get by quotienting by this involution and then desingularizing in the same way. Okay, so it's just some twist of this sort of simple construction over here. And now it is an interesting question to ask whether or not. interesting question to ask whether or not uh whether or not this common variety has rational points whether or not it satisfies the has principle sort of what obstructions there are to rational points um okay and sort of i guess a case of particular interest is the case where you start with an abelian surface because then uh you're asking questions about existence of rational points on k3 surfaces which is something that's uh was sort of quite very difficult and also very interesting sort of particular case okay Okay. Yeah, maybe also say so case of ability surfaces that are particularly interested in will be Jacobians of genus two curves. And then there's quite a nice, sort of explicit description of these Kumo varieties. And you can write down sort of equations for them as the intersection of pre-quadrics in P5. So sort of one, sort of, this is a bit abstract. You can get certain Get certain intersections of free quadratics in P5 sort of via this construction. Okay, so there's a fair bit of existing work studying rational points on these Kummer varieties, and sort of the basic The basic method for doing this goes back to Swinet and Daya and was also sort of touched upon in the first talk today. So maybe let me just say that you can study existence, and I'll say more precise stuff later. So you can study existence of rational points on these generalized commervarieties via what often. By what I often hear called the Swinners and Dyers method or descent vibration method, which I'll describe in this special case later in the talk. And let me mention some, well, I'll mention. Let me mention some. Well, I'll mention some results in a second, but just some sort of authors and papers who contributed to this. So, I guess the first, I mean, Swinth method goes back sort of quite a long time, maybe I think 95 maybe, and sort of various contexts in particular for sort of surfaces fibrin and genus one curves has been developed by several people, I guess, in the audience, so by Skora Bogatov, by Kolo Tolen, Swanitan Dyer, and Swinedendaier and Pittenberg. In this particular setting of Kuma varieties, I want to mention some work. Skor Bogatov, Swinisundaya from 05, the first sort of paper dealing with common varieties explicitly. And then Harpage. Um and then Harpage from 2016 and then also a paper papash from 2019 and I sort of want to group them like this because these sort of these two papers they work in the situation where all of the two torsion is defined over the base field. The two torsion is defined over the base field. And this paper and then a sort of generalization of this of mine, which I want to talk about in just a second from this year, kind of goes in the orthogonal direction where you want a large Galois action on the two torsion. So there's sort of two orthogonal directions in which this method has developed. And I guess, sort of, roughly speaking, if you have all of your two torsion defined over the base field, then you can do things fairly explicitly. So if you even just two descent on elliptic curves, for example, can be made much more explicit when you have all of your two torsion. On the other hand, On the other hand, when you have large Gau action on the two torsion, things get less explicit, but in some sense, they get nicer because there's certain kind of degenerate cases that can happen over here, which you find just don't ever happen at all when you have enough galaxy number two. Okay, so what I want to focus on is this side, but I just kind of want to mention that there's this work that I won't really touch on in the other direction. Um Okay, so maybe now what I'll do is I'll state kind of the main result, or one of the main results of this paper, and then sort of afterwards I'll say kind of what the version or generalization of this that I've worked on is. So in the sort of large Gawa action setting, what Harpash and Skorobogatov proved is the following. The following. So assume the abelian variety is principally polarized. So, for example, Jacobian is fine. Okay, and you take your class that's going to define the Kummer variety. Then, well, there's some conditions on the theorem, and it's going to depend on the nature of this class a little bit. Depend on the nature of this class a little bit, and then depend quite heavily on exactly what the Gao group of the two-division field is. And the result has the following shape. So you assume some things, which I'll state in just a second, and then the conclusion is that the hassle. That the Hasse principle holds for this Kuma variety conditional on finiteness of Schaffer's state groups. Two parts of Shafari state groups for quadratic twists of A. Okay, so it's a conditional result, but it's conditional on the standard conjecture, and it's saying something about, for example. Conjecture, and it's saying something about, for example, rational points on K-pre surfaces, which is sort of very, very difficult to say anything unconditionally about. And as we'll see in a second, it's sort of the method reduces in some sense to Taurus's underbellian varieties. And there, you really need finance of SHA to say things about the Haas principle or the Brown-Manning obstruction. So it's kind of reasonable. What are the assumptions? So there's what I'll call a technical condition on what this class looks like. What I'll call a technical condition on what this class looks like, and I'll mention maybe in a special case what this assumption is, but I don't massively want to go into it. And then there's some conditions on what the two torsion and what the Galois action of the two torsion looks like. So the two torsion should be simple as a G module and And the only endomorphisms of the two torsion commuting with the G-action should be scalars. Should be some element in G fixing a line and And should have vanishing of H1, I guess, elements in this cohomology group that vanish from restriction to the two-division fields. But this is just something purely depending on G, this group ought to vanish. F2, so just scalars, you just have just scalar only endomorphism computing with the G-action of scalars. So I mean. Okay, um yeah, maybe so what I'm actually what I meant to say when I stated this theorem. So this group here, Gallo group of the two-division field, so the beam variety is principally polarized, so that means that Gallo acts on the two torsion preserving the Bay pairing. So this group here. Pairing. So, this group here, this is sort of naturally thought of as, at least, maybe after picking the basis or something, is naturally thought of as a subgroup of the symplectic group sp2g F2, okay, of automorphisms of the two torsion, linear automorphisms of the two torsion that are preserving the vapair associated to the principal polarization. Okay, so some remarks about this. So these conditions on the two division field, two to four, they hold for A the Jacobian of a hyper elliptic curve y squared equals f of x where f of x has odd degree 2g plus 1. So that's if f has so this hyperliptic curve y squared equals f of x. If f has degree 2g plus 1, this is a genus g curve, two dimensional beam variety. Two-dimensional beam variety. Provided, yeah, so odd degree and the Gallo group of F, symmetric group 2G plus 1, so as large as it can be. Maybe let me say in this condition, what this technical condition on alpha says here is, for example, satisfied when if you work over Q and F is an integer polynomial, then if you have an odd prime dividing the description. An odd prime dividing the discriminant exactly once, where this class is unramified, that's good enough for the technical conditions. So, something reasonably general. Okay. But this, so yeah, I mean, conditions two and three, they sort of say the Gau action is large, but four is sort of saying in some sense maybe that it's not too large because it fails. Because it fails, in particular, for G being as large as possible. So it's not satisfied by the full symplectic group. And it's also not satisfied by Jacobians of hypercliptic curves where. 3f is even 2g plus 2, and the Galois group is as large as possible. So the full symmetric group. And maybe let me say in this case, for g even. It's also not satisfied for g odd, but what I'm going to say in a second will only hold for g even. Yeah, okay, so this is a really nice theorem. It holds for So, this is a really nice theorem. It holds for pretty generic genus 2 curves that can be put in the form y squared equals quintic, so have a fixed rational biost point. But for the most sort of general case of genus2 curves, y squared equals sort of sextic with maximal Gao group. It's not satisfied because of this condition. So, when I was looking into this, I wanted to try and understand sort of what goes wrong and then what you can do to try and remedy this in the case. remedy this in the case of two torsion being sort of as large, gau action on the two torsion being as large as possible. And so sort of first, let me write kind of what it is, sort of the reason why this doesn't hold. So the point is that in both of these cases, there's sort of a distinguished element inside this cohomology group. Group forcing it to be non-zero. Comoji group is in fact one-dimensional and is generated by a class that I'll call C. And what this is, is it corresponds to the corresponding corresponding And what this is, is it corresponds to a sort of upper set of quadratic enhancements of the vapor pairing on the two torsions. So yes, I mean, so the ray pairing on the two-torsion, this is an alternating pairing, it's Galois covariant. And in characteristic two, when alternating pairing is in particular symmetric, you can ask whether that pairing is induced from a quadratic. Whether that pairing is induced from a quadratic form, and it turns out that not always, and there's a co-mode class that sort of obstructs that. So, if you take a quadratic form that induces the vairing, you hit it by an element of Galois and subtract the original one, this will define for you one co-cycle valued here. And that gives you sort of a cohomology class. More geometrically, you can think of this as being sort of the elements in H1 that's parameterizing symmetric. Be elements in H1 that's parameterizing symmetric line bundles defining the given principle polarization. So, not necessarily the case that this principal polarization is induced from a symmetric line bundle over the base field, and the obstruction to that happening defines for you a class in the H1. But a third way of saying it in the case of Jacobians is that this class is parameterizing pheta characteristics. Okay, anyway, sort of long story short, there's this kind of distinguished class that you can always write down, and that's sort of what. And that's sort of at least stopping this figure from applying for Betheman, we'll see why this is actually causing problems for the method as well in just a second. Okay, yeah, maybe so okay, so I think maybe let's I'll state sort of the generalization of this that I proved, and then then we go back and make a couple of remarks that I sort of meant to make about these firms. Sort of meant to make about these firms earlier. Okay, so firm B, so sort of put on archive earlier, well, end of last year, is sort of the same part. But, well, slightly different conditions. So this third condition is slightly tweaked. Okay, that's not sort of super important. So instead of having a Gawa element fixing a line, I want a Gawa element fixing no to torsion. But the more sort of relevant one is that this vanishing of this H1 is that I allow for this weaken it slightly to say that, well, either it's zero or it's generated by this distinguished class. So I can weaken that a little bit further, but it So, I can weaken that a little bit further, but it gets a bit complicated to write down because I do have, in general, trouble dealing with elements inside this co-monology group, but I can at least treat the case which we saw for sort of the maximal action on the two torsion, which is when it's generated by this single distinguished class C. Okay, so in particular. Allows a case where the Galaxy number two torsion is as large as possible, the full symplectic group, and Jacobians of hyperliptic curves where degree of F Degree of F 2G plus 2G even and the Gaul group is as large as possible. So in the particular case of genus 2 Jacobians, where you're saying something about K3 surfaces, I'm allowing now y squared equals sex check with maximal Gaudel group, which is sort of the aim of this project to include that case. Okay. Okay. Yeah, and okay, and a couple more remarks. So, maybe I should say that this theorem of Harpash and Skarbogatov, they also allowed sort of suitable products of abelian variety satisfying these conditions. So, in particular, they were able to prove a really nice result about sort of K-free surfaces arising as Kumas of products of elliptic curves, which sort of not this generalization is not something that I'm looking at. And secondly, so I guess maybe what you should expect, I think there's. So, I guess maybe what you should expect, I think there's a conjecture of Scott Bogatov that all failures of the Hasse principle should be explained by the Brown-Manning instruction for KP services. But here, sort of we're not, we're just seeing the HAST principle being satisfied. And I guess the sort of reason for that is due to these conditions, one can show, and there's a paper of Skarboga, Twob and Zahin, which shows that the relevant part of the Brown manual instruction that might obstruct the Haas principle here actually vanishes under these conditions. So the sort of is. Under these conditions, so this sort of is kind of natural, yeah. Yeah, and so I haven't checked actually that same vanishing old here, but you presume that the similar thing would be true. So, in some sense, this is really a result about the Brown manual instruction, even though it's phrased in terms of the hasput. Okay. Okay, any questions before I sort of say something about the method?  So, in this one, there's a paper that checks the bra group doesn't play a role. Yeah, I think they show that, maybe it can be corrected if I'm wrong, but I think they show that the odd part of the Brow group just never plays a role and that sort of maybe the two-part modular constants vanishes under these conditions. It's something like that. And what I haven't done is go through that. What I haven't done is go through that paper and check that the same holds under my case, but it's kind of proving the same theorem. So, presumably that would also be possible. Okay. Yeah, okay. So, let me say, I want to start by saying, well, I want to say a little bit about the method of both proofs and, in particular, sort of why a different strategy is needed. Just if you weaken this a little bit, this last condition, you need a quite different strategy. Quite a different strategy. First, let me just discuss a little bit how you might get a handle on rational points on this Kuma. And in particular, why this sort of vanishing of Schafferiot take groups of quadratic twists is entering the theorem. So, yeah, what happens is the following. So if Yeah, okay. So remember that this comma variety we had, it was a quotient of a two covering, so it was a quotient of a torso of the abelian variety. So, in particular, if that torsa on the abelian variety has a point, then you map that down to the comma and you'll find that it has a has a point. But sort of clearly, not conversely, like points on here need not lift to the two covering. But what you can check, and I'll just write down in a second, is that actually there's a sort of a whole family of two coverings sitting over this commercial. Family of two coverings sitting over this Kumar variety, and rational point has to lift at least to one member of this family. So let me write that down. So for sort of first indentation, so if you take a element in k cross moduli squares, or if you like, so imagine working over q and take square free integer, then from this you can form the quadratic twist of your Belian variety. In the case of Jacobians of hyper elliptic curves, you just put a d in front of the y squared, and then you take the Jacobian again. That gives you the quadratic twist. And it has sort of nice property that, I mean, this is a abelian variety. It's the same dimension, becomes isomorphic to a vision of a Belian variety once you square root D, but it's in general different over the base field. But the property that it has is that. But the property that it has is that the two torsion in the original beaning variety is the same as the two torsion in the quadratic twist, sort of, if you like, as Galo modules or as group schemes. And what that allows you to do is this class alpha, we can view it now not as living inside H1 with coefficients in the two torsion. In the two torsion, but as H1 with coefficients in the two torsion of the twist, because it's just the same gamma module. But then via the procedure that we had before, that corresponds now a two-covering of the twist. So we get a Y alpha, D, which is a two covering of a covering of the twist. Okay, it's a different torso under a different abelian variety, but when you form the Kummer associated to this quotient by its involution, then you actually get the same Kumma variety that we had before. And you should sort of expect this because when you form the quadratic twist, you're twisting the Gallo action by sort of minus one. Sort of minus one. And here you'll take a quotient by essentially by plus minus one. So you should expect really that you're doing nothing on the quotient with this twisting. Okay. And the other So now you have this whole family of two coverings of abelian varieties that map down to your single comma variety and sort of following sort of lemma, which is that I guess, well, in particular, that rational points on your comma lift at least a sum to your covering. To your covering. So there's a rational point on this comma if and only if there's some twist where the corresponding two covering has a point. So it is true that rational points on this comma are controlled by rational points on Taurus' underbleding varieties, but you sort of need to include this whole family of twists. Need to include this whole family of twists in order to get that statement. And sort of the proof of this is sort of very straightforward. So if you, I mean, you look at your original two covering, mapping down quotient by this involution to your variety. And if you have a K point here, let's call it P, you can just look at the fiber over P, and it looks like Q, and then some point, just something in the fiber, and then it's Some point, just something in the fiber, and then its image under the involution. And okay, it's not the case that P lifts to a rational point here, like Q and the Ota of Q, they can be flipped by Galois, but at least this set is defined over K. So you have a Galois action on this set. Galois action on a set of size two, that's cutting out for you the stabilizer of this, say the fixed field of the stabilizer, this will cut out a quadratic extension of K. And when you twist by the corresponding sort of element, Corresponding sort of element giving a generator for a quadratic extension, you're sort of untwisting the Galois action on the fiber, and then you'll find that actually the point lifts to the corresponding twist. That's how that goes. And sort of with that in hand, I can explain what the strategy is for this, I guess, this result that I just rubbed off, and then this result of mine. So first Strategy for this theorem A say second Aha Yeah, yeah, well at the at I guess at the At the at I guess at the um I mean points corresponding to two torsion points this will be ramified yeah um yeah um but yeah I mean this is this is still okay I think okay so Yeah, so what is the strategy? So we assume that this Kuma is everywhere locally soluble, so it has points of every completion, and we want to produce a global point. And well, we're going to do that by finding a suitable twist with a global point, and that's sort of equivalent by this lemma. First thing to note is that, well, we want to convert, I guess, having the Kumma variety being Ebro-locally soluble to something about these Taus's underbelian varieties. Uh, tors as underbelian varieties, and if you apply this lemma with k replaced by its completion, you'll find that for every place you'll get some twist where the two covering has a rational point, but they won't necessarily piece together to live on a single twist. Or, I mean, a priori, you won't be able to piece these local quadratic extensions together to find a single twist that's everywhere locally soluble. But it turns out that there's sort of some machinery, a sort of vibration method machinery, which allows you to do exactly this. Which allows you to do exactly this, providing some sort of suitable vertical Bryo group vanishes. And you can check that the assumptions of the theorem sort of force that. So we just say, plus some sort of vibration method stuff. I mean, you can do it sort of fairly explicitly as well with class field theory. You have a collection of local characters, and you want to sort of say when can I piece them together to a global quadratic character. And in this setting, you can just check that you can do this. So if this Kumar is. If this Kuma is everywhere locally soluble, you show the following. So this Kummer is everywhere locally soluble if and only if there exists a D0, so a particular twist where the corresponding two covering is also everywhere locally soluble. And another way of saying this. Another way of saying this, so an everywhere locally soluble two covering, that's the same as a two-selma element. So that's the same as saying this alpha lives inside the two-Selma group of the corresponding twist. So now you've sort of forgotten about the Kummer variety, and you're in a situation where you've got sort of a two covering of an abelian variety that's defining a Selma element for you. And you want to know, is there a quadratic twist of that where it actually has a global point? And yeah, so for this. Yeah, so for this in the setting of firm A, you do the following. So starting from D0, so what Scarborough and Harper showed, starting from D0 and kind of adapting sort of what I'll call a twisting procedure of Of Maze and Rubin, you can construct a sequence T1, T2, and so on, where at each step the Selma group is decreasing in size. So you start with your. So, you start with your zero. It contains this class alpha that we're interested in. And sort of, I'm viewing the sum group inside, I want to view the sum group of every twist of A inside this sort of original H1 coefficients in the two torsion. And that's okay because this two-tortion as a Gal module is not changing under quadratic twist. And yeah, each step in this sequence, you sort of inductively construct the sequence where at each step, the Selma group is shown. Where at each step the Selma group is shrinking in size until eventually they show that you can get down to some dn where now this summer group is just generated precisely by this class that we're interested in. Okay. Yeah, and sort of roughly what you're doing is, I mean, if you think of Roughly, what you're doing is, I mean, if you think of these as being square free integers, you're kind of adding in an extra prime factor each time and do it in a very carefully chosen way so that you're kind of eliminating some elements that you had in this original group and not allowing anything extra in. And it's a bit delicate, but it can be done. I guess so, yeah, this is sort of quite a lot of elaborate linear algebra. No, sorry, sorry, that's what I meant. No, sorry, so that's what I meant in the Swineton diet setting. And here it's a bit, it's kind of, I don't know, replaced by sort of careful use of like Pridate duality and so on. And it's maybe a bit more conceptual. I can say a bit more about that maybe, maybe later. Yeah, so it's, I mean, in some sense, this has a lot in common with what Swinus and Dyer is doing, I think, but yeah, it's sort of structured and phrased quite differently. Okay, and then at this point, I sort of claim that we're Okay, and then at this point I sort of claim that we're done and that's for the following reason. So, okay, so I have two sort of observations. So, firstly, you have this sort of standard short exact sequence, which Sequence which the Selma group lives in. So it lives between the rational points, well, the Selma group of the twist by this D sub N. It lives between the rational points on the twist by DN, modulo 2, and two torsion in the Chaffer-Vitate group. And I can recall that this was just spanned by this class defining our comma. And well, if this class maps to zero in the Schaffrovich state group, then I mean, we're done. So you take a 1200. You take a torso under Blane variety, it's everywhere locally solid, but it defines a class in the Shaper state group, and that class is trivial precisely when that torsor has a rational point. So if alpha maps to zero in here, then what that's saying is that this y alpha comma dn has a point, which would mean that our comma has a point. Okay. Okay, but the sort of key step now is to observe that you have the Castle-Tate pairing on the Chapiro-Tate group. Let's say we call it CTP sub DN. So that's a bit of a mouthful. It's a pairing on, let me say the two part of the Schaefer shape, I mean, it lives on the The Shafari, I mean, it lives on the whole Shaper Hate group, but I'll just be interested in it on the two parts takes values in Q mod Z and it's alternating in this context and show and it's non-degenerate provided. Provided you provides two part is finite. Sorry? Yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah. Alternating for me is that if you pair an element of itself, you get zero. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, but it's a general fact that if you have finite abelian group equipped with a non-degenerate alternating pairing, then that is the square of another abelian group. And in particular, its two torsion is necessarily even-dimensional. So like a formal concept. So, like a formal consequence of this is that the Shafrovich tape group of this twist, two torsion, is even-dimensional, but it is sort of the surjective image of something that's one-dimensional, so it better be actually trivial. Okay, but then, well, necessarily, this alpha does have to map to zero inside the Chapier Route group, and then we're done. So, sort of twisting to something one-dimensional and then using this observation about the Castle-Tate pairing is enough to sort of complete the argument. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So, let me talk about why. Let me talk about why this fails in my setting. So firstly, you can check that this kind of canonical class C parametrizing like quadratic enhancements of the vaporing, this lives inside the Selma group of every single twist. Of every single twist, so you just cannot get rid of it with any twisting procedure. So, but I could only hope for this inductive procedure ending in a two-dimensional, oh, so yeah, when you've got two-dimensional semi-group. So, that's bad. And the second bad thing is that even if you would have arrived at something. Would have arrived at something spanned by the class alpha, you still wouldn't be done because, actually, it's sort of shown by Poulin and Stoll that for principal polar to be in variety, the castle state pairing doesn't have to be alternating. It is forced to be alternating under the conditions of fiery, but it's not when this class C is non-zero. And in fact, what Punishdahl show is that for NED, And any X in the Chapiro shape group of the twist. If you pair element with itself, you get the result is the same as pairing that element with this given class C. So If C is non-zero, this castle tape pairing need not be alternating. So maybe let me just take a sort of two minutes to say what I do to get around this. So instead, so the first step is basically the same. You show that there exists some d zipper where Where this class lives inside the summary group of the twist, okay, that works just exactly the same. But if you're careful about this and this uses this sort of technical condition on what this class alpha looks like, then you can also arrange that the two infinity summer rank, so sort of just the rank if you're assuming that Scheffer-Shape group is finite, is actually odd. And yeah, I mean, you would expect this. And yeah, I mean, you would expect this. You can show that sort of using root numbers, you can arrange this quite easily. So, if you're happy to assume the parity conjecture, then you can get this okay. I had to work quite hard to show, sort of, I guess, in some sense, prove that version of the two-parity conjecture here, but show that you can really arrange this for two-infinity sample groups. But okay, let's not say any more about that. But then, once you've done this, sort of instead of doing a twisting procedure where you shrink the sample group, Well, you shrink the Selma group. What you can do instead is sort of freeze the Selma group. So you construct, well, I guess, an infinite family, say F inside of twists, where if D is in the family, then we'll firstly Then, well, firstly, to infinity summer remains odd, and secondly, the two summer group is exactly the same as your original two-summer group as a subgroup of this overarching sort of H1, which is not very. Overarching sort of H1, which is not varying when you twist. Okay, so you've frozen the two-selmer group, but there's no reason why you should have frozen the Castle-Tate pairing on the two-somal group in the process. And so, when you have this big family with identical two-selma groups, what you can do is you can study the variation of. Of the Casso-Tate pairing on these sort of common sem group. So I sort of did this a little bit in some previous work of mine. It's also sort of thing studied in work of Harpash and work of Alexander Smith. And you basically show that you can get any pairing, the customer pairing can be any pairing you like on the two-somale group. And in particular, you show. And in particular, you show that exists a twist where alpha is the unique non-tribute element in the kernel of the castle state pairing on the two-semil group of the twist. Okay, and then you're done because you've arranged for the rank to be odd. So, from that short exact sequence, you know there's at least some element that's really trivial inside the Shafi'it take group. But if there's a unique non-trivial element in the kernel, then that non-trivial element better be that sort of rank element coming from here. So, again, you get that this alpha has to map to zero. That this alpha has to map to zero inside the Shepherd-Shake group, and you get a point on your command. Okay, and then I should probably stop there. Questions, comments? Thanks for the very nice talk, Adam. Okay. My question is: do you use this ready symbol to construct like accurate subscription of the castle state pairing or what goes into proving accurate distribution of the castle state pairing? So, can you say that again? Do I use the ready symbol or do I. Do you use ready symbols to get accurate of the castle state pairing or something like that? Yeah, I guess something like that. So I think it's not exactly ready symbols that are appearing, but it's a similar sort of thing. So you can sort of build up some sort of, I guess, I don't know, like generalized dihedral type extension out of the elements inside this two-semogroup. And you can show that it's Robinius in this extension that's controlling, or maybe not the Casus Tapeen, but the sum of sort. Tape pairing, but the sum of sort of CT, the castle-tape pairing corresponding to the twist plus the original castle-tape pairing is controlled by Robinius inside this extension. And using that, you can sort of carefully produce an element that has the right sort of Castle's tape pairing. Yeah, so I guess it's sort of some sort of generalized red A symbols may be fair to say I can say more about that. Okay, thank you. Yeah, okay. Do I have one or two minutes? Can I write something on the board, or should I say? Okay, maybe here. So, I mean, yeah, so I guess maybe the conceptual, or what I would see as the conceptual reason why you can control sort of the sum of two castles tape pairings is that there's an isogeny from sort of the rate restriction of A from a quadratic extension to the product. From a quadratic extension to the product of A and its twist. And you can sort of write down what I would call the V pairing formula for the castle tape pairing associated to an isogeny. And you find that it's sort of simpler than, you know, using the structure of this isogeny, you find that it's simpler than just sort of writing down the individual casetate pairings associated to like the two torsion. And you get a sort of simplification that way, which allows you to gain control of it. And more sort of what answer to Peter's question, if you sort of To Peter's question, if you sort of look at you adjoin two torsion, this is a G extension. From here, you can sort of build the extension where these, so if you have some two elements A and B inside the Selma group, you can build an extension, the smallest extension through which these factor. Let's call this L and its Galois group will be sort of a subgroup of two torsion squared, but in fact, using these sort of largeness assumptions, you can check that. Assumptions can check that this whole thing is semi-direct product of G with acting on two copies of the two torsion, one for each of these cosyc elements. And then you have this cut product, the fact that they're in the summer group means this cut product vanishes inside H2μ2. And from there, you can sort of show that this vanishing means that you're solving some embedding problem, and you can sit on top of here, sort of some central extension. Sort of some central extension of this semi-direct product by μ2. And sort of what you prove by sort of writing down what the Cassel take pairing process esogeny looks like is that it's kind of the Frobenius element inside this tower, sort of this extension here, or sort of evaluating Frobenius at some co-chain trivializing this cup product that controls the castle's tape pairing. I could say sort of more about that in more time. Um yeah, so I mean, I have a previous paper, um, it's called quadratic twists of regional varieties and disparity in summer ranks, and so the main result of that. And so the main result of that paper is showing that you can decompose the two-infinity sum rank into a sum of local terms. And I guess there's two things that go into that. Sort of one is some of this sort of Maser-Rubin kind of polytechnic machinery. And then some is an explicit computation of, so I mean, you can check the sort of whether the two opinions, I mean, yeah. Whether or not the Shafi'i group has square order is controlled by. The Chaffee-H group has square order is controlled by when you pair this class C with itself. And I sort of do an explicit computation of what that is in sort of quadratic twist families, sort of using the sort of simplification of the calcotate pairing under quadratic twist. And from there, I show that this to infinity summaran sort of parity is controlled by finitely many terms. And then you can just sort of check that under the sort of condition on alpha, which I didn't actually write down, you can force that sum of local terms to be odd. And then you just need to sort of fix. To be odd, and then you just need to sort of fix what's happening for your twist at some finitely many bad places, and then you can sort of vary it away from there and keep the Selma parity. No, it really is a two-infinity Selma rank. So you can control both I guess you control both the parity of the two Selma group and the parity of sort of two torsion and the Chaferi-Te group and from the difference of the two you can extract the the the rank if you like.
