I'll speak about some joint work with Dmitri Golovati and Itasha Fourier from the Tech Echo. So it is about the, it's not really non-local, I mean, but someone said that everything that is not That everything that does not have necessarily to be local should be in the conference. So here is the Ausen Funk energy functional. Many of you must have seen it before, and it's the director field. It is the local average of the direction of the liquid crystal molecules. Crystal molecules. And its elasticity energy, what distinguishes this functional from what you usually know is this chirality, chirality tau. Yes, so keep them both chirality is any. Kali is any real number, and you could easily convince yourself that the uniform distribution, because of if there is a non-vanishing corality, is not the minimizer. Just a word on the case, there are elastic coefficients, the Rosen-Frank energy functional is energy of elastic. Functional is energy of elasticity. And we're not going to look at it in its greater generality. Even here, I think I dropped one term. There are, of course, also more general models for liquid crystal energy, but even here, I'm not going to go with this model in its greatest generality. I'm going to look at the case where two constants, k2 and k3, are equal. I mean, I set them arbitrarily to one, but. I set them arbitrarily to one, but that doesn't change anything. And there is a separate constant before of the divergence, which is called splash energy. Okay, a splay, sorry, splay. So the first question is, of course, what is the global minimizer here if you forget about boundary conditions? That was solved some many years ago. You could see that if Many years ago, you could see that if this term vanishes, then so must the divergence just by taking the divergence of the equation. And then our results, first of all, by Erickson, and then which was rigorously proved by O. I mean, there is a, it's an AMS note where he. Note where he shows a rigorous proof of Ericsson result. And there is a separate result by Baumann, Phillips, Chi, and Caldera by a different technique. What do they found both? That the solution must have up to rotation, up to any rotation, the solution must be of this form. Of this form, which means that it is planar and it rotates around the rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane where the liquid crystals molecules are directed. And also, here I use the pH 2 pi over tau, we'll need it soon. And what is most important. What is most important for me is this rate of rotation, tau. Tau is inherent in the functional. It has nothing to do with the boundary condition. And what I'm going to ask today is what happens if you forces the boundary condition for put the boundary condition a different rate of rotation. So here is a picture. So here is a picture that's the it's taken from a web page of a Brazilian mathematician. It's very large, so the resolution blurs it a bit. But I think you could see that here's a half pitch, I mean half period. You see it's a rotation of See, it's a rotation of a whole pie. The molecules circulate around the rotation axis, and of course, it changes the photoelectric or photonic properties of the sensitivity to light of the liquid crystal. This is one of the reasons these colosterics liquid crystals are very commonly used in liquid crystal screens. Liquid crystal screens. So after explaining on the global minimizer, now I'm going to take the simplest possible problem where unnatural rate of rotation is force. I'm taking periodicity in one direction. One direction, I'm just looking at the periodic. Looking at the periodic, the period is L, it's not really very important. And on the boundary, I'm forcing the rate of rotation to be something like alpha. I mean, the length is one, so if I had a natural rate of rotation, then I should expect a jump of tau, right? Jump of tau, right? This is forceful spherical coordinate transformation, which creates some problem. I'll talk about it later. But if we look at this variable phi, it jumps by alpha and alpha need not necessarily be equal to tau. So the question is what the minimizer is given such boundary condition. Boundary collision. Here is just the perfect cholesteric state. You see it's tau x2, right? It remains all the time in the same plane. And it's tau x2. So on the boundary, it's tau, which is not the case here. Okay, so that's just those observations. Let's return to the energy. Let's return to the energy functional. It is once again now written on the domain of force I turned into the interval 0L because of the periodicity. The Euler-Lagrange equation given here, it's pretty standard. You can't enforce zero here because it's the minimum. Because it's the minimum the n is in s2, just you can just say that the left-hand side is parallel to n. And for a specific value of lambda, you can show that the linear solution, I mean, just like the perfect cholesterol, but instead of alpha is tau, is a critical point. Normally, it's not the Normally, it's not the minimizer, as we'll see it later, but it is a critical point. And you can ask yourself whether this critical point is, first of all, locally stable. That was the first question we asked ourselves in a two-dimensional setting. So, here is the theorem. Pretty long theorem, very lots of detail in it, but I think the The simple graph below is sufficient to explain it. We have two regions of stability. One is the interval tau to tau, right? If I'm changing my value of alpha, the rate of rotation and forced on the boundary, from tau to two tau, I have stability. This is, by the way, very easy to prove that between tau and two tau, it is. proof that between tau and two tau it is, then we actually found the to leading order that there is a bit to the left and a bit to the right. To the left it's something of order one, the left bound, and to the right it's of order one over tau, which can be very small for large tau. Tau and there is a small neighborhood of stability near zero for large tau, it is of order one over tau. I could have convinced you quite quickly that it is a reasonable result by a few arguments, but let's move to other results. Are the results? So let's speak about one-dimensional analysis. That's the most trivial choice, and even that hasn't been answered. This is how the functional looks. There are some results on that. Results on that, notably by the Russian physicist Zeldovich from the beginning of the 80s, they just found a critical point: you can solve the Euler Lagrange, but he never answered what the global minimizer is for such a setup. And there is a previous work by Golovati, Novak, and Sternberg. They used somewhat the same functional but Functional, but with additional Ginz-Bog-Landau term showing that there is some gamma convergence to this functional. Let me go on. So here's a simple result. So I'll address here only the case when tau is greater than pi. In one dimension, we can actually find the threshold. It's precisely. It's precisely pi, otherwise, we'll need large tau analysis. But if tau is greater than pi in one dimension, then if the difference between the unnatural rotation and the natural rotation is bounded by something of order tau to the half, then the minimizer is precisely. Precisely the linear function we saw before. That's the first result, but that is limited just to, if tau is large, just to all tau to the half neighborhood of tau. On the other hand, if we look at the case, and in the one-dimensional case, you can get precise values. Values. If we look at the case where it's greater than tau to the half, this is pi tau to the half, then you get a minimum which is completely independent of the rate of rotation. So here is the formula for it, for the minimizer. I'll show it in a moment in a picture, so don't bother yourself too much with the formula. The minimizer, first of all, is not attained. This is the This is not a minimizer. And maybe I can just move to the numerical simulation. Here you see the numerical simulation. This is the case when alpha minus tau is less than this threshold and you see the linear behavior of theta of the rotation. Of the rotation. In the case where we move the word away from the pi tau to the half from the natural rate of flotation, the solution is the minimum is obtained quite simply by moving to zero. I mean, what does it mean moving to zero? This is the axis of rotation, and here the liquid liquid. The liquid liquid crystal molecules for the global minimizer. Because of the unnatural rotation, what the minimizer does is move to the direction of the axis of rotation. Then it rotates as much as it needs with no cost at all. And then it goes back to the plane and rotates again with natural rotation. Again, with natural rate of rotation, as much as you need. This is how you close the gap between alpha and tau. Of course, this linear behavior when you move from the plane to the axis of rotation costs something. So you need a gap between the rate of rotation and the natural rate of rotation. But then this is what you get. It's always the same. It's always the same. A word of the regularity of the solution. There are two problems here. You see, this is a jump in the derivative. This is a real issue. It comes because of the case when K, I forgot to say that this is the K equals zero. It comes because of the It comes because of this the fact that k equals zero, you have this jump, but this is a real problem of the minimizer itself. This jump is just an artifact of the singularity of the spherical coordinate transformation. Let me show it here. So if I here so if i instead of the instead of the um spherical coordinates use just cartesian coordinates ordinary cartesian coordinates i get this functional with uh after using the fact that n1 squared plus n2 squared plus n3 square equal one i can get rid of n2 and get a simple linear functional for n3 and n1 just n3 and n1 just with the extra non-holomonic condition that n1 square plus n3 square is one so uh this is where n1 square plus n3 square equal one so this is a real singularity on the other hand um um if you get to phi equals zero and which means that n And which means that n1 squared plus n3 squared is zero. This is just an ordinary point. This there's no singularity. The minimizer in Cartesian coordinate does exist. It's just that in spherical coordinates, it doesn't. So this is the pretty much everything I have to say about the case k equals zero. If we take k positive, then Then the problem is no longer a singular at phi equal pi over 2, or where we had this jump in the derivative. And in this case, this is just quickly functions that I need in the theorem to functions. So in this case, once again, this is just a large tau. Large tau result. If we are sufficiently close to the natural rate of rotation, the minimizer is still linear. If we are away from it, we get once again, it's a bit more complicated technically, but it's the same thing. We get a minimum which is independent of tau. And this is the minimum I show. This is the minimum. I'll show it in the. Here are the numerical simulations, one case of a numerical simulation. Once again, we see running to zero, almost linearly. It's exponentially close to linear behavior. We run to zero and then at zero, we have a jump. We can jump as much as we want because we rotate the liquid crystals. We rotate the liquid crystals molecule around their axis. This helps us satisfy the boundary condition. This is the profile of phi of the deviation from the plane. Okay. What can we say in two dimensions? How am I with the time? Six minutes. Six minutes. Okay. So maybe you could play the video now, the video now, and then we'll say something. Okay, that's it. Okay, so here that's a I must thank, of course, my colleague Dmitry for providing me in a short note. In a short notice. This is just the linear initial conditions. If you look here, you see the direction of the liquid crystal is described by an arrow and of course by the length of the magnitude of the small segment. When you see it's only When you see it almost vanishes, it means that it is perpendicular to the plane. This is the standard, it rotates around this axis, right? Imagine that it rotates, and of course it does it at an unnatural rate of rotation. Now you can play the video. Okay, so the transient is less interesting for me. I'm not. Is less interesting for me. I'm not that ambitious. Even the global minimizer is very hard to expand in two dimensions. You can see that, unlike the initial condition, now the solution rotates not around the x2 axis, as the initial condition, as the boundary condition, or the initial condition and force at the beginning. At the beginning, but now it rotates around the x1 axis, right? You see it changes. And of course, to satisfy the boundary condition, we have this boundary layer here where it changes from one-dimensional behavior around x1 to one-dimensional behavior around x2. That's how the global minimizer looks numerically. Minimizer looks numerically, what we can prove is much less. Back to the PDF, yes. Yeah, it's just repeating the same thing. Now I'm not dealing with a natural rotation, the results have nothing to do with the boundary condition, just the same. Do with the boundary condition, just the same domain. So, what we can show that if the energy that is, for instance, twice as much the energy of the one-dimensional global minimizer. If I start with that, I mean, it can be any C tau. I just wrote twice as much, but it can be any C tau. Then you see that the energy. You see that the energy of the energy, the weight on N is split half half. Half goes perpendicularly to the plane, the X1, X2 plane, and half is somehow in the X1, X2 plane. So that's in line with the picture that you saw, right? Mostly along X1, but also along X2, it can change. Also, along with Sue, it can change like that, but the N3 direction preserves half of the weight. That's one result. The second is if you allow, I mean, I'm just repeating what I said. Here you see, half goes to the N3 and half goes for the global minimizer. This is what you get. Is what you get. If you use another transformation, another spherical coordinate transformation, now it's a different setup. Now I change the axis of the spherical transformation. And if you use a separate, then you could show. I'm out of time, so I'm just going to show the result. So, the result is that if you start with an energy, now it's stated for critical points, not for any function with low energy, a critical point with this energy, any C tau, well. Then I get that the gradient of one of the angles is, and the difference between tau and the other is bound. Tau and the other is bounded by tau to the three over four, right? It's square, so it's tau to the three over four. So this one runs C, the gradient C of is of order tau, and we can allow deviation of tau to the three over four. Those still, of course, work. Thank you for your attention, of course.
