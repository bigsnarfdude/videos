Lovely. Okay, so thanks, Michelle, for the introduction. I'm really pleased to be here. Really pleased to be talking about this problem with this group, because I think there's a lot to be done here, and I'm excited about it. So I'm going to talk about the little piece that I have been able to contribute and some questions that I have about issues that are related to microplastic transport. I said environmental flows in the title, but we're primarily going to be talking. In the title, but we're primarily going to be talking about turbulence and a little bit of quiescent settling as well. So, off we go. So, how do microplastics move around in the environment? This is the question that brings us all here, so I won't waste your time motivating it, but just to briefly summarize, microplastics are not supposed to be in the environment, and we're putting them there at an astonishing rate. There are lots of ways we can try to mitigate the ecological and environmental problems that are caused by an ocean. Problems that are caused by an ocean full of plastic. And I just want to state upfront: the most effective way to do that will be always to just stop putting plastic into the environment. And this is a policy problem and a sociology problem, but it's not exactly a physics problem. And to paraphrase Liam Neeson, the group of people in this workshop are here because they have a very particular set of skills. We might not be able to stop plastic from entering the environment, but we do have a sort of unique set. The environment, but we do have a sort of unique set of tools collectively that can give us a little bit of insight into how it moves once it gets there. Right, you can see the left side here is kind of, can you see my cursor, by the way? I can never remember if people can see the cursor. Yes. Okay, great. So I'll use that as a pointer. Yeah, so we have lots of things we can talk about in terms of the social and political and kind of public engagement side. Public engagement side, but our specialties are all over here mostly, right? We want to think about fluid motion. We want to think about these kinds of transport pathways. In some cases, we might intersect with the biology and ecology of the problem. And so this is where we kind of want to focus. And as an experimentalist, I want to focus in even more sharply because how do microplastics move in the environment is obviously way too big a question for a 45-minute talk. Way too big a question for a 45-minute talk. So, we're going to zoom in a little bit and ask what we can do in the lab to inform what happens at larger scales. And specifically, what can we do to help parametrize these larger scale models by examining how differences in particle characteristics might change key model inputs? Like, for example, particle settling velocity. So, how do particle characteristics interact with the flow around them? And how does that change these bulk properties? How does that change these bulk properties that we care about that might be entered into these larger scale models? So, I'm going to talk today about four different characteristics of particles that are particularly relevant to microplastics. The first one is size. We know that marine debris ranges from the sub-micron scale all the way up to very, very large pieces of primary litter. And this is clearly going to influence how it's transported. Second characteristic is shape. We know that microplastics can be fragments, fibers. Microplastics can be fragments, fibers, films, and a lot of other shapes. There's no standard microplastic, but if there was, it probably wouldn't be a sphere. I've read a couple of sources that have claimed that fibers are the most prevalent shape. So that's a good place to start. But in reality, we just want to kind of get a little bit of more nuanced view into the effective shape and whether it matters that much. We've already had some discussions about how different. We've already had some discussions about how differently shaped particles move around in flow, so I'll add a little bit to that today. The next characteristic is density. Plastics range from positively buoyant to negatively buoyant on their own, but we also know that plastics don't stay just plastic. They degrade, they get biofouled. So we should probably think of density as kind of a dynamic property. And then lastly, we'll talk about density distribution, which I think is something that doesn't get a lot of airtime and really should. And what I'm And what I'm saying here is that microplastics can and often are be non-uniform in density. They might be incorporated into aggregates, they might be degraded or biofouled unevenly. And so we'll talk about some new results from our group showing that some particle behaviors can be extremely sensitive to density distribution, which means it might not always be appropriate to parametrize with an average density. And so we'll talk about that and then we'll... We'll talk about that and then we'll finish up with kind of a brief tour through some of our current projects, ask some questions that'll hopefully help us guide the discussion of how laboratory experiments can play a role in the overall picture of microplastic transport. So that's where we're going. And we'll start. I tried to talk about these separately, but they kept coming back together. So we're going to talk about all three of these at the same time. So for most of this talk, as I said, I'm going to focus on turbulence. Said I'm going to focus on turbulence. And when we think about turbulence, we can kind of draw this little cartoon of the energy cascade or the energy spectrum. Where is the energy in ocean turbulence? It's injected at the very large energy containing scales, the scales of the wind and the tides, and then it cascades into smaller and smaller scales, passing kinetic energy to smaller and smaller eddies until we reach an eddy size where the inertial forces and viscous forces are roughly in balance. And that's how we get the Kolmogorov scale. And that's highly very. Scale. And that's highly variable in the ocean, of course. But in general, we can say that Komogorov scale is on the order of a millimeter, maybe down to a 10th of a millimeter, maybe a little bit higher. There are certainly plastics below that scale. We know that there are nanoplastics that are smaller than a micron, but we don't know as much about how many there are since it's really hard to sample those tiny, tiny plastics not as effectively as we can larger plastics. I actually went to a talk last week where the speaker Last week, where the speaker claimed on average, a person consumes about a credit card worth of plastic every week because of these very small pieces that are making their way through our water supply. And I did look this up to see if it was true. And I sifted through all the clickbait. And yes, so this is the upper bound of a peer-reviewed study. And I can share that with you if you're interested. But the range they give is that a person on average ingests about 0.1 to 5 grams of plastic per week. Grams of plastic per week, which is very gross. But so for these tiny plastics, unless the particle is significantly heavier or lighter than water, we can consider it to be a passive tracer. And some things might depend on the particle shape, but in general, we can think of these as tracers. But the term microplastic, it usually refers to pieces that are bigger than that, on the order of one to five microns in size. And so that falls. In size. And so that falls pretty squarely into the lower end of the inertial subrange. We might see some larger macroplastics kind of up here. But right here is kind of an interesting place to be. And I've, for the turbulence nerds in here, I've marked the Kolmogorov scale and the Taylor scale and Ankrilleng scale, but the large eggling scale, excuse me. But this is kind of an interesting place to be because it's spatiotemporally very heterogeneous, right? Be very heterogeneous, right? If you're a particle and you're this big, then you're smaller than the largest flow structures, but you're bigger than the smallest ones. And even if you're neutrally buoyant, you're still going to have some inertia. You're not going to exactly follow the flow as a passive tracer, even if you're entirely neutrally buoyant. So I think we can safely say that most of the microplastics that we have the tools to sample are inertial. We can think about them as inertial particles. Can think about them as inertial particles, and inertial particles can sometimes interact with turbulence in somewhat non-intuitive ways. And so, we know that the size and the shape of a particle determines how it experiences velocity gradients. If we were below the Kolmogorov scale, we know that you're going to be experiencing kind of linear shear along the length of the particle. And it makes it a little bit easier to a priori say what's going to happen to that particle if you send it sailing through some. You send it sailing through some turbulence if you know what the fluid is doing. But the larger particles sample turbulent gradients. And that's one reason why, even a neutrally buoyant particle is not a perfect tracer. It can't respond to what the fluid is doing because the fluid is changing on a spatial scale and usually on a time scale that's much faster and much smaller than what the particle is able to do. And so even if this particle has a specific gravity of exactly one, you can see here. You can see here I've got our classic Stokes number definition. We've got the ratio of the particle time scale to the fluid time scale. But the particle time scale here depends on both mass density and size. So even if we had, you could see the particle density over the fluid density, even if that was one, specific gravity was one, the time scale here could still be pretty substantial if the particle was big. And so this, of course, And so, this, of course, raises the question of how large can the particle get before it's entirely appropriate for us to get within a mile of the word Stokes? But we'll talk about that in just a few minutes. And the other thing that I want to point out, and I promise this is the end of most of the math here, is that inertial particles also have history. So, this is the equation of motion for a small sphere that complies with Stokes' law, but if I get bigger, With Stokes' law, but if I get bigger, I have my turbulent motion, it's unsteady. I have to include unsteady drag, I have to include acceleration reaction force. And if the particle is inertial, I have to include the effects of the particle's history on its motion. And so you see all these correction terms. You see this integral term where I have to integrate everything that has happened to the particle from the initial condition up till now. And all of that is theoretically influencing what the particle is doing right. Influencing what the particle is doing right at the instant that I'm looking at it. And so, if this spherical particle takes up any space, then I have to add even more corrections over here. And so, this is already really, really complicated, and we haven't even gotten away from a sphere. And actually, this is strictly only appropriate for Stokes flow. So, with a Stokes number of still less than one. And so, the lesson that I just want to teach from this is that analytical expressions for Is that analytical expressions for particle and turbulence are really complicated, and it becomes really difficult to write down an equation of motion as a particle departs from this idealized spherical case. And so that was really just a long way to justify my existence as an experimentalist, that we don't have the analytical tools. And in a lot of cases, we have some limits on our computational tools as well. So there's not really any substitute for dumping a bunch. There's not really any substitute for dumping a bunch of particles in a tank and looking at what happens. And so, I want to switch gears here and zoom in on one thing that we tend to think about a lot when we think of microplastics in the ocean, and that's settling velocity. And we know that a particle's settling velocity and turbulence is not the same as it is in still water. And I keep coming back to this figure from Nielsen, and this comes to us from. And this comes to us from kind of the sediment side of things. But we also in this plot have some droplets and some bubbles as well. So if on the x-axis, we have our relative turbulence strength. So that's the RMS of the turbulence or the turbulent velocity scale divided by a particle's unaltered still water settling velocity, right? So really turbulent. Velocity, right? So, really turbulent would be over here, not very turbulent, weak turbulence over here. Okay, and on the y-axis, we have the alteration of the settling velocity as given by the ratio between the vertical velocity and turbulence divided by that quiescent settling velocity. So a totally unaltered velocity would be one, a particle settling faster than normal would be up here, and particle settling slower than normal would be down here. Would be down here. And so, again, this is motivated by sediment transport, but it still is really useful because it shows just how much variability there is in these kinds of altered settlings. We see some particles have a reduced settling velocity and turbulence, some have an enhanced settling velocity and turbulence, and some really don't settle at all. The dotted line is for a Stokes number of less than one here. And so, this fit here goes to, as the turbulence gets really strong, then The turbulence gets really strong, then the particles are never going to settle at all. And so, I think this is kind of an interesting way to frame what the interactions between particles and turbulence do and the vast kind of variety that we can see. And I'm just very briefly going to talk about a couple of the mechanisms that alter these settling velocities. And there are probably lots of people in this Zoom call that have worked on this. Zoom call that have worked on this. So if your paper is not listed here, it's because I didn't have the time. But we can think about the very classic from the aerosol side of things, people looking at how aerosols settle. Max Sean Corson in 1986 identified this mechanism that would later come to be called fast tracking, where you have particles being thrust out to the edge of vortices, and they looked at cellular flows and kind of hypothesized how it would apply in turbulence. kind of hypothesized how it would apply in turbulence. And the idea was that the particles would preferentially sample downgoing regions of the flow. And that would lead to an enhanced settling velocity. And other people have found that as well. And all the way on the right, I like this photo because it just really shows you, this is actually solid body rotation here. And a fairly large spherical particle here is trapped in the region of the flow that opposes. In the region of the flow that opposes its own motion. So, this is upgoing in the fluid. The sphere would be settling, but because of the gradient in the flow, it kind of gets just moved around in a circle. And so, this would later come to be called vortex trapping. A lot of really nice work on this. We've seen some really nice experiments coming out of Elizabeth Bozzelli's work, or a group that have examined this kind of same phenomenon. And then the last thing that really contributes to this or That really contributes to this, or the last main thing, is this idea that drag is non-linear at these intermediate regions where inertia becomes more and more important. And the Stokes number creeps up and up and up. And so we've got lots of people looking at this. There's a great review by Good et al., or not a review, excuse me, but a parameter tweet, basically, where they look at all the different kinds of particle properties and homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, and you can see. And ice tropic turbulence, and you can see in the inset here this altered settling velocity. The x-axis here is sort of a modified gravitational Stokes number. And you see that in some cases, the turbulent settling velocity W is higher than the quiescent W naught, and in some cases, it gets lower. And so, we'll talk more about this and kind of how to really frame it, because it's a thorny question to pin down what things influence this. What things influence this kind of alteration of settling velocity? So, here's our big question: is how do the size and shape of nearly neutrally buoyant particles affect their motion? What we're going to be looking at is fairly large particles that are close to neutral buoyancy that have different shapes and how they interact with the flow around them. So, we want to know how turbulence affects the behavior of these inverse. Know how turbulence affects the behavior of these inertial and spherical particles. I started looking at this question during my PhD work at UC Berkeley with Evan Viriana. And in his lab, there's a fairly large turbulence tank. This cross-section is about three quarters of a meter by three quarters of a meter. And this tank is driven by two facing jet arrays. You can see those here. The jets are firing randomly, and the shearing and entrainment that happens closer to the arrays blends into some nicely homogeneous. Blends into some nicely homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in the middle. Of course, there's no homogeneous and isotropic turbulence out there in the real world, but for our purposes, it's actually really useful to be able to tease out behavior that's related to gravitational settling if the velocity fluctuations are statistically identical between the lateral and the vertical direction. That helps us kind of separate out what's gravity and what's not. So, the tank's parameters are tuned to be similar to mixed layers. Tuned to be similar to mixed layer turbulence in the ocean. I've thrown some of the numbers up there on the slide if that's interesting to you. And in this tank, we suspended a bunch of cylinders. These are on the order of about 20 to 50 times the Komogorov scale. We looked at four different aspect ratios so that we could kind of just start prying into this effective shape a little bit. And then we looked at two different densities, which were both really, really close to neutral buoyancy. Really, really close to neutral buoyancy. And the clever part here, in my humble opinion, is that the cylinders are made of a hydrogel that's nearly refractive in its match to the water. So that gives us the ability to measure the flow around the particle simultaneously with the motion of the particle itself. So we can dump a bunch of cylinders in the tank. We keep the volume fraction low enough. We don't have to worry about particle-particle collisions. And we measure the motion within the tank as well. The motion within the tank as well as the motion of the fluid around them at the same instant. And we can use stereoscopic PIV, particle image velocimetry, in a laser plane that bisects the tank. And we get images sort of like the ones here. These are from a different study. We didn't actually study spheroids in this particular project that I'm going to talk about today, just cylinders. But if we have that information, right, we have a slice through the cylinder and we have the flow around. Cylinder, and we have the flow around it, then we can define a particle slip velocity. And so, we define our particle slip velocity as the average velocity of the in-plane slice, we'll call that UP, minus the average fluid velocity in an annulus around the particle or around the particle slice, which goes out to one sphere equivalent diameter away. So, we've got this information about this. So, we've got this information about this slip velocity. Okay, so I'm going to show us some results of this UP and UF that we're measuring directly for our cylinders. So, we've got a lot of independent measurements. Every dot represents each every set of three dots represents one independent measurement. Here we're plotting the U component and the V component and the W component. Our Y axis is vertical. Axis is vertical, so V is the one that's in the gravity direction. So on the horizontal axis here, I've got my fluid velocity, and on the vertical axis, I've got the particle velocity. And what's interesting, just at even first look, is that in spite of the fact these particles are fairly large, they have a very high Stokes number, somewhere around 30, 40, the fluid velocity is a pretty good predictor of the particle. Good predictor of the particle velocity, even at extreme values. I kind of don't expect that, right? I expect a particle goes through a high-velocity gust and it's slow to respond. It might not get up to the same speed as the fluid before that gust kind of passes on, right? But here we don't see that. We see sort of the same set of extremes. We see less, we see less data, or fewer data points, I should say, at the extremes because those. Extremes because those events are less common, but we don't necessarily see a shift away from this kind of one-to-one line, if you can imagine there. So they're not perfect tracers. If they were perfect tracers, then the particle and fluid velocity would always be the same. So they're not perfect tracers. If so, they would collapse onto this line. There's a lot of scatter and the Of scatter and the particles have this non-zero slit velocity. They're moving with respect to the fluid around them. And actually, all three the dimensional components, U, V, and W, have significant slip right away from that line. And I want to call your attention to the fact that the vertical component is offset. The vertical component has a non-zero offset from the others because that is where gravitational. The others, because that is where gravitational settling is occurring. And I want to remind you that our specific gravity here for this case, I'm only showing one of our eight cylinder types here to make things a little simpler, but all our plots look like this. And this is a specific gravity of 1.006. So these are particles that are 0.6% denser than the fluid around them. And we can still see this offset fairly clearly. So our vertical slip velocity is biased because of the effects of gravity. Because of the effects of gravity. But if our turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic, then we should see the average of the horizontal components come back to that line. The average slip velocity in the horizontal should be zero because of the homogeneity and isotropy of our turbulence. Our turbulence is statistically independent of the coordinate system. I can move that coordinate system however I want, and the velocity fluctuation should still be statistically identical. Still be statistically identical. So we have this kind of offset here, and some of that's due to gravity. The horizontal components don't have gravity, but they do still have slip. And so this kind of gives us a little bit of an idea. There's slip here that's related to gravity, but there's also slip that's related to the particle history. We have an inertial particle that suddenly moves. That suddenly moves from an updraft to a downdraft will have significant slip, even if it's perfectly neutrally buoyant. It can't respond quickly to a quick change in the fluid flow. So there are kind of two independent effects here that are contributing to slip, gravity and history. So gravity gives us this constant offset. History gives us this scatter around our kind of linear fit. And so why not try to decompose that? To decompose that. So it's kind of useful maybe to try a sort of a Reynolds decomposition of the slip velocity itself. So remember, our slip velocity is our instantaneous difference between the particle velocity and the fluid velocity. We're going to break that into an average and a fluctuating term. So the average term should be zero in the horizontal components and non-zero. Horizontal components and non-zero in the vertical components. And so we can take that average and say, we'll define that as the buoyant, the velocity, B for buoyancy. And so there should be an average of zero slip over a large ensemble of independent measurements in the two horizontal directions, the U velocity and the W velocity. But for our gravity coupled direction, we should see that constant offset show up. There should be an average. Show up. There should be an average downward bias. And so then we can say this is the buoyancy effects, and this is the history effects. The fluctuating components are going to be a super complicated function of the particle history. We can't write down an equation of motion that gives us that, but we know that that scatter about that line, you know, obviously there's experimental noise in there, but Experimental noise in there, but there's also all the effects of history, the previous path that the particle took before it floated through our laser plane, before it was imaged. So we expect the slip here to be a function of finite size effects and mass effects that are not related to gravity, right? This should show up in the horizontal components too. So let's take a look at how this breaks out. If I look at the At the average slip and my fluctuations. So, here I'm going to call your attention to the top. So, this is our average. A little bit of a notation change. Apologize, I didn't catch that. But here is our average slip velocity. And we don't see anything super surprising. The horizontal components come in around zero, as we expect, and the vertical components are negative. And so that is indicating the action of gravity. We have remember two specific gravity. We have remember two specific gravities at 1.003 and 1.006. So even this tiny difference is visible. Heavier particles are having this more negative average. That's not really surprising. Heavier particles fall faster. Great. Alert the process. But we don't see a lot of effective shape here, which is sort of consistent with other investigations of shape at this point. Investigations of shape at this particular corner of the turbulence space. But we do see heavier particles falling faster. What's really interesting is if we go down here and we look at this fluctuating component, I can't average the fluctuating component because by definition that would go to zero, but I can average the square. And so I average the square of my fluctuating component. And I see a couple of interesting things. I see more mass leading to more slip. Leading to more slip, right? Even this small increase in specific gravity, you can see an overall increase in these fluctuations, an overall increase in the scatter around that one-to-one relationship between UP and UF. But the difference between the horizontal and the vertical components remains. So, with this decomposition, we have not removed gravity. We still have a difference between the gravity coupled. Between the gravity coupled and the non-gravity coupled dimensions. And so this is kind of weird. Buoyancy effects are still playing a role, they're damping the vertical component of the slip more than they are the horizontal components of the slip. And remember, in our theoretical decomposition, which is imperfect, but we're going to take this as a first pass with this problem, this is where all the traces of the particle history are supposed to go. The particle history are supposed to go. And what this tells us: if we read between the lines, it says that even though our turbulence is isotropic, our large particles are sampling the flow in a non-isotropic way due to the influence of gravity. And this is observable even with particles that are less than 1% denser than the surrounding fluid. And so that's kind of interesting and exciting and leads to this idea of. This idea of okay. Well, how can we decouple the effects of mass and the effects of buoyancy? And we want to also investigate the effects of shape. Again, it looks like here there's not too much variation with shape, but there might be some trends maybe sort of kind of starting to emerge. So it's also possible that shape is coupled to density. Coupled to density. And if we see some differences across shape, maybe those differences would emerge more if we made our particles heavier. And so you can check out the paper for more kind of pontification and speculation on that. But we don't really have anything significant to say about shape. And so one question sort of remains here to be asked, and that is how is the average vertical slip velocity related to the vertical slide. Slip velocity related to the vertical settling velocity in still water. We talked about turbulence alteration of settling velocity. We've seen some interesting things about slip velocity, but what does, I mean, how is the slip velocity related to the vertical settling velocity? So, I mean, here, what our slip velocity here is, this average slip, this is the average vertical velocity of our particles. So, we can consider this to be our average turbulence settling velocity. Settling velocity. And it turns out that our settling velocity, our vertical slip, is quite a lot less than the quiescent settling velocity. We observe reduced settling. And the lighter particles are reduced by a little bit more than 50% on average. The heavier particles are experiencing a little bit less of a reduction, but still a lot, right? Still a big reduction in settling velocity. And so if we come back to this figure from the Nielsen paper. From the Nielsen paper. I don't know why that's animated there. But if we look at where our data fall on this plot, we see our slightly heavier particles here in red. The reason they're over here is because their quiescent settling velocity is larger, right? So they move to the left on this plot, even though the turbulence is the same. Though the turbulence is the same. But we start seeing the exploration of this space over here, this space between these two curves. Stokes number greater than one should do some fast tracking stuff. Stokes number less than one should behave as a passive tracer. But what's in between, right? So we know heavier particles with a higher quiescent settling velocity are going to feel weaker turbulence. The turbulence is going to affect them less. So they're going to kind of end up over here occentrally. So, they're going to kind of end up over here asymptotically approaching one, no matter what. If the turbulence gets so weak that it's non-existent, you're going to have an unaltered settling velocity no matter what kind of particle you have. And so we're really curious then about this space because all of these particles are small heavy particles and those are inertial, but so are our large light particles. And when I say light, I mean they're still negatively buoyant, but they're really close to neutral, right? So they have inertial. To neutral, right? So they have inertia from their size, but not so much inertia from their mass. And that brings us back to the Stokes number. And if you've heard me give a talk before, you know that I will complain about this until the cows come home. But when we look at our Stokes number, we use the Stokes number because it reduces the parameter space so that a small heavy particle and a large light particle are effectively considered to be equivalent. But this is kind of a double-edged sword because a small heavy particle is Is kind of a double-edged sword because a small heavy particle and a large light particle don't behave equivalently in all situations. And this is especially true when the Stokes number is greater than one, when we really shouldn't be using Stokes flow at all. It's not Stokes flow. If our Reynolds numbers are somewhat high, then the Stokes number is maybe not even a great descriptor anyway. But if we plot, here's our Stokes number, right? If we plot our Stokes. If we plot our Stokes number space as a function of the specific gravity and the diameter of the particle, let's instead of using the Kolmogorov time scale as our fluid time scale, let's use an inertial time scale. So if our particle is larger than the Kolmogorov scale, then we should use a time scale that matches our particle's size scale. So that's pretty simple to do. We're going to scale it up like that. To scale it up like this. And you can find more details about that kind of scaling here in this paper. But effectively, we're using a time scale for our fluid that's the time scale of an eddy that's the same size as the equivalent diameter of one of our particles. Here, the d sub p is the sphere equivalent diameter. And so all of the stuff in the parentheses is constant for a given flow, a given tank, a given box of turbulence. And I can plot. And I can plot the Stokes number space for this flow. And you can see if I take a constant contour of Stokes number, then we see a sort of a difference in the gradient of the Stokes number. So if I look at, there's our Kolmogorov Tamp scale right there, or Kolmogorov length scale for reference. If I have a large and a light particle, it's going to be over. In a light particle, it's going to be over here: large diameter, small specific gravity. A large light particle, the Stokes number is a very strong function of the specific gravity. If I change the diameter, that's not really going to change the Stokes number very much. Changing the specific gravity, right, if I go in the vertical direction, if I look at the gradient in y here, changing the specific gravity is going to change the Stokes number real fast. And so we can see. And so we can see in this space, our Stokes number is really sensitive to changes in specific gravity, not too sensitive to changes in density. Over here, though, if I have a particle that's really small, but it's heavy, the Stokes number, if I increase the particle's density, isn't really going to change very much. But if I increase the particle's diameter even by a little bit, I'm going to see a quick change in the Stokes number. And the particles we talked about today are over here on this large light side. On this large light side of the plot. And so that seems to indicate or seems to support what we observe, which is that shape doesn't matter very much, because if I change the length scales, that's not really going to change the inertial response, my particle to turbulence. But if I change the specific gravity, even a tiny, tiny bit, then the particle should be really sensitive to that. And that's what we see. We have these really small departures from neutral buoyancy that show up. From neutral buoyancy, that show up pretty well in our analysis. So, I want to leave us here with that. We can talk more about it if you're interested. Major things we want to say, our settling velocity is reduced in turbulence. Shape doesn't really matter, at least not near neutral buoyancy. Our size and our mass effects are not independent, and our buoyancy effects are somehow influencing the way that the particle samples turbine. The way that the particle samples turbulence. We can try to remove gravity and it's still there. And lastly, just my personal soapbox, that the Stokes number can't really fully describe particle inertia if your particles are large, right? So we have to come up with a better way to talk about particle inertia to capture these kind of variations between particles that might have the same Stokes number. Okay, so I'm going to check where I am on time. I'm okay, not disastrous. And so I want to briefly tell you. And so I want to briefly talk about, so all of that was kind of work that I did during my PhD and a little bit after in collaboration with Evan Vriano and a couple of other excellent co-authors. But some newer stuff that we've been working on is this idea of density distribution. And so we know that microplastics are not always uniform in density. They are getting fouled. Are getting fouled, right? They're getting degraded. They're not necessarily going to stay the same. And if we have a cylinder, coming back to our semi-idealized shape particle land, if I have a cylinder that is uniform and density and it's falling just in a quiescent still water, I would expect it to turn like this. The pressure distribution around my cylinder makes this a stable falling configuration. Falling configuration. But if I take my cylinder and I make one side heavy and one side light, so the average density is still the same, then what I should see is in the uniform case, the buoyant and gravity forces are coaligned. There's no net torque, but here they're not, right? There's a net buoyant torque on this particle. So instead of settling in a broadside configuration, it would have to kind of come down. It would have to kind of come down like this. And that's that's kind of the stable position for this guy. Or so we would believe if we stopped at introductory fluid mechanics. And so we can already see that even if these two particles have the same average density, they might have different settling velocities. They have different cross-sectional areas, different drag coefficients, and these different orientations. But I want to dig a little deeper into how these particles actually do settle. Do settle. And so, this is primarily the work of a master's student who finished in my group a couple of years ago, Brandon Engel. And he made hydrogel cylinders, so the same process that we used for the previous study, but he made them in two modes, right? A uniform density and a compound density, where they had the same average density, but one side was heavy and one side was light on these particles. And he set up a hexagonal tank. We're imaging from two sides so that we can get. imaging from two sides so that we can get a three-dimensional picture of the particle's trajectory and orientation as it falls. We also have a camera looking up from the bottom. The red cameras here are just kind of zoomed out low-speed cameras and the two black ones here are high-speed cameras. So when the particle is done falling and it lands on the bottom of the tank we can take a picture and we can look at this the landing site and look at maybe how particles spread out as they fall. Spread out as they fall, perhaps differently between these two kinds of classes. We've got three different aspect ratios: one, two, and four. Here's a picture over here of what the whole thing looks like. And so again, this hydrogel refractive index mashing method gives us a little bit more optical access. We can do PIV. We can put a laser sheet up through the bottom of that tank and get just really simple two-dimensional two-components velocity in a plane. Plane. And so once we have our molded particles, we can get these are dyed. So the yellow is the light side and the red is the heavy side. But they're not actually this color naturally. So even though they look like candy, please don't eat them. So when we look at the landing sites, right, remember we have that camera coming up at the bottom of the tank. We can already see. The bottom of the tank, we can already see a difference. We always drop the cylinders in an orientation along the horizontal here, so the axis of the particle would go from zero to 180. And for the uniform density cylinders, they fall kind of pretty well distributed, right, around a tight circle in the center. It gets tighter and tighter the longer the Tighter and tighter the longer the cylinders are. The red here is probability distribution, not position. So don't be fooled by the angles there, right? This is the red is probability distribution. The actual landing sites are the black circles. But when we look at the compound density cylinders, we start seeing something weird. They're moving to the side and they drift. And this becomes more and more pronounced as the aspect ratio increases. And we'll learn why. And we'll learn why in just a second. So, okay, so these are not playing. And I'm going to try one more time because the next several slides are really important to be able to conceptualize this phenomenon. So I'm going to just restart the PowerPoint really quickly because that's what fixed it when we were proofing this right before we started. And I will reset it and hope that it finds the right codecs. Okay, yeah, we're good. Let me just share again. Thank you for your patience. Okay, so our short cylinders, aspert ratio of one, uniform on the left, compound on the right, we sort of see exactly what we expect. Sort of see exactly what we expect, but we get some oscillations here, and that's an interesting artifact. So, if we look at the trajectories, and this is from the side in X and Y, our uniform density cylinders are staying in this configuration with the axis of symmetry broadside, and they're kind of swinging around, and the compound density particles are tilting so that their axis of symmetry is vertical. Axis of symmetry is vertical and they're actually falling with quite a bit less oscillation. We can look at the bottom view as well of how they're moving in X and Z, and you can see a lot more kind of distribution around the dropping origin. Whereas for these guys, they're a little bit more stable. We can look at the angle of that axis of symmetry as they fall as well. As they fall as well, and see that the X, the we have, if this angle is zero, they're falling horizontally. We sort of see two modes here. Some of the uniform density cylinders are falling with their axis of symmetry vertical, which would be 90 degrees, and oscillating around that position. Some are here. This is an aspect of visual one, so we're a little bit, we don't have a dominant axis, right? Our axis of symmetry is the same. Right, our axis of symmetry is the same as our particle diameter, but these guys all fall effectively with that pointing axis of symmetry vertical. Moving on to the aspect ratio of two, and now I'm going to kind of speed up a little bit. Our uniform density cylinders are stable. They're falling broadside. And the trajectories are pretty straight. From the bottom, they don't spread out a lot. They're not oscillating a whole lot in the angle. Oscillating a whole lot in the angle, and their landing sites are pretty tightly clustered around the center of the tank. But then, if we look at the compound density cylinders, this is where it gets weird because we saw two kind of distinct modes. We saw this sort of stable mode where there's a little bit of an angle, it drips over to the side, and then there's a mode where they swing over like a pendulum and start kind of falling down in this oscillatory way. You can see that in the angle here, you can see in the trajectory. Here. You can see in the trajectories a little bit. And then from the bottom, you can see an average drift over to the left. The red line here is the angle of our dropper angle. So if our cylinders were dropped at a slight angle to the x-axis in this case. So that's kind of interesting. And we'll come back to it. But let's take a look at our aspect ratio 4 here. Of four. Here, again, we see this very stable, straight down, minimal oscillation in the angle here. But the compound density cylinders fall at this drift. And effectively, what's going on here is there's an angle of attack here that's generating a force that's pulling the cylinders to the side as they fall. And so we can see this also in the angle fluctuations and in the landing. Situations and in the landing sites, right? So the compound density ones are getting pulled all the way over to the side. And so let's come back to what we actually care about, which is the average settling velocity. And we can see some strong effects, not only of shape due to variation in the cross-sectional area, but also in this mode of falling, right? The compound density particles fall differently and therefore have a smaller settling velocity. So I'm going to define three different To define three different falling modes. Mode zero is the broadside stable orientation. Mode one is this kind of angled lifting configuration. And mode two is the pendulum where we go swing the heavy side down and kind of oscillate around that vertical position. And so the vertical velocity here is on the left. We have our fastest falling cylinders or the compound density aspect ratio of two cylinders. And then we also see differences in the lateral velocity. Differences in the lateral velocity. So W here is pretty constant because of the way that we drop them, but U is the side, right? They're drifting to the side. There's a net lateral velocity in some of these particles. And so we were really mystified by this, by the fact that our aspect ratio of two particles were falling in seemingly two different modes. The particles should be identical, but we saw a really distinct separation between these two behaviors. Behaviors. And our grad students, we realized after he presented the data, we were like, when did you do these experiments? And he said, well, I did some of them over Christmas. And over the Christmas break, the heat was turned off. And he had not taken the temperature of the water to determine the viscosity. And we were like, what if the Reynolds number was actually different between this set of experiments and that set of experiments? And so. Of experiments, and so he actually put a bunch of ice in the tank to cool down the water and effectively change the viscosity. And he also used immersion circulators to heat the water so that we would be able to change the viscosity that way and then create some shifts in the Reynolds number without changing anything about the particles. And lo and behold, we did see a big change here. When he heated up the water and decreased the kinematic viscosity, Decrease the kinematic viscosity, we saw most of the cylinders fell in that pendulum configuration. Whereas in the cold water, it was about 50-50, right? So we have, or sorry, not about 50-50. At the cold water, we had most of the particles falling in mode one and no particles in mode two, which is our pendulum you configuration. Which is our pendulum configuration. And so we're kind of hypothesizing that this change in behavior is really, really sensitive to Reynolds number and looking, we're trying to define a sort of a transition regime right around a Reynolds number of 300 or so. We don't have enough information to really pin this down, but if you are a Reynolds number of kind of below this, then you're going to fall in that stable angled configuration. Configuration. And if it's higher, then you're going to swing down and kind of act like a pendulum. So, obviously, the next step is then to look at the hydrodynamics and look at what's going on there to see if that is changing. And we do see some differences here. We see in our mode zero, our stable horizontal configuration, you have some attached vorticity. As would be expected, you have some still some. Some still somewhat attached vorticity over here in the stable configuration. And it's not over here until mode two that you start to really see shedding. And so we think that there's a lot of really interesting interactions going on in the wake here, but we need to look at this in a lot more detail. So if anybody has ideas, I would love to hear them. Okay, so we're exploring more shapes and more mass distributions. We'll hopefully extend those turbulence eventually. I have an undergraduate student. Um, I have an undergraduate student, undergraduate student right now who is working on using actual plastic instead of hydrogels because we're focusing on microplastics as an application area. But you may have noticed that I have not actually used plastic at all so far in this talk. And so Brayden is hard at work looking at different mass distributions, density distributions, and more than just what we had seen in the previous study. And we also are curious about these really subtle differences. Subtle differences in density. So, my master's student, Annalie, is working on trying to grow biofilms on nurdles, on plastic nurdles, and seeing how that impacts their rise velocity. And she also has done some work with fibers as well. She built this, there's a rising nurdle there, it's positively buoyant. She also built this very cool bidirectional flume. It can be run in both a horizontal configuration and a vertical configuration. And we're hoping to try. Configuration, and we're hoping to try to grow some biofilms on our particles this way. It'll allow us to grow them in different levels of turbulence, grow them when the particle is floating on the surface, grow the particle when it's fully submerged and allowed to tumble. We've designed the tank to if it matches the velocity around the flume matches the rise velocity of the plastic, then they'll just kind of stay here and be submerged in the turbulence. And so this is all exciting, but it's all very preliminary. So I don't want to talk too much about it right now. Too much about it right now, but I do want to hat to these awesome students that are working on these projects. So I'm almost out of time, and so I wanted to kind of zoom right back out onto this question of where do we go from here. So we learned from our study of compound density cylinders or non-uniform particles. Okay, our cylinders fell in three different modes. What does that mean? It means that having a non-uniform density affects settling velocity. We cannot necessarily use an average density. Necessarily use an average density to parametrize settling velocity. We need to know if our particles are uniform or non-uniform, and we just have a lot of work to do there on how to really parametrize settling velocity. In our cylinders, we saw that our falling mode depends on both the aspect ratio and the density distribution. I'm going to paraphrase this over to you, shape matters, we should think about it. Third, we saw a transition between modes that might be really sensitive to a threshold of a critical Reynolds number. Of a critical Reynolds number. And this tells us that very subtle changes in density can create really big changes in settling, which might explain how biofouling can pull a particle under, right? Because we have these very slow, gradual increases in density that might not be huge, but might change the settling velocity a lot. And then also we have this idea that our density distribution strongly affected where the cylinders landed, and that kind of raises issues of dispersion. So, how are our So, how are our microplastics being dispersed? And how does this depend on the uniformity or non-uniformity of their mass distribution? And so, that's how I will leave it. Looking forward to some good discussions with all of you. I want to thank all of the collaborators and students that worked on this stuff, as well as our funding sources. And there's my email address and my website if you want to follow up, and I'm happy to take any questions. Thank you very much. Nick, we've got some time for questions. Thanks, Margaret. That was really interesting. I really liked the last section that you talked about, in particular, this talk about density distribution. And it struck me that a lot of the sort of mode transitions you're seeing look similar to a lot of what's been done over the past few years with gyrotactic plankton. And I'm wondering if you've, if there's any, if you think there's any. if you've um if there's any if you think there's any connection to the literature or if you've explored that or if that's something on your on your radar screen that is not on my radar screen but it is now um okay yeah um so you're gonna have to refresh my memory because i am not a plankton ecologist remind me that gyrotactic is um if the center of uh center of mass is offset from the center of buoyancy then you'll get a gravitational torque if you're spun a little bit and that leads to people have done this in like Taylor Greenboard to see To people who've done this in like Taylor Greenbortices, and you get spinning, and you get laning, and you get all sorts of okay, okay, excellent. Yeah, I mean, I think that this offset between the center of mass and center of gravity, you know, obviously there are a lot of critters that use that. The other set, the other hat that I wear, the bio-locomotion stuff, if you know the other side of my lab, right? Some of the critters we study also have that kind of writing response. But I don't think that's what this is, right? This isn't exactly a writing response. I think in the mode two case, Think in the mode two case, it is, right? It's an effect of inertia, right? You have a buoyant torque that swings it down. And that's what I expected to see. What I didn't expect to see was the angled configuration, which we actually did, I didn't present it here, but we did some follow-up computational simulations with a collaborator. And we couldn't see it in the experiment, but if you decrease the viscosity in the simulation, the ones that were falling at an angle were actually doing this. So this was the stable. So, this was the stable falling angle. So, the pressure distribution then has got to be leading these guys to fall in a stable way. And I think we've seen a lot of this in much, much larger cylinders. Some of the literature we looked at for this project was actually Navy stuff on if you accidentally drop a torpedo off a ship, where's it go? But yeah, I think there's some really interesting stuff here. Interesting stuff here. I'm not sure if that answers your question or raises new ones. My question was just: is there a relation? The answer is, I guess, maybe. So, maybe in the kind of the pendulum mode, but I'm not sure about the other one. Yeah. Bruce? Well, thanks so much for simultaneously inspirational talk, but also kind of depressing. One thing we like to do is just assume the Viscount. Do is just assume the viscosity of water is constant. Right. Adding that as a new parameter. Oh my God. So that's just a comment. Right. Well, I mean, to be fair, we really stretched the limits of the viscosity on this one to try to tease out that threshold. So I don't know if a difference of, you know, a few degrees would make a difference. Okay, but still, you know, wintertime settling as opposed to summertime settling. Right. Yeah, that is true. I mean, because when our experience, our student was doing the experiments, we were not. Our student was doing the experiments. We were not aware that he was in the unheated building that was 50 degrees doing the experiments. So I try to take better care of my students than that. But yeah, I guess if I was going to ask a question, of course, the other difference would be the density of the water. And I appreciate that. It's probably because you're thinking of vortex shedding that you're referring to viscosity as being the dominant thing. But do you think the density of the water might also have played a role in? Absolutely. I mean, I think it's important then for us to remember, right, that if Remember, right, that if the Reynolds number is that important, and if there are microplastics aplenty that are around some kind of critical transition threshold, then the difference between freshwater and saltwater might be enough, right? You might see a dramatically different settling velocity of the same piece of plastic if you hit some kind of threshold, right? And we have a lot more work to do, obviously, on identifying where this threshold might be. But yeah, I think that that could be significant. Yeah, I was just thinking how the density. Yeah, I was just thinking how the density might switch to mode of behavior. Because I think all of your particles had the same mean density. Yes, they did. Yeah. And so, yeah, it was just a question of could density also affect, you know, it's maybe trying to fall a little bit more slowly in the denser water. Maybe that also could affect the vortex shedding in the transition. Yeah, I think in the denser water, and this kind of speaks to something I'm sure a lot of you have noticed as well, is that we've been focusing a lot on ocean-borne plastics and paying a little bit less attention. Borne plastics and paying a little bit less attention to what they're doing in freshwater systems. And I've sort of seen an uptick in the literature over the past couple of years focusing on these freshwater systems. But if you have a difference in the Reynolds number where the Reynolds number is just a little bit higher in freshwater, then you might see significantly faster settling. And I'm really just spitballing, and I want to emphasize that we have this super idealized case, right? Microplastics are not bipartite cylinders, but it certainly speaks to a lot of bipartisan. But it certainly speaks to a lot of questions that remain unanswered. Indeed. Thanks again for your great talk. Thanks. Thank you. Claudia, we'll take maybe one more question and then we'll move to our break. Yeah, thank you, Margaret. That was a great talk. Haven't worked much with this hydrogel, but if I understand correctly, inside the hydrogel, is the same fluid as outside? The same fluid as outside, correct? So, when you, yeah, when you increase the temperature, did you make your cylinder with the same temperature water as the ambient? No, we didn't. And there is that problem, and we've tried that before because we've tried to make the particles denser by manipulating the viscosity or adding salt to the water. And the time scale of the exchange between the water that the hydrogel. Between the water that the hydrogel has absorbed is not that long, but it's on the order of minutes, right? So we can drop one of our particles that was made with this kind of water. And if the trajectory is measured immediately, it gave us a headache when we were trying to do the same thing in the turbulence, right? Because if the particles are remaining submerged, they're going to equalize with the surrounding water and you're going to get the same, roughly the same density distribution difference that you had before. But yeah, no, it's there are other people also that have been. There are other people also that have been messing around with this refractive index mash method. And so I think there are probably some good tools to use. If anybody's interested in that, find me in the gather space because we've been working hard to get those methods accessible to people. And these particles, these gels, they don't change their property when the temperature is too hot or too cold. I'm just wondering if those changes you saw just because of the particular particle that you're using made this average. That you're using made with agriculture, than with some other plastic or things. That's a fair question. That's a very fair question. I would think no for the temperatures that we were using and across the time scales that we were using, right? Because we had the particles and we dropped them in the tank. I don't know if they would have had time to change with that temperature distribution over that short a time scale. But one of the reasons also that we're trying to repeat these experiments with actual Trying to repeat these experiments with actual plastic is to get a better idea of whether this is whether this is real, whether that actually depends on something that's a vagary of our experimental setup versus something that's actually happening. And the preliminary results look like the same kinds of things are happening. But yeah, another question is the boundary condition on the particle itself, right? Because if you have a gel, you have to consider that you might have a sort of a semi-slip boundary. Have a sort of a semi-slip boundary at the very, very small scale because of the pores in the gel, whereas a solid particle would have the no-slip that you would see in a real past. Although I think hopefully Kai will tell us more about the surface properties of particles later in his talk and how we might expect or not expect particles to behave like solid pieces. Great, thank you. Great.
