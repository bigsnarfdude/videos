Thanks for inviting me to talk. Yeah, okay. There's a few, I wanted to like announce something before I start talking about this that's completely unrelated. But a lot of you have graduate students. And if your graduate students are interested in derived categories, the American Mathematical Society has approved a math research. A math research community on drived categories for the summer of 2023. The application isn't up yet, but if you have students and you want them to learn about drived categories, please let them know about it. Okay, so I'm out of breath already, but yeah, okay, all right. I'll be talking about test ideals and its mixed characteristic. A mixed characteristic. This was joint work with Christopher Hagen and Carl Schwed. And I've put the archive paper thing on there. I should thank Christopher Hagen and Carl Schwed because they gave me the opportunity to learn about this stuff. So yeah, first of all, a quick outline. First, I'm going to talk about the characteristics. First, I'm going to talk about the characteristic zero situation. Then I'm going to tell you about characteristic not equal to zero. And then I'll tell you about some of the results in this paper. Okay, so in the characteristic zero case, like this whole story of test ideals from Test ideals from my point of view begins with multiplier ideals in characteristic zero. So I want to tell you about that first. So okay, so why multiplier ideals? There's two reasons why I like them, which kind of give an outline for the first part of my talk. First of all, Talk. First of all, they sort of allow us to encode information about singularities. And additionally, they satisfy nice vanishing theorems, which is helpful and useful and makes me happy. Okay, so So a lot of talks have already mentioned multiplier ideals or hinted at the existence of them. But I want to take like a few minutes, a solid few minutes to like go over all of the pieces of the definition of a multiplier ideal. There's three parts. The first thing that I want to define is a Q divisor. Well, I guess, first of all, let's. Well, I guess first of all, let me put the setup on the board. So, X is going to be a smooth variety over a field K, and I'm going to assume for the first part of the talk that the characteristic of K is zero and also that K is algebraically closed. Okay, so what is a Q divisor on X? So A Q divisor is just a divisor. So it's a finite formal linear combination of irreducible codimension one subvarieties. So this z is my irreducible codimension one subvarieties. And this a sub i, my coefficients, are just going to be rational numbers. Very Rational numbers. Very exciting. But I can take, what do I call it? The rounddown of D. I'll write that as 4D. And this is just going to be the same thing, but I'm going to force my coefficients in my linear combination to be integers. So I'll take the round down of those. Of those. And the same adjectives still apply to Q divisors as we use on normal devices, like, okay, normal is a bad word, as we use on usual divisors, like effective. So I'll call these effective if my coefficients are bigger than or equal to zero. Okay. So that's the first piece that we need in the definition of a multiplier ideal. Need in the definition of a multiplier ideal. The second piece, I'm not going to give you an actual definition of, I'm going to wave my hands at it a bit. But there's lots of ways to learn about this if you don't already know what it is. And that is a log resolution. So a log resolution of a Q divisor D on X is just going to be Is just going to be a proper birational map. So this is proper and birational. Satisfying certain properties. That's really helpful. But I would just think of this for the purpose of this talk, because I'll only use it for multiplier ideals, as being a more restrictive form of. A more restrictive form of a resolution of singularities. So a theorem due to Hiranaka says that log resolutions exist. I'm being hand-wavy on purpose. This won't be consequential for the rest of the talk, but. Consequential for the rest of the talk. But okay, we have these two things. I need one more thing to define a multiply ideal, and that is the relative canonical divisor. So given a proper birational map or a log resolution, I can define the relative canonical divisor. And I'm going to write that as k of x prime over x. And this is just going to be the canonical divisor of x prime minus uh oh, the pullback. I always, it takes me a minute with these things of the canonical divisor x. Okay, now I'll give you a definition of. Now, I'll give you a definition of the multiplier ideal. Okay, so I'm going to fix a log resolution of some divisor D, the multiplier ideal J of D is going to be defined as. Is going to be defined as, okay, the push forward of O of X prime twisted by the relative canonical divisor minus, I'm running out of room, but we're subtracting the rounddown of the pullback of the divisor. Okay. Okay. Any questions so far? Is anyone angry yet? Yeah. Definitely got questions, but how is D related to the math pipe? Oh, yeah. So it's sort of like maybe D is like singular and you're resolving it to make it not a dumb question, also. Yeah, so a few quick facts. So, a few quick facts. This is an ideal sheaf. Shocking. And also, the multiplier ideal is independent of the log resolution that we do. Okay, so Okay, so how do we use this? Example. Have some examples for us. Okay, so I'm going to let X be just a complex plane. So this is spec of C joint X Y. And I want to consider the cusp given by. Given by x squared minus y cubed equals zero. So if I draw, obviously this isn't a picture of this, but because I'm in the complex plane, but it looks something like this. It's a cusp. So if I do the work of computing a log resolution and plugging this into the definition, you can check. You can check that the multiplier ideal of C times A is the ideal generated by XY if C is equal to 5 over 6 and just O X or trivial otherwise. Okay, so a few things I want to mention before I talk about what this means. This means if I take a log resolution of this, blowing up once doesn't, like, that's not a log resolution. I need to do it multiple times to satisfy the conditions that I haven't given you. But that's good to keep in mind if you ever try to do this on your own. Okay, so what does this mean? So this was confusing to me when This was confusing to me when I was trying to learn about this stuff. This ideal generated by X and Y is smaller than the whole ring. So somehow when C is equal to 5 over 6, I have a bad or badly behaved singularity. You mean C is bigger than or equal to 5, 6? Bigger, yes, thank you. Bigger than or equal to 5, 6. And I guess what. And I guess what I want instead of otherwise is for C between 0 and 5, 6. So compare that to the next example. If I just have B being the vanishing set of X squared plus Y squared, you can check that the multiplier ideal of Of c times b is of x for c between 0 and 1. So somehow, because I get a smaller thing that's not like it's smaller than the entire ring itself, somehow A has a more badly behaved singularity than D does. Okay. And so if x isn't smooth, I can also define a notion of a multiplier ideal. And I think this is how people normally just start off with defining it. But that's not how my brain works. But that's not how my brain works. So when X isn't smooth, my canonical divisor is just a V divisor, and then I have trouble pulling it back. So I want to promote this to be a Q Cardi A divisor. And to do that, I'll just add another divisor, Delta, to kind of like perturb this thing. To kind of like perturb this thing to make it Q cardi A, and this is called a boundary divisor. And I require this thing to be Q party A. And then my multiplier ideal is going to be, I'll write it as X, Delta. x comma delta. So this is going to be the push forward of O of X prime of my relative canonical divisor minus the round down of the pullback of k of x plus delta plus my divisor d. And so when when delta is zero, I get this. When delta is zero, I get the same definition that I've already written down, and everyone's happy. And yeah, it works. Okay. So I hope I've convinced you that multiplier ideals are good for detecting the badness of singularities. And now I should maybe tell you about some vanishing theorems that they satisfy. Okay, so Okay, so is everyone good with Codira vanishing? Because I can put it on the board. Can put it on the board. Okay, I don't have to do it. Okay, yeah, so okay, a classical vanishing theorem. The first vanishing theorem I learned about is Kodira vanishing, which says that if X is a projective variety and L is an ample divisor, Then I have that h i of o of x kx plus l is zero for i bigger than zero. Okay, so there are stronger results. In particular, Kauamata Baywig, I always pronounce names wrong. I always pronounce names wrong. I'm really sorry. I apologize ahead of time. So we can improve this. Okay, so if I take L to be an integral. If I take L to be an integral divisor on X and D an effective Q divisor. And so because of the conditions, this might not seem like it's a stronger result, but I promise it is. So let's suppose that L minus D is big enough. So let's suppose that L minus D is big enough, and also that D has simple normal crossing support. Okay, so if these conditions are satisfied, then We get, so this is continued to this next board that h i of x of x of monical divide here plus l minus the round down of b is zero for I figured. Where I bigger than zero. And I guess I should note that if d is zero and l is just ample, then we get codira vanishing. And as a consequence of this, we get a global generation result. So if I fix a very ample divisor. A very ample divisor B. And just again say that D is an effective Q divisor. And again, yeah, L is integral and L minus D is big enough. Then I have that OX of Kx plus L plus C times my divisor B ten. Divisor B captured with the multiplier ideal of D is globally generated for C bigger than or equal to the dimension of my variety. Okay. So this is quite nice. I hope you agree. Okay. So you might be wondering what happens when the characteristic of your variety isn't zero? That's a good question. And so that brings me to the second part of my talk. And I'm going to change the setup. And I'm going to change the setup here. I'm going to keep it on this board so that we remember it. Okay, so RM is going to be an excellent local ring. Of residual characteristic P, where P is bigger than zero. So, yeah, and I'm going to take X over R to be proper integral as. To be proper integral and of dimension D. So Okay, there's a few problems in characteristic not equal to zero. If I'm trying to define like the analogous type of thing as a multiplier ideal. So, first of all, I don't have like a well-established theory of the resolution of singularities, which is what my log resolution was. And that was a really important part of the definition of a multiplier ideal. So, that's bad. That's one thing going wrong. Another thing going wrong is I don't have Kodir vanishing anymore or any sort of Or any sort of analog theorem to that. So I'm not in great shape to define a multiplier ideal, but thankfully, people that have existed long before me have developed the theory of test ideals. And so with test ideals, you can get similar global generation results. Results. Global, that's not, yeah, globally generated, what I just wrote on the board. And you can sort of tiptoe around your resolution of singularity problem by using Frobenius and other vanishing theorems. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about mixed characteristics. So we're in this setup and We're in this setup, and I need to define a few more things. So, okay, so the goal here is to work on something that admits vanishing theorems, okay, because my scheme X in mixed characteristic at this point. In mixed characteristic at this point does not. So I'm going to let k of x bar be the absolute integral closure of k of x. And I'm going to define x plus, as in Kevin's talk, to be the limit. To be the limit over finite surjective. So I'm going to write this out in words. Okay, so it'll be the limit over finite surjective maps f from y to x, where y is normal and integral. And we'll also have a fixed embedding of k of y into k of x bar. Okay. So you might be wondering why I'm telling you about X plus. Spoiler, it has vanishing theorems. But before I tell you about the vanishing theorems or the vanishing theorem, some quick. Some quick facts. X Plus is indeed esteemed, although it's not really well behaved. So it's not usually an Ethereum, even if X is. I guess that's the only factor that I want to write down. But I'm going to let mu be the canonical map. mu be the canonical map from x plus to x so that i guess that should be part of my setup but yeah okay so we have an analog of kalmata vaywig vanishing on it um due to bot and okay i don't have all of the authors of this paper written down i just have the first letters the seven author paper that's already been talked about That's already been talked about. The most general version of this theorem, I believe, is in that paper. So let's see: E, M, P, S, T, W, W. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to take. I'm going to take line bundle L to be big and semi-ample. And for i less than the dimension of my scheme x, we have That this vanishes. So I believe Kevin already talked about this. So sorry if you already know all about this, but I'm writing it down on the board again. We have a vanishing theorem, which is very exciting because X is quite poorly behaved. So the idea here is I've got X. I want to define like test ideals or did I mention that test? Yes, I did mention test ideals. Okay, good. I want to define like a notion of test ideals on X, but I don't satisfy any nice vanishing theorems. So So I'm gonna move up to X plus and work on there where I do have vanishing theorems. Even though it's nasty. I remember asking Carl about X plus because I was trying to understand it and it was bad. It was a yeah, okay. So yeah, basically I'll just push forward and pull. Basically, I'll just push forward and pull back along μ to say things about stuff on X. And with that in mind, so for a Q divisor D on X, I want to view D on X plus, right? x plus right so let me just write this out I'll define the push forward of O of X plus of the pullback of B to be the co-limit along my maps F that I told you about over there of push forward of F of O of Y O of Y, the floor of the pool back of F. Okay, so this gives us we get a sheaf O X plus the pullback of D on X plus. Okay. Yeah, so before I tell you about anything else, I want to mention that most of the results in this paper that I've put on the first board are written. First board are written in terms of local cohomology, and this is something that I wasn't very familiar with. And I would argue I'm still not very familiar with it. But like this whole project was very unfamiliar to me when I started it. So I wondered, what's the deal with local cohomology? Why do we need to use this? So I want to tell you why before I tell you anything else. Because this was a big issue. Because this was a big issue for me. Yeah, so this is going to be really hand-wavy, and I'm sorry, but if I take X and L to be the same thing that they were over there over a field, stare duality tells me that I have this kind of duality. So So and then I can take the MATLAS dual and get so let's see. I need to what when I take the dual um okay just you do the shared duality and then just making sure the context is clear. Just making sure the context is clear. Yes. Yes. So before you're overfield, now you're not over. Yes. Thank you. So okay, so MATLAB's duality gives me This kind of statement. The problem is: okay, this is just how I think about this. Don't take it too technically, but I don't know what's going on on this side. So I want to look at the local picture, local cohomology picture. Was that too hand-wavy? At least omega X doesn't make sense on X plus. Well, yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, exactly. What does omega x plus look like? I don't know. Maybe someone else knows, but I don't know. So yeah, we'll look at the local picture. Should I say anything else about that? I don't have anything else to say about that. So yeah, okay, so with this. So, with this idea, this is just an idea. It's not, don't take it too technically again. But so with this in mind, this idea in mind, we can start to define what a test ideal is on X using vanishing theorems and stuff from X plus. Okay. So Kevin already mentioned this. So he did all of the hard work, and I'm just going to write it on the board. But so in the characteristic P case, when you're defining test ideals, you can use Robenius invariant sections to do this. We don't have that in the mixed characteristic case. Mixed characteristic case. So we'll use trace invariant sections instead. And so the seven-author paper uses B0 to write this. And I should mention that Takamatsu and Yoshikawa wrote this as T0. So if you look at their paper, it's different notation. Yeah, okay. So Okay, so for a Q divisor D and a divisorial sheath OX M, we can define what these trace invariant sections are. So, I'm just going to write down basically the same thing Kevin already wrote down, but it's worth having on the board again, I guess. So it's the intersection over these finite maps of the image of H naught of Y. I'm going to run out of room. Um okay, so this is the uh intake of this map, and then I'm gonna map it to this is not good board work, but I'm just taking the image of this map to little sections of Alexa Bam. Elizabeth Bam and these are my trace and variant sections or I guess less stable is also what it is called What it is called. Okay, and with this, now we can define what a test ideal is. And if you haven't noticed already, my board work is getting progressively sloppier because these are really long things to write. Okay, so yeah, okay, so I'm gonna take A to be a sufficiently ample advisor. Then the plus test ideal, which I'm gonna write. As what did I do here? Yeah, okay. I can't tell the difference between A's and deltas in my notes. So that's great. No, that is a No, that is a delta. No, A is A is sufficiently ample. What is? Oh boy. Okay, A is sufficiently ample. We'll figure out what delta is in a minute. We'll define this test ideal to be the subsheaf. I need to go at least from the previous that would make sense. Okay, I'm going to put a D there then of O of X so that this subsheaf tensored with O X of A is globally generated. Ah, yes. Ah, yes, yeah. That's the D over here by B naught of X D O X of A and this is a subset of global sections. Okay. So, I should probably tell you about some of the results of the paper that's on the Of the paper that's on the board. I don't remember what time I started, also. About 11:07, I think, or okay. Well, this was a quick talk. But section three, results. Okay, so first of all, this definition of tau plus doesn't Of tau plus doesn't depend on the choice of A. So that's good. And if the canonical divisor plus D is Q cardi A. Then this plus test ideal agrees with the test ideal, like the usual test ideal for characteristic P. Okay, um yeah, so the first thing that I want to mention. That I want to mention on this is the global generation result. So there are a lot of different theorems in this paper. I have chosen a small subset of them to talk about. Okay, so the global generation result says. Says, so we'll suppose that KX plus M is a Cartier divisor so that M minus D is big and semi-ample. I'll suppose that OX of L is globally generated in ample. And for M bigger than or equal to D, where D is the dimension of the closed fiber. Yeah, okay, so for m bigger than or equal to d, we have that plus test ideal tensored with that this thing is globally generated by. By where should I write this? This is more difficult to write down than I can. Okay, yeah, so this test ideal tensored with that thing is globally generated. I B naught of X D O X of A X plus N plus little N times L. And I guess I should mention that the proof of this is similar to the characteristic peak case using a SCODA-like complex. Go to like complex. Yeah. Okay. That's all I have to say about global generation. But I also wanted to mention that this definition of a test ideal is nice because it commutes with localization. What should I say about this? This is not going to be precise, but I'm going to write it down. Don't get mad at me, please. As you would hope, that like if I take the test ideal of some open subject. Of some open subset, and then I restrict to the localization, I get the same test ideal. So, no, you look unhappy. What's you? It just uh right, okay. So, if you have two compact locations, is available. Yeah, I guess it, I mean, I'm going to confuse myself and get even more nervous than I already am. So I'm going to stop talking now. Thank you for listening. Any questions? I'm curious about this. Could you move over? I can repeat the question too. Yeah. Is there anything to be said about like different varieties have the same X plus? And does that say anything about their relationship? Okay, so the question was if it's possible for two varieties to have the same X pluses and if that says anything about the varieties that you started with. Anything about the varieties that you started with? And my answer is: I've never thought of that because, in me trying to understand X plus, I was very confused. Wouldn't it be the case that most, that's very common? I mean, it's, I mean, the number of possible R pluses is almost, you know, it's very limited. You know, it's very limited because you can actually start with regular rates, right? Right. Yeah. So, um, I don't know if the microphone picked that up, but a member of the audience commented that that should be pretty common. I mean, X plus is huge, so. If y to X is a finite map, then Y and X want the same X plus. Yeah, okay. So if the map from Y to X is finite, then they should have the same X pluses. X plus is so could you think about it as some sort of universal uniformization or universal cover kind of thing? Are there any other questions? So is the idea of going to X plus like really the parallel of using R plus algebras? Okay, so the question was, is the idea of going to X plus just like the idea of using Just like the idea of using R plus algebras? I think so. Yeah. Any other questions? Do we have any questions from the Zoom audience? No. Well, it looks like no, but not in the comments at least. I mean, you can unmute yourself and say something, or maybe I can. I think that's it. Soon, or maybe I think that's right. Yeah, yeah. If you have a question, you can unmute yourself. Okay, then shall we thank the speaker again?
