He's physically here in Mexico, so he's going to take the floor. So, Daniel is a leader in SARWAL mechanics. He came here from Penn State and he will be giving one of these longer talks for us to thought-provoking exercise for us to open. Provoking exercise for us to open our minds a bit more. So, again, if anybody has during the talk also questions, you can post it on the Slack or here on the team. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, we have an hour session. I'm not going to talk an hour. I'm going to really give some background. Going to really give some background into molecular models of plant cell walls. And in particular, I'll be ending up with the model that Yao Yang presented at the beginning of this morning session. The three co-authors, four co-authors, well, anyway, the participants in this are three Zhang. So Yao Zhang, Su Lin Zhang, and Tian Zhang. They are not related to one another. Uh, are not related to one another. Uh, Yao is now a professor in China, Tia is also a professor in China. Sule Zhang is a professor at Penn State University, and this coarse-grained model that we'll be talking about really started with him talking to me after a seminar and saying, I have some ideas of how to approach this. And then Gene E. Yu will be talking tomorrow about the experimental mechanics of the onion cell wall that we've been developing. That we've been developing. And so this is related. Okay. So this is relevant to understanding things like wall elasticity, plasticity, yield threshold, wall stress, and ultimately, we hope mechanisms of cell wall loosening and cell grow. And so for a long time, I've wondered things like what's how is forth being transferred within the cell wall from one material element to another material element? What's that transfer mechanism? And what's the That transfer mechanism, and what's the physical nature of wall elasticity? What polymers are bearing that reversible force? And so these are things I wondered about. And also, I got into this work because when we were trying to investigate how expansions cause cell wall loosening, so we discovered expansions of the wall loosening factor in loose cell wall creep some years ago. And as we investigated what Years ago. And as we investigated what they were doing, I became more and more mystified because it didn't fit into the normal models of cell wall. Those models of cell wall did not make much sense. So I started rethinking about things. So let me just begin at the beginning, a parts of this for primary cell walls. I know you're not all cell wall people. So three major components of cellulose, they come in the form of stiff microfibrils. They provide the mechanical bias of the cell wall. Mechanical bias of the cell wall. One of the aspects of cellulose microfibrils that's been overlooked in the cell wall modeling field is that cellulose has a strong ability to bind laterally to one another. And as you'll see, this comes in importantly in our model. Hemicelluloses are flexible chains. They bind tightly to cellulose. And sectins are flexible hydrophilic gel formers. They have extensive but weak contacts with cellulose. So this is a physical way. Cellulose. So, this is a physical way of looking at the components of the cell wall. We want to then know how these polymers interact to make a strong and yet extensible cell wall. And here we come into what we mean by models of cell walls. So, there are lots of models of cell walls put forward by plant wall biochemists. And I was faced with the conundrum that polymer physicists think about models very differently from the way wall. Very differently from the way wall biochemists think about models. And so, just to show you that, I've gone through the literature and pulled out various wall depictions, I'll call them, rather than models, depictions of cell walls from the cell wall literature. So the first molecular representation I could find was this one by Fry Wiesling. He shows cellulose microfibrils. And note, the microfibrils are not contacting one another. This is despite his own images. This is despite his own images show of contacting with cellulose microfibrils. I think this feature of microfibril organization has infected the whole field, or at least set the bias for the whole field, ignoring the fact that cellulose-cellulose interactions could be avoided. So then I just go through a series of images from the cell wall field without trying to explain them, just so you get a sense of the different representations people. The different representations people have of cell walls, trying to depict various aspects of the cell wall, and I'm just doing this chronologically. All right, and then here's another one by Fry. And they have different purposes when they put forward, but these are all considered cell wall models by wall biochemists. And I'll continue doing more recent times. Okay, Recent times. So, we might call these depictions of cell walls representing certain concepts of this. And of course, the issue is these things are not quantitative. Any predictions they make are based upon hunches you have, intuitions of what you're seeing rather than actual quantitative computational predictions. And so, I think these various models, quote unquote, predictions of cell wall can be categorized into three main. Categorizes the three main concepts. So, the one on the left here is that the wall is a pectic hydrogel reinforced by cellulose microfibrils. We see this sort of statement commonly these days. The second major idea in the field is that the matrix is a giant macromolecule that's non-covalently bonded to the cellulose microfibrous through the xyloblucan. This is the classic idea of Albersheim, and it's still represented in the field today. In the field today, I know the one that's most been most dominant in recent years is what I call the tethered network hypothesis. So, this is the idea of again cellulose microfibrils being physically separated from one another, tethered together through xyloblucans, which bond non-covalently to the surface of cellulose. All right, so note the well-space microphone goes through all of this. So, we, before we started getting to the modeling idea, we wanted to know how can we test these concepts? Know how can we test these concepts? So instead of just using these depictions as a parts list and a cartoon, we wanted to use them as, consider them as hypotheses. How do we test these hypotheses? So Yao already talked about the model system that we've been using for some of our wall mechanics. We can make these epidermal peels. We get images of the surface of the cell wall. The wall in this onion epidermal. The wall in this onion epidermis is a polylamellate structure, cross-lamellate structure, and we can image it. We can also do mechanical assays, stretch-drain analyses and creep and things like that. And so we could ask questions like which polymers influence the mechanics of the cell wall, and how do different mechanical assays or do different mechanical assays give equivalent results? So if you measure a modulus with an indentation, With an indentation, does it tell you anything about a modulus in the tensile direction? And note, modulus, there are lots of different kinds of moduli, and I think the field has been pretty sloppy in mixing and conflating different kinds of moduli one with another. All right, so this was published in that citation down below. We did these four assays. So, first, the top one is chemoreological creep. All right, so we Orheological creep. All right, so we plant the wall under constant force, we add a protein, and we ask that the cell wall undergo irreversible extension or creep. The second assay is one where we stress strain of the cell wall. We do it through two cycles, and from this we can get elastic and plastic stiffness, or we measure its compliances. The third one is where we use the AFM to indent the surface of the cell wall, and you get what I call an indentation. Get what I call an indentation modulus. So it's a kind of a stiffness, but we're in the normal to the plane of the cell wall. And then the third one is one where we use the AFM to repeatedly scan. And from this, we can get an assessment of the lateral mobility of cellulose microfibrils. And without going into details, here are some of our results. And I'll just highlight a couple of pieces so we don't belabor the point too much. Belabor the point too much. One interesting thing, and one and we've seen quite commonly is if we activate expansions, we're doing this in this case by acidifying the cell wall. In previous work, we actually added alpha expansions. You note that we don't get changes in the thickness of the cell wall by these various measurements. Yet we do get a very strong robust creep response. So alpha expansions causes creep, but it's Alpha expansions causes creep, but it doesn't change the modulus of the cell wall by the usual quick mechanical assays. The cellulose microfibril movement, yeah, indeed reduce the increased mobility in this AFM assay. But then contrast that with the pectec lias assay, where we don't get creep. We do see some changes in strong changes in the nano in the patient and very strong changes in the microfibromobility, local micromylomic. Mobility, local microfibril mobility, yet we don't get Creek. That seems to me like a pretty important observation. So the Creek process is not just lateral mobility of microfibril, but it's got something to do with a larger scale phenomenon. How we interpret it. Okay, so what's going on? I don't know if it's clicked on your screen. Just kick on the screen there. I want to think very so. There's a lot more to be said about this, but I'll just summarize that since what you published with the assertion that these results made us question the What happened? I don't know. It's pretty much fun. Miguel? Miguel, I think we did have. Let's check on. Is he sharing? Yeah, stop sharing and start sharing it. Yeah, we want to advance. We escape out of the house. Okay. Share again. Is it a good? Share again. Is it a glitch in the I don't know what happened? Maybe you can get it. Thank you. And so I'm interpreting. And so I interpret these results from this study as inconsistent with these conventional models of the cell law. All right, so xyloglucadase, for example, treatment, you would expect from that lower television network model, you would see some changes in the modules as well. Well, we don't see it. This is a really robust result. We've seen this in multiple systems. And likewise, PECBA-BIS, for example, I think. Pectate bodies, for example. I think we don't see induction of creep, and that challenges the idea that the wall mechanically is fundamentally a hydro effective hydrogel. So just to summarize what we concluded qualitatively is that the tensile properties of the cell wall were largely controlled by cellulose properties. The indentation properties of the cell wall were controlled both by pectin as well as the cellulose network. All right, so. Network. All right, so what kind of molecular structure is consistent with these results? And this is where we said, okay, let's try to get a physical model of the cell wall based upon really simple physics of the fundamental polymer. So we said, okay, let's get three polymers, cellulose, xylo, glucan, and pectin, and we model them in the bead and spring model. So this is where my first grade collaborators. My coarse grain collaborators came in. And so, for those who aren't familiar with coarse grain modeling so much, let me just say a word about that. So, the bead and spring models, the beads represent the physical elements of different pieces of that. And so that would be a chunk of cellulose, for example, in that case. And the beads are connected by springs. And the springs are parameterized in ways that represent the Young's modulus, the axial stiffness, as well as the flex. Axial stiffness as well as the flexibility of the polymers. And then, in addition, we also have to need to bring in the non-covalent binding and repulsion interactions between the different components. And that's done in this case through an equation. So Morse potential, which represents the energy as a function of the distance between the beads. And we parameterize this based upon values from the literature. So it's a top-down parameter. The literature. So it's a top-down parameterization. We know, for example, how tightly xylogucan binds to cellulose, and that factors into those equations, for instance. Then we arrange the polymers into a simulation box that represents how we think the cell deposits this stuff to the surface of the cell. We equilibrate and we allow the wall to allow these polymers to assemble as they will. And then in the second stage, which Yao talked about, we can deform that box and measure. Out, we can deform that box and measure mechanical behavior, and we can do parallel experimental measurements with the ugly epidermis. So, the figure you see here on the right is what's self-constructed from the polymer. So, the purple is cellulose, and we see a number of interesting features, for example. So, cellulose undergoes bundling, and it will get the network formation, and it resembles to a significant extent the A significant extent, the actual observations of study laws that we saw in the onion law. The confirmation of Zyno-Blue Cand, shown here in green, matches pretty closely what the physical observations were that we've made independently. The confirmation of pectin forms this soft network with extensive contact with cellulose microfibrils. So all of this is very nice, and this is all just based upon very simple physics of the polymers. Upon very simple physics of the polymers itself. No, we're not, so all the interactions here are non-covalent interactions. The bead and springs were where the covalent bonds are, but everything else is then reversible non-covalent interactions, and it's dynamic. So we saw a stress-self-organized. It's self-organized, it's exactly like that. Yeah, from something that we put down in a certain direction, cellulose, we've got to put down in a certain direction. Everything else is just dumped out right now. Everything else is just dumped out randomly and then it organizes into this just based upon the interactions that we built into those models. We see complex stress-strain behaviors, cellular motions that Gal talked about, which we saw experimentally before we did the years before we did the model in a paper published at Nature Plants using AFM to observe how cellulose microfibrils change as we stretch the onion cell wall. Onion cell law, we could see a lot of the kinds of behaviors that the model, after the fact, replicated. Okay. And so oftentimes I wonder, how's the stress distributed in the cell wall? The model gives an answer. It says it's all in the cellulose, all right? And pectin and anxyl glucans have bear very little of intensile stress. And when you have a multiglamulet cell wall, I oftentimes wonder how the Oftentimes, I wonder how the stress was distributed in those different lamellae. It turns out, which is fairly intuitive in hindsight, it's got to do with the orientation of the cellulose microficrons because they are the stiffest component of the cell wall. You hear that over and over again in the cell wall literature, and yet the take-home message doesn't come through very well. So it really depends upon the orientation of the study routes. And here's a close-up of an image that Yao showed earlier about some stress distribution. Showed earlier about some stretch distribution within cellulose, and there's a couple of features I wanted to point out. So, this is the wall is stretched to a certain size, and you can see the stress, this tenth out stress is heterogeneous. And you also see that the tempile stress is really quite large. It's up approaching megapascals. So it's at the maximum values is up in the hundreds of megapascals. And that's about 100 times larger than. Times larger than the calculated engineering stress of the cell wall. Because all the stress is borne in this model, all the stress is borne by the cellular microfibril network. And there's a lot of space in between that's filled with soft pectins and water and stuff like that that is used in the calculation of the stress engineering stress, but it's not stress-bearing. So this may be really important. That's just for calibration. So yeah, well, yeah, it shows. So yeah, well, Yao shows, for example, that you get curving the spidulose microfibrils when the microfibrils are in a transverse direction, like this guy, for example. So we're stretching in this direction and the wall gets thinner. And so you get curving of microfibrils. So that's compression. And the negative value is compression. So it seems to me this is really important because the wall, the cellular. The wall, the cellulose microfibrils, according to this model, are under a lot more tensile stress than what we normally think of when we just say, okay, the stress in the cell wall is eight megapascals, right? It could be really important for modeling. Okay, so traditional models, I say, have had some serious problems. Here's an alternative one where it solves some of those problems. It's by no means, it's certainly an oversimplified model. It's certainly an oversimplified model. So, what's different about this model? One, it's based, it's a computational model, it's based upon similar polymer physics and it makes quantitative predictions. That's different from the other things which are drawn with pen intake. Sensile forces model is transmitted directly through the cellulose network. That's because cellulose-cellulose contacts are strong, and that's where the ovipores are transmitted. Of how the forces are transmitted through lateral binding of cellulose microphysiology in this model. And that network is an emergent behavior of the model itself. So in this model, cellulose contacts, sliding, straightening are key factors in the tensile mechanics. So sliding of cellulose microfibril is the basis for cell wall plasticity. The straightening of cellulose microfibrils is the major, not 100%, but it's a major component. Percent, but it's a major component in the wall elasticity. So, when you stretch this wall, there are curved regions of the cellulose microfibros, and they straighten out. And you can intuitively think, all right, they're acting like a spring as they straighten out because cellulose, yeah. And then the yield threshold, that's something we can measure in this model. We see that behavior, and it's got to do with the dynamics of cellulosellose. The dynamics of cellulose cellulose contents. In this model, what's the role of pectin and xyloglucan? So, I don't think they're irrelevant, I think they're really important for mechanics, but indirectly. So, they influence the ability of cellulose to interact with other cellulose, to come into contact. So, in this model, the pectin and xylogans can affect the formation of the cellulose network. That in turn is a major. Is a major aspect of it. You showed a result whereby changing Cyberbuchan, you saw no measurable difference in the creep? That's experimental, obviously. Experimental. So how do you consolidate this with the model? Yeah, so formation of the cell wall versus when you have an existing cell wall, and now you can digest it over there. So the dilo glucans are not bearing any load in this model. And that explains why when you digest an existing cell wall. Digest an existing cell wall with xyloginase, we don't see any mechanical effects. And so at that point, they're not playing role in sensile mechanics. All right, so that leaves us with some open questions, unanswered questions and things for the future. I should also point out that the three, so Sulan Shao and Professor. Sulan Arishao, the professor in mechanical engineering at Pan Segi, is on Zoom today. So he will be here to chime in in this discussion. Jing Yi is also on. She'll be giving a Zoom talk tomorrow about the mechanics of the cell wall. And Yao, I presume, is still on for this. So I advertised this a couple of months ago as wanting to talk about the modeling, the sliding cellulose microfibrils. Sliding cellulose microfibrils are in wall growth. Let me point out something that might not be immediately obvious. So, in this model, it's an equilibrium model. We do the stress-drain experiments, and it's basically almost in equilibrium throughout the whole period of stress, of stretching. So, if you then hold that wall in tension and then wait and say, does it undergo creep? The answer is no, it doesn't. It's an equilibrium model. Answer is no, it doesn't. It's an equilibrium model that's static, at least in the time frame for these simulations. And so, and that's that's a mean, and that indicates that plasticity, which we could measure, that force-induced sliding may not be the same sort of dynamics as what occurs when cellulose microfibricles slide under constant force under the action of expansons, for example. Action of expansions, for example, there may be a different process going on there. That's still, you know, something that's left for us to work out and ideas that you may have. All right. So the temple, plasticity, you mean exactly what here? What happened when you. So plasticity, you stretch the cell wall and then reduce the force. Yeah, it's become longer. And that happens. Yeah, and that happens that basically plastic in the ideal case is time-independent, right? Reality is a little bit different from that, but basically it's uh it's an instantaneous irreversible change, information of the cell wall that come back. Elasticity, of course, it just comes back. And that's different from Creek. And we saw this in the experimental measurements that I first showed you with that table where we saw we could add things that would cause the wall. things that would cause the wall to have an increased plastic compliance. So it was, it was, it would stretch much more. Dry self, so this complex enzyme mixture that cut everything would cause implasticity, but remarkably it does not cause cell wall creeping. All right. Perplexing but true. Yeah. Perplexing but true. Could we interrupt you as a thought or not? And this puzzle becomes uh integral. Sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah. So, the so so you can ask the question, yeah, okay. So I'm just to be confused now because uh, just the way you made the difference between plasticity and just an apparent scale creep, yeah, okay, so so so the creep experiment we're holding. The creep experiment, we're holding the wall under constant force, constant tension, and then we add something, right, and ask: does it now extend? All right, so does it increase the apparent or decrease the apparent viscosity? But I don't think of it as a viscosity. So the notion is that its inter expansions are disrupting the cellulose contacts and allowing the microfiber. And allowing the microfibrils to slide in a slow time-descended manner. If I could just make a comment, in fact, it's really beautiful, this polymer stuff and this elasticity and interaction, labor interaction between two beats, it's said, because if you are in a crypto experiment, we apply a constant stress and see how it differs, elongates. If you have a constant speed, then you can define an effective. Um, an effective, yeah, uh, this study, and this can be a really linked lateral interaction by going from well to well, in some sense, yeah. So, so it's an effective one, and it's also it happens in muscles. I mean, you have attachment forces and so on, but if you apply some load on this muscle, you get an effective viscosity, let's say. So, I I think you you're quite near, but for that you you still need to have this constant speed and constant stress. Constant stress in terms of experimental stuff work, yeah. Yeah, okay, so I take your position and experimentally there may we might have to get go about it in a reverse sort of way. I don't, so that's something where we could, we'll have a session this afternoon where we could talk, or just you and I maybe talk about the mechanics of that. That might not be of interest to everyone to hear about the. To hear about the mechanics stuff. So it's good. Thank you for that suggestion. Yeah, so the extensibility. So in the Lockhart equation, for example, I assume people are familiar with that Lockhart equation. That extensibility term is an apparent viscosity or inverse viscosity. But I think fundamentally it's not a viscous motion, right? It's not a limitation. And in this model, it really has to do. It really has to do with the direct interaction. So, our model, the analogies of the way an extension ladder gets longer. If you're all familiar with those extension ladders, when you're painting a house or something, you pull those and it slides out and it becomes longer and it's hopefully irreversibly longer so it doesn't collapse when you get on top of it. So, that's the analogy of how cellulose is behaving in this. Behaving in this system. Again, a model, it's simplified, one can add complexity to it. We have tried with playing with some of the making the model a little bit more complex. And they, yeah, so that's a possibility. And I won't go into those details. So when we talk about expansion stimulating creep, well, this model that we put forward doesn't stimulate creep because it's outside the Because it's outside the, you know, my understanding from the modelers is it's outside the time scale. So you'd have to go, you know, creep is a very slow process. We're doing, you know, microseconds and creep in reality, it's something that takes many minutes or hours to see. And so presumably, if we could do the model for a long enough time, then you might be able to see something happening. So as you were saying, you might have hopping. We might have hopping between beads, and that may take something that requires overcoming an energy barrier and activation energy. So these are ideas that Su Lin Zhang has been thinking about and we've been talking about and attempting to think about ways of modeling that. All right, so that's a question that may be put forward. The other sort of thing is that we don't know yet and we're Is that we don't know yet, and we're working on it from an experimental side standpoint: is what's the relationship between the yield threshold for plasticity and the yield threshold for expansive mediated creep? Are they the same kind of thing? And it's not obvious that they are because the motions, because they sometimes are affected differently by some of our chemical treatments. So, there's some fuzziness in there that we would need to sort out. That we would need to sort out. And the other thing is, we talk about yield thresholds, but we need to differentiate between maybe different contexts: the scale, the length scale for the yield threshold, and possibly for the time scale too. So plasticity, we measure the yield threshold with these very rapid extensions. We measure yield threshold for creep in these very slow constant forest measurements. And yeah, so they, you know, how we connect those together in a good Together in a good, rigorous mathematical sense is something that's open, it's an open question, still. So can I maybe on that? I've been thinking a bit during your talk, which thank you. Actually, I think it's really clear. So do the plants, cells, grow in response to fair record, right? Right to the larger, I mean, we have to have terrible terrible. So, terrible results in force that is translated into growth because you also have expansion there. Let's, I think it's fair to us. So, expansion, however, as if I get it correctly, your planned journal paper. So, we have an effect with. With let's say, even without sterical, I mean, expansion can have an effect that approach makes creep in situations where you don't have terrible. Well, so in order to get the walls to creep, we don't have turger, but we put the wall under tension. You don't put the turger. And that wall in tension is to replace the effective turger. I see, I see. Okay, so therefore, turgor. Okay, so therefore turtle has nothing to do with plastic kind of deformation. Well, turgor is all in force. And we measure plasticity by applying a physical tensile force in the cell wall. Right, but you also have applied force to get the effect of creep. Yes, yeah. So there is some furtherness there, right? Some furtherness there, right, in terms of yeah. So, so plasticity, I think, normally in the living growing system, I think plasticity is irrelevant for growth. I see. Okay. All right, because plasticity you only see by these definitions, you only see when you increase the forest. And I don't think that actually occurs in normal biological growing systems. So it's not like you get incremental. So, it's not like you get incremental plasticity because incremental plasticity means you have incremental increases in force, and that can't go on forever. Okay, so then what is relevant for growth in real plants is the interaction of creep with the force that exists and not the plasticity related. Major to it. So there's a big gap between plasticity and measuring these in vol or in vitro assays and the creep process. Yeah, I absolutely agree with that. Yeah, so that's quite important. I'm not sure that's very clear. Yeah, okay. Not very clear conceptually or because sometimes you talk about time scale and now you talk about the way you increase the cost. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, so plasticity is an empirical measurement, okay? As we do it in the cell wall field, how do you measure plasticity? You stretch the cell wall, you add force to it, and then you say how much of that deformation is reversible and how much of it is irreversible. And the irreversible part is plastic. If this is continuous, sorry, if the if you measure just after the applying the stress. The applying the stress because creep would also induce some sort of irregularity. Yeah, so if you hold it at a constant force for a long time, then creep will ensue and it's a much slower process than the scalable measurements. Yeah. So just to be fair with those which are in Zoom, Charlotte, you have a comment on this also you'd like to share? Yes, I have a question exactly related to the Turger discussion. So what intrigues Discussion. So, what intrigues me about this is that Turge actually is applied orthogonal, not just in y direction, if you want. So, I wondered whether any models you've tried to do that, whether you can comment on what is the effect of compressing these layers in that direction, in addition to applying a force in growth direction. Okay, and before you answer, maybe Bruno, you can ask your question and then Daniel can see how he continues. Daniel, you can see how he continues. Okay. Thanks. Well, it's a naive question because I'm not sewable guy. Have you studied a lot the effect of temperature in addition to the one of expansions? Because usually with anything that's slides and screep or temperature is interesting and we know that it changes a lot and the rate of growth. So why do they, I don't, I haven't read much about I don't haven't read much about this, and so maybe this is my question: How is temperature active, and how can we take this into account? We have a question: isotropy, temperature, and Gabrielle, one more question, and then I'm going to. Should I? Okay, so I would ask it right away about this plasticity definition. If now I'm thinking in If now I'm thinking in a growing system with the effort of some genes that regulate growth, that I can imagine that might weaken the cross-links between the cellulose fibers. I agree that at the cell wall scale, continuum scale, we probably shouldn't imagine that there's an increase in force. So the term plasticity probably is not suitable. But again, if we look down at the fiber level, wouldn't Fiber level, wouldn't it again fit? Because if we lose these cross-links, then maybe the individual fibers are under a higher tension. What do you think about that? Thanks, Gabrielle. Okay, so I'll take them in the order of easiest to answer. Temperature. What's the effect of temperature? So we've done a little bit of work on just measuring the effects of temperature. Measuring the effects of temperature on the onion epidermis. So we put it at room temperature, slightly higher than room temperature, or put it in a cold room. We measure these stress-strain properties, for example, and it has remarkably little effect. That's one of the reasons. So that's one piece. I don't want to steal the thunder for GEU who's going to be talking about those experiments, but there's another reason to think that it's not simply a polymer viscosity phenomenon. Polymer viscosity phenomenon in the traditional sense, like pectin viscosity, because of temperatures and also because of the time dependence. So, but I've already said more than I want to say, all right. There's a time dependence that you can then use as a diagnostic for classical polymer viscosity, all right. Um, and uh, she'll talk about, I think, those some of those results maybe tomorrow, and then the trigger pressure and uh. And trigger pressure, yes. Okay, so I think I've two. So, two thoughts come to mind. So, we need to, the experiments we do are uniaxial stretching, all right? And in the living system, hydrostatic pressure puts stress in all directions, right? It's isotropic force, at least, to the cellar wall, which translates into stress. Into stresses depending upon the geometry of the cell, but it's at least bidirectional. So that's important because the stress in the let's say the transverse direction will sort of resist the ability of the wall to deform in the axial direction, right? Because it's holding the force in an extended configuration. So you'll get more stretching, for example, the uniaxial stretch. For example, in the uniaxial stretch, than in the hydrostatic type stretch, the equivalent. And that's been known for a long time. And there's people that tried to do equivalencies of it. And, you know, I've heard of numbers, heuristic numbers saying, well, you get three times more extensibility with a uniaxial stretching than when you do hydrostatic, something like that. So, that definitely, if you want to be really quantitative, that's an important aspect. And then the other thing that And then the other thing that Charlotte questioned was the turbo pressure is also compressing the cell wall, the polymers, right? And so they're going to be pushed into one another. The middle or the lamellae maybe are forced into stronger interaction. There are some systems where that's a really big effect. So when you lose turbine, the wall swells out quite a bit. There's a number of interesting papers on that topic. That's not really very typical for growing cell walls. For growing cell walls, I'm sure there is some of that sort of phenomenon. I don't know how big it is. I don't think I've ever seen measurements of it. So that will tend to, I guess, resist, to make the wall stiffer, less extensible. But I don't have any other deeper insights than beyond that hunch. It's an intuitive guess. And then the last one was about plasticity and the rearrangement. And the rearrangement of the fibros, and the Sawal, the one Gabrielle asked. So in a growing system. Okay, so maybe I need a... Gabrielle, do you want to reformulate your question really short? I was curious, like, because you mentioned that you think in plants growth, there's no plastic growth, it would be by creep. It would be by creep. But I was wondering about the meaning of that. Like when I think of what happens to the fibers, down to the fibers, I would imagine that if there are some enzymes, some action that is reducing the cross-links, then the stress, the tension on the individual fibers is actually increasing. And so at that scale, I would speak, I would imagine maybe possible to speak about a plastic deformation. Maybe it's just a terminology question, but it might bear some consequences. And I would like to know what you think about that. Would like to know what you think about that. Yeah, so at that scale, there might be a place where they start to merge. And that would require, I think, some more careful analysis and then how you define the different processes. But plasticity as used in the cell wall field is a macroscopic phenomenon. You stretch the cell wall. It's not irrelevant to biology. So, for example, plasticity, I think, is really important for bending of trees. For bending of trees, uh, sometimes things bend over and it's a way of dissipating energy so that you don't get breakage. And I see this with my tomatoes all the time: they fall over and they stay over. You know, there's a plastic deformation that occurs. You can then push them back, all right, and there's another plastic deformation that goes in the opposite direction. But with a growing system, the wall polymers are not increasing. Let me think about that. So, so, so this, yeah. So, so, so, we're, we're, so this, this has not been well formulated and thought out. And so, I'm just thinking at the top of my head. The one case where it might be, you might get the overlap is when, so when the cellulose microfibril is deposited in cell wall, it's in a relaxed position. Now, it binds to other cellulose microfibrils, and maybe there's other interactions too, but let's just keep it. Maybe there's other interactions too, but let's just keep it simple. It binds to other cellulose microfibrils, and now it transmits force from so it makes a network, right? That can now bear some force. And when the wall grows, then that network starts to stretch, that nascent, that newly formed network starts layer, starts to grow, and there's an increase in force. So that's a case where there may be some plastic deformation that is occurring in that one particular look. That in that one particular level, followed what is the increase in force here? Because as the wall grows, the new cellulose microfibrils originally are not, newly synthesized microfibrils are not bearing any tensile force. But then as the wall grows, they then stretch along with it. But that growth is still pushed by something. No trigger, yeah. Yeah, the wall, but the trigger is constant here. The trigger is constant. It's constant here. The Turger is constant, but the forces. Yeah, but the forces are borne by the pre-existing cell wall. The new cell wall is not bearing any forces at all. But then as you stretch that new cell wall, it's now resisting that, all right, because it's got good mechanical properties. And now that one layer is actually picking up support. So there's an increase in force. And that's a case where then the concept of the mechanism. The concept of the mechanisms of plasticity, as we measure in the macroscopic way, might be applied to the microfibrillar nanoscale way. Daniel, we have two more comments from the Zoom. Would you like to get them now or do you want to continue with your talk? Well, is there relevance to what we're discussing? Yeah, actually, my talk is right now open for Eric. I don't have other stuff to present, but I want you to be a. So I think Rico would you would you like to yeah it's related I think to this issue of plasticity so um uh point of clarification really you say it's an equilibrium model so I'm trying to understand so you apply a force to your wall by equilibrium do you mean you wait to the force to decay to zero or to a constant value that's non a non-zero elastic the elastic component what so what happens Component. So, what happens after you apply force in your simulation? So, we very slowly increase the force or increase the dimension of the box and then allow the force to increase as it will without overshooting. So if you go too fast, then it will overshoot. So, basically, all the motions, the molecular motions that are occurring as you stretch the cell wall, we do it at a slow enough rate. We do it at a slow enough rate such that it's close to equilibrium. It's not undergoing much more motion beyond the time we're ramping up the length of the course. So if we hold it there, so let's say we stretch the cell wall in this model, the coarse grain model, we stretch the cell wall, and let me back up. To do these coarse-grading simulations, I think, as I understand it, I think as I understand it, I'm not the coarse-grained modeler. Yao might want to chime in here, or Susan. You know, you need to do that slowly enough so that everything can equilibrate. And that's the nature of these models. So they're equilibrium models. Now, if you just hold it there, by definition, by how the model is run and has to be run, as I understand it, there's not going to be any more motion. Going to be any more motions that are occurring, at least at the time scale that we're measuring for here. So, for but the wall is still under tension, and so presumably, in order to get creep to occur, there's got to be some of this kind of bead hopping, some things jumping over an energy barrier, and that would be a gradual slippage that would occur into a stable state. So there would be a kind of a relaxation that would occur in that situation. In that situation, but then if you're holding it at constant force, the relaxation is not allowed to occur as you're keeping it at constant force. So then the model will lengthen. Rico, are you happy with that? Well, let me ask the following thought experiment. Suppose you slowly increase the force, you stretch it, and then as I understand it, now it stops stretching, the force stabilizes. Now you release the force. Okay, so now you take away the force and it contracts, but it doesn't contract. Contracts, but it doesn't contract to its original length because of the plastic component. Now you do the same thing, you apply it again, you apply the force again. All right, so now you're going to get another. So what I'm trying to say is if you did cycles of this, would it get longer and longer and longer? So in other words, would you build up your plastic response? So effectively, it becomes like creep because you're building up extension through applying it cyclically. Would that happen or have I misunderstood? So empirically. So, empirically, with a real cell wall, no, it doesn't get longer and longer and longer. So, if you take the real cell wall, you stretch it to a certain point, then you relax it, and then you put it back again, it just comes to that very same point within 95% value. So you don't get continual additional more plasticity, more plasticity, more plasticity. Plasticity empirically and also, I think, in this. Also, I think in this model, is a one-shot deal. So you get these deformations, and it doesn't come back. That's not, you could devise a situation where it would come back, but it doesn't here because of the nature of the model. But in the model, then what happens in the model? In the model, I think the first approximation, it would just come back. It would just come back. It would be reversible, come back just the way it did before. So, you know, there actually is irreversible lengthening. And if you try to bring it back to zero force, the model is now longer. And the polymers have rearranged themselves. So, you know, all these fibers, they have now rearranged. So it's a new polymer situation. Now you stretch it again and it will undergo the same sort of behavior. Go the same sort of behavior, there might be some plasticity occurs because you've rearranged, you know, you the polymers have rearranged themselves. So, this is not something we've explored in the model in any depth. Yao, do you have any comments on that? Yao? He's there. I'm here. So, basically, from the, we've, I can first talk about all the experiments. For the experiments, you do the cyclical loading. You do the cyclical loading. So, only no, I think the plastic formation only happened in the first cycle. If you do several cycles, so from the second cycle to later cycles, the stress strain curve from loading for loading and unloading are just repeatable. It means that after the first cycle, the later cycles, I think it's more like I think it's more like elastical deformation because all these deformations are repeatable. For the simulations, we try to simulate this process and we get a similar result. So it's still the same. If we look at the strategy curve, first, in the first cycle, we have a loading curve and on loading curve. So from the second cycle, the second cycle, the loading curve is. The loading curve is different from the loading curve of the first cycle. But for the third cycle, they are the same. So the first approximation, you don't get more plasticity if you just repeat to the same force. You only get more plasticity when you increase the force beyond the initial point. And so Ewan had a question also. He patiently had his hand up for a long time. Sorry. Hi, sorry. Hi. Yeah, I'm just quite interested by your model. I wonder, you know, you mentioned about extending it to a tissue scale. I wonder if you could apply some of the principles from like, not the exact same principles, because I don't think that would work, but from my mean field theory, I've tried to, you know, take some average of like your network to try to come up with some actual like constitutively, like more analytical term, which you could then use to extend. Which you could then use to extend your principles you found here of the sliding and stuff to the tissue scale. Yeah, so yeah, thanks for that suggestion. And I think I believe that's possible. And I think the modelers on our team have advocated going that way, particularly Sulin. And the reason I The reason I'm not so enthusiastic about it is because these constitutive models have been around for a long time, but they don't really give any insights into the underlying mechanics of what's going on as I've seen them. So the Lockhart equation, for example, you know, is a constituent law, and it doesn't tell you anything about what the yield threshold is. It doesn't tell you anything about what extensibility is. There's just these terms and they operate and they're good for mimicking some of the behavior of. Some of the behavior of the cell law. But what I really like about this coarse-grade model is it's a representation of the behavior of the polymers themselves. And you can see what's going on and understand it at a molecular level. So that's my... I'm still. And you have a mapping to experiment, right? And of course, we have the experiments that we can map it exactly and validate. Charlie had a question here in the room. Yeah, so, you know, I think one of the questions. Yeah, so I think one of the questions that you raised is scalability up to the cell scale. And it seems like some of the properties of the coarse-grade model sort of are emerging and you posited that they are relevant to the macro scale, right? Macro scale mechanics in some ways. So I guess the proposal I would make or the question I would have is, can we coarse grain the coarse grain, right? Can we take the outputs of the nanoscale? Of the nano-scale coarse-grade model, and make those, each of those units, let's say one by one micron, into something that's analogous to a finite element, but would allow us to stimulate what's happening in a whole cell and simulate growth. And that's one of the challenges of this workshop is to do multi, you know, working across scales. What do we need to do to implement something like that? So, I'm by no means. So I'm by no means an expert. Sulan is online. Does he have a comment on that? Sulan, are you still here? Yes, I'm here. I'm actually in another meeting. So I'm very happy to see this heated debate on this. Yes, definitely. This is in the Mathas Gilling domain. That's also my My research domain over the years. But I think that our cost-green model, our agent-based model, is pretty cost. It's very difficult to go further from that point of your career. It's cost of model. It's pretty hard because that's restricted by the structure of the. structure of the of the of the wall right but you you can actually cross grade to continue for instance for the uh the plant say wall and then you have this uh you know set of junctions right so you take this constitutive law for the uh this flat region and that's that's one constitutive law right or that's one spring and then you have the incellular junctions that's another constitutive law right and you put together two to do And you put together to do a cellular level or multi-cell level kind of simulation. You can do that, definitely. And I think that's very useful. And it's a finite analysis. Yeah, thank you. So we've had discussions. So the continuum representation that you suggested, I think that's one way to go. And it may be the way one has to go in order to. Way one has to go in order to get to the bigger scale. I was hoping somebody would be able to suggest an alternative idea that would still have some representation of the behavior of the polymers in the cell wall. I understand as you go up, you lose things. And so it might be one of those things that's tough lines. You know, you can't have everything. You have one or another. Discussions before about the Discussions before about the trying to do finite element modeling with the kind of behaviors that we're talking about here is: I think that there are technical problems with that. The model then gets so complicated that because if you're trying to simulate shearing of cellulose microfibrils and different scales, I understand that there are some technical problems that really limit the ability to do that. It ends up getting huge. That it ends up getting you to make that work, you end up adding so many other tests each time you got to go through and test all these things with your beats that you don't gain much in terms of the computational efficiency. Okay. Yes, yes. I just want to make a comment, a very important comment in this community. If you want to do a fine element analysis of individual fibers, that's something that in continuing mechanics is very difficult to do because it involves a lot of contact mechanics. And the contact mechanics. Contact mechanics. And the contact mechanics in financial is very, very, very, very difficult to do. And that's what Dan just mentioned about that difficulty. So, so, so, in the sense that you cannot cost grain to continue level using final element but still stay in a five-wheel level. That's going to be very challenging. Leah Bam has a question. She has her hand up. Hi. I wondered how important. I wondered how important the random orientations and positioning of the cellulase fibres were. Because I appreciate the moment you're getting this from data. But I wondered if you're trying to come up with an idealised geometry polymer network? As by creating an idealised geometry network, then it's more amenable to do that coarse graining up to the larger scales while still keeping the network representation. So, our outlook was the following one. We had a lot of data on structure and its mechanics, and we wanted to stick for our first model. We wanted to stick with that to see how close the coarse grain model actually would go without doing huge parameterization investigations or changing organization of things outside of reality. So, we haven't explored that in great depth. Explored that in great depth. We have done some of that kind of stuff, but fairly limited because we wanted to go within the realm of empirical testing, empirical validation, verification that the model is giving us results that, in fact, was realistic. If you go way outside, so the model itself, you can deposit cellulose in all kinds of directions and you will get. And you will get different kinds of mechanical properties because, as you can intuitively see, if you have a different cellulose network, it's going to respond to forces in a different way. So, the density of cellulose microfibrils and their orientation will make a difference. So, if you just take one lamella, if you stretch it in the onion system, all the cellulose microfibrils within a lamella are oriented approximately in one direction with some dispersion, and that's what we try to. With some dispersion, and that's what we tried to replicate in the course grain. You could change the dispersion, you could, and so we tested that. And if you stretch in the direction where the cellulose are all oriented, it's very stiff. If you stretch in the direction at right angles to the way the cellulose is oriented, it's much softer, much more compliant, and you have everything in between. If you do a random lumbella, we haven't maybe. haven't maybe maybe out did that um so then then you get things things that are so the model is is is amenable to that sort of analysis is that uh relevant to your question there yes thank you and though have you actually thought about doing a com like an idealized geometry network which could then be amenable to the sort of kind of coarse graining mathematical approaches Explain what you mean by an idealized network. I'm not quite sure I'm getting your meaning. The network is the fibers or of the cells, Leah? I guess of the cellulase network, so that you prescribe orientations and connections, but with kind of set parameters that aren't. Artificial kind, yeah, you know, that's self-organized at the moment. The geometry of the microphones is it was just taken from an image, so, say, was it not? No, no, that was self-organized. Oh, but you started with the with the yeah, it's uh so so you have to deposit the cellulose. There's a couple ways of doing it, but basically the way we did it was we just deposited the cellulose in a general direction, right? In a general direction, right? So, the way they might get deposited, but there's no network formation. And then we just allow them to assemble. So, then they assemble, they bundle, they form larger-scale networks. But the general orientation in which cellulose is aligned is set in the model. So, were they all parallel to stercums? Approximately, there's some dispersion. So, I think your question is this: if you don't let it assemble, but you give it some type of prefix geometry, then you might be able to. Then you might be able to assess the effect of the geometry. I see. When you think it's totally off, yeah, so in principle, I think that that could be done. There might be nice shortcuts you could do to make it experimental or computationally more efficient to do something like that. And that's not something that we've explored in this, except in the sense of looking at different cellulose microfibrics. Cellulose microfibrils with different orientations. Okay. So, in your model, you have quite a large number of fibers, and I guess of these many particles that you need to simulate, hence why the simulations take so long. But I mean, for some of the questions that you're asking, like, how much do they slip? And how could we increase the simulation time to see if we could actually observe creep? Could you? Could you consider a much simpler simulation, perhaps with two fibers that interact with one another, and then keep that simulation running for a long time so that the thermal fluctuations give rise to slipping and so that you can observe these phenomena in a simpler geometry, perhaps somewhat idealized. So, I think, in principle, that's a great way to go for a small scale, and then for the old. Out. And then for the old, so you would get basically fiber-fiber slippage, and you could investigate yield thresholds in terms of how much interaction there is. So we know in our publication, we increase the or decrease the attractive force between cellulose microfibrils and ask, what does that do to the mechanics? What does that do to the yield threshold? It affects the yield threshold, as you might intuitively guess, right? And so you could do And so you could do that at a smaller scale to investigate that in more detail. The thing is, you remember the distribution of stresses in the cellulose microfibril network at one little picture? So as I see it, there's some microfibers that are under very high tensile stress and some that are very low. What I imagine at that scale is there are some of those ones under high tension are undergoing slippage. Slippage would tend to go undergo slippage and much faster than ones that are in low tension, right? Intuitively, obviously. And then there'll be propagation of forces, right? There'll be a percolation kind of effect as things redistribute. And so the phenomenon you see, if you just do two fibers, the dynamics might be rather different than if you're doing a larger scale network with lots of different forces applied to different parts of that. To different parts of the network, that's my it would be nice to see that actually, you know, like even, yeah, yeah, you hear that now? It's gonna be zoom out. Okay, just because there is a coffee break and we do want to have a little pause for the next session, I would just go for the last question because Eric Eric posed one. Okay, yeah, hi. Hi. So you requested maybe different ideas about core screening of polymer network dynamics. Polymer network dynamics than the mean field theory that may coarsify too much. And I just want to advertise the possibility of using our dynamic Boltzmann distribution coursification of stochastic reaction networks to create a model that coarsifies what I'll talk about tomorrow, dynamical graph grammars. Sorry? No, they just don't. So, I don't know if I should continue. No, you're back. You're back. Okay, we lost sound for about one minute. Okay. Talk about the Boltzmann Boltzmann distribution method for coarse graining that I think can be applied to dynamical graph grammars, which I'll talk about tomorrow, which are quite similar in many ways. Are quite similar in many ways to your coarse grain molecular dynamics. And in that way, one could reflect some of the structural things like the graph connections between two cellulose fibrils and in a way that adds more variables to the coarse-grained but otherwise mean field theory-like representation. So there's a possibility if somebody wanted to. If somebody wanted to work on the mathematics and physics and computer science of that, that would be novel, in my opinion. Great. Thank you, Eric. Could I ask you to maybe put onto Slack the session C maybe a reference or two to those papers so we could get a trail to pick up and study? Sure. Sure. And we'll have session C will be continuing, I guess, this morning's general discussion this afternoon for those who are interested and available. And so just we're out of time, I think. Yeah, so thank you so much, Daniel. That was great. So we have a 25-minute pause. We'll be back here at 11 local time. And see you later.
