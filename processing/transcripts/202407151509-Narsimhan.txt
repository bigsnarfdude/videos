So the macro, the Nami. So for you, joined by five people, so you just go to the chat. Before I begin, can people hear me at the back, okay? All right. So yeah, thank you for inviting me. My name is Vivek Narsimhan. I'm an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Purdue University. And today I'll be talking to you about some of the work my lab's doing to understand the micro-hydrodynamics of ellipsoidal particles and viscoelastic fluids. So I'll be talking about three small sub-projects in this area. In this area. And this work has been primarily done by two of my graduate students, Chung Wei Tai and Tang Wee Apke. And I've also been very fortunate to be collaborating with Professor Ardu Ardakani, who's organizing this conference. And I've been able to work with one of her graduate students at Deep as well, who's on these papers to do that. So when particles flow in a polymeric fluid and flow in a confined system in a polymeric fluid with pressure gradients, I'm going to call it red fluid pressure gradients. What ends up happening is that particles experience lift forces that push them to particular regions in the channel. This is basically due to normal stresses in the fluid that's created by stretching a polymer chain. And typically what ends up happening is particles move from regions of high normal stress to low normal stress. And since the region in the middle of the channel has zero shear rate or zero normal stress, you tend to see particle migration to the middle of the channel. Now, if you want to get like a nice cartoon. If you want to get a nice cartoon picture of what's going on, this is kind of what I would draw up if I were to explain this in class. So, whenever you have streamlines going around a particle, what ends up happening is you have polymers stretching along the streamlines. And this gives rise to what is known as streamlined tension. And the streamlined tension will then ultimately give rise to a force above and below the particle. And if there's an imbalance of tension above and below the particle, then you would get a net force that pushes the particle to a particular region. Pushes the particle to a particular region in the channel. So, whenever you have gradients in shear rate, you're going to have a difference in the force above and below, and that's going to cause migration to the region of the lower shear rate in the channel. So this actually is a very well-known phenomenon. People have described this since the 1970s, but there's actually been a renewed interest in this topic, I would say, in the last 10 to 15 years. The reason being is that in microfluidics, it turns out that the forces depend quite a bit on. These forces depend quite a bit on particle size and particle shape, so you can use them to separate particles by shape and size. If people are interested in micro-rheology, for example, if you want to infer non-linear properties of fluid like normal stresses, maybe getting something about the lift forces could give you something about the normal stresses. And it turns out these lift forces are also important in a wide variety of topics. Whenever you have particles in a viscoelastic fluid, one very specific example is hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing, where you are injecting typically like polymeric fluids into the ground, and you have solids in that. So, although this study has been kind of done for a while, there's actually still a lot of gaps in the literature that people haven't figured out. So, people don't know the effect of particle shape on these forces, confinement, concentration, effective different types of geometry. So, what I want to talk about, at least in the first portion of the talk, is the effect of particle shape. All right. Alright, so what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do the simplest problem one can think of. I'm going to just look at a single particle in a pressure-driven flow. So you have a parabolic flow profile shown here. And what we're going to do is we're going to track the particle as a function of time as it experiences a lift force to the middle of the flow. And we're going to track its migration and orientation. I'm going to be looking right now at an unbound 3D tube flow, as shown here. And here are a couple of assumptions that we're assuming. We're going to assume we're at zero fluid. We're going to assume we're at zero fluid inertia, so the Reynolds number is zero. We're going to assume weak viscoelasticity, so this Depper number, which is the ratio of normal stresses to shear stresses, are going to be quite small. We're going to assume that this suspending fluid has no shear thinning, so just normal stresses. And we're going to assume that they're small particles. So in other words, the size of the particle compared to the length scale over which you see the variation in the flow is small. So in other words, what we can do is we can do a first approximation of neglect the effect of the wall and really only look at The wall and really only look at the effect of the curvature in the steamer. So, the model that we're going to use to describe the fluid is going to be known as the second order fluid model. Arizona talked about this a little earlier before, but this is essentially valid for any slow flow of viscoelastic fluid. It has no shear thinning and it has constant normal stress coefficients. So, in the rheology literature, this is sometimes known as a Boger fluid. Boger fluid. Now, this is called a second-order fluid model, mainly because what happens is if you look at the stress tensor, you're going to have a Newtonian bit, and then the correction to the stress tensor is going to be basically the stress tensor Taylor expanded second order in the radar strain tensor. So it's going to be quadratic in the radar strain tensor. And so you have the Newtonian and discoelastic bits. Now, again, there's three dimensionless numbers that determine the dynamics of the particle in these type of flows. There's a Reynolds number, so the ratio of renatural force to discuss force. We can assume it's zero here, so it's a very. We can assume it's zero here, so it's inertialist. There's a Deborah number, which is the ratio of normal stresses to shear stresses. We're going to assume it's quite small. And then there's this normal stress ratio, which is the ratio of the second to first normal stress coefficients. We've actually done simulations and theories for all different values of alpha. What I'm going to be showing in this talk is particularly just this alpha is equal to zero because this is close to what's typically observed experiment. All right, so what are we going to do theoretically? So, this is what we do, we're essentially going to do. What we do, we essentially are going to be doing a perturbation expansion and the limit that Deborah number is very small. And the basic idea is we want to solve for the rigid body motion, the order Deborah. And we're going to use a special theorem that's known as the reciprocal theorem that has a very well-known literature in the Stokes flow community. And if you want to learn more about kind of how we did it, we have it in our papers as well. So let's just summarize what are the main results we get from this. So here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to basically look is I'm going to basically look at the position of the particle as a function of time, and I'm going to call y of t the distance of the particle between the particle and the center streamline. And I'm going to plot essentially y versus time. And what we see here is that if you notice, look here, this is the log scale as shown here. What happens is you see that all the particles exponentially move to the middle of the channel, okay? But the slope is different depending on the particle shape. Now what we typically see Particle shape. Now, what we typically see is that for particles of the same volume, spheres tend to move faster than oblate particles, and oblate particles move faster to the middle of a channel than prolate particles if they're at the same aspect ratio. So, how can we explain this? Well, so the first trend, the exponential decay, can be explained by simple scaling arguments. So, the basic idea is as follows. If you have normal stresses in the fluid, what happens is you're going to get a lift force, a polymer force that pushes the Force, a polymer force that pushes the particle to the middle, and that's going to be balanced by the Stokes drag. So, this polymer force is on the scale of the volume of the particle times the gradient and the normal stresses, which is what you get here, and then the lift velocity is going to be the standard Stokes drag. If you balance the two, what ends up happening is you just get a simple differential equation for the distance of the particle to the center, dy/dt, this proportional to the Deborah number, the particle size squared, and the distance from y equals zero. And this constant proportion. y equals zero, and this constant of proportionality is known as this mobility coefficient that is different for different particle shapes. And if you solve this, you get this nice exponential result that's shown here. Now, if you want to understand the effect of particle shape, what you need to understand are the orientation dynamics. So lift is essentially due to sampling of normal stress gradients along the shear gradient direction. So what matters is actually this LSG along the shear gradient direction. Direction. If this LSG corresponds to the long axis for a particle, you're going to get larger lift than a sphere of the same volume. But if LSG corresponds to the short axis, you're going to get smaller lift than the sphere of the same volume. You're not sampling the normal stress differences nearly as much. So let's kind of look at what we see in the orientation dynamics when we do these type of theories. So in early times, what ends up happening is for prolate and oblate particles, you basically get tumbling behavior, right? Locally, it's in shear flow, and when you're in shear flow, you get what is known as these Jeffrey. Hand shear flow, you get what is known as these Jeffrey orbits that are shown here. But what ends up happening is that long times, when you have particles tumbling in it, when there's normal stresses in the fluid, the normal stresses actually impart a torque. And what happens is that the particle will eventually go to a steady orientation at late time, depending on the type of flow. So if it's a slip flow, for example, this prolight particle orients perpendicular to the flow along the vorticity axis, which is known as law rolling. But if it's a tube flow where you have velocity curvature, A tube flow where you have velocity curvature on all sides and lines along the flow that ends up happening. And if you go through the oblate particles, you actually end up getting similar types of orientation behavior as well. So what ends up happening is at early time during the tumbling, this LSG is a mixture of the long and short axes. But at long times, what ends up happening is it's always this LSG, the length spanned along the shear-rate variant axis, is always the short axis, right? And so that means you get less lift than sphere of the same volume. And this is kind of what ends up the reason why non-sphere. What ends up the reason why non-spherical particles get less lithium spheres of the same volume? And what we've done is that we've actually done more quantitative stuff. We've actually been able to calculate this mobility coefficient for different particle shapes and see how it depends on aspect ratio for both prolike and both late particles. Right. So we did all these theories, but how well does it actually recreate what is observed experimentally. So what we try to do is do the simplest experiment one can humanly do. Experiment one can humanly do because I'm a theorist. We try, we can't do super complicated experiments. We did the simplest one you can. We have literally a straight microfluidic channel, okay, that's a capillary of diameter 130 microns. And what we're going to do is we're going to flow into the inlet, we're going to flow a suspension of non-spherical particles, right? So either spheres, prolate, or oblates that are stretched to a given aspect ratio. And they're going to be suspended in a viscoelastic fluid. The viscoelastic fluid we're choosing is a polygonal pyrolodone. Is a polygonal pyrolidone solution, eight percent molecular weight, and it's going to also have glycerin in it, so it's density, so it's density matched. Okay, now this particular type of fluid is has, at least at the shear it's we're dealing with, has constant viscosity, and it has a known one relaxation time. Okay, and we can actually measure this using rheometry. And so this is known as a Bober fluid in the literature. And so at the flow rates that we're dealing with here, the Deborah number is on the order of 10 to the minus 2. Of 10 to the minus 2. The Reynolds number is on the order of 10 to the minus 4. So, Reynolds number is much smaller than the number. So, it falls within the purview of our theory. We're dealing with volume fractions that are about 0.1% ultra-dilute, so only single-particle dynamics would matter. So let's say what we're going to do. So for imaging here, what we're going to do is essentially, we're going to flow stuff into the suspension, into the straight channel, and we're going to image the particles 2 centimeters, 4 centimeters, and 6 centimeters from the inlet. We're going to take a bunch of pictures and see where the We're going to take a bunch of pictures and see where they flow within the channel. And we're going to essentially create a distribution of where the particles lie in the channel and see how this PDF evolves as a function of time as you go further and further down the channel. Now, if you want to compare this to theory, basically the way we're going to do this is we're going to run our simulation at the same equivalent setup, same Reynolds number, Deborah number, to get the theoretical mobility coefficient. And then we're going to try to get the experimental. And then we're going to try to get the experimental mobility coefficient and compare it against the theory. And the way we're going to get the experimental mobility coefficient is as follows. Basically, if we're given a histogram at two centimeters from the inlet, okay, we're going to then try to, for each particle we observed at two centimeters from the inlet, we're going to then solve this differential equation to figure out the particle x and y position as a function of time, okay, where this is the mobility coefficient. And we're going to basically try to figure out what is this mobility coefficient that best fits. This mobility coefficient that best fits the experimental data at four and six centimeters. So we're taking the two centimeter data, trying to figure out the mobility coefficient coefficient that best fits the data further downstream. So let's look at kind of what we observed from our experiments. So here, the particle distributions two centimeters, four centimeters, and six centimeters from the inlet, okay, for spheres. The blue is the experimental particle distribution. So what we see here from the blue is that first, you know. Is that first, you know, you see that they have a distribution here. As you go further and further down, it scrunches towards the center. So you're getting lift to the middle of the channel. And the orange is essentially the solution using the experimental mobility coefficient. So we're assuming the exponential scaling to the middle of the channel, right? We're finding the best fit MD based on the data here, and we're seeing how well it matches with these two. And see overall we get a reasonable match between both there. Now we can do the same thing for the prolate and oblate particles. Prolate and oblate particles. I'm only going to show you the results for the prolate right now. And here you get the experimental particle distribution. As you go further and further down the channel, this distribution scrunches to the middle as well. So you're getting lift. But you also see here that it doesn't scrunch nearly as much as the spheres. In fact, you look at the average distance from the center of the channel, they're about the same at the beginning, but at the end, they're actually further away from the prolifer compared to the open. So, a couple of things we want to point out. So, a couple of things we want to point out. So, particles move to the center. It seems like that non-spherical particles, like proloispheroids, move slower than spherical particles of the same volume. We tend to see, it turns out that these trends were observed also in another paper that was published a year later after we originally published. So at least we're not going crazy here. It seems to be consistent with what's in the literature. And if we look at actually the theoretical and the experimental mobility quotes. Experimental mobility coefficients. You see, you got reasonable agreement, although the experimental mobility coefficient tends to underpredict the theoretical values by a factor about 10%. Now, what could explain maybe the underprediction? So, one of the sort, in our theory, we neglected the effect of the wall, right? And it turns out that the effect of the wall is a, it gives a lift on the order of the blockage ratio squared, or blockage ratio is the particle size to the channel confined. Size to the channel confinement. It turns out people have done work on spheres, have not done work on non-spherical particles, but for spherical particles, if you actually include the effect of the wall, the lift force has an extra attraction of order beta cubed, and it tends to reduce the lift force. And if you look at the betas that we're choosing here, they're about 10%, which is comparable to the error that we're showing here. So we think this could maybe play a role of why we're seeing this under prediction. But overall, Seeing is under prediction. But overall, the trends seem to match the theory quite well. So, the last portion of the talk, I just kind of want to talk about some of the stuff that we're currently working on, work underway, some of the things we want to do in the future. So, some of the things we want to do is developing 3D imaging techniques to look at the orientation of these particles in these flows. And also, look at the effective stress of these solutions, right? So, what I'm going to talk about here is how do you actually image the 3D position and orientation of particles. Position and orientation of particles in such fluids. We're going to be using a technique that's known as holography. So, in holography, the basic idea is as follows: You take a laser, shine it on a particle, you're going to get a scattering pattern. Based on the scattering pattern, you can infer what is the 3D position and orientation of the particle. The basic idea is, okay, if you get a scattering pattern at a particular plane, using this data, what you're going to do, you can solve the Helmholtz equation and to reconstruct what the scattering pattern is. To reconstruct what the scattering pattern would be at different C positions. And based on all the different scattering data at all the different C planes, you can then use the data to infer the 3D position collier. So people have done holography in the past. In fact, we've actually done some work ourselves. Here's just an example of a square microchannel, and we flow a bunch of particles in non-Eutronian fluid, the same non-Eutromian fluid. And if you look at six centimeters from the inlet, and here we look at the cross-section. And here we look at the cross-section. Each of the dots here represents the 3D position of where the particles are flowing through the cross-section. So you can get the 3D position of all the particles and get a 3D order distribution function with this type of method. But what they gap in the literature so far is that all the people have been able to do holography for spherical particles. It turns out for non-Newtonian fluids, there really hasn't been much work on holography looking at the orientation dynamics of non-spherical particles. And so there's And so there's a gap in imaging non-spherical particles for the applications. So what we want to talk about here is we're going to be talking about a forward reconstruction technique where we examine specific patterns and correlate them to figure out the particles' geometric features. It turns out that in these particular applications, when you're the specific type of particles that most people use in these applications like polystyrene, at order one aspect, you tend to get these lens effects that make it a little difficult to infer data, but if you're careful, that applies. Data, but if you're careful and apply correct masking procedures, you can get around some of these issues. So, just to give you a brief idea of what we're doing, again, if you have a hologram at z equals zero, the basic idea what we're going to do is we're going to use this angular spectrum method. The first thing you do is you take the data, perform a fast Fourier transform to figure out what the scattering pattern looks like in the Fourier domain. Once you do that, then you can then solve the Helmholtz equation using this data. Equation using this data and figure out what the pattern would look like in the Fourier domain at a different z-plane. Reconstruct the data again using a backward Fourier transform. And this is what the scattering, inferred scattering pattern is in a different z plane. You can do this multiple times and you can get a stack of images, right? Based on the sharpness, you can kind of get an idea what z position the particle would be. And so this idea, this angular spectrum method, the basic assumption is that you're assuming that the cell model, he can That this Helmutz equation, you can write the solution to the Helmutz equation as a superposition of planar waves. What that means is that there's this Fresnel number, and basically we're dealing with the near-field regime, where you can assume this near superposition of planar waves. So let me just kind of show you a little bit. So what basically, if you ever try to look at the sharpness of an image and infer the Z position using these type of technique, what happens is if you don't use a mask, we often end up actually getting incorrect measures. Up actually getting incorrect measurements, but if you are careful and apply a map where you tend to get these aberrations, you can actually calculate the correct z position as shown as below. And then once you get all this information at different z planes, you can do whatever technique you want. We did a principal component analysis to figure out the outer term orientation. All right. So just to get an idea how well this works, we decided to do the simplest experiment one can think of. What we did is we just fixed polystyrene particles in a PDMS. Particles in a PDMS gel. So it's fixed in a particular place, in a particular orientation, that are fluorescently dyed. So that we can also image them using confocal and compare against a ground truth. So we can do holography experiments, we can do confocal experiments, do that as ground truth and see how well they compare against each other. So we can look at the error in the outer plane, in the ZC, on the outer plane ZC, and also the error in the outer plane angle. And overall, we see we get an error about. And overall, we see we're going to err about 25% of the particle size for the outer plane position, which is okay for certain flow applications. For other applications, it may not be so good, but for large-scale flow applications, it's mainly okay. Autoclane angle is about 2 to 4 degrees. And what we've actually done is we've started doing some work where we're looking at actually swimming of cells, for example, in different types of fluids. These are E. coli cells. You can actually calculate their position, 3D position, and orientation during the swimming. Position and orientation during this one using these types of holographic techniques and infer some of these patterns. Okay, so in the last portion of the talk, I just want to talk a little bit about stress in viscoelastic fluids. So up until now, what we've been doing is we've been looking at rigid body dynamics and non-spherical particles in a viscoelastic fluid. Okay, so we looked at the particle translation and the rotation. And what we did is we did this for a simple constitutive model, the second-order fluid model, which is for a weekly. Order fluid model, which is for a weakly viscoelastic fluid. But in addition to getting the translation and the rotation, what we can do is we can also get the effective stress in the suspension. And so what we want to do now is if we have a suspension of these ellipsoids in solution, we can then do ensemble averaging and then figure out what is the effective stress of the suspension of these particles. We can assume that these are rigid ellipsoids. We're going to do non-inertial, non-Brownian, forcing torque. Non-Brownian, forcent torque-free, dilute, same. The fluid satisfy the same constituent model. The basic ideas of this homogenization technique are actually detailed by Koch and Supermanian, as well as Eric Schock-Fay's group. It turns out that this is a little bit more complicated than just calculating the force dipoles on the particles, which is known as a stresslip. Because the governing fluid itself is actually non-linear, it turns out when adding particles of fluid Out when adding particles of fluid, the perturbation in the velocity field gives rise to these non-linear terms that are also in the bulk for the volume average, which are equivalent to what are known as these Reynolds stress terms that we get in the turbulence, for example. But at the end of the day, if you go through this whole Righma rule, you can get now what are known as the Einstein corrections to the stress for all these viscometric functions up to order double number, right? Order double number, right? We can get the effective viscosity, the effective normal first and second normal stress coefficients, the effective extensional viscosities, and planar uniaxial extensional flow, up to order Dummer number when you start having these type of fluids. And so, like just look at for an example. If you look at the uniaxial extension, if you look at the effective extensional viscosity, you get this correction factor k that's shown here. And so you can calculate what this correction to Calculate what this correction to the extension of viscosity is due to the presence of particles. And you can see how it depends on the Deborah number as well as the aspect ratio of the particle. It turns out for aspect ratio one spheres, the results have been published in the literature, which is Pope and Supermanian as well as ShockFate. Our results exactly match. But now we can look at all different types of aspect ratios and how does particle shape affect the, alter the effective reality of the fluid. We've done stuff also for effective normal stress coefficients. stuff also for effective normal stress coefficients and shear flow and again here k is this uh is this correction factor to the first normal stress coefficient it turns out that the first normal stress coefficients and the effective viscosity actually show no linear dependence on the Gebron number but they do depend on the aspect ratio and it turns out if you call that I plate K versus aspect ratio tends to go down as you increase the aspect ratio the reason is at long times the particle aligns along the vorticity axis Aligns along the vorticity axis, and if you increase the aspect ratio, the particle is shrinking along the shear-grade gradient axis, and so therefore the contribution to the stress increases. Okay. So, if you got nothing out of this talk, hopefully this slide summarizes everything. Basically, what we're doing is we're looking at non-spherical particles in weakly viscoelastic fluids. We looked at lift forces, did some theory and experiments. We're trying to develop some imaging techniques to look at orientation dynamics in these viscoelastic fluids. Dynamics in these viscoelastic fluids. And now we're trying to come up with some homogenization techniques to calculate the effective stress of suspensions of these particles. So I want to thank all the students who did all the work. I didn't do the work. My students did the work. And also like to acknowledge my sources of funding. I'm open to any questions. Okay, nice English. So the second order model is nice that you can separate the elastic and this is for fluids that follow the second order model experiment. The EDP that you use is a second order model. So every polymeric fluid in the limit of small Deborah number or small Weisenberg number can collapse onto, can map onto the second order fluid model. Now at higher Deborah number of Weisenberg number, it's not going to be true. Depper number, Weisenberg number? It's not going to be true. Right, so in terms of concentrations, you had 8% transmission. That those concentrations that you had, this is still very dilute. So it's not dilute. It's not dilute, but even for non-dilute, as long as there's a weak departure from Newtonian, you can still tailor expand. And so it turns out we're above the overlap concentration for this. But I mean, we look here, we checked at I mean, we look here, we checked that the shear rates were dealing with very low, small shear rates. It's constant viscosity, one relaxation time. And also, we calculated the Depper number based on the relaxation time, and it's on the order of 10 to the point. It's 2. So, okay. That's great. So, yeah, I think yes, so you have micro channels. There is no way that you can scale up these systems so that you can allow it to come with any more. Yeah, well, we're trying to figure out how to do that. I think that's going to be the next thing. Trying to figure out how to do that. I think that's going to be the next challenge. We tie all this with static particles right now. And the idea is: hopefully, you know, we've shown we can get 3D positions pretty easily with holography. Now, I want to see whether we can get the orientations. I think we'll have to do a lot of post-processing, but you could potentially do it. We'll have to see. I mean, that's been the goal of the next graduate student, and we'll see whether it can get done, and hopefully, it can. So I think some studies have shown that the particles can also go, some particles are at least going to be small. So you use the sort of asymptotic limit, which is locker duration was so small. So is it the reason or the second order flow registration? So what ends up happening, so what people have observed is if you're at higher If you're at higher debra number and also at higher blockage ratio, you can get attraction to the wall in addition to, or you know, you can. So what ends up happening is a separatrix. Like if you're close enough to the wall, it gets stuck to the wall. If you're further away, it goes there. But it only works, but in the limit of small ever number, almost always everything goes to the middle. At higher Weisenberg, what happens is secondary flows can cause a pollution. Secondary flows can cause a confusion in the middle. And higher blockage ratios, I think you get an additional this addition. This order beta cube effect actually mentioned over covering. So in your theory, if you want to sort of come see your, so is it the normal stress? It's a normal stress, yeah. Yeah, so we haven't figured out. So people have done this work for spheres. No one knows anything about non-spherical particles. That's one thing that we would like to kind of look at next, yes? Yes. So, um for for the second for the for the logography, if you are just interested in the position of the particles in 3D, could you do this dynamically? Um, but I'm thinking like if compared to on Volgo, typically you have like the time to do a scan of different focal planes, right? But with this, with the holography, is it faster? Is it just take a single plate? Yeah, so the basic, the advantage of holography is you're limited by the camera speed, right? So basically, as long as you have one image, As long as you have one image and a scattering pattern, you can do post-processing and then figure out what it is. So then you could get really fast dynamics in a sense, like whatever. If you have a high-speed camera in principle, you can, and infinite computational power, you could do whatever you want and get all types of 3D position and orientation that you wouldn't be able to do with a control setup. And so it turns out for a lot of these things, you know, particles are flowing fast, even in these slow flows, they're flowing fast enough that you can't, they're doing control. You can't it's the doing conflict will you not be able to resolve the only information you can do uh really cool. You I guess showed that your anisotropic particles migrate slower, but did you have an intuition for that? Is that because of the tumbling? Because basically, yeah, I mean when we were actually solved the behavior, solved the tumbling, we found that we get this log rolling behavior or you know alignment. So we thought, oh, because you know the the length scale is going to be you have a different length scale. Is going to be a different length scale that we anticipated that it would occur. And people have also found this log rolling behavior experimentally in the old Realogy picture. So you're comparing particles of the same volume. No, if we rescale by the longest axis, I don't remember what the shorter results are. But we always looked at compared everything with the same volume. Because experimentally, we took the same particles and then we stretched them out, right, in a TVA gel, right, and threw them into. Thanks, Yube. I was wondering in your experiments, microfluidic experiments, only looked at the distribution of your particle up until six centimeters, right? If you were to wait a little bit longer, image your particles after probably 20 centimeters, do you expect to see the distribution to be moving further towards the That's what we would expect, but I know. I guess I'm not as good of an experimentalist as you. So we only were able to go up to maybe eight or ten centimeters before, like, we just couldn't figure out up to, unless we realized we wrapped things around. But we have actually done experiments at higher nebula number, okay? Where then the, because remember the rate depends on the debt. So when we go to higher debt number, we see everything goes straight to the nebula. We just bet then we can't do a quantitative comparison. Can't do a quantitative comparison because I theories are unfortunately. I don't have amazing codes to look at order one debt or stuff. So, yeah. Very nice talk, but I wanted to ask for your holographic method. Overall, you're working very dagguts. Yep. And so, if you have overlapping ellipsoids, can you pull out some interesting things? Well, I mean, the question is: what can you do with the multiple scattering, right? Well, if you're clever enough and can infer something from multiple scattering, perhaps. I haven't seen people actually do stuff with multiple scattering with holography because everything is kind of based on the me theory, which is a single particle. I think the only way you could, if you wanted to try to do multiple particles, is then you have to do index matching for a whole bunch of particles and have one particle. A whole bunch of particles and have one particle not indexed matched, right? If you want to do that, yeah, that's kind of also many people what they say in holography, this kind of the limit, right? Oftentimes, in the imaging that people do in the higher Reynolds number of flows, they often only deal with the small number of particles that's dilute, right? I have seen it done with spheres. And you know, or you know what the fringe patterns of the sphere look like, so you can try to decommodate that. So I have not even, I have not looked, so I have personally. I have not looked, so I personally have not looked at the solution to Helmholtz equations for all these multiple ellipsoids. So I don't have no idea. I have no intuition toward what will happen there as of yet. I've got a couple of questions, both fairly simple. You said early in your presentation that you had a Reynolds number of zero, but you had a velocity field. So when I say Reynolds number of zero, I... So when I say Reynolds number is zero, I mean Reynolds number is really, really small. We're in the Stokes number. That's what I mean. Stokes flow ratios. And then the other question is, so these particles are pretty small, so you're assuming that they're not compacting the velocity of the older compulsory. Yeah. Yeah, for the most part. I mean, we've dealt with, you know, these particles are on the order of a little less than 10% of the channel size. Is that what you see, is that they don't really encounter those large? That they don't really catch those velocity. We haven't done DID measurements, so yeah. I mean, the background flow, like in a Boger fluid, should be exactly the same as a positive flow. So that's why we just assume the same background pressure flow, but in shear thinning, it's going to be different, right?
