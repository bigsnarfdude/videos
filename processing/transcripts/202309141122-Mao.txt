I'm going to talk about my work on mechanics of fiber networks. And for this audience, I think we all agree that fiber networks are amazing multi-scale materials. Starting from the nanometer scale, you have these biomolecules forming twisted chiral bundles, and the bundles form bundles, and there are several hierarchy. And, for example, for collagen, you have these fibers where each of the fibers is already a complicated combination of. Already a complicated combination of molecules. And yet, they are just the building unit of the complex three-dimensional disorder network we have that is responsible for a lot of elasticity and integrity of our bodies. So it is really, there are a lot of amazing physics biology going on across the several length scales. And one question I got really fascinated about recently is really the self-assembly of these kind of problems. And in particular, I just Problems. And in particular, as a theorist, I've always been thinking about how necessary it is really for biology to play the role to do this. Is it even possible for us to have an inorganic system that self-assembled into something like this? So my hope is that next time when I meet you, I could talk about that. We have some very small progress on that, but we're not there yet. So today what I'm going to talk about is the mechanics of this existing Mechanics of these existing fiber networks and especially at the fiber length scale. And we're going to just mention a little bit into the microscopic scale. Okay, so for this week, we already had a number of wonderful talks from Omita and Ita and Fred about mechanical criticality in these fiber networks. So I'm not going to repeat all of the introductory material, just want to mention that these fiber networks have very interesting mechanical criticality. Interesting mechanical criticality: where both at the nonlinear scale you have stress stiffening, and in the linear scale, by changing the concentration of the molecules, you can change the elastic moduli by orders of magnitude. Both phenomena point to interesting mechanical criticality that make the system really sensitive and can do a lot of wonderful things. So, instead of going into the introduction of this, what I'm going to do today is that I'm going Do today is that I'm going to talk about a few interesting phenomena that stem from this mechanical criticality. And here's an important slide to acknowledge the people who did the work. Include three formal numbers from my student Le Yuja and the former postdocs, Zeb Rockland and Dijo, and my longtime collaborators, Len Sunder, Herbie Levin, and Bo Sung, and also Jing Chen Feng, who was a student with Herbie. So the first So the first question I would like to discuss is the fracturing of fiber networks. So speaking of fracturing, many of the literature we see today has their roots in this classical seminal paper by Griffiths. So basically, Griffiths calculated the stress distribution of a homogeneous material with a crack. As you can imagine, you stretch this material, there is a far-field stress field. But at the tip, But at the tip of the crack, the stress is amplified, and the amplification factor is controlled by the square root of the length of the crack. So, as you can imagine, there is a lot of stress focusing here. And in fact, this is a so-called stress intensity factor. So, this immediately tells you that there is instability. As the stress at the tip causes the material to start to damage, you will have a longer crack, and then lumber crack will have. Crack and then longer crack will have more stress focusing because of this factor. And then there's an instability for a catastrophic failure, the material just snap into two pieces. And we were interested in understanding how this interplays with the disorder in fiber networks. So if we make the simple assumption that each fiber just breaks in a brittle way, what is the failure mode of the whole network? Whole network at the macroscopic level. So, to put this question in context, I would like to use this phase diagram that Fred showed you yesterday, where, just to remind you, this axis is the connectivity of a disordered metal. And this axis is the nonlinear strain. And if you just look at zero strain, which means linear elasticity, you have this critical point, which is sometimes called the central force isostatic point. Above this point, the net. Above this point, the network has enough constraints so that even if it's just a ball and a spring network, you have rigidity. Any deformation you apply to the network won't necessarily stretch the materials, the fibers. And below that, the network doesn't have central force rigidity, and you can apply deformations to the network, but these deformations only rotate the fibers relative to one another without stretching them. So you have a floppy. Stretching them. So you have a floppy phase. And interestingly, when you stretch the material to the nonlinear level, there is a transition where you actually prepare the network from the floppy state to the original state. You generate a force chains by giving it a nonlinear strength. So here I would like to also show another version of this diagram that we wrote about in this paper here, where it looks more messy because we add a third axis of the binding stiffness and we focused on. Binding stiffness, and we focused on the scaling relations around this central force at a static point. But the essential idea I want to talk about here is really that there is such a transition that as you stretch the network to a nonlinear level, it enters rigidity. So then in light of this, how do these materials break? If you say that each of the fiber can only carry so much tension, beyond that, it is now. Then to study that. Snap. Then to study that, we did some computation. And in particular, we just see the simplest case. We ignore bending stiffness, just the central force network. And we say that every filament has a breaking threshold. And we make the threshold rather small. A little bit of stretch will cause it to break and not contribute to the elasticity anymore. And we just causes statically loaded the network. So here is a contrast of two cases. One is above this linear. Is above this linear transition point. So basically, what we have here is actually a triangular lattice. It's a little harder to see. And we put a crack here, and what you can see if I show this video is that as you stretch it, there will be a lot of stress at the tip of this crack, just as predicted by Griffith theory. And then the stress-strain relation is linear until it reaches threshold, it breaks. Threshold, it breaks, and it's an instability that the crap will propagate. The whole thing breaks into two pieces quickly. Okay, so this is the classical behavior. So how does it work if I choose a network that is originally below this point, which means it doesn't have rigidity in the linear regime? So I apologize for the resolution. I'm happy to show you afterwards. So basically, I start from a network that is below isostaticity. That is below as staticity, and as you stretch it in the beginning, there is no stress. Stress is zero, and only as you cross this critical value which corresponds to this transition line. At that point, you can see that suddenly there is a rearrangement across the whole network, and you start to have force chains. And interestingly, because we give the fibers a threshold to break, the force chains emerge and very quickly it across the threshold. Across the threshold, because a lot of the stress of the whole system are focused on a few force chains. And after they break, there is interestingly a steady state where one force chain break, another force chain emerge, and you just take reservoirs of force chains from this network. And this continues for a long time until, after a certain point, there is a macroscopic crack. And then it breaks more or less according to classical theory. To classical theory. Yes. In this process, it's the load sharing. Yes, the load is shared by the network. Through the force chains. Yes. Yeah. So we have force balance at all times. Yes. Second question. It looked like when you started the movie, the density was much lower at the top, almost like there was a propagation down the bottom. Is that just pure coincidence? It was just a random network and it happened. Coincidence with just a random network and it happened to have a rules. So I think it has to do with the algorithm because before you reach this point, you have many degenerate one states. And the algorithm we choose is just stretch things from the top. So, okay, I get that. But they are all degenerate. Okay, so yeah, right. Yeah, just to play it again, so you can see how it happens and let me know if there are any questions. It's entirely floppy at the top there, and it could have been definitely. There and it could have been that low density region in the middle. Yeah. Okay. But if you pull from the bottom, it would start at the bottom. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So there are all the generative solutions until you reach that point. How does the number of force chains change as you start popping things? Yeah, that's a very good question. So we did a scaling analysis that I'm going to show next. So basically, you can see that the breaking event happened in Event happens in a way that one bound break here, the next bound to break over there, it's a length scale that is across the whole systems. And you always have a very small number of first phase. You don't have a lot of fibers stretched at the same time. And you have a plateau here, which means it's always a small number of chains that are excited. Okay, so that's an intuitive picture, and to fully understand it, we should do scaling analysis and see what is actually happening. So, here is a basic summary of the result of the scaling analysis. So, basically, this axis is on the occupancy on the network, which is also the conductivity of the network. And above that, you start from a material that has rigidity at a linear elasticity level. And as you go to larger And as you go to larger and larger system size, you flow to the classical crack nucleation fixed point. So basically, the picture is that you will have a crack, and the width of the crack is controlled by the correlation length of rigidity population. And you basically have a narrow band of damage when you stretch it. And in terms of scaling analysis, you can basically count the total number of damaged buns after the material is done, fracturing into the After the material is done, fracturing into two pieces. And the scaling analysis goes roughly like this. You have this correlation length of rigidity population, which is controlled by how far you are from this particular point. And then system size goes through finite size scaling. So this is well understood. And we can have scaling collapse that at a different system size. And what is really interesting is the behavior below PC. Below PC, where as you can see, the damage happens everywhere. And then at the same time, it's not only close to this critical point, it is really the whole range of networks that all do the same thing. And when you do the scaling analysis, you can see that this means that the correlation length is always infinity for the whole range of behavior here. And when we try to collapse the data, we only need to use this size. Need to use this size to rescale the vertical axis. This means that there is not a divergent length scale only at here. It's divergent at the whole junk, so we have a critical face. So this, I think, may have some interesting relation to what Fred said, that there is a line of critical points or something, but it's a really interesting physics that at least I don't fully understand it yet. Okay, so anyway, we also looked at the avalanche statistics of this fracturing process. So, what do we mean by avalanche distribution? So, as you remember in the movie, we can see that we quasi-statically loaded this material and the bond break. And at each quasi-static step, one bond break and that may cause a number of other bonds to break because they share the load. And then we wait after all of that happened. After all of that happened, then we stretch the interior a little bit more and we call that one avalanche. So there is one avalanche size S, which is basically how many boundary break triggered by one bound breaking event. We can find a distribution. And this satisfies basically the classical form people use to do avalanche size distribution. Basically, you have a power law for small avalanches. And then for very large avalanches, there is a cutoff. So basically, you've got a distribution like this. Got a distribution like this. This is the cumulant, and this, sorry, this is the distribution, this is the avalanche size. So you have a lot of small avalanches and less and less large avalanches. And the exponent here we find is 1.5, which is the same as the avalanche exponent people have observed in granular matter. And then this cutout function is controlled by the rigidity population correlation depth. Collision correlation length. This is what happens when the threshold is small, which means that the fiber will break immediately after you stretch it a little bit. So you always only have a very small number of force chains that are contributing. In contrast, if I make the threshold large, I say that every fiber can stretch a lot. It's like a rubber band until it breaks. Then I have a crossover scaling that reaches a different expression. That reaches a different exponent, which is 2.5. And that agrees with the exponent for avalanches absorbed in many brittle materials when there is only weak discord. So there is a crossover between two types of behaviors. And interestingly, more recently there are a number of more computational and experimental studies of this type of problem. And what people found is that there is an interesting scaling between the An interesting scaling between the threshold and the system size. So, for larger and larger system size, you need to make the threshold smaller and smaller in order to see this interesting regime where you have criticality the whole range of P less than Ps. Okay, so this is the first part on fracturing of fiber networks. Any questions before I move on? Something about the argument for The argument for the infinite correlation length again along your below, do you see? Yes. Is it just that you don't actually see any mechanics at all until you've reached the critical strain and therefore by definition the correlation length has gone to a thing? Could that be a reason why it's essentially why it appears to be infinite along that whole line? Yeah, I think it's roughly like that. So using your phase diagram again, so the system. This diagram again, so the system reaches this line, and because I make the threshold so small, it always goes back to that line. Yeah, yeah, and so then it's basically just pinned to the full system size, no matter what the system size. Exactly. In the simulations, if you stop before the first fracture, can you predict which one's going to break? Just from the configuration? I'm not sure if I fully understand. I'm not sure if I fully understand numerically we can, right? Because we can just pick out which one carries the most load. Yeah, yeah. Before you get anywhere here, how early can you predict from the particular configuration you've set up? How early are you going to predict which is the one that's going to break? That's an interesting question. I think if I'm deep in the below PC, it's hard because I cannot. I cannot do it just from linear elasticity of looking at the network. I need to stretch and prepare it. I don't know if you have a good answer to that. Well, I think, if I understand correctly, your system is still fully deterministic, right? So there will be, you could do it again and again and again, always at the same time. So I would say it's probably encoded into a Heritage disorder, but other than that quitch disorder. But you could also imagine putting in a stochastic treasure, which would then be different. But yours is not stochastic. Different. But yours is not stochastic. So if we know the quantity disorder in the beginning, yes, we can find it, but I don't know if you can see it. What if you load it before the birth point? And then, right, because this is what biologists would like to know. They want to see a picture of this and see which is the thing that's going to be the most fragile from an image. Right, from an image, I don't know. Maybe there are some network science tools that help you find a bottleneck or something, but with But with full mechanical information, we can just define it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And really useful passing work. It's a slightly different setting, but like find pretty exact spots in granular packets. So I was wondering if maybe similar tools would be, yeah, yeah, yeah. There can be some way to learn that. Yes? Yeah, yeah, that would also be interesting. Yeah. Okay, so that is the part of failure of fibrometworks. And the next I will just briefly talk a little bit about I will just briefly talk a little bit about some effort we have done in trying to understand from these fiber networks what can we say about the cell ECM interactions. So we, together with Van Sender and Herbie Login, we tried a number of models, basically trying to understand when you put a cell which has active contraction and protrusion and how to understand its collective dynamics on fibral networks. I don't think I have time. I don't think I have time to go through the full projects. So, here I will just focus on one simple thing we did, which is trying to ask how plastic are these deformations in collagen networks. So, I bet you all know what this picture is, right? You have cells in collagen matrix, and then the cells contract, and you can see that all of them contract at the same time, then you have dense collagen bundles in between. So, we were interested in understanding. So, we were interested in understanding how much plasticity is there. Can you explain all of this by just using simple screen mass networks or button stiffness? So, one thing we found experimentally, in fact, Bosan's group found experimentally, was that if you turn off the contraction of the cells, so they have ways to make the cell not contracting anymore. And then they take an image again, the bundles are still there. So, there is a lot of plasticity. So, there is a lot of plasticity. So, how do we model that kind of plasticity? So, here is one simple computational model we did. We show that if you just use simple diluted lattice models and everything is elastic, you have two cells contracted, you typically would not get densification like this. You will have some more dense lines in between the cells. It is only one way allows. It is only when we allow some plastic events. For example, if you have two fibers crossing like this, there is a shear stress, and I allow, when it's beyond a certain threshold, I allow the crosslink to slide on the fiber, and I also allow two fibers getting too close to merge together. Then we get this kind of phenomena that is very similar to what you observed in experiments. And in the paper, we also quantitatively compared. Compared the intensity of the collagen fibers in between and show that you related plasticity to qualitatively explain the phenomena. So here, just briefly, I would like to mention this effort. And for the rest of the time, how many minutes? Just under 20 minutes to launch. Okay, okay, so that's good. So I would like to measure a relatively new direction of research with The new direction of research we have on looking at topological mechanical phenomena in fibromylus. So, topological states of matter, I think some of you are familiar with, some of you are not. So, let me just take one minute to give you like a very brief overview. So, as you know, topological states is one of the focal points of condensed matter physics in the last few decades. And a very simple way to think about it is really using geometry. Using geometry. So, if you think about a wave very generally, it can be a mechanical wave, it can be a quantum wave function, anything, you can map it to some kind of curved surface. So if you have a two-dimensional space, you have a wave, you can just think of the value of the wave as a height field. Then you can map waves to differential geometry. And for differential geometry, it is known that there are various topological invariants you can define. For example, You can define. For example, you take the Gaussian curvature, you integrate it over a closed surface, you get these integers that tell you basically how many handles or holes you have on the surface. And these are highly robust quantities. They can only take integer values. These are topologically protected. And what happens when you calculate this kind of thing to your wave functions? This is basically the essential idea of topological states. Essential idea of topological states. And then most of the time we do it in momentum space. So you have a Brulean zone, and then you look at your wave function, how it varies along your Brulean zone, and you calculate this topological invariant, oftentimes a so-called barycurvature. And when you have this non-trivial topological invariance in your wave function, what happens really interestingly is that in real space, that tells you something special. You something special has to happen on the edge of the system in real space. If you cut the system and have an open edge, this kind of topological invariant, which you calculate using the bulk wave function, tells you that something special has to happen at the edge. And this is very robust. No matter how you cut the edge, you can predict these phenomena, such as boundary edge states. And this is the so-called bottom-edge correspondence. So, this has been like. So, this has been like studied for the past few decades, and in particular, in the past 10 years also, a lot of classical systems have been found to exhibit this type of phenomena, such as classical mechanical systems. And my group has spent a lot of time studying that. So, why is this relevant for fiber networks? The question we can ask here is: what are the modes of a fiber network? So, by counting degrees of freedom and the constant. Counting degrees of freedom and constraints, like threaded yesterday, we know that there are a lot of floppy modes. But what are the features of these flopping modes? Are they extended plane wave-like states, or are they vocalized? How do we describe these flopping modes? So that is where the topological description comes in. So to do that, let's start from a simple model, which is a so-called Mikado network, where it's the setup. Where the setup is really simple. You just draw a bunch of straight lines in 2D, and then you put down a cross-link whenever they cross. And we consider the simplest limit where each of the lines just is something for a spring, and nothing else is a born spring metal. And you can do a simple counting of how many degrees of freedom, how many constraints are there. What you will find is that you have a number of zero modes, which are zero energy normal modes for the system to have motion. And that is exactly. Motion, and that is exactly equal to how many fibers you have. In other words, there is a unique decomposition of the zero modes such that every fiber carries one zero mode. And it is actually quite easy to construct intuitively. So here is one fiber network, and you have these zero modes decomposite to each fiber. So here is one example. The red arrows are the displacement vectors of the nodes on the Of the nodes on the fiber. So I single out one fiber and I point it to the right. And then the green arrows are their projections to this fibrine pulling. So the red arrows are all perpendicular to these other fibers that cross this fibrine pulling to the right. Because it's perpendicular, it doesn't stretch the length to leading order. And all of the green arrows are of the same length, so this fibrin pulling to the right also maintains its length for every section. Its length for every section. So it is a well-defined zero mode in linear elasticity. And it is a bulk mode in the sense that all of the green arrows have the same length. It doesn't care whether I'm standing on the edge of the network or the center of the network. So then we made an interesting observation that this is completely analogous to a special type of lattice models that exhibit topological states. Exhibit topological states in terms of its mechanics. And in particular, these are so-called Maxwell lattices, named after the Maxwell's counting rule. So these lattices are defined as coordination number equal to two times spatial dimension. That places them at the margin of mechanical stability. And here is one example. If you ignore the arrows, you can see it's basically a Kagame lattice. Every site is four-coordinated, but we have to crumple the units. But we have to crumple the unit cell geometry a little bit in order to have magical modes, basically. And when you have these straight lines of the edges, when you calculate the zero modes of the network, you can see that they are also all bulk modes, very similar to what you get here. So for these periodic lattices, it is known that they exhibit a topological transition, where the system can go between different topological states. Between different topological states. So, this slide is a little bit busy. Let me try to take a minute to walk you through. This is the state we have already seen. I have these straight lines along this direction, and each of the straight lines carries a bulk zero mode. And when I change the geometry of the unit cell a little bit, which I can actually do without changing the elastic energy of the system, because I just rotate the angle between the fibers. And when I do that, in one step, Do that in one state, I have exponential localization of floppy modes at the bottom edge of the network. And in another state, all of those are moved to the top edge. And you can see that in this demonstration we made, here, this edge is compliant. If we push it, it deforms. And yet, in this case, it becomes rigid. It's somewhat amazing to see because we build this network with a lot of free hinges. All of these points are free hinges. Points are free hinges, and there is no stress. Nothing prevents the system from rotating like this. And yet, we get an edge that can carry stress with a whole lot of freaking jungles along the line. So, it is somewhat amazing to see to us. And it is really the power of topological protection. That topology of the wave function tells us that the wave function must be exponentially localized on the top when you have such an open edge. And that leaves the Per edge. And that leaves the bottom to be rigid. Yes. Clearly, this is without bending resistance, right? This is without. If you add a bending stiffness, this mode lifts a little bit in its frequency, but as long as it doesn't hybridize with the bulk mode, it's junior. Any other questions? So this gave us ideas to design metamaterials, and we had a lot of fun doing that. But coming back to fiber networks, can we have this? Fiber networks. Can we have this type of phenomena of switching, basically manipulating the modes by just changing the geometry a little bit? It turns out to also work equally well. So basically inspired by what happens in the lattices, we can take this fiber network. And what we do is to change the geometry a little bit by pulling one fiber to the right a little bit. So this is an amplified version. You just follow the bulk of the remote. Follow the bulk zero mode. And because I'm following a zero mode, the stress that is going to be caused. Okay, very good, I'm almost done, is higher order. So I basically create a new world state where the geometry is just complied a little bit. And by doing that, I can ask now if I calculate the zero mode, what it is like, it becomes exponentially localized. Basically, exponentially localized on the tail. And we can show this. And we can show this analytically. I will not go into details. It's basically just determined by the geometry at each of the junctions. And we can show that there are certain junction geometries where the model decays and certain geometries where the model grows. And when you pull the fiber to the right to create this new brown state, coherently, the mode always decays. And in our paper, we did the more careful disorder average and the defined. More careful disorder average and the defined topological index, which I'm going to just skip. And the main phenomena here is this exponential localization. So then how is this relevant? It seems to be a highly artificial model. So one situation we thought it may be interesting is when you drive the fiber network from the state where you have all straight fibers. For example, you have some kind of motor that contracts. Have some kind of motor that contracts the fiber, and then this section will move to the right, and this section will move to the left. And according to what we just talked about, you create a domain one of opposite topological polarization. And the modes, if you calculate it now, you will see that it first exponentially decreases and then exponentially increases. And this gave us interesting mechanical consequences, for example. Consequences. For example, when you have this contraction, the center will be hard and the edges will be soft. And when you have expansion in the middle, that is going to make the center soft and the edges hard. In the paper, we have computational test of actually testing the local stiffness. You can see a difference at these different places due to the contraction and the expansion. And another interesting And another interesting consequence that might happen is that this could serve as a mechanical amplifier. Because when you create a mode like this, when you have a small mechanical signal in the middle, it's going to excite this mode and give you a large autoport. And we hypothesize that this may play a role in some kind of mechanical signal propagation on these networks. Okay, so with that, I would like to finish. We're talking about a few examples of mechanical. Few examples of mechanical criticality in disorder decycle networks. And I'd like to thank our funding sources and thank all of you for your attention. So again, if I have any sort of collagen network and I've got a cell that starts doing this, is your analysis going to apply? Or is there something special that needs to be there in the network? So this has so what we studied is 2D. In 3D, it's going to be more complicated because the system is not mechanical and marginal. And we're looking at that problem, like with some banding stiffness, can we move it to the critical point so that we can apply this analysis? And so far, this is 2D. And if you have a 2D fiber network like this, presumably you should have. Presumably, you should have. I mean, one thing to think about is that if you have a 3D network, but the bonds are only four-fold, then in some sense, it almost is 2D. Doesn't that make sense? Rocolate that is 2D, but at the whole network level, you have too many numbers as we don't. Yeah. So if it's straight down, just doesn't work. But if you make a 3D network with six-fold connectivity, you could get these events. Oh, yeah, exactly. Like your number of stars. That's a good point. Other questions? So we just the technical ones since we have time. Coming back to this inhomogeneity in the so-called formal. Homogeneity in the core opening. So you do a step of displacement of your upper boundary and then you relax everything and then you break bonds? Or? Because then it should be homogeneous, right? Yeah, yeah. So we stretch a tiny little bit, we calculated the force balance configuration. And in that configuration, if anything goes above threshold, we break it. And then we recalculated the equilibrium. And then if other bonds go above threshold, we break those until all of the bonds that have. Until all of the bonds that has to break already broke in the screen. So there's a sequence that you can calculate your steps that proceeds from the top of the bottom in some way. That only matters before you have the force chains. After you have the force change, the whole thing is... That whole degenerate range is just one stress, right? And and just to clarify that, in that simulation in the standoid is the deterministic. Yes. So it's only a contradictory order from the beginning. Yes. So the other thing is, can you imagine, like if you have an ephelio cell sheet and you start thinking about the force networks that are emerging from the cells pulling on one another, can I do then, can I apply all of this there? I mean, I'm trying to think about whether or not the cables that we heard about. Not the cables that we heard about last week in Cambridge, where you have these epithelial cells that pull and start to create cables, whether or not that has any relationship. Yeah. Yeah, I think I see what you mean, like in a different type of model, but you can have this type of phenomena. Yeah, so you sort of think about the inverse network, or the, you know, whatever, the reciprocal network of forces. The reciprocal network of forces on this ethelial cell sheet, and then that becomes your network. And when, you know, can you start to think about concentrations using this amplification sort of mechanism to generate structures within the epithelial cell sheet? Yeah, for that system, I don't, that's a really interesting one. As you stretch it, is it more like a jamming condition that's? A jamming conversion that everywhere you have force everywhere, or it's disorder the force chains. Yeah, I mean, what they were showing was that you could generate really localized sort of look like cables in the 2D sheet. And so the question is whether or not that sort of localization can happen from just individual cells pulling on this stress network in order. Stress network in order to sort of amplify these cables that then get used in some sort of tensegrity way to do morphogenesis. Yeah, that sounds really interesting. Um so in the first part of the job, I just forgot what we the uh fractional mechanic setting is basically Is basically magnetic limits. You're sort of relaxing to a mechanical grand pulling by a small step, relaxing to mechanical grands. Yeah, what I did here was only quasi-static, but of course there are many other studies that actually data the dynamics. There was a question earlier about whether the forces were more or less evenly distributed throughout the networks. I guess my intuition is just because of spatial randomness in the network, you could make kind of inhomogeneous Kind of inhomogeneous distribution of forces that might lead to like fracturing kind of yeah this is very heterogeneous right like extremely heterogeneous over force the network by just looking at it is not a very heterogeneous right you just run uncorrelated random pollution but how force distributed is very hydrogenous avalanche statistics yeah yeah yeah definitely
