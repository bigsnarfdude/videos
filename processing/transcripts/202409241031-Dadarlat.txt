The organizer inviting me to talk. So the title is Group Stability with respect to the operator norm. Will be part survey. And results from this year are based on joint work on the Spores Plan from the States. So we discussed stability. Stability with operator mode. The flavor here is topological, k-theoretical. And then, when trying to approximate maps on the group, we can approximate those locally finitely many elements or uniformly at all the elements. Okay, so this leads us to four, or really three. Stability properties, which I will discuss briefly. So, I will start first with the definition: uniform to uniform stability. This is also called known as Coulomb stability, but I prefer this terminology. Okay, so a group, a discrete countable group, it's uniform to uniforms. Group is uniform to uniform stable, and I will often abbreviate this as U U stable. If for any sequence of unital maps which are uniformly asymptotically multiplicative, so see the defects are small all across the group, and they go to zero. Then we ask if there is a sequence of representations such Such that they approximate again uniformly the given sequence. So, in other words, the reason ρ n is asymptotically multiplicative just because it's an L-infinity perturbation of true representations. And the uniform norm of the representative norm of the perturbations that are all right. Alright, so historically, I think the first interesting results are due to Kashdar, Le Dito, and he showed that all aminable groups are uniform to uniform stable. And in the same paper, he showed that surface groups of genus greater than one are not uniformly uniform stable. So I'm not writing the definition, but these are the fundamental groups of G. Fundamental use of G hole G hole that would be G. Alright, and then turns out that bounded cohomology plays a role in this context. I will not give the definition, but bounded homology is defined very similar to the regular cohomology. To the regular cohomology, except that one has the requirement that all co-cycles are bounded, L infinity bounded. So Berger, Ozawa, Tran in 2013, showed that if the comparison map between bounded two cohomology and cohomology is not injective, that Homology is not injective, that gamma is not uniform to uniform statement. And they have a very clever and short argument. So elements of the kernel of this comparison map are given by homogeneous quasimorphisms. So quasimorphism, it's a map from gamma to R, which has a uniform bounded effect. And homogeneous means that it's a true homogeneous. That it's a true homomorphism when restricted to cyclic groups. And if one takes such a quasimorphism, which is not a homomorphism, then by exponentiating these quasimorphisms, one in fact gets a sequence of maps to the circle. To the circle, which satisfies the condition that uniformity as simple it can be multiplicative, and yet they are far away from homogeneous systems. All right, and then when does this happen? So, these are classic results, some results. This kernel has the powers of continuous for more elementary activity group, and it's The heterobolic group, and it's also non-zero donkey called if it's equal to acid hydrobolic group. And then, as a consequence, these hyperbolic groups, or more generally, isolated hyperbolic groups, are not unstable. And in particular, the free groups and the surface groups are not unstable. They are hyperbolic, non-animal. Alright, so what about stability? Uniform stability. So in the same paper, Ferguson Laton, they showed that SLNZ, it's a linear stable spree. And then recently, Pledgekin, Volsky, Modo, Ram Karajan, last year they showed that numerous lattices in other semi-stable groups are even stable, so generalizing the lattice. Okay, and the way they put it, And the way they put it, this is another type of phenomena of these legacies. Now, I will contrast this with another stability, which gives you a feel about the role of property. So in contrast, all these lattices are not local to local statements. Are not local to local stable. So now I'm switching to a different notion of stability that I will reinforce. So what do we mean by local to local stability? We consider a sequence of MEPs, unital maps, which are asymptotic, multiplicative, but only pointwise, as opposed to uniformly across the group. But we demand a lot less. We demand only pointwise approximations by true representations. True representations. So, so in yes, all right. For later purposes, I would consider a more weaker quantity where I require local-to-local stability with respect to a threshold system algebra. So, that means here instead of UN, we go to unitary matrix. We go to unitary matrices of a traitial system algebra, and then if the corresponding property holds a LL path study of tracial. Alright, so when I say that most of these lattices are not locally local stable, okay, so I will say now a few more. So, I will say now a few more words about local-to-local stable groups. So, the study recently by Eiler, Schulman, and Sorensen, and they showed that the virtually free group are LL stable, so in particular SL2Z. And they use okay, and they also use winding number invariants of hash darn text-lowering type to show that certain groups are not. In time to show that certain groups are not. I will elaborate a little bit. Now, winding number invariants turns out that are connected to group to homology. And in fact, then it's not surprising that higher-dimensional homology plays a role as well. And then, here I'm reviewing one of my earlier results. So, if gamma is an MF group that has Group that has a gamma element in the set of asparagus, which is KK2 condition. If one of the rational even cohomology groups of gamma do not vanish, then gamma is not local stable. So groups which satisfy this condition, so all aminable groups, all inner groups, all hyperbolic basic finite groups, they satisfy the Samson's theorem, except for the, of course, the cohomological condition. But then, to support my claim, lattices in semi-simple leak groups are typically not local stable. And indeed, a theorem of last year of rather reports is Sauer and Weiberger. They show that if gamma is a co-compact lattice in a real semi-simple regroup, which is is not locally isomorphic to either the Lorentz group SOL plus 1 or SL3C. So with this exception, then the even cohomology does not vanish and therefore one can deduce from the theorem above that gamma is not below to local stable. So that was the motivation to compute this homology. So now of course here So now, of course, here we have plenty of groups with property T which are not local to local stable, as opposed to the UU study. Yes? Do you know something about non-uniform processes? Maybe, but I don't know, so I'm not prepared. All right, so now diagram. So how are these uh two conditions related so far? Conditions related so far. This class of local-to-local stable groups are very small, much smaller than it is NPR. Whereas, as we have seen, that uniform to uniform stable groups, they form a larger class. So, this is flashdown. So, I'm having a So, maybe I'll say a few more words about the LL class. Eilers and Schulman are so essential that at this diagnographic group it's LA stable if and only if it's as dimensional more screw and the rational two formula vanishes. That condition does not appear in the paper, but it's equivalent to what we have. And then the LL class is closed that there are more than 83 products and age in there. Free products and aging that extensions. So finite groups, this is the theme of a shape here. Okay, but still, this is a small group. And what about the intersection? The intersection is also small, the integers, and then the two-dimensional crystallographic group with Spanish investigative cohomology. So this is easily served, but we have a very small intersection. Now, I'm going to a mixed condition. I'm going to a mixed condition, UL stability. Now, this time we are looking at unital maps, again, which forms a uniform asymptotically multiplicative sequence. So the multiplicative is very strong, uniform over the group, but we ask for a lot less, mainly that Mainly that we want to approximate this by representation only point-wise. Okay? So you see, if you make a strong, strong assumption, like this uniform condition, the condition to approximate globally, it's also very strict. That's why, for instance, the free group fails to use paper. To be used. But for the free group, the free groups trivially satisfy this. Alright. Now, here I give you on a diagram all the definitions so you don't get confused. So we ask uniform approximate multiplicativity, and then from that, UU stability means approximate uniform. Approximate uniform approximation, UL stability, local approximations. Now, Khajidan's original proof that the surface groups are not even stable was different than Berger, Rosawa, and Tom. But it turns out that even though Kashdang does not stay Even though Kajdang does not state that in the paper, it's obvious from the proof that he shows that these surface loops are not even neuron stable. In some sense, that motivates, I mean, not only, you know, combinatorics, you are something, assume something as for something, you know, so these classes, which in some sense are very strongly unstable. Okay, and then it's natural to And then it it's uh natural to see: okay, are there other groups which are not stable in this sense besides these groups? So that would be partial topic of the panel. Alright, so now I revisit the previous diagram. So now I include the I include the class of UL stable groups. So it follows immediately from the definition that UL stable groups include the previous classes, UU and LL. Now it's strictly larger. For instance, SL2Z star Zm. It's trivial to check that does not belong here because SL2Z does not belong here. L to Z does not belong here, does not belong in the L class because Z M does not belong here in the model. It's slightly more involved to show that the Cartesian product also, SLC, Cartesian product was direct product was the end. Okay. And then we have seen that uh surface groups uh maybe I want that too. Maybe I want that too, not one, two. And then we ask: are there a other examples which are not stable in any sense? Of course, you may ask what are other examples of UL stable groups. There are more examples, but that I did not investigate. Okay, now what does not appear is the condition LU but this is because this is straightforward, the group would be stable if and only if the group. L is stable if I know only if I have a group it's fine. So this would be a finite group, so we see there's a group that's line also. Alright, so now with Forest, we are looking at searching for something else, but then we're led to this result. So we go back to the comparison in HEP. Right, so there you have bounded tuple cycles, there are any tuple cycles. And then I record the result that if the current of the comparison map is non-zero, then grammar is not really stable. And it turns out that the image of the comparison map also plays a role. And I state this result, and so. And so the first one is if the tuple homology with real coefficients, the pressure coefficient, is different from zero, that gamma is not local to local stable with respect to the plus of unit or pressure system. Okay, so we have seen before cases where the non-vanishing of homology implies LL. L L non-stability, but that condition requires some additional assumption on the group, like it was linear or amino or MF and have a gamma element. But here there is no condition on the group, but of course the outcome is only weak. You don't have local to local stability with respect to event and ratio system algebra. Okay? System actually, yes. Okay, now for now, uh, to get to the point, if the image of the comparison map is not equal to zero, right then it turns out that gamma is not uniform to local stable with respect to the class of unit temperature system. Again, this is without any assumption on the group except on the image. Of course, ideally, one would like to use this to extract. To use this to extract non-stability or stability for maps into matrices. It's a very tactician in general, but I will comment on that. So, but when do we know that this map has a non-zero image? For instance, by the source of Bromov and then the photo. Bromov, and then the footprint was covered by me, generalizing to bound it to comparison. They showed that the comparison map is subjective in all dimensions for hyperbolic groups. So, in particular, if gamma is hyperbolic and its two cohomology is non-zero, then of course the comparison map is subjective. So, then one can apply the second point here, the gamma. The second point here for the gamma is not u, u tau stable. Okay, so uh to summarize: the kernel non-zero gives you your non-stability, the image non-zero gives you your tau stat non-stability, and then non-zero homology gives L then up non-stability. Alright, so I'll say a few words. Alright, so I'll say a few words about the invariant that it's used. So just this part is familiar, with many of you. We take a hyperbolic group with non-zero cohomology. We take a bounded two-co-cycle. So this is an L-infinity function whose class is non-zero. And we know that such a cosycle is by the cosine. Such a co-cycle is by the previous result of promoting F. And then we compose with characters of R onto the cycle. And then we consider twisted loop system algebras or cycles which are exponentials of the character. And then we define projective representations, like Objective representations like that, which range are these twisted proof system algebras. So, first you go from gamma to the universal twisted algebra by canonical map, and then you go to any treasure quotient of the twisted algebras. And of course, there are many threshold quotient algebra itself, the reduced the reduced twisted algebra is that there are plenty of examples. There are plenty of examples. So now, by a typical computation, this is a projective representation. So if you compute the defect from linear representation, you get here the exponential and n and the cosycle. Now, if this co cycle is bounded as n goes to infinity, this defect goes to one uniformly. Otherwise, Otherwise, if it's non-zero only in the usual homology, it goes to one pointwise. Okay? All right. And then the plane is that, and I will discuss a little bit, there are no representations from pi n, from gamma to these trees quotients of twisted algebras which approximate the representation. Okay, so in particular, this is the case if ramma. This is the case if gamma is hyperbolic and this homology is non-zero, then we have like this. Okay, so now when can you press to, when can you obtain such a derive here U L non-stability for representations for LMOS maps going to matrices. Okay, so this will happen for instance if this universal twist. This universal twist that algebras have an NF quotient. So, an NF quotient means an algebra which embeds the product of matrices over some of matrices. Of course, there are this wide conjecture, and equality wide, but Black at Fischberg said that maybe all system algebras are MF, but no clue. Now, I like to say this in this generality because actually for in many concrete cases. Actually, for in many concrete cases, there are plenty of finite-dimensional portions. This Pn can be chosen to be finite-dimensional algebra. And in fact, one can rewrite Kajnan argument, and this is what happens there. Now, of course, projective representation, what we have earlier in the video. Earlier in the literature, in some sense, Voikulescu's matrices come from an irreducible representation of the Heisenberg group H3. So they are a projective representation of Z squared, so they are there. And then uh recently um uh I should go to that Joan spas uh Joanna Spasa. Ioanna, Spass, and Jersna. They used projective representation constructed exactly in this way to prove the failure of lifting property for full system algebras of contradictory groups, well like the property D. I mean this non-lifting property is very strong, much stronger than stability. You cannot even lift this projective representation to completely positive maps, let alone homomorphisms. But the argument and But the argument and the key, at least in the proof, this has to do with property T or a relative property. Now, in the approach that we use, property T does not play any role, not an explicit role. And so then this applies to groups without property PM. And then just to sketch you, give you an idea of the invariant that we consider. Of the invariant that group was. So, if one has an LMOS representation of the group in a tracial system algebra, one can define local two-po cycles. So, here is the definition. 1 over 2πi tau log of the defect. So, if this defect is small in the unit ball, then we log this defined. Then use a pi since the definition. And the data trace, then one by two pi height. So this is a real multi. Now, but what happens? The chronecker pairing of this local co-cycle, so why is this local? It satisfies the co-cycle condition only at finitely many elements when this quantity is small. So it's a local. So it's a local. But nevertheless, we can pair with an even two cycle because an even two cycle is given by finite determinants. So you know combination of the finite factor as a bearing. And now if you pair to a two co-cycles, so this depends continuously on the raw, and it turns out that in fact this the padding belongs, it's not any belongs is not any subset of R but it's in the image of the trace the image the k-theodic group of algebra through the trace and in the paper that we are writing we verify this using an index theorem that I have in all the paper special cases there are some other methods. There are some other methods. Anyway, you see, if I have a representation, this possibility would be zero. Now, this takes values in this discrete set. That would be a simple case. It's more general. It depends continuously on the representations. So the non-vanishing of the pairing, an ice there, it follows that the robot is. There it follows that the robot is far from a homomorphism. Because this is an invariant which takes discrete values is continuous. It vanishes for homomorphism, so therefore cannot vanish. Does not vanish for anonymous representation, we cannot part. Alright, so that's another line of argument and probably this. Alright, but then what about higher dimensional obstructions? Higher dimensional obstructions, because we have seen for the LL star, we also had a higher dimensional obstruction coming not only for the H2, but for H4 and so on. And indeed, so what I know about this case, it's about groups arising as fundamental groups. So of closed connected Riemannian manifold, which pin Which pinch negative sectional curvature. So, what this means, and that's the established etymology, but this means that sectional curvature at each point, I mean, over the manifold, it's bounded between two negative constants. In particular, it can be constant for all constants. Okay, now the fundamental group happens to be a residual. Group happens to be residually finite, and one of the even cohomology groups of the manifold is not equal to zero, then the group is not uniform. Okay, so then come on two things. So the universal the universal cover of this manifold is contrary but This manifold is contractible, that's Hadermann's theorem. And in fact, M plays the role of V gamma, becomes V gamma, the classifying space. So this condition really is H to I of gamma at I. All right, now, so we have this assumption. So I want to make a few observations. First, if the manifold is orientable, If the manifold is orientable and even dimensional, then the fundamental class is not zero, so this condition is automatic. Now, if the manifold is auto-dimensional, then by quant array duality, you need only one of the homologic good motor vanish, because by by point array you get also an even homologic good motor vanish. An even homological not to vanish. So, in particular, let's say you need only H1 not to vanish. So, what is that condition? That condition means that it's equivalent that there is a surjective homomorphism from pi 1m onto the integers. So, a stronger assumption, this group has a surjective homomorphism. Has a subjective homomorphism onto the integer. So that would imply that for H1 in the equal number. But that's a difficult condition to check. So there are famous results in literature which established a non-vanishing prospective number for such groups. Alright, now what about the residually finite? So such fundamental groups, so it's a classic result, they are hyperbolic. And then there is a conjecture which opened problems. Which open problem maybe speculative, I'm not an expert, but an open problem whether all hyperbolic groups are visible finite. Alright, so once again, as I mentioned, the group is hyper-quiet. Now, in fact, I'm Now, in fact, I mentioned that the result of Chromo, the comparison map is rejected in all dimensions. So then one would expect, okay, maybe something similar to what happened in dimension two might happen here, right? In dimension two, what it happened if the map If this was rejected in dimension two, that group was not uniform to local stable with respect to threshold algebras. What if that happens for H4? I'm working on that approach, and I have some hopes, but not that I'm not ready to talk about that. But the point of the theorem that I stated. Of the theorem that I stated below before. In fact, the proof involves a K-theory counterpart of this property, of the subjectivity of this method, but it's more restrictive to fundamental. Namely, that the K-theory of the manifold, K0, is generated by vector particles which are uniformly almost flat. Okay, so What that means is that if one takes such a prompt, now since the so this is a classic result that each element in the fundamental group is given by a unique geodesic. So now, if one transpire transport along the unique geodesics, the Unique geodesics that represent the element of environmental group. This will yield almost a representation rho which uniformly bounded effects, just as in the assumption on UL or UU. And make the analogy between this property and then the subjectivity of the context. Okay, now why are such almost representations not perturbable? Representation not perturbable to true representation is due to the fact that the obstruction comes from the corresponding bundle. If the corresponding bundle has a non-vanishing rational shell class, then that's an abstraction. So that's an abstraction. Shows that these uniform almost representations are not rectangular. Okay, so this involves various results. Many people mentioned Kasparov. Kasparov is the gamma element, and so dual comparison map is congruent of Moscovich. So Moskovich. So they first introduced this idea of obtaining ELMOS representations from ELMOS clad one. Gromovitu worked on the gamma element and Kubota. So he had a key idea that the temperament that And pressing the ergonomic method that I introduced. So now I'll say a few words in a second about these bundles, but the first chat classes of these bundles correspond to the invariant discussor introspection. Remember, earlier we had this cosine that associated with the hormones representation, which gave an element an H2. Okay, so in this setup, the corresponds to the first germ master. Okay, so now for applications. So we take the Lorentz group, N1, the component of the identity. So if γ is a torsion-free co-compact lattice, so if n is given, or n it's odd, but one of the cohomology groups cannot find. One of the cohomology groups than alternation, then gamma is not U, is not UL stable. So face this stronger condition of or weaker condition of stability. And how is this derived? So one considers the n-dimensional hyperbolic space, which has sectional constant const sectional curvature negative one, so it's obtained distinction. And then gamma is free here, but it's a fundamental group, so we take the orbit space that are manifold. That's it. And the case n equals 2 includes the surface principle. Of course, this is more complicated. They are not age to approach, but it's included surprisingly. Okay, and then I say, okay, what about examples? Examples. So I collected some examples from the literature, from a paper of Nielsen in 1966. Okay, so I mean examples of arithmetic vertices, complete groups, which are not really stable. So now one consider SLN plus one of Z roots to be and paste the intersection with S L With SO of this quadratic form. So, what do we mean by this? So, all the elements in S1 plus 1 which preserve this quadratic form, which is for the quadratic form. Now, they are so compact, but there is an issue about torsion. You want the portion to be a manifold, not an order-fold. Not only that, one also needs to check that the homology of these groups is not trivial. And that's the result of Milson. He showed that the first betting normals, so in particular H1, are non-zero. But he shows this in order to guarantee that one gets such groups and also get of torsion, one goes to some congruence of class. So one takes element. Class. So one takes elements in this code, in this element, which are congruent, module both 3 and 11, to quite energy. Then in the given case, they are not really stable. And if if on it if and it's odd, one takes an extra. Uh when it takes an extra condition. So they are, I mean in some sense they are not that complete, but they have multiple results. Right, and then more about, maybe I say one more word about the one-dimensional case. So, in the same paper that I quoted earlier, that Bada Elikos is our mind, they computed the homology of less. The cohomology of compact lattices in Lie groups, they say they had this exception. What was the exception? They assumed that the Lie group is not locally isomorphic to two groups. So in the even case, they didn't, the assumption was it should not be isomorphic, locally isomorphic to this Lorentz group. So then they return to the Lorentz group and then analyze. And then there they show the following property. There is a finite There is a finite, so let gamma 1 be an alphabetical compact like this, then it has a finite index group, which in turn, all of its finite index subgroups have non-vanishing even homology, and therefore they are not even LL stable. So there are plenty of such groups. Okay, and we concluded in a paper they are not LL stable. We concluded in a paper they are not stable, but with this observation, my earlier research, then one can conclude that a group like this is not even UL stable. Okay, and then I would recap this notion of stability. So here is the diagram we have seen before. Okay, so and then And then maybe some approximate pictures of the relative position, and then some examples in each class. So you see, in UU, uniform to uniform, you have most higher length lattices groups, and many random lattices, in particular those that I discussed. They are outside the UN class. So maybe I'll say one more word. Just one minute what I have in mind. One more, and then I'll stop here. So the method that Gromov, and then Konkromov Gromorph, then Khon Gromov suggested, is that to construct almost homomorphism, they construct first almost freight bundles by geometric methods. So they pull their maps for certain manifolds to even spheres and they pull back the bottle and then they consider. The water element, and then they consider under separate assumption assumption uh finite powers, and then that's how they construct almost a flat one. And uh then final transport in those bundles would be almost homomorphisms. And they use that method in announcement to prove many cases of the novel conjecture. Okay, now uh the other direction can be also worked out. Can be also worked out. But uh, I still want to mention uh one key idea, method that I uh that I used. So assume, assume you have an almost representation, an almost representation. This is an almost representation. Okay, so uh so you can extend it to an almost So you can extend it to an almost representation of L1 gamma into n by n matrices. Now there is this duality between group system algebras and classifying space, which is explained by Baum Kohn theory. Bound code theory. So on B gamma, one has a canonical bound double michenko line bound up. I mean this algorithm gamma. So gamma x diagonally d gamma and gamma and the quotient, so you get a bundle over d gamma. Okay, so this is the Mishenko line bundle. And I will skip details if P is compact. Otherwise, one works with subsets, compact subsets of gamma. Let me call this bundle. These fibers are L1 gamma. So now one can push forward. You see, if you have a representation of L1 gamma, one can push forward this Mishenpo line bundle. This mission for line bundle to get a bundle of R B gamma. That's the so-called Atia map, which associated a flat bundle to a line bundle. We didn't use this formula machine. But in this context, we can push forward this bundle using... You see, if you have a projector in algebra and you have an approximate map, its image is almost a projection. Is almost a projection. So, in this way, you can push a projection to almost projection, which can be perturbed by projection, even if you have an approximate. So, if you have an approximate representation, you can push this forward to small sharp of E gamma. And this, in terms of the bundles, you get a vector bundle of Ib gamma. And now, if the almost representation pertaps to a representation, this bundle will be flat. And for flat bundles, observation of Milmer, all chem classes vanish rationally. So if one constructs Telmond's representation such that the push-forward of Mishenko-line bundle does not have vanished irrational churn classes, then you cannot quature. You cannot put that. Then the question is: okay, but how do you construct such a representation if you don't start with the buttons? And what I did was to construct this using quasi-diagonal group algebra. And then in the general situation, I use this idea of ubota, which extends the range of groups for which the system can demand. Thank you. Any questions for anything?
