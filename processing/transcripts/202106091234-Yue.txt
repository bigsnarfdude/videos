This is a collaborative work between a lot of people here. I'm a faculty member from Virginia Tech. And Yuanan is a faculty member at NGIT. And Jimmy is the math man behind this whole project. He's from UBC. And we have three students here who actually did most of the work. Okay. So here are the contents. Contents. Just five topics here: introduction, mathematical formulation, and I'm going to use LU method to track the deformation of the hydrogel and some numerical examples. Finally, summary. Okay, so first about the hydrogel. Hydrogels are actually just cross-linked polymer networks and they're infused with aqueous solvent. So if you just zoom in, you'll see a solid skeleton. See a solid skeleton and in a void area, a void region, actually, they're occupied by fluid. So that's hydrogel. Hydrogel are very important in a lot of emerging technologies, such as this one, the tissue engineering, and the cell culture and the drug delivery. And in some applications, like this one, obviously, we have this kind of cell-all drug encapsulation. And in this process, the interfacial dynamics. Process, the interfacial dynamics plays a very important role. That's the motivation of our work. So, problem setup. We are looking at a hydrogel droplet suspended in some outer fluid. So, in this hydrogel, we have a solid phase, actually solid skeleton, and we have a fluid phase, which is the solvent. To describe the whole problem, we need a lot of Describe the whole problem, we need a lot of variables, like a solid fraction. So, this thing here is actually like a power medium, but it's elastic, it can deform. We have a solid displacement so that we can define the solid stress and also the solid velocity and pressure, which is shared between those two components, between the solid and fluid, and the Darcy drag between those two components. So, that's the variables that we need to use. Just some conventional. Use just some conventions here. The capital letters are for the exterior fluid, which is Newtonian fluid. And lowercase ones, they are for the things in the hydrogel. And then S here denotes the solid phase, and the F here denotes the fluid phase in the hydrogel. Okay, so in the simulation of this problem, there are two major difficulties. One is the boundary conditions on the interface between the Conditions on the interface between the force medium and the exterior fluid. And for this one, we use an energy dissipation argument so that we can detect a PD system that's compliant with the second law of thermodynamics. Another difficulty is the full structure interaction problem that we are facing. Because the solar scattering here may deform, so we have to use some techniques to track the deformation. To track the deformation. So we use the ALE method in this work to track the deformation of a cell skeleton. Okay, the mathematical formulation. This problem is a, so there are some existing equations in the literature that we can follow. Like, let's see, here I list some equations that we need to follow, kind of a standard equations. Like even hydrogel, we use this kind of brink mic. We use this kind of Brinkmann equation for the fluid, and this is the solid equation. This one here is essentially just like a stoker equation, but we need to consider the volume fraction. Phi F is the volume fraction of fluid, and also we need to consider the Dossi drag between the two components. Okay, and we also need to consider the mass conservation of those components. Actually, those two equations, we only need to take one, the other ones. Take one. The other one is because phi s plus phi f is equal to one. And we need to satisfy the continuity equation. And the exterior flow, we use the Stokes equation. The Stokes equation. And the boundary equations. Oh, okay. Oh, but boundary conditions on the hydro interface, there are some conditions like the mass balance. This has to be satisfied. And there are a lot of other conditions we have to determine based on. Have to determine it based on the energy dissipation. Okay, and we also need to satisfy this kinematic equation that is solid velocity is equal to the material derivative of a solid displacement and some constitutive relations. Like a solid stress is a function of a solid displacement and the food stress in the hard jaw and the food stress outside the harja. The full stress outside the hydrogel. Okay, the question here: how to determine this interaction term, Darcy drag. Actually, this one is a, we have a kind of a common adopted form. And more importantly, how to determine other boundary conditions on this hydrogen interface. What we do is just take the actually just like we have government equations. We can be derived based on We can be derived based on those Gautam equations, based on momentum equations, we can write the energy equation. So, what we do is actually take the inner product of this equation with the fluid velocity in hydrogel, this one with the solid velocity in hydrogel, and this equation with the pressure inside hydrogel, and this guy here with the velocity outside the hydrogel and the pressure outside the hydrogel. We can get a big equation and the Big equation, and we use a integration by parts and use divergence theorem. Eventually, we can get this complete form. So, this one is if we just characterize the different terms here, you can easily see that we have this one, the surface integration on out boundary. This is simply just the external work. And also, we have this surface integration on a hydrogel interface. This is a term that we are going to work with. With okay, and there are some volume integrations like this one, the viscous dissipation. And actually, based on this one, you can imagine what kind of form you should propose for your viscous stress. You need to make sure that this guy here is, okay, if I don't include the negative sign, this term in the green box should be positive. And there's viscous dissipation inside the hydrogel. And this one here, this is solid stress. And if the solid is And if the solid is hyper-elastic, it can be shown that this is actually just the rate of change of the elastic energy. So it's, and we have the dissipation due to density drag. So we can, that's the whole energy equation. Of course, I can put it into a nicer form. Like on the left-hand side, we have a little bit of change of the elastic energy, which is the only free energy in this whole system, because we don't consider inertia, otherwise. We don't consider inertia, otherwise, there will be kinetic energy here. And on the right-hand side, we have external work. The others, we have to make sure the others are non-positive so that if we don't have external work, then the actual energy keeps decreasing. Okay, so this one is always guaranteed if we use the standard viscous stress term. This one, we can guarantee it's non-positive if we use this Darcy drag. We use this Darcy drag. And here, this C here is just a friction factor. And what we are going to work with is this term A. We need to make sure that this term A has to be non-positive. We need to propose boundary conditions such that this term here is non-positive. Of course, there are many ways to do this. One way to do it is just we can decompose the velocity into two parts. One is the normal velocity. Two parts. One is the normal velocity, the other one is the tangential velocity. Okay, this one here, this tensor here is actually the projection tensor. I think I saw this tensor in Patrick and Nick's presentation yesterday. The same projection tensor. It projects a vector onto the plane, onto the tangential plane. Okay. And also, if we consider this relation, this is just mass balance. We need to make sure that. We need to make sure that this condition is always satisfied. Then we can write the term A into this form. And there are four terms here. We make sure that each term separately, they are non-positive. Then we can guarantee the dissipation. So from the first term, you see that the normal velocity difference just needs to be proportional to the normal component of this traction, actually, traction difference. Traction, actually, traction difference. If this can be satisfied, then we can guarantee this green box here to be non-positive. And this eta here is just some phenomenal parameter. We call it interfacial permeability coefficient. And the second term, this is actually just the slip velocity, the difference between the tangential velocity at the two sides of the hydro interface. And this slip velocity is a proportional. This slip velocity is proportional to the tangential component of the traction, and the beta here is the so-called slip coefficient. And then the third one, if we just let this guy here to be proportional to the tangential component, this part, that is this one, then we can make sure that the third term here is also non-positive. So finally, this one here, actually, we don't have any choice in here. Any choice in here. So, this is actually the balance of total traction. That's on the two sides of the surface, the attraction should be the same. And thus, this term here is zero. It doesn't contribute to the dissipation. So that's the four conditions we can get just from this energy dissipation argument. Of course, the first three conditions here, they're not unique. You can just decompose. You can just decompose this A or the velocity in different ways and get different conditions. So, the summary here is for the matching condition, we need to satisfy mass balance, total traction balance, and we have choices in other three conditions. So here, I just did two options, just two choices. Actually, those conditions, whether they are correct or not, it still needs verification. Needs verification. You need to compare it with experiments or compare it with some other well-established theory. Okay. The difference between these two is just when you consider the velocity difference here or velocity jump, whether it's with respect to the solid velocity in the hydrogel or whether it's with respect to the fluid velocity in the hydrogel. That's the only difference here. Okay, those are just the matching conditions. Just the matching conditions. With those matching conditions, we can come up with a weak form for our system. The whole weak form here. The complication here, we have to put the weak form into a single equation. The reason is because we have to satisfy this essential condition on the hydro interface. So that is those solutions, the trial solutions. Solutions, the trial solutions and the test functions, they are not independent. They have to be connected by this mass balance on the hydrograph interface. So we have to keep it in this single form, a single equation form. And also, if you can plug in the boundary conditions, the surface integral on the hydro surface, they can be simplified. It's pretty simple form here. And just Just a side note here. Actually, if there's no third velocity, actually, if there's no surf velocity, this one, this one, the same, then those integrations on the hydro interface will just be gone. They don't contribute to the weak form. Okay, so that's just the weak form here. And this weak form, you can And this weak form, you can easily see that actually it will reduce to, yeah, if you choose the proper test functions, you will reproduce the disputative energy law. And if you choose different boundary conditions, then those terms, the blue terms, they will be different. Okay, and of course, we need to solve the solid one fraction, which is quite standard. Is quite standard and solid displacement. Okay, so that's the formulation that we're going to use. Okay, next I'm okay. I think I have to hurry up. We use LU method. We use actually the mapping type of LU method. So all the equations are solved in the reference frame with a fixed mesh, but we have to consider mapping. Consider mapping. The advantage is that the mesh is fixed, so we don't need to deal with the moving mesh. But the disadvantage is that the formulation gets extremely complicated. But theoretically, this is equivalent to the moving mesh ALU. It's just whether you want to spend time in moving the mesh or you want to spend time in the incorporate mapping into your. The incorporate mapping into our government equations. Okay, yeah. So that's this is for the mesh displacement. Actually, I should say the mapping displacement and the solid fraction. So each time step here, we first advance this equation in time to get the new bond fraction for the solid. And then we solve this equation and this displacement equation all together. This displacement equation altogether using Newton's method. And the code is developed using DO2 Fanan library. Okay, and here's just some constitutive relations. Okay. Yeah, in the following, I'm going to talk about some examples. So first is the compression of hydrogel by inform flow. So in this problem here, we consider just the abundant compression. Just the abundant compression. Do you think that you have just a layer of hydrogel? You can think about just like a sponge. And there's a liquid here coming through the sponge. And the right boundary of this hydrogel is fixed. And the left boundary will be because there's a Darcy drag in here, once the flow flows through the hydrogel, it will compress the hydrogel. That's a That's this problem here. So it's okay, yeah. Here's the just the transient behavior. So we have the inflow. Inflow is a velocity fixed. So at first, oh, okay, this US here is just the displacement of this interface, this interface. So it gets compressed. Okay, so it's actually. Okay, so it actually gets compressed, eventually it stabilizes. And in this process, once it gets compressed, the solid fraction, the solid fraction increases, and also the solid will slow down. At first, the solid moves together with the liquid, so you see the velocity of the fluid is equal to one, the same as inflow. But later on, the solid will, you know, it will come to a rest. The it will come to a rest so because of the uh volume conservation, so and inside the inside the hydrogel, the full fraction is a we use a full fraction which is a 0.5, so there will be some variation, but then roughly just like the fluid, the space for the fluid to flow is just half of the channel area. So this fluid blast will increase to about two here. Will increase to about two here so that you can conserve mass. Okay, so that's the transient. And here's the steady state profile for the Darcy flow. We use Darcy flow because we have a theoretical solution. We can easily get a theoretical solution compared with our numeric solution. So you can see in the steady state, this guy here, this curve, black curve here, is the normal stress, the x-axis component of the stress. The XX component of the stress, and then because of the Dussy drag, the foam, the hydrogel, gets compressed, and the dust drag behaves like a body force. So it's compressed more at the right end. The negative number here means that it's compressed. So the magnitude actually gets bigger at the right end. And correspondingly, at the right end, the solid fraction is bigger. Is bigger so that at the right end the volume of the fluid fraction is lower, so the fluid velocity will be higher at the right end. And also you can see the pressure inside the hydrogel. That pressure equation will drive the full velocity inside the hydrogel. So we have the comparison with the theory. The theory is obtained from Darcy flow, and we assume we use. And we assume we use a linear elastic model. Okay, and some convergence tests. We have a first order in time and second order in space. If we just look at the solid fraction, actually, if we look at other variables, we may get a higher convergence order. Because we use a Q2 here for velocities, we may get a third order. And I think for the interface location, somehow we got the fourth order convergence. Got the fourth-order convergence. I don't know whether that's a super convergence or just some coincidence. Because this problem here is a pretty simple problem, just 1D, essentially 1D, although we use a 2D code to compute it. Mengtao, we are getting a bit late. Please, in two minutes. Okay. Yeah, I think I started late. But anyways, I'll just wrap up quickly. So the two-layer share flow. Shear flow, we have a yeah, the shear of this hydrogel, and we can capture the actually the interface slip at the hydrogel interface. And in the free flow region, you see the shear flow, yeah, the velocity profile is linear, and the inside hydrogel is non-linear because of the Darcy drag. We have a nice comparison with the theory. The theory. And also, we did some calculation on this drop deformation in a thinner and drift flow. So once again, we have a very nice agreement with the theory. This theory is based on a small deformation and I think a linear elastic model and the infinite domain. So it's a and you see the relative error here actually gets bigger as the definition. Bigger as the deformation increases, so which is expected, because our model here allows large deformation. Okay, if we allow the elongation rate to be large enough, we may run into actually this kind of failure of the material. So at the tip here, the volume fraction may decrease to a point which is close to zero, and the material actually fails. That's the displacement field, the X displacement, Y displacement. Why displacement? Okay. Okay, here's the summary. I think because I'm running out of time, so I just stop here. Let's see whether you have any questions. And yeah, thank you all for your attention. Thank you very much. And sorry for rushing at the end. We have one question from Mike Ram that was, I think, partially answered by James Feng. But Mike, do you think it's useful to ask a question? Yeah, yeah, I think. I think, yeah, so this is a very interesting problem, and it reminds me that this issue of boundary conditions, of course, interfaces are non-trivial. And so Jimmy said something in the chat, basically there's an ambiguity because now you have two phases, and how is the momentum distributed between the two phases, essentially? I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that. It seems It seems like there should be some boundary layer theory or something like that between a clear fluid and a Brinkman medium that could address this. Yeah, for that one, so how to distribute the momentum? That's quite tricky from our energy dissipation argument here. We couldn't answer that question. Question. So we still need input from other analysis to just to impose that condition into our energy argument that we can get a boundary condition, which is, you know, kind of, we can call it thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions. So one question would be: does it matter? Is there a boundary layer in which the details matter right at the interface? Right at the interface. But things don't matter outside that boundary layer. Is there anything that could be done? Certainly, you could do direct simulations. Yeah, that one is a... Essentially, you have a coarse grain model. Yeah, that's right. That question is. I have to say it's so the model here is a kind of more as a phenomenological model. Phenomenological model. We just make sure the phenomenon here is consistent with the thermodynamics. But if you want to look at the details, then we do need the Devax simulation. So my question is, how much does the choice matter overall? If you compared your two cases and then looked at the overall behavior. Behavior, are there strong effects on the choice you make in modeling that boundary condition? Oh, yeah, yes, yes. There are, for example, the PC1, PC2 here. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just like this one here. Oh, yeah. BC1 doesn't induce any flow inside the hydrogel. Inside the higher gel. The reason is actually just because the particular format of this boundary condition, the slip is defined with respect to the solid velocity. So it doesn't have any requirement on the full velocity. And eventually, the solid velocity flow velocity, there will be zero inside the hydrogel. And of course, that's consistent with the zero full. Excuse me, with a zero full stress inside the hydrogen. I see. Okay, so it does matter. It doesn't matter, yeah. Okay, very interesting. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, so I'll just stop here.
