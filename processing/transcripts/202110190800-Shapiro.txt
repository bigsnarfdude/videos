Okay, good to know. Okay, so this is a story about real algebraic geometry and counting, and it is closely related to Viraud's patchworking method behind it somehow, we hope. And so that's probably the closest I can get to. I can get to the main topic of the conference. And I hope you like it because it's both elementary and a lot of things to do, but also nice and has a lot of historical connotations. Okay, so let's see what happens now. Good. So there are here some references. We hopefully will put an archive this week for this menu. This week for this material and text on archive this week. And then, very good, interesting sources for this is Huygens' work here in Latin and also English translation and also classical book by Salman, which was first published 1860. And this is the last edition, 1960. Okay, so I'll be talking about evolutes. So evolute is Is a curve. So, if we are given a plane curve in the Euclidean plane, so we fix the metric, which is important, the standard Euclidean metric. And then at a generic point of a curve, we have a curvature circle, a circle which has maximal contact with our curve at this point. And its centrum is called the centrum of curvature. And now, if we look at all curvature center. All curvature center varying the point along the curve will get the evolute. So, this is a classical notion. So, it first appeared in Apollonius from Perga's book on conic sections. So, this book was the manuscript disappeared. So, and it became available in Europe after a series of translations first to Arabic. Translations first to Arabic, then in Spain from Arabic to Spanish, and then by some Spanish monk finally to Latin. And actually, Newton used this book a lot when he was proving the ellipticity of the orbits of orbits of planet motions. He used very sophisticated results of Apollonius on conic sections. Or conic sections. So Higgins developed the theory of evolute. So Paulonius only mentioned that there is a curve which, if one reads him carefully, is an evolute of an ellipse. So Huygens actually developed the theory of evolute in a very interesting context. He was trying to construct a good pendulum because the physical pendulum Because the physical pendulum, in fact, its period is dependent on the displacement. And I'll show you. So this, it was a problem posed in the 16th century. It was a challenge from Bernoulli brothers to Newton. How can you create such a curve that if you put a ball on it independently on ball's initial position? On ball's initial position, if the ball moves under the effect of the gravitation power, it will go, its period would be constant independently of which place you'll start with. And it turns out that several people solved it. Newton, in particular, published anonymously his solution in a journal, but Bernoulli discovered him. There is his famous phrase that you Is his famous phrase that you recognize a lion if you find it his claw? So, let me show you quickly how so yeah. So, do you see my screen now? Yes, good. Okay, look what happens. Okay, look what happens. So you have four balls moving along this curve, and they come to the origin at exactly the same moment. That's a miracle. That's a cycloid. So that's how you should how Huygens was solving the problem of Of tautotron, tautochron, this curve was called, and this actually appeared to be a cycloid. And cycloid is a unique curve with the property that its evolute is a cycloid. This was very essential. Okay, now let's go further. So let's see. Good. So this is Huygens. And this is the first page of his book. Is the first page of his book in Latin? It's actually freely available on the internet and it contains a whole bunch of beautiful illustrations, including a large number of evolutes. Okay, so let me jump to more mathematical part of my talk. So from the computational point of view, you can get an evalu by if you have a local parametrization of your regional curve gamma. So the evolute would be parametrized as gamma. Would be parametrized as gamma plus this curvature centrum times the unit normal to the curve at this point. And from this, you can, if you have a local parametrization of a curve, you get a very nice parametrization of the evolute. And if your curve is given by an equation in two variables, you can also get a system of three equations, and if you eliminate the And if you eliminate the original variables xy of your curve, which we did in many cases using Macaulay, you can get the algebraic equation, if your original curve is algebraic, you can get the algebraic equation for the evolute, but it's actually starts quite becoming quite tricky computationally. As soon as your curve is already a generic cubic, it doesn't work very well. It works quite nice if your original curve is. Quite nice if your original curve is a rational curve, but otherwise it seems to take forever for Macaulay. So, basic examples of the evolute is in case of a parabola, you get the usual cusp, the cuspidal cubic. And in case of an ellipse, you get this curve, which is an asteroid, it's a sextic. It's a sex stick, and we'll talk about it a little bit later. It has four cusps in particular. It's a singular sex stick. So one important property which we'll use is that if your original curve has an inflection point, then the curvature radius becomes infinity, and that means that the evolute will tend to infinity along the normal. Along the normal to your original curve at the point at the inflection point. So here we have this cubic, and then it has an inflection here, and this is the normal curve, and that's to which this direction the evolute will tend to infinity. Yeah, okay. So in case when the gamma is original, gamma is rational, then we get the rational parametrization. That we get the rational parametrization of the evolute. And also, one important property is that you can think of the evolute as an envelope of the family of normals. So the dual curve to the evolute is the curve consisting of normals to the original curve. It looks similar to the dual curve, but you have to, you know, instead of taking tangent lines, take the normal lines. Lines, take the normal lines, and this would be the dual curve to the evalu. We'll need this later on. Okay, now, so this is the definition of the curve of normals. So we'll be taking the projective closure of the curve of normals, which originally is only defined in the affine part, but then we take the projectivization of this thing. Take the projectivization of this thing. And for the curve of normals, we also have a natural parameterization. And similarly, we can get it's using Macaulay, we can eliminate a couple of variables and in many cases get the algebraic equation for the curve of normals. Okay, so evolutes and curve of normals was studied class. Was studied classically. And one of the books, one of the among very many books on algebraic curves, there are not so many containing material on evolutes. And among those, most important is this book of Salmon, which is mentioned, published in the second half of the 19th century. And it has a lot of details about complex properties of the complexification of the evolute. Of the evolute. And in particular, he shows that I show you a couple of prepositions: that if we start with a real algebraic curve of a given degree D in general position with respect to the line at infinity and with only nodes and cusps and singularities, then you have that the regional curve, the curve of the evolute, and the curve of normals are birationally equivalent. And you can even weaken the assumption. And you can even weaken the assumption there, so they are typically birationally equivalent. Well, it's kind of obvious because we associate to a generic point on our curve the center of the curvature, which is a point on the evolute. And also we can associate to it the point on the curve of normals, which is just the normal line at that point. And the degree of the curve of the degree of evolute for curves in general. For curves in general position and with cusps and nodes, only is given by 3d times d minus 1 minus six nodes minus eight cusps. So typically, if your curve is smooth, the degree would be 3d times d minus 1. And the degree of the curve of normals is d squared minus twice sigma minus 3 kappa. So typically, again, for a smooth curve, you'll get d squared. Smooth curve and in general position with this. Smooth curve and in general position with respect to infinity. Okay, so there is also another statement which describes how many singular points you'll have. It turns out that typically the evolute has no inflection points. It just has cusps, typically, cusps and nodes, but no inflection points, which is related to its property that it's some kind of a wavefront. Of a wavefront, I can talk about this for somebody who is interested, and then there is also a count of the number of complex cusps, the number of complex nodes, both for the evolute and the curve of normals. But yeah, we'll probably need this, but I don't want you to just to concentrate on these formulas for the moment. Okay, now let me mention that the two. That there are two classically studied notions in differential geometry which are closely related to study of evolutes and the curve of normal. One such notion is a notion of a vertex of a curve. And the vertex of a curve, if you have a plane curve, its vertex is a point where the curvature attains its critical. Attains its critical value where there is either a maximum of the curvature or a minimum of the curvature. So, about 100 years ago, a beautiful theorem was proved that if you look at any closed non-self-intersecting oval in the plane, then it has at least four vertices. So, if you think about the ellipse, the ellipse has four vertices, two points where Is two points where the curvature is maximum and two points where the curvature is minimal. And so, yeah, so this theorem led to a large number of generalizations, but it's a theorem of differential geometry. It doesn't have anything to do immediately with algebraic curves. Okay, then another notion which was studied a lot is the notion of a diameter of a curve. If you have a curve in the If you have a curve in the plane, again, it's an oval. So a diameter is a chord connecting two points on this curve such that it's orthogonal to the curve at both ends. So if you think about the ellipse, so its large axis would be one diameter and its other axis would be another diameter. So it's a chord which is perpendicular to the curve on both sides. On both sides. And vertices are related to cusps of the evolute. So at the vertex, vertex, the evolute will have a real cusp. And for a diameter, diameter is related to nodes of the curve of normals, actually crew nodes. So the real nodes, a real node of a real algebraic curve. Of a real algebraic curve are of two types. Either it's a crew node where a curve looks like a cross, or it's an isolated point like x squared plus i squared equals to zero. This is called an arc node in classical terminology. Okay, now one more thing we'll be discussing is the notion of an R degree, real degree. So So it's the following: if you have, say, a real algebraic surface, so it has its complex degree, we all know about, but also we can kind of define its real degree, which is you look at generic real lines cutting your surface and you count how many times they do this without multiplicity. And we take the supremum of the number of intersection points. Number of intersection points of a generic real line with your surface. And this number is, of course, small or equal than the usual degree, but it can be strictly smaller, of course. Well, there is a trivial example when the zero locus is empty, but that's not what we want. Let us look at the case of the asteroid. So this thing has degree. thing it has degree six but there is no real line cutting it more than four times so its real degree is four but its usual degree is six that's the kind of notion we will start study okay now let me briefly tell you which questions we were discussing so in this paper we were discussing So, in this paper, we were discussing four types of questions. The first one: if we fix a positive integer d and looking at all real algebraic curves of degree d, we will be asking what is the maximal possible number of r degrees for the evolute and for the curve of normals. So, we're allowing our basic curve to be any curve of degree d. Of degree d. So we're looking at the family of evolutes and we're asking, we know the complex answer: what would be the degree of the evolute, but what is its real degree? And as this example with ellipse shows, so in the case of degree two, we have ellipses and we have hyperbolas and parabolas. And in all of them, well, both for ellipses and for the hyperbolas, the degree of the And for the hyperbolas, the degree of the evolute is six, but its real degree one can show is only four. Okay, let me now formulate the second question. The second question is the question about what is, again, we're fixing the degree D, and what is the maximal possible number of real cusps you can get on the evolute. And this is, as I mentioned, related to what is the maximal number. To what is the maximal number of vertices of a real algebraic curve of degree D? This is question number two. Question number three is how many diameters do you get on real algebraic curves of degree D, which is reformulated as the maximal possible number of crew nodes or real nodes looking like a crossing on the curve of normals. And finally, the last question which we discussed was. Which we discussed: what is the maximal possible number of crew nodes on the evolute itself? So, this is related to points in the regional plane through which you have a two, which can serve as centers of two or more curvature circles. So, curvature circles might have a common center, different. might have a common center different curvature so circles and that's the question about how many such points such point correspond to a crew node of the evolute so what can be the maximal number of such things okay now let me start with our first result and i hope to be to be able to prove at least couple of them they are not so complicated the proofs and then we'll see what happens Will see what happens. Okay, the first result is the upper with the lower bound for the maximal R degree among the evolutes for curves of degree D. And we're saying that it is no less than D times D minus 3. So the complex answer is 3 D times D minus 1. So it's kind of one-third of this. Of this, uh, and it's a it's definitely not sharp, but that's the thing we were able to prove. And how one can prove this? The proof is not very complicated, it's based on Klein's famous theorem about the number of inflections. So, Klein has shown in 1870s the following result: that if you look at the real algebraic degree D and count Degree D and count its number of inflection points and complex inflection points. Then the number of real inflection points is at most one-third of the number of complex inflection points. And in fact, there exist curves in each degree D for which this bound is achieved. So the number of complex inflection points one can easily prove using the Prove using the Hessian because inflection points are related to the intersection of the Hessian equal to zero with the original curve. So it's typically 3d times d minus 2. And one-third of this would be d times d minus 2. Now using this fact, we can easily prove our result, huh? Well, at each inflection point or at each real inflection point of the original Real inflection point of your original curve, the evolute goes to infinity. You probably remember this example I showed you with the cubic curve, which means that the evolute will hit the line at infinity. So we can easily construct real algebraic curves for which its evolute will hit the line at infinity d times d minus two times. Well, now if you shift Well, now if you shift this line at infinity a little bit to a usual affine line, due to the transversality with the intersection at infinity, you get exactly d times d minus 2, which is what we want. And I want to mention that this is not a sharp bound. If we look at degree 2, our bound is empty. It gives zero while we know that the actual answer. know that the actual answer for the R degree of evolutes of conics is four. Now if we look at cubics, our bound gives us three and it's not at all difficult to construct cubics whose evolute has a real degree at least six. So we don't quite know. We think maybe that the leading coefficient d squared is correct, but definitely there is Correct, but definitely there is a room for improvement of this result. We just, yeah, we just don't know the tools exactly. We're just scratching the surface. Okay, now if we ask a similar question for the curve of normals, it actually is so that the situation is quite different. So the degree of a typical curve of normals for the real algebraic curve of degree D is D squared. degree d is d squared. It's not d times d minus one as you would expect because d times d minus one you get for the dual curve, but for curve of normals it's d squared. It's a little bit bigger. And it turns out that you can actually construct original curves whose curves of normal will have real degree exactly equal to d squared. Let me tell you how to do that. Okay, the idea is to in through the rest of this talk, all my methods would be, all our methods with co-authors would be to get examples by deforming real arrangement of lines. So, and that's why it seems like closely related to pitch walking technology. So, we start with the famous result. So we start with the famous result by Brizzotti, really proven, published more or less 100 years ago, 1923, I think. And it says the following. Assume that you have a real algebraic curves, curve with only nodes, the singularities, can be both crew nodes and act nodes, both crossings and just small points there. And this is a curve of some given degree D. So his results. Degree D. So his result says that you can find a small deformation of such a curve that each of the nodes, real nodes, would be deformed the way you want. So there are two topological types of deformations of both a crew node and an arc node, of course. So an arc node, which is a point, you can either resolve that it disappears completely or becomes a little circle. Little circle and the crew node you can either resolve one way or the other way. So it becomes looking like a small hyperbola piece, either one way or the other way. And Brizotti tells us that you can independently assign which way you want to resolve each of the nodes. And there is a small deformation not increasing the degree, which will give you this chosen, a priori chosen type. Okay, now to show that we can find a real algebraic curve whose curve of normals will have degree D squared, the original curve has degree D. We argue as follows. Let us look at any generic arrangement of D-real lines and pick a point generically again. Pick a point generically again. This is point Z. Now I'm saying that I will be able to resolve my original arrangement of lines such that in the following way. So first of all, through this point D, sorry, through this point Z, there are D normals to D lines. So if we deform our curve small enough, so you'll get a normal. So you'll get a normal to the deformation close to your original normal. And the second thing is that if you have a vertex, so a typical arrangement will have D choose two vertices, yes, where two pairs of lines cross. And you can deform each vertex in such a way that close to the chord, to the straight segment connecting your point Z with With this vertex, they will be two normals will be born. So, in this way, the original point Z is a line on the dual plane. So, in terms of the curve of normals, that means that the line corresponding to this point Z will hit the corresponding small deformation of a configuration. small deformation of a configuration of lines exactly d times d minus one plus d, which is d squared times, which and d squared is the complex answer. In this way, we're happy. Okay, and this is this picture illustrates what happens, what kind of resolution of a crew node you have to do to get close to this straight segment. This straight segment CZ two normals. If you resolve this node in another way, like this, then you'll not be getting two normals to the code. Okay, so this is about this theorem. Now let me probably I have something like 10 minutes. I have something like 10 minutes. I guess maybe I'll be able to talk about the case of cusps, which real cusps of the evolute, which corresponds to the case to counting vertices on the original real algebraic curve. And the vertices again are points where the curvature attains either a maximum or a minimum. Okay, so first of all, the result. So, first of all, the result is that typically for a generic curve, the complex number of vertices which is equal to 3d times 2d minus 3. This is, in other words, the number of complex casps when they evaluate. So, this can be read off from these results of Salman or obtained using more models. obtained using more modern technology with algebraic geometry nowadays in complex of a complex field has a lot of lots of nice formulas okay and our claim is that we can find a curve of degree d real curve whose evolute has at least one-third d times to d minus three real cusps or in other words Or, in other words, the regional curve has at least d times 2d minus 3 real vertices. Okay, and this proof is based on the following construction and lemma. Again, we will be using small deformations of line arrangements, but now we'll be paying attention to what happens close to the so-called Close to the so-called edge. An edge is just a bounded straight segment connecting two vertices of an arrangement. So we'll be paying attention to what happens close to two vertices of the arrangement. Now we can resolve them in this way, or these are two typical ways to resolve, to find the small deformation. To find the small deformation. And in the first case, one can show, we have a little lemma about this saying that for the first resolution, we'll be getting at least five vertices on the resolved red curve. One here, we have a maximum here, maximum here, maximum here. And finally, we'll be getting a minimum of the curvature somewhere here in between. Somewhere here in between, and for the second resolutions, we can guarantee four maxima: one here, one here, one here, one here, but we cannot say anything because to the existence of this inflection point in between, we can only guarantee the existence of four vertices for a sufficiently small deformation of this fragment consisting of shown by a blue curve here and there. Let's see, I had the lemma somewhere. Now let's see. Okay, sorry. Okay. Now to get our bound, which is d times to d minus 3, we do the following. We start with a generic configuration of lines and say, let this configuration of lines. This configuration of lines be given by polynomial p, which is the product of linear linear factors describing each line. And let's consider p equals to epsilon, where epsilon is a small positive number. And in this way, we'll get the resolution where inflection points will not appear. The second part will not appear. So. So close to each edge of our configuration, we'll be getting five inflection points. Yes, we'll be getting, I'm sorry, five vertices as shown on this picture here. One, two, three, four, five. And if you count exactly what happens for such resolution of a generic arrangement, so we'll be getting this number. So, we'll be getting this number d times 2d minus 3. Again, this is a very straightforward and naive method. So, apparently, one can do better. It's a little bit surprising that we are kind of getting exactly one-third of the complex answer. I don't know whether it's related to Klein's original theorem about the number of inflections or not, because Klein's original theorem. Because Klein's original theorem also requires smoothness and so on and so on. So, there are some mysterious details which we do not quite understand at the moment. Okay, so let's see. Yeah, maybe let me tell you at least the result of what happens in the case of diameters and then show you a number of pictures of evolutes. Okay, for diameters, Okay, for diameters, so I'll show you the bound we were able to obtain in a little while, but how this bound is obtained is through the following lemma. Again, we'll be deforming a generic arrangement of real lines with some additional condition that no lines are perpendicular. So that we'll throw in this is what is. In this is what is we meant by strongly generic arrangement. Now, if we resolve it a little bit, so then one can observe that first of all, close to its vertex of a to each vertex of an arrangement, we'll get one small diameter between the two branches. So it's like you know, you take xy equals to zero, then you resolve it a little bit, and then you'll have a very short chord where the pairwise distance between y. The pairwise distance between one branch of the hyperbola and the other branch of the hyperbola is minimized. You'll get a small diameter like this. Now, there will be diameters coming from two other circumstances. One circumstance is like this. Say, assume that you have an altitude. Altitude is a kind of, is a straight segment which connects the vertex of your arrangement and perpendicular to. And perpendicular to some other line to the third line in your arrangement. Now, if you choose a proper deformation, if you choose, sorry, a proper resolution of this normal crossing, of this node, like shown on this picture, by red curves, so then close to your original altitude, you'll be getting two diameters, as shown by black lines here. Black lines here. So, this is the second phenomenon, and finally, we have the third phenomenon. So, the third phenomenon comes from two pairs of lines. If you have one pair of lines in your arrangement and another pair of lines of your arrangement, which satisfy a certain property and then you resolve them in proper way, which is in our paper called that these vertices have each other in sight, they see each other, so to say. They see each other, so to say, and you resolve them properly, then you will get a four-tuple of diameters. Here, by these black lines, you see four diameters. There is a one diameter in between each branch here and each branch here. So, we have four pairs of branches, one coming from here and another from there, and we'll get four diameters. So, and if you count what happens properly for sufficiently generic Properly for sufficiently generic arrangements, blah blah blah. You will be getting the following lower bound for the maximal number of diameters. It's again, it's apparently not optimal because already in the first non-trivial case, which we when we just have three lines, we can find an example which does better. In particular, here for these three. Here for these three lines given by in blue here, we can find the deformation, small resolution which creates 21 diameters. That's maybe a little bit too small to see, but yeah, if somebody is interested, I can provide the details. So we'll get we'll have three diameters, three short diameters, when we'll get two diameters for each altitude. For each altitude, for each height of the original triangle, another six. So we'll get three plus six nine. And then we'll be getting about 12, I guess. Yes, 12. For each pairs of vertices of the original triangle, we'll be getting four additional diameters, which makes it 9 plus 12 totally 21. And this bound gives a smaller number for t equals 3. So again, apparently. So again, apparently the bound which we obtain has the same magnitude, it has the same degree of the leading term as the complex bound. So it's apparently not so bad, but we are not at all sure about the, for example, about the constant of the leading coefficient here. Okay, so yeah, so we have a similar result for the last case, and let me just finish by. Case and let me just finish by showing you some pictures. So, for example, this is how the evolute of the Vestras cubic looks like. This is a cubic, you know, y squared equals a cubic polynomial in x, shown in blue here with a small oval and this branch. So this is its evolute. It goes to infinity all the way like this. So this is a nodal cubic and shown in the chart where it Shown in the chart where it hits infinity in three real points. And its evolute is a fairly interesting thing. So you see a large number of cusps and large number of nodes and so on and so on. So it's quite a rich geometry. So this is a non-singular cubic, not in the Weierstrass form, but hitting infinity in three distinct real points. So its evolute is quite involved. Quite involved. It has nine cusps and a whole bunch of nodes. I don't quite remember at the moment, but you see many, many, many, many nodes here. And these are some nice examples of real rational curves. Real rational curves also provide a very rich geometry. And with this, yeah, I am done. And thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention. So, thank you very much for your very nice talk with nice pictures showing that also classical geometry comes still with a lot of challenges. Whenever there are questions, feel free to either write in the chat or immediately unmute yourself and ask a question. Let me start by mentioning that during the talk, there was a comment by Frederik Bihan, who mentioned that a paper by That a paper by Ervan Brugale on inflection points apparently should be useful. Whatever. Maybe he can also, if this is useful, also give some more explanations about this, but only if he likes. Yeah, yeah. I think I've seen it. Yeah, but I'll probably need to take another look. Yeah. I'm not sure, in fact, I'm just okay. Just give the reference and you see. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think Lucy has got. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think Lucia is going to talk about this on Friday. Oh, oh, yes. She's not here now because she's also in charge of the Congress, annual Congress of the Mexican Mathematical Society, but she will be here and talk about this related subject on Friday. Very good. Thank you. Nice. So are there further questions, remarks? So otherwise, let me start with one. Let me start with one because you were mentioning techniques, you were mentioning that patchworking plays an important role with respect to your bounds and constructions. Yeah, so we are kind of thinking. I'm sorry to interrupt you. So, I mean, so it looks very similar in spirit. It would be very nice to develop, for example, what well, it seems since we're deforming the configuration of lines, but lines, configuration of lines. But lines, configuration of lines do not have evaluation in rigorous mathematical way. So one has to, first of all, to define this limiting object, what is an evolute of a configuration of lines, for example, and then try to see. So it's more like a dream. It feels Dream. It feels very closely related to tropical geometry and Rose patch working, but not that we know of very rigorous connections. So there's some objects which need to be defined first. Okay. So that was my first part of the question, indeed. The second part related to this in particular, because I know your co-author, Cordian Rina, quite well. I was wondering if symmetry also plays a lot of roles in checking whether your bounds are. Checking whether your bounds are tight and so on, because he's usually very interested in symmetry. So, in How Fab play is symmetry an important role in your symmetry is a nightmare here because, you know, everything collapses, you know, instead of seeing three diameters, you see one, but it's with some multiplicity, you have to define it, and so on, and so on. Symmetry is like a plague, I would say. Okay, okay, interesting. Interesting. Okay, further questions? Yeah, if I may. So, yeah, so first thing about your comment about Viro's patchworking, so I don't know whether you investigated this, but I mean, did you look at Maslov de quantization from like classical curves to patchwork curves, kind of? I mean, there is a geometric deformation process, right, to end up with something like Vero's patchworking. With something like VOS patchworking, and now I whom should I ask about this? We can chat later, I can give you a few references. Yeah, this would be very nice, yes. And then I have another question which maybe is naive. Tell me if it is. But I mean, if you look at the evolute of a curve and you take the smooth part, you can define the evolute of this, right? So, what happens if you? So, what happens if you play this game? Does anybody know? So, what do you mean? You remove singularities and so you have to just look at the smooth part, right? I mean, to define the evolute, right? Yeah, and then you take the algebraic closure, yes. Yes, and if you if you do this, so so the evolute of the evolute, aha, the evolute of the evolute. Aha, the evolute of the evolute. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So the iteration of the process of evolute has been studied a little bit. So there is a very nice, fairly recent paper by Fux, Tabachnikov, and somebody else. But they looked at this more from the dynamical point of view. You know, you get kind of funny pentagram-looking diagrams and so on. But I On, but I don't think I can definitely send it to you. I haven't found immediate relevance of that to what we were doing, but people have studied iterations of evolutes, of course. Yes, but from a different perspective, it's more like in more like dynamical systems. But you can take there are some curves we have examples of cycloads, hypocycloads or other cycloids. Or other cyclodes whose evolutes are also curved of the same type. So, for example, same type of curve. So, if you, for example, take what's called a ranunculoid and you take its evolute, it's again a smaller ranunculoid. And if you do this over and over again, you get the beautiful flower out of it. I mean, it's really, it has all these leaves and you can do evolutes, evolutes, evolutes, and you get a very nice. Evolutes and you get a very nice picture, but you never get back to the same curve. But I mean, it's but these are very special curves. So as I mentioned in the very beginning, cichloid, the evolute of cycloid being cycloid was Huggins marvelous discovery.
