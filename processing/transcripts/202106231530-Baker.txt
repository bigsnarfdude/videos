It's lovely to be back here in Oaxaca. I think it was last year in 2017. So glad to see some of you familiar faces again. So I'm going to quickly, well, quickly, 25 minutes, tell you about some recent work that's mostly with Mark Cagle and Duncan McCoy. It's actually kind of bifurcated at some point. It at some point, I'm, you know, I'll just kind of give a revisionist history of the whole thing. So, um, I think the right way to do is go ahead and start off with a little bit of motivation for everything. And so, this actually maybe here's a good spot to kind of start the story. Um, so I guess I said 2020, that's when it, I guess, it got published. This is more like 2016 or so when. 2016 or so, when the work was done. But with John Lucke, we proved the existence of asymmetric L-space knots in S3. And this was done more specifically by showing that there are these hyperbolic knots in S3 with asymmetric complements that admit a non-trivial. That admits a non-trivial surgery to the double-branched cover of a non-split alternating link. I guess we can throw out the word non-split because otherwise you've got to be the unknown. But anyway, here's like, I think basically the simplest example that we were able to write down from that paper. And so we've got this not K that's a closure of a 12 stray end positive braid with braid word of length 240. Of length 249. So I think that means it's like a genus 119 or something. It's positive braids, so it's fibered and all that. And then we're able to show that actually has a Dane surgery. The, where'd I put it? There, the 272 surgery on this guy gave you the double branched cover of this particular not J or J star. I guess it's a link. L12A955. So, this talk is not about how we did that. Okay, this is just the starting spot. Now, I'm happy to tell you a little bit more about that, but the point is we were able to create a whole slew of asymmetric hyperbolic knots with surgeries to the double-branched cover of an alternating link. So, when we say words like an alternating surgery, I mean things like I mean, things like it goes to the double-branched cover of an alternating link, right? So that's just saying the BC. So, and what does this have to do with L-space knots? Well, again, I actually don't really want to say too much about Hagar fluorhommology or anything there. So an L-space knot is a knot that has a non-trivial surgery to an L-space. Nice circular definition almost. But as a Definition almost, but as a prime example of L spaces, you know, these three manifolds that are L spaces, double branch covers of non-split alternating links are L spaces, or examples of L spaces. There's plenty of other L spaces that are not. Part of my interest in it is that, of course, length spaces are double branch covers of alternating knots and links, namely two bridge knots and links. So this kind of ties in with anything you This kind of ties in with anything you might be interested in if you're looking into surgery stuff on spaces. So if you know about me and my work history, that's maybe one avenue that brought me into all this business. Well, anyway, for your information, J is not the two-bridge knot, but so no counterexample to the Berbie conjecture there. One thing that happened, though, of course, in the process of trying to get this paper published is Trying to get this paper published, is there was this remark which either came from a referee or the editor that surely there has got to be a simpler example of an asymmetric L-space norm. Okay, this seems kind of complicated. There's got to be something simpler. There's got to be an easier way to get to it. I'm not really sure if this is an accurate portrayal of it, but then at some point, Dunfield comes back and says, Well, in fact, I have surveyed the Snappy census and found all the NOT complements. found all the knot complements, you know, the complements of knots in S3, and I've also found all the ones that have that are L-space knots. And so, and it turns out that among all of the knots in the snappy census, there are nine asymmetric ones that are L-space knots. So it turns out that there are, just by Dunfield's magical shenanigans, he was able to show that there are nine asymmetric L-space knots in the snappy census. Well, we're like, okay. Well, we're like, okay, you know, but you know, do they have alternating surgeries? Okay, because really, you know, the real trick here is that we were getting alternating surgeries. And that's, and honestly, I don't know how we would have proven these things were L-space knots otherwise. Okay, so it was really like somehow there's something interesting about having an alternating surgery. So this story somewhat, in some sense, really begins in trying to say, well, do these nine, do any of Do any of these nine asymmetric L-space knots in the SNAPI census have an alternating surgery? Well, Mark Cable and I, you know, after doing some other work, which I'll bring up later, we had kind of started pushing down this road, trying to figure out ways of doing that. And we started getting answers to it and addressing it. And then we started realizing, well, maybe we should just. We started realizing, well, maybe we should just try to do this for all knots in the snappy census. And then we were like, you know, so here's somebody else who knows alternating surgeries better than we do, and that would be Duncan Coy. So we roped him in, and that completely like revamped the whole procedure that we went towards addressing this. So what I want to start off doing is talking about alternating surgeries or not, just in general. So this is some background. I'm not going to go into it too much, but I just wanted to kind of give some. Go into it too much, but I just wanted to kind of give some key pieces of information that will get used. I'm just going to throw these words around. Let's not worry about it too much. So, for starters, if I have a surgery on a knot to a double-branch cover of an alternating link, then in fact, Anjvath and Zabo tell us that, in fact, that three-manifold is the boundary of a, it's called a sharp four-manifold. Don't worry about it. But what's interesting about that is that the But what's interesting about that is that the intersection form of that four-manifold is isomorphic to the Gertz form of that alternating link, or the alternating diagram of that alternating link. And so there's some interesting kind of crossover between seeing that information there. And then Julian Gibbons, and further developed with by Duncan McCoy, showed that, in fact, we could take some of Josh Green's change makers. We could take some of Josh Green's change maker theory and really get some information out of all this. So, that in fact, this intersection form has an embedding as a change maker lattice. You can talk about integers changemaker lattices or rational change maker lattices just associated to the slope of the surgery. And these lattices, so a change maker lattice is a lattice with a change maker embedding. And a change maker embedding of a lattice has some stable coefficients associated to your change. Coefficients associated to your change maker vectors. And in fact, these stable coefficients are basically able to be read off of the Alexander polynomial of your knot. And if you have an Alexander polynomial, the knot, you can either, if you can create stable coefficients, then you create a unique set of stable coefficients. Sometimes you can't, for instance, if it's not like an all-space knot. And then furthermore, if it's got to have this alternating surgery, this changemaker lattice also has something called an obtuse super base. An obtus superbase from which we can come back and create the Geritz form. And actually, from that Guritz form, then you can come back and create an alternating diagram for that J, for that alternating link J. All right. So there's a whole circle of little ideas here. All that work is not me. I mean, like, you know, the heavy lifting here definitely, in my view, here's all the stuff that Duncan was doing. So, with all that as a background. With all that as background, I want to just kind of talk about a strategy for just in general. Given a knot and S3, what are the alternating surgeries on that knot? Okay, so here's a strategy for coming up with that. So what, you're going to start off with a knot K and S3, and then you can ask, are there stable coefficients of a change maker or lattice compatible with your Alexander polynomial? Either you can construct these stable coefficients or you cannot. You can't, you don't have an alternating circuit. Can't, you don't have an alternating surgery. Once you have these stable coefficients, you get something called the alternating interval, which is this interval between from between these integers n minus one and n plus one that is determined by the stable coefficients. And then it also gives you these particular change maker lattices for each of those three integer guys. Frankly, you get all the rational change maker lattices in that interval too, but. In that interval, too, but we don't really need to worry about that. So, once you construct those, after you've seen that you have state-compatible state coefficients, you can ask: well, do any of these lattices contain, like admit, an OP2 superbase? Well, you can, this is an algorithm thing you can start to figure out. And if it doesn't, well, then you don't have an alternating surgery. If it does, well, then you're going to create Garrett's matrix for that lattice, and therefore you can get an And therefore, you can get an alternating branch locus, like some alternating link who has that Gertz form. And the point is, then, if you had integer surgery, maybe the corresponding integer surgery to that double branch cover of the alternating link, then it would have to be double branch cover of this alternating link. Anyway, so because we have three integers in this alternating link. Three integers in this alternating interval and these three change vector lattices, we can have up to three super bases. And you know, this kind of is where we get why I'm calling it a strategy rather than an algorithm. If you have all three of these guys, the expectation, so let's maybe call it conjecture. I don't know if I really want to say that yet, but is that your Alexander polynomial agrees with the Alexander polynomial of a certain kind of cable knot? Certain kind of cable knot. And then you know that any alternating surgery on your knot would have to be equivalent to the alternating surgery on that cable knot. All right. And so that gives you a way of checking. So then you just go through and just check all of the integer, all of the integral surgeries. I guess only listed two of them. I should have listed three, but you just use computer programs like Snappy and Regina to just. Computer programs like Snappy and Regina to just say, for those integral guys, am I getting an alternating surgery? Because I know what I should get. And for the non-integral surgeries, well, since it should be something corresponding to something rational, rational surgery on a cable, then I can just check to see if I'm getting any exceptional surgeries on my knob. If you have just two, they're going to be a consecutive integer. There are going to be consecutive integers. You just again have to check. And if you have to worry about the non-integral, it's kind of ad hoc. I don't know what to say there in general. I think more can be said, but let's not worry about that. And then if you have just one thing, if just one of those changemaker lattices emits an OP2 superbase, then you have this one candidate for an alternating surgery, and it's only that integer guy. And so you can check either do or don't. Okay. So, what I want to do then now is say, well, let's just take that strategy, ready to go, and let's just apply it now to the knots in the snappy census. Okay, so I'm just going to apply that strategy to the knots in the snappy census, which is basically what I do. And in fact, of course, the snappy census, as determined by Dunfield, has 1,267 knots in it. And actually, using Dunfield's stuff, we can actually pass farther and say, So, if we can actually pass farther and say, well, we know it's got to be an L-space knot, so we can whittle it down already to the L-space knots in the snappy census. That ends up giving us 632 knots. Two of them in Dunfield's time were undecided, and we showed that they actually had to be L-space knots by demonstrating quasi-alternating surgeries. But of these guys, nine of them are asymmetric, and all the rest. And all the rest are strongly invertible with tunnel number at most two. And some of these do have tunnel number two, the strongly invertible ones. So let me just give you the output of that. We're going to push through this kind of like machine that we had. And when we're done, we end up getting 397 knots that are all strongly invertible that have compatible stable coefficients and OP2 super bases for at least one. For at least one of these lattices. And from that, we get Gareth matrices, and we can say something about branch loci. Well, from that, one thing that's interesting is that out of all that calculation, we can already tell that branch loci have to have crossing number at most 13. And so the branch loci for any of these L-space synthesis knots, if you have an integral surgery to a To a alternating double branch cover of an alternating guy, it's got to be the double branch cover of a link with at most 13 crossings. So that actually makes it to where we can just kind of enumerate, just take the covers of all of them and just check, which is effectively what we do to get our alternating surgeries. So we can ask how many of these three integer changemaker lattices for each of our knots. For each of our knots, how many of those three actually have up to super bases? For four of them, we found three, and that was because it ended up being because those knots had Alexander polynomials that agreed with torus knots. But we can just rule out that these actually had any alternating surgery because their exceptional surgeries were only graph manifolds and not lens bases or cyclic fibered. So we can rule out those four guys. Could rule out those four guys. Then we saw that when we had two of them, there were 381 knots that had just two. And in fact, in each of those cases, both of the candidate integral alternating surgeries were indeed integral alternating surgeries. And then furthermore, we could check the half integral surgery and see that that was, you know, between those two integers, and that was a integral one. And we saw that actually this corresponded to. This corresponded to the dealternation crossing of an almost alternating unknot diagram, right? So, what is that? What is that? Well, here's a picture of an unknot, believe it or not. So, this is a picture of an unknot, and it's almost alternating in that there is a single crossing, which I've highlighted that where it fails to be alternating. And then, if you think of like an arc for that crossing, well, if you take the double branch cover of the unknot, you get S3. Well, that arc is going to lift. 3, well, that arc is going to lift to a knot, right? And so this gives us a knot in the MNES3. Turns out these knots are these that we obtain this way, or all of these 381 knots that we found. And when you do rational tangle replacements on that crossing, you can get a variety of different alternating surgeries by just putting in the correct alternating rational tangle. Alternating rational tangle. And the two integer surgeries that we're getting correspond to the two smoothings. And so we're getting these two smoothings are giving us the two integer ones. And then between and the kind of like the interval of slopes between those two integer smoothings, which correspond to integer surgeries, we're getting all of the rational surgeries. So in fact, what's happening is that every slope in this kind of interval from n to n plus one, or maybe it was n minus one to n, every slope. n minus one to n, every single one of those rational slopes is an alternating surgery slope. And we can just see it coming from this dealternation crossing. And then lastly, we have 12 remaining knots where there is this unique candidate. And it turns out that they all work out to give us the integral surgeries. And furthermore, we were able to identify these as what I call the dealternation energy. So here's the same unknot, but instead of Same unknot, but instead of doing a crossing, I'm kind of going along like this, you know, this edge here, right? So I'm going from here to here, and I'm just kind of doing a banding kind of following that edge. In fact, you can see that kind of given an alternating diagram, an almost alternating diagram of an unbotted, there's kind of maybe these four different guys you can choose. Anyway, this is one of them. And banding along that gave us a particular alternating link. And that, you know, we can see, in fact, That you know, we can see, in fact, each of these 12 knots we had such a big surgery. So we can actually classify all of those final and confirm them. So, what this has done is it's shown us that we've been able to determine all of the alternating surgeries on all of these snappy census mods. Just as a remark, all of the alternate ones with alternating surgeries actually are actually have tunnel number one, right? So, in particular, Right, so in particular, none of the we answered to get the question: none of the asymmetric guys have an alternating surgery. Um, one other curious thing, though, is that we went ahead and ran this algorithm on some of our alternate our asymmetric knots, and we found another alternating surgery. Like, what? I don't know where that is, but like, for instance, on that same knot I showed you at the beginning, 271 surgery on that gave a double branch cover of an alternating knot. Double branch cover of an alternating knot. I don't know why, but it did. And that happened for all of the examples that we checked, which is about like 10 examples or something. But for some reason, I don't know. I haven't explained it yet. So do they all? I don't know. Okay, so that's interesting. I found that really surprising. I did not expect there to be a second integral alternating surgery. And in fact, we can show that there's no other alternating surgeries. All right, so now the other interesting thing that came out. So, now the other interesting thing that came out of this braid positivity, I've got like six minutes, maybe. So, there was a conjecture that any hyperbolic L-space knot or its mirror is the closure of a positive braid, something we call a braid positive knot. In fact, this statement was first written down in a problem session when I was last here in Oaxaca in 2017. Okay, that's where I guess that conjecture was recorded. I should have checked to see if I'm one that actually made the conjecture. I don't know. If I'm one that actually made the conjecture, I don't know. As an interesting remark for why we need to include hyperbolic, is that it's been well known that the 2,3 cable of the 2,3 torus knot shown here is an L-space knot, but it's not very positive. Okay, so you do need that word hyperbolic. Yeah. And we know what happens for torus knots. So, you know, this example here is a cable. So, some of this work began in this work with, like, I didn't even count how many people are here, but there was a workshop where I led a group where Mark and I started working on things together among all the rest, where we showed that, in fact, all of the Snappy census L-space knots with ton of number, at least two, so all the asymmetric ones and all that, those are actually brain positive. We found surgery diagrams for them to get actually, then we could change that into diagrams. Then we could change that into diagrams of the knots, and then we could actually find braids, then we could finagle the braids to make them braid positive. So we found all those to be braid positive. Really, all this work was doing using the kind of the kitchen sink that Dunfield provides for Snappy and all these other Regina and all these other kind of programs together. So that was kind of a major tool on this. So, well, I mentioned this in a talk this morning. At in a talk this morning, or whenever that was, then, in fact, we have Mark and I, and I really should say it largely was all Mark doing the heavy lifting on this, but we ended up obtaining surgery diagrams for all of the snappy census knots. And these from these census surgery diagrams, then that was allowed us. We were able to finagle that into diagrams. And then, once we get diagrams, you can get grades. Okay, so all census knots, Pell Space and Monel space. So, we could actually get those. And it's once you get. We could actually get those, and it's once you get them, it's easy to check. You just input the purported braid word and check is the braid closure isomorphic to the specific knot. So we can actually confirm that we actually did get the right things, at least to what a precision, I don't know. But well, okay, then we try to do the same thing. I mean, Finago at all. And so, what do we get here? I mean, so we get that all snappy census pulse-based knots are grade positive. Oh, except for one. Except for one, you know, and you know, we were able to find this particular one, and we know it's not rate positive because it fails Ito's Homphly positivity check, which is pretty much similar to the Frank Williams Homphley positivity check. But anyway, it tells us it's not very positive. So that's a counterexample. That's the first known counterexample. So that was a nice. So that was a nice surprising thing. So we found the first non-grade positive hyperbolic L-space norm. And it was in the SNPI census. And it's the only one in these current SNAPI census that does this. You might look and try to generalize this. So we did. We tried. These are all L-space knots. We can tell that they all have surgeries to a cipher. Surgeries to a ciphered fibrid L space. But we have a hard time telling that they're great positive. They, for n bigger than one, these all pass Ito's Homphly positivity check. And they seem to pass other kind of positivity checks you might want to do. So big question is: are these grade positive? Do we actually have an infinite family of an infinite family of grade positive hyperbolic sorry do we have an infinite family of non-grade positive hyperbolic L space knots I think so but I don't know I would guess that these are these I would guess that these fail to be grade positive anyway um I think that is my time all right thank you very much Ken any questions Well, I would like to acknowledge very much all the work that Duncan McCoy and Mark Kagel have done. They have been like machines and doing a lot of the programming and whatever. And I feel like I've been just kind of helping kind of guide them around. But they've done really excellent work on all this. And so can't speak highly enough of them. Well, if there are no questions, let's think in again and get ready for the next talk in a couple of minutes. Thanks, guys. I think that I'm the next doc. You're the next.
