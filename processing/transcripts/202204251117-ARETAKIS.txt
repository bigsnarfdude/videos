To follow the theme of Rita and Lars and talk about the dynamics of black holes. I will be interested in understanding the evolution of hyperbolic equations on such backgrounds, but moreover, I will also be interested in trying to understand if we can extract any kind of information from these dynamics. These dynamics. In particular, as we'll see, we'll try to see if we can find observation signatures for sema black holes. So, as I said, we are considering exactly the same problem, which is that of the wave equation on black hole backgrounds. This is the black hole region. This is the exterior of the black hole. This is the event horizon. And here is null infinity. Null infinity. This is not the formal penos diagram that my sister Rita showed to us, but it's an informal diagram just to that introduces one more angular coordinate. Okay, so we will be considering, as I said, the super basic wave equation, okay, linear homogeneous colour wave equation, and on-rise and northern or current backgrounds. More careful grounds. That's our problem. We will be prescribing initial data on a Caucasian hypersurface, and the main goal will be to understand the solution in the future. So up to here, it's exactly what also we heard in the previous talks. Now, what I will, as I said, we will on top of understanding the behavior in the future, I will also be interested in understanding if there are. Understanding if there are any distinguishing features of the solution to the wavy question in the future. So, what do I mean by that? Suppose you know your solution at infinity, for example, at null infinity. Suppose you know that. Is it possible, but you don't know, and you know that the space-time you are working at is a horizon. Is Horizon Australum spacetime? But you don't know whether the space-time is extremal or not. So we know that we have a solution to the wave equation in the Rise-Nords from spacetime. Or care, but okay, for simplicity, let's assume it's Rise-Nordstrom. And you know what its radiation field looks like or what it is on L infinity. And the question is: can you under, can you, just from knowing the radiation field, can you? Field, can you understand whether you are on extremal risen Austral or on a sub-extremal Rhizon Nordstrom? So we will want to know if there is a way to distinguish extremality by knowing the dynamics of the wave equation on null infinity. Okay, and that's exactly what I basically mean here by observational signatures at nal infinity. And signatures at null infinity, and that's the topic of today's talk. But by radiation, you mean just a scalar field, right? A real scalar field, is that right? Sorry, I'm talking about the radiation field. So by that, I mean whatever you get from the wave equation on L infinity. So if C is the solution to the wavy question, then R times C, where R is an appropriate rate. R is an appropriate radius function. R times C has a finite trace of null infinity. C is zero null infinity, so it's meaningless to talk about C itself, but it's non-meaningless to talk about the trace of C or null infinity, the weight trace, which is R times C, which is the radiation field. That's what I mean by radiation field. Okay, and yeah, the reason we consider And yeah, the reason we're considering the wave equation is because it's a simple model problem for the actual nonlinear system. Okay, because eventually one would like to understand these kinds of questions and these kind of properties for the actual Einstein questions. Now, before I show you the next slide, let's try to think a little bit more what we are doing here. We have an extremal black hole or Extremal black hole or a sub-extremal black hole, and we have its exterior, and we want to understand if there is a property of the dynamics of its color perturbations that reveals whether your space-time or whether your black hole was extremal or sub-extremal. Of course, having an extremal or sub-extremal black hole is a global property. Like if you cannot have an extremal resonance black hole here, but being sub-extremal in the exterior, so it's a Extremely exterior, right? So it's a global property. But what we would ideally want to do is we would ideally want to measure properties, to observe and measure properties of the extremal horizon, say, if your black hole is extremal, from null infinity. So we are trying to do something super tricky here. We are trying to see if we can measure properties. Your properties from the horizon at n infinity. That would seem, in the way I'm stating it right now, that would seem that it would violate the domain of dependence property because nothing from the black hole or even the event for Ison can escape to the exterior, let alone null infinity. But okay, this has almost, this is correct, what I said, like we cannot violate the domain of dependence property. But what we can do is we can But what we can do is we can think about it asymptotically. If we come asymptotic, like infinitesimally close to the event horizon, then this information can indeed be propagated to null infinity. And the only price we'll have to pay is that we will have to know the radiation field at very late times, along null infinity. Okay, we come very close to the horizon. Piece of information can now be read at very... Be read at very late times at null infinity. So, why did I say that? Because that's what we need to do. We need to study the asymptotics for this problem. Okay, we need to study the asymptotics along the horizon, along constant radius hypersurfaces, and along null infinity. And it's these asymptotics, like it's the late time behavior and specifically precise asymptotics during those very late times that will probably. Delay times that will probably reveal whether your space-time is extremal or not. Okay? Because it's this late asymptotics that can see something about the horizon. Okay, so actually the goal of this lecture is to derive or present, of this talk, sorry, is to present asymptotics of this form for the wavy question. We will do this for the general solutions to the wavy question, but we will also consider But we will also consider specific angular frequencies. Now, and other goal of today's talk is to also show you that this type of asymptotics, like late-time asymptotics for solutions to the wave equation, are intimately connected to conservation laws. Okay, and that connection is true for both the Connection is true for both the extremal and sub-extremal black holes. Now, another benefit of deriving precise asymptotics, which means you know the exact rate here, P, plus you also have an explicit expression for the coefficient here, Q. Another benefit of that is that you know precise rates, which means that you can derive upper bounds, which are useful for stability considerations, but also you can derive lower bounds. But also, you can derive lower bounds, which are useful for the formation of singularities. Now, our methods are based on physical space techniques. And we will consider first var-seal, then sub-extremalizon, then the extremal resonostrum, okay, in which case we will present that observation signature. And then we will also consider the Kerr family. Now, as I said, the main goal is to understand asymptotics and then also to understand that the asymptotics are a consequence of conservation laws. Now, the simplest way to see that there is a connection between conservation laws and asymptotics of the wave equation is to look at what happens in Mikovsky. So, this is by far the most elementary. So, this is by far the most elementary slide that I have, and probably the one that I will spend more time explaining. Okay, so the wave equation on Mikovsky looks like that. This is the wave equation Mikovsky for a fixed angular frequency L. The dv derivative is the outgoing derivative, and the du derivative is the incoming derivative. And again, we don't have any angular derivatives here because I have projected in the angular mode. Angular mode. Now, this is the wavy question. What does it say to us? It says to us that the partial derivative of this expression is zero. So this expression here is conserved in the u direction. That's what the wave equation tells us. So the wave equation by itself on Mikovsky is a conservation law, okay, in the incoming direction. Now, that conservation law. Now, that conservation law immediately, for example, gives us the precise late-time asymptotics in the Minkowski case. In which case, you know, if we have compact support, then of course there are no compact, as we all know, right? If the initial data are compactly supported, then there are no asymptotics in view of the strong-Hogging principle. And this conservation law can immediately be used to prove strong-Huggins principle in the following way. In the following way. So let's assume here is our initial hypersurface. This is the non-trivial part of the initial data, and this is the trivial part of the initial data. We have an incoming conservation law, which means that everything here is initial zero. This expression here is zero as well. And it will always be zero in the incoming direction. Okay, so this conservation law basically allows us to cross this wave zone. To cross this wave zone very safely while keeping this expression here equal to zero. Okay, so we cross this wave zone using this conservation law. We come in this region and we have that this expression here is also zero on this triangle. And now this expression in this triangle is simply an outgoing derivative. So in this triangle, we have that an outgoing derivative is zero. Outgoing derivative is zero. So, if we integrate in this direction, like that, we will get that C itself is zero here, okay, because it has to R C, it has to be zero here because R, the radius is zero here. The outgoing derivative is zero here because of the conservation law that allowed us to cross here this region. So, by integrating this expression in this direction, we get that RPC. Direction, we get that RPC0 here. So, this conservation law allowed us to very simply cross this region where things are non-trivial until we get in a region where you can integrate and get everything you want. So, surprisingly, it turns out that modulo some extra difficulties and estimates and things like that, something quite similar can be used for black holes. Use for black holes. Okay, same idea. Okay, you have a conservation law in this direction, you use it to pass a dangerous region, and then at late times things look better. And by integrating in other direction, you can get more precise estimates. You won't get that things are trivial, but at least you will get non-trivial precise estimates. Okay. All right. So the purpose of that slide was just to show you the connection between conservation. Show you the connection between conservation loss and asymptotics. As I said, in the black hole case, we have more difficulties. So one of them is the redshift effect, which is illustrated in this picture here. Signals are redshifted along the horizon. We have, of course, positivity of the mass. And we also have the trapping effect that again Rita and Lars briefly mentioned. And Lars briefly mentioned. All right. And the existence of the photosphere. So these are, of course, difficulties that one needs to understand before trying to attack the asymptotics problem for the wave question. As we heard in the previous talks, there is a huge literature in the direction of trying to understand the evolution equations on black holes. As Rita also mentioned, probably one of the most important ones is the result by Mikhailis Yakov and Igor that shows that general solutions to the sub-extremal care backgrounds decay. And when we say decay, we mean that the C itself decays, the radiation field decays, all derivatives decay along the Veno horizon, away from the Veno horizon, along nano infinity. The perforizor long nan infinity, full decay results. Okay, so for the sub-extremal case, at least we have decay, and a similar result, of course, holds for sub-extremal resonostrum, not just for sub-extremal care. Now, here is the first asymptotics result that I would like to present for today, which is for Schwarzschild. The top-order term in the time expansion of C. Expansion of C along the band horizon or along the constant radius hypersurface or of the radiation field along null infinity is given by these three expressions. We see that c itself decays like t to the minus three along the given horizon or even away from the given horizon. And the precise coefficient is given by this expression I zero one that we'll explain in a second what it is. For now it's important to know that this expression is generically non-zero. This expression is generically non-zero. Now, for the radiation field, we have slower decay. Okay, this is again the sharp decay rate. In other words, C is equal to this term plus something that decays faster. So for the radiation field, we have t to the minus 2 decay rate. And surprisingly, the coefficient here of that top-order term is exactly the same modulo factor as in the event horizon case. Even horizon case and the constant radius hypersurface case. So, these asymptotics in particular immediately show us that there is a strong correlation of the radiation field along null infinity and of the scalar field along the even horizon, right? Because the coefficients here are basically the same. We have different decay rates, but if you exclude the decay rates, the coefficients here are the same. This work recovers semi-analytical work of Lever that also Rita mentioned, and these asymptotics were independently also obtained by Peter Hinch using different methods. Okay, these are the asymptotics in the extreme, in the Sparta case, all right. All right, now I said that the coefficient of the asymptotics is given by this expression here. This expression can be explicitly computed from the initial data. Okay, so say if your initial data is on a t equals zero hyper surface, then you compute this quantity here and you find the constant that appears in your late-time asymptotics. Moreover, this constant, the same constant asymptotics, can be computed in terms of the radiation field itself. So if you integrate the radiation field along all null infinity, actually along to the future, along null infinity to the future of the initial hypersurface, then that integral gives you I0, one. Okay, and this is somewhat important because it shows to you that if you know the adjacent field itself, which is again in the spirit of what we're trying to do in this talk, if you know the radiation field itself, then you know this integral by integrating. So you know this constant. And if you know this constant, then you can go back and compute the late time asymptotics of the radius. The late IM asymptotics of the radiation field. You can compute the late IM asymptotics of PC along constant radius hypersurfaces, including of C along the event horizon. So if you know the radiation speed at null infinity, then you know the late time asymptotics of C at the event horizon. Okay, and that allows us to conclude that the late time tails are basically dictated by knowing the radiation field at infinity. The radiation field at infinity, in other words, by the weak field dynamics. Okay, this is again still, we are in the Spartel case. Now, I will connect what I presented for the Spartel case with the Mikovsky picture because I promise to you that these asymptotics are related to conservation laws. And indeed, And indeed, that's the case. This constant here that is equal to this in terms of the initial data, or is equal to this in terms of the radiation field, is actually a child of a conservation law. What conservation law? It's something very similar to what we have in Mikovsky, but anyway, it's a conservation law that's called the Newman-Penrose constant. Now, what is it? Along null infinity, which is an incoming hypersurface, the outgoing derivative, appropriately weighted, is conserved. So, again, it's a conservation law in the incoming direction, as was in the Mikovsky case. It's just because now we don't have exactly Mikovsky. I have to go all the way to null infinity in order to see something that's conserved. So, we have a conservation law and long null infinity, and the conserved charge is called. And the conserved child is called the new Mapenos constant. Now, the problem is that if we consider initially, sorry about this. If we consider initially compactly supporting data, that means that there is a whole region here where everything is trivial by the domain of dependence property. So every quantity you can write down here will be zero, and therefore, any conservation along a non-al-infinity will have to. Conservation along a non-al-infinity will have to be the zero conservation law, like the value of the quantity, the conserved charge, has to be equal to zero, because eventually it enters this region here where everything is zero. So for our type of initial data, the conserved charges, the new Mappennel charges, will be zero. So they are not going to give you something non-trivial, like a trivial conservation law, where the conserved charges are. Conservation law, where the conserved charge is zero, is not going to give you a non-trivial type of asymptotics. And indeed, this is not the conservation law we use in order to derive the previous asymptotics that I showed you. Instead, what we need to do is we need to take the scalar field C, remove from it one time derivative, get a solution to the wavy question, which is this thing here, the time integral of C, which is now. Galopsy, which is now not compactly supported, and there, and then get the conservation law, and then consider the conserved charge, the new mappenous charge of that scalar field, which is now generically non-zero. So the new Mapendrous charge of the time integral of C is exactly what appears in the asymptotics. Okay, here. So these asymptotics are indeed follow from a conservation. Follow from a conservation law, but the conservation law goes through the time indeed. Okay. So that basically concludes the first picture of the asymptotics and their relation with conservation laws in the sub-extremal case. Actually, to even have a more complete picture, we can consider specific angular frequencies and therefore derive the precise prices. Derrive, you know, the precise price's law for all angular frequencies with precise expressions on the late time asymptotics. Again, these laws follow from conservation laws that hold for each angular frequency. Related works were also done by Donning Slang Soffer and Hints. I have to mention this. So, just summarize, these are our assignments. So, just summarize, these are our asymptotics in the Spartan case. What happens if we go to the Rise and Nordsum case? So, what happens if we turn on the charge? Spartile, Rise and Nordsome. If you observe, these asymptotics are exactly the same. This is the Rhizon-Nordstrom case. This is the Svartzil case. Okay, so the charge does not seem to affect the asymptotics. The asymptotics here have exactly the same. Are exactly the same form in both sub-eximarisonostrum and spart silk. So the chart here does not explicitly appear. All right. So that's the picture now up to the full sub-extremalized Nordstrom family. But since the child does not appear here, one could think that, you know, okay, you have the same asymptotics from Swartzil to sub-extermal resinosum, then maybe from sub-eximal resinostum to the external resonosum, you still have the same. To the external zerosome, you still have the same thing. But that's not true because now, although the asymptotics do not depend on the charge explicitly, the error terms depend on the charge explicitly and in a big way. And in fact, the error terms blow up as we approach extremality. Indeed, in the extremal Rise and Nordstrom case, in work joined with Jan Sengelopoulos, who is in Caltech, and Ian Geitz. In Caltech and the NGITS, who is in the Netherlands. We showed that for solutions on extreme resonance space-time, we have these asymptotics. Again, we have the event horizon, we have constant radius hypersurfaces, and we have the radiation field. Let's try to see a few differences from what we have already seen. First of all, the decay rate of the scalar field. Rate of the scalar field along the event horizon, the decay rate is only one over t. Okay, whereas previously it was one over t to the three. So we lose two powers of t of tau, which is huge. Okay. Now, if you go away from the horizon, but still stay in a bounded region, the decay rate gets better, but not as good as before. So it's only one over t to the two instead of one over t to the three. Two instead of one over t to the three, which is in the sub-aximal case. So the decay rates are slower. The radiation field has the same decay rate as previously, t to the minus two. All right. Now, what about the coefficients? The coefficient in the case of the asymptotics along the Venn horizon is an expression we call H, which is completely different from this thing. Now, away from the Venn horizon, the coefficients also depend. Also, depend also depends on H, which again is very different from this thing. And at null infinity, the coefficient of the asymptotics involves both that H and the previous Newman-Penns constant of the time integral that we saw before. So the radiation field sees now like all difficulties. It sees something new that appears in the extremal case and it sees what we saw before in the sub-extremal case. We saw before in the sub-eximal case. But in the strong field theory, close development horizon, we only have the appearance of H. So we have slower asymptotics, we have a new constant or an expression in the asymptotics. What is that H? These are asymptotics, right? And I promise to you that every time we see asymptotics, we will see a conservation law. And that is indeed the case. This AIDS camps is a child. Comps is a child of a conservation law. It's not the same child as this one. This also comes from a conservation law. But yeah, this one comes from a conservation law, but a different one. It's a conservation law that only exists in the extremal case. What is it? Let's see what it is. First of all, before I show you the conservation law, I need to tell you its geometric origin, and the geometric origin of the conservation law that gives rise to this H is that it generates. This age is the degeneracy of the redshift effect at the extremal case. Okay, this is the redshift effect in the extremal case. There's no basically redshift, it degenerates. And geometrically, this is related to the vanishing of the surface gravity. And here is our conservation law. Our H is again an integral of the transversal derivative of the scalar field along oversections of the event. Along over sections of the event horizon. Okay. So in this, in the Newman-Pennons conservation law was conserved an incoming conservation law of outgoing derivatives. In this case, along the event horizon, we have a conservation law along the outgoing event horizon of a transversal incoming derivative. So things are flipped. In any case, we have a conservation law. Case we have a conservation law along the event horizon in the extremal case. We will call this the extremal charge of scalar field. And it immediately shows us some interesting things. It shows to us that if we start with a generic, smooth, compactly supported initial data for which initially that quantity here is non-zero, which happens generically, right? Generically, like this integral can be arranged so that it is initially non-zero for generic initial data. Then, of course, we will have that, you know, this expression will stay non-zero because it's conserved along the event horizon. So that immediately tells you that not all things can decay along the event horizon because you have quantities which are initially non-zero and they are conserved. And indeed, we have the first non-decay result, transversal derivatives to the event. Transversal derivatives to the event horizon do not decay along the event horizon. Okay, for generic initial data. This is the first result where we see very different things from what was the case in the sub-extremal case, where again, the result of Mikhail, Sigurd, and Jakob shows that everything of that form goes to zero. Things are even worse if you try to add one or more transversal derivatives and you look at it. Derivative, and you look at it along the event horizon, then that thing is going to grow in time. So you even have a proper instability along the event horizon away from the event horizon. These quantities actually go to zero. So this instability is true on the horizon only. And for this reason, we call it horizon instability. And the conserved charts here that gives rise to this instability is called the To this instability, it's called the horizon here. It's a horizon because, as we said, it's only meaningful at the horizon. And it's a hair precisely because we have something of the scalar field that stays forever in the evolution in the future. Now, this here has physical meaning because it's related to a component of the energy momentum tensor. Component of the energy momentum tensor. All right. And this instability here has been studied and extended by several people. Now, let's go closer to the ultimate goal of today's lecture, which is this observational business of extremal black holes. We saw that in the asymptotic, we saw the asymptotics in the sub-extremal case, what they What they are, and basically what generates them. We show the asymptotics in the extremal case. We commented on the differences between the asymptotics in the sub-extremal and the extremal case. We saw that in the extremal case, the generator of the asymptotics is basically a new conservation law that actually gives rise to horizon instability. Horizon stability. Now let's go back to the initial question, right? Which is: can we actually measure or observe that horizon charge from afar? Can this quantity H be measured from afar? And the answer is yes. And basically, it's yes for the following reason. Super easy to see. It's yes because it appears here. Right? If you know the radiation field, you know it's asymptotics. You know, it's asymptotics. So you know this. This expression is 100% given by the radiation field itself, because it was one of the crucial things I told you here. It's one of the crucial representations of that Newman-Penrose and time integral conservation law. So we know the radiation field, we know the asymptotics, we know this thing again, which means we know also. Which means we know also this thing. So, by knowing the radiation field, we can indeed compute the horizon charge. We can put all these things together to finally conclude the following. If we have a solution C to the wave equation and we know it's adjacent field at null infinity, so we know this, and then we compute that signature, that expression S, which is. Expression S, which is given by this. It's a weighted limit of the radiation field plus an integral of the radiation field along L infinity. If we compute this, then we have the following result. That expression is always zero in the sub-extremal case, and it is generically non-zero in the extremal case. And in which case, like in the extremal case, that the value. Like in the extremal case, that the value of this expression here is given precisely by the conserved charts at the horizon, it's given precisely by H. So we have one expression of the radeson field that allows us to differentiate between extremality and sub-extremality. Okay, if you get that this expression is one, then you should know that you are on an extremal space-time. All right, three conclusions about this thing. About this thing. And not only that, but the value of one, right, is the value of the conserved charge, okay, at the horizon. Extremal black holes admit classical, externally measurable hair. The hair is this H quantity. It's classical because it's classical, and it's externally measurable precisely because it can be computed from null infinity. Then, for this reason, this here could potentially serve as an observation signature for a simple black hole. As an observation signature for Ximo black holes, and that's also something related to what I said in the beginning. One should think of this as you know having information leaking, but classically from the event horizon to null infinity. Okay, and this is possibly precisely because we look at the asymptotics. Now, transient signature, observation signature for near extreme black holes have also been found and under. Been found and understood by numerical work by Burko Guaravkana and Sam Harval. And then maybe I want to end my how many moments I have I want to say that 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Thank you. I would like to end now with a discussion about the care space-times, which also as we Which also, as we saw in written stock, are more interesting, astrophysically relevant, and have a richer structure. So let's go back to the SmartSill case. These are our asymptotics. What are the asymptotics in the care case? Specifically the sub-extemal care case. Well, let's see. These are the ones. Again, work by Yanis and Dejan. Deyan shows that these are the symptotics in the sub-examinal case. If you notice, they are exactly the same as in Schwartzil. So, in the same, like when we turned on the charts, the asymptotics did not change, right? When we pass from Swartzil to Reisen Nordstrom. Exactly the same happens when we pass from Svartzil to Kerr. We might turn on the angular momentum, but the asymptotics will not change. This is true for the full. This is true for the full sub-extremal care family. Again, the same decay rates, right? Same expressions, same conservation laws, time integrals, Newma Penn's constants, etc. So exactly the same picture for the asymptotics in the sub-eximal care family. I have also to say that the asymptotics for the full sub-eximal care case were also derived by were also derived by Peter Hinge again in the different approaches. We have also derived asymptotics not just for the general solution C, but when for the projection of C on angular modes. Now care is not spherically symmetric. Nonetheless, you can still make sense of the nice buoyant requisite spheres and you can make sense of projections of Projections of that C in angular frequencies relative to these spheres. These projections here, these modes, will not be solutions to the wave equation precisely because care is not spherically symmetric, but they will be functions. And one would like to study these functions. These functions will solve a coupled system. They will be coupled. So there are coupled equations that one can study. There are a couple of questions that one can study. They are not solutions to heavy questions, but nonetheless, they are, you know, components of the C itself. So, we'd like to know how these components themselves behave. And here is the answer. For L equal to one, the first angular mode, we have this decay rate, faster decay rate, for both C and its radiation field. And for L equal to two, again, we have here the asymptotics. Now, the comment for that is the following. If you remember, Price's law says the decay rate. Remember, Price's law says the decay rate is expected to be 12 plus 3. For L equal to 2, that would be 2 times 2 plus 3, so it would be 7. So in the Spartan case, that decay rate is 7. But in the Kerr case, that decay rate is 5. So you see that we indeed have the same asymptotics from Svartzin to Kerr, exactly the same, but only for the general solution, C. As soon as you try to project to specific. Try to project to specific angular frequencies, which is not the zero frequency, higher but fixed angular frequencies, then that uniformity breaks down. And the curve case becomes much slower. And the reason these modes are slower, again, has to do with the fact that they are coupled. So a fast mode is now coupled by a small, slow mode. So that's slowing down. So that's slowing down the fast one. And indeed, the L equal to two mode is coupled with the L equals zero mode. And that's why we see explicitly here that coupling here. In the asymptotics of the L equal to two mode, we have the presence of the conservation law here that it is actually affecting the one mode, the zero mode. The radiation field, as always, is the most complicated guy. So it sees the coupling. The coupling of the L equal to 2 and the L equal to 0 mode, plus it sees its own difficulties, like its own conservation laws. Anyway, these are the asymptotics for high wrangular frequencies in care. Another issue is that if you look at the L equal to one mode and you try to look at the asymptotics along the null generators of the event horizon, there you are going to see some oscillations, which is not, which is something. Which is something we have not seen at all so far. We have only seen inverse polynomial functions. For L equal to one, the asymptotics are not inverse polynomial functions anymore, but they have oscillations along the van horizon. Okay, and these are oscillations that were also previously seen in work by Barak and Ori. Now, what about the extremal case? The extremal case is quite complicated for the axiomatic solution. For the axiomatic solutions to the wave equation, we have basically the same results as in the streamal reson. Now, if you fix an azimuthal frequency which is non-zero, then you have actually even stronger instability results that were first found by Graala, Zimmerman, and Casals and the rigorous proof of what's happening in this fixed asymmoval frequency. A fixed as immovable frequency regime will be provided by Dian Geitz in his upcoming work. So, here we have like for the azimuthal frequency, we have exactly the same thing as what we have discussed. For fixed modes, we have fixed non-zero azimuthal frequencies, we have something even worse, like things growing faster. Now, for the high angular frequencies, which is a regime that also Rita discussed, we Alright, we discussed, we don't have a picture yet of what's happening. So that means that if we try to understand, like, we don't know yet how this a general solution to the way the question on extremal care behaves. Okay, we don't even know yet an energy if we have an energy boundness result. What we know for sure is that this guy, the general solution to the extremal care space-times. To the extremal care space times will be behaving very badly, much badly than anything we've seen before in this talk. So the question is how badly does this guy behave? And does it behave so badly so that in the non-linear picture, you could even form naked singularities from smooth data, right, in finite time. This is an open problem. This is also another open problem. Is also another open problem. I spend quite a lot of time trying to convince you that conservation laws generate asymptotics, or asymptotics are generated by conservation laws. And for this reason, I would like to finish this talk by simply mentioning that we have actually a general geometric theory for the linear wave equation that gives necessary sufficient conditions for the existence of this specific kind of conservation. Existence of this specific kind of conservation laws that generate this type of asymptotics. So, we have a theory for general origin manifolds, like when do you have such conservation laws? And more recent work with myself and Stefan Simek and Nigorodnyansky applies these ideas to understanding a more restrictive regime, which is that of neighborhoods of Mikovsky. To understand these conservation laws, but at the level of the fully non-national Conservation laws, but at the level of the fully nonlinear Einstein equations. And in that case, we relate those conservation laws with physical quantities such as mass, linear, angular momentum, center of mass. Anyway, I would like to thank you very much for listening. Thank you very much, Stefano, for a very interesting talk. Any questions? Any questions from the audience? I have a question just about the Kerr case. You said, so I know you have some asymptotics for L equals to for the wave equation. I'm just wondering if you can say something about Tcholsky. So I know that I guess the reason why you do this is you kind of expect. The reason why you do this is you kind of expect that the Tsukovsky equation behaves like the wave equation for L equals 2. I guess I was wondering more about how you would go about proving this if our methods of, you know, even take the small A case, but our methods are you do the Schunderstecker transformation and then you go back. I'm just wondering how does your method to obtain these sharp asymptotics, how would it interact with that channel? How would it interact with that complexity of the gender secret transformation? Or do you think that you can just that you don't need that at all and that you can do this? Perfect. So the first step would be to try to find the conservation law. Now, once you have found the conservation law, then I think what you would need to do is Would need to do is to have an integrated local energy decay estimate. So even here, like these are results based purely on physical space, but we are using as a black box the integrated local energy decay estimate, the proof of which, for example, might not be proved only using physical space techniques. So what one needs to do in order to get such results is to have a modestimate. Have a more of its estimate, obtain, you know, energy boundness, more of its estimate, integral coordinates decay, obtain in any way. And then also derive appropriate RP estimates at infinity, which are, you know, what Mikhail Seignigo do, plus a natural extension of such results. But even those results can be done in physical space as they were done here for care. were done here for care and they only require again the integral localcy decay and acid flatness so that's how i think it would go so so you think you don't need to to get your fingers in this whole shadow secret transformation business think okay that's that's good that's reassuring um okay thank you rita thanks thank you so i So, I have a couple of, yeah, I have a couple of first of all. I mean, the thing is that heuristically, as you said, in the case of the Reichson Nordstrom case, you know, what is happening to decay along ScryPlus is kind of things going along the horizon. But of course, you know, even though in various pictures we draw horizon and scry plus as meeting at a single point, it's not a single point. It really is. Single point, it's it really is blown up because r is equal to r plus the yeah, so they don't really meet. I mean, it's uh, there's a hole there, right? Because as your picture shows, I mean, in the various R equal to constant lines pass through there. So, and more recently, people have done this more carefully about trying to draw a hyperboloid between the end point of the event horizon and the endpoint. Horizon and the endpoint of ScryPlus and connecting them, trying to analyze the relations between what is happening at the horizon and what is happening at the scribe plus. So, but in your analysis, I just want to say, presumably, this doesn't matter so much because of the decay along the time-like direction along those arrows that you had got in the picture. Is that correct? I don't need to know specific. I don't need to know specifically the structure of this region, as you say, or of time like infinity. Yeah, what we really do is, you know, we are along null infinity and we try to understand what happens along null generators, along these arrows, and along null infinity. But I mean, the geometric structure of that point here or whatever it is, it doesn't play a specific role. A specific role. Like we are not using any conformal compactifications so that we don't need to know what happens here. But my comment about what I said at the beginning is that, you know, it's impossible, like if you know the radiation field here, like if you want to understand something about the black hole from null infinity, then you definitely need to know the late times asymptotics of the radiation field. Just knowing the radiation field in a bounded region. The adjacent field in a bounded region will never tell you anything about the horizon because of the domain of dependence property. So, if I know the adjacent field from here up to here, then I can only see the past in this region, right? That was my comment. But I mean, in the Reison-Osdam case, you had this constant. There was only one constant, right? only one constant right i would you call i think i zero one is if i remember i'm right yeah right i zero one and then that there for example right is this curve or is this uh this is okay yeah but but still the you only have i01 everywhere and that i01 could be could be calculated by looking at uh what is happening in the Happening in the at the sky plus. Exactly. But on the other hand, in the Kerr case, you seem to have these two different constants, isn't it? Yeah, we have two constants in the
