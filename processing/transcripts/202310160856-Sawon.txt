Thank you for the organizers for the invitation and the opportunity to speak here. This this I mean I'm interested in complex symplectic varieties, usually compact, sometimes smooth, sometimes singular, so also orbifolds or singular synthetic varieties. And the way I'm going to motivate this talk is I'm going to motivate this talk is around the problem of can you reconstruct the holomorphic symphlectic variety from a holomorphic Lagrangian sub-manifold inside. Now, this may sound a little kind of far-fetched, and certainly there's lots of cases where this would just be impossible, and I can show you some of those in a moment. But there are some instances where it seems like this kind of thing is possible, and I'm sort of curious about whether there's About whether there's some more general ideas and techniques around exploring this problem. So, I'll start by just giving you a brief reminder of the objects I'm looking at, the Mopix and Platinum manifold and Lagrangians inside them. And then I want to talk about the specific case of curves in K3 surfaces. And a curve is always Lagrangian inside of K3 surface. And then the other source of Lagrangian side are. Then, the other source of Lagrangians that I study a lot are fibers of fibrations on homomorphic symplectic manifolds. And there are very rigid results about the structures of vibrations, and you see that all the fibers are going to be Lagrangian. And so a lot of my work is around the problem of understanding these Lagrangian vibrations and classifying them. And that's where the idea of trying to determine. To determine the total space from the fibers is kind of emerged. And then in the end, I may say a few words about possible connections to topological recursion. So this is partly joint work with my student or former student, Cheng Chen, and my current postdoc, Qu Cheng Chin. But also, it's also part of our FRG with Laura and Modi on Olivia. And that's where we're exploring how to bring in. Where we're exploring how to bring in ideas from Hitchin systems and possibly topological recursion to study this problem. Okay, so to begin with, I'll mainly be talking about compact manifolds. So a compact Kaler manifold is holomorphic symplectic. If it has a holomorphic two-form on it that's non-degenerate. Form on it that's non-degenerate in the sense that it gives a pairing, a non-degenerate pairing on the tangent bundle. So it induces an isomorphism between the tangent and cotangent bundles. And this implies it's even-dimensional, and the top power of the C1 trivializes come under the model. So these are examples of manifolds with vanishing first-churn class. And in fact, the Bogomolon decomposition theorem says that a manifold, the compact The manifold, the compact Kale manifold with managing first churn class, up to a finite cover, splits into a product of Tauri, Calabi, Yaus, and these sorts of holomorphic symplectic manifolds. Or more specifically, in that case, irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds, which are ones that are, in addition, simply connected and the two-form generates the symplectic form generates the space of homomorphic two-forms. So the examples of these are in two dimensions, K3 surfaces, and in higher dimensions. You can take the Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface. This is a Krepid resolution of the symmetric quantum K3 surface. And if you try to do the same thing with an abelian surface, you again get the Hilbert scheme of points on the abelian surface is again holomorphic synthetic. That's not irreducible, but the Following the Bogomola decomposition theorem has a tile cover that splits, in this case, into a product of the ability surface and an irreducible Bolomothy sympathetic factor, which is a generalized commodity. But the main ones I'm interested in in this talk will be the first and the third example. So the third way of viewing some of these spaces, but also generalizing them, is to consider moduli spaces of stable sheaves on K3 or abelian surfaces. And Mackay showed that there's an And Mackay showed that there's a natural symplectic structure on these. The tangent space, so that the moduli space out of sheaf E, is the X1 group from E to itself. And you can compose the X1s and then take a trace to get to here. And on K3O Belian surface, this is one-dimensional. So that gives the this few symmetric pairing on the tan space of these moduli spaces and they become symplectic. Sympletic varieties in this way. So when these are when you're in the case where all the all the semi-stable sheaves are stable, and that's just a topological condition, then you get compact moduli spaces from these. And it turns out that in the case of K3 services, the deformations of this Hilbert scheme are 0.7. If they're not complete, If they're not compact, then you if the modernized space of stable sheaves is not compact, then you can add strictly semi-stable sheaves and get a singular symplectic variety. And there's a couple of cases where they can be dissingularized with smooth examples, which are due to a gradient dimension 6 and 10. As far as the smooth examples are, up to deformation, we essentially know at the moment we have two examples in four. At the moment, we have two examples in four dimensions, these two, and then three in six dimensions, which are on some of the greatest examples. But as I mentioned, I'm interested also in the orbifolds and singular varieties. There are many examples of both. We'll see some of those later on. Okay, but um complex Lagrangian submanifold I mean a submanifold of half the dimension of x such that the pullback of the symplectic form vanishes on on y. Vanishes on y. So any projective space of half dimension is going to be Lagrangian just because there's no holomorphic two-forms on Pn. And the way to find examples of those is if you take a K3 with a rational curve in it, then the symmetric product of the rational curve sits inside the Hilbert scheme, and that gives a Lagrangian Pn inside the Hilbert scheme. In fact, in this case, if you take any curve in the K3, then that. Any curve in the K3, then that induces a Lagrangian in the Bilbert scheme. Another way to get Lagrangians is by looking at vibrations. So if you have an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold and you have a fibration on it, and by this I mean a proper subjective morphism with connected fibers such that the dimension of the base is strictly between Dimension of the base is strictly between 0 and the dimension of x. Then Matsusha showed that there's strong restrictions on the form of this vibration. He showed that the base has to be, and the fibers will have to be half the dimension of x. And the fibers are Lagrangian with respect to the holomorphic symplectic form. So that means that the smooth fibers are Lagrangian, but also if you have a singular fiber, it could even be break up into irreducible pieces. Break up into irreducible pieces, each irreducible component will be Lagrangian. And also, the generic fiber in these fabric has to be a complex torus. But in fact, Bozon showed that using Hodge theory that the general fiber is actually an abelian variety. So X itself doesn't have to be projective. It's a compact Kayla manifold. And for example, with K3 surfaces, the general K3 surface is not. The general K3 surface is not projective. The same is true in the high-dimensional homomorphic symplectic manifolds. But even if X is not projective, non-algebraic, the fibers have to be, and so they are the linear variants always. Now, Matsush also showed some results about the base, and those results suggested that the base should be Pn. He showed it that it has the same Holtz numbers as Pn. And Juno Kwan proved that if the base is smooth, then indeed it is isomorphic to a complex projective space. So that means if you have a section of the fibration, it will be a Pn inside your X. So it will run to the n in that case. In general, it's not known whether the base is smooth or not. It is known in dimension 4, so n equal 2, as proved by Webrecks and Shu, that in that That in that case the base is smooth, so that means that by Huang's result it is smooth. But most of the examples we'll see will have base Pn. In fact, it's not known whether there are any examples where the base is a singular method. So what's the condition on the question being a vibration? Just that it's a proper map? It's a proper holomorphic morphism to a normal composition. Into a normal complex space B with connected fibers and I want the base to be a dimension strictly between zero and the dimension x. Well the base the dimension of the base is strictly between zero and two n. Other questions? Okay, so now let me come back to the next one. Okay, so now let me come to the sort of motivating question. So, given a holomorphic Lagrangian inside of X, the question is: can you reconstruct the admin space X from Y? Now, the normal bundle to the Lagrangian is the cotangent bundle of the Lagrangian. You can see that from looking at the normal bundle sequence. So, if you take this normal bundle sequence, I guess this should really be restricted to y. So, this is the So this is the tangent bundle of y sitting in the tangent bundle of x, the normal bundle. If you dualize this sequence, then you get the dual sequence. But on x, we have this morphism, this isomorphism from the tangent bundle of x, to the cotangent bundle, induced by the symplectic form. And if y is Lagrangian, then the symplectic form restricted to y is going to be trivial. Is going to be trivial. So if you consider then the map from the tangent bundle of y through this isomorphism over to the cotangent bundle of y, that has to be zero. And so means the image of Ty inside here, when you map it down to here, has to lift to a map to the codormal bundle. So in the end, you get an isomorphism between these two, or equivalently, an isomorphism between these two. So the normal bundle is the So, the normal bundle is the cotential bundle to y. Now, in real symplatic geometry, you have like the Einstein triple neighborhood theorem, which says that a neighborhood of the Lagrangian is diffeomorphic to the neighborhood of the zero section in its cotangent bundle. You don't have that in the holomorphic setting, in the sense that the neighborhood of the Lagrangian is not bi-holomorphic to the neighborhood of the zero section in the cotangent bundle. I mean, you see that already. I mean, you see that already with the vibrations because the vibration, if you take a general fiber, it's the Lagrangian abelian variety or complex forus. The cotangent bundle is trivial, but neighborhood of the fibers is not trivial. The nearby fibers are different, not all of us. I mean, there are examples of isotrivial fibrations where the fibers are all isomorphic, but in general, the fibers are varying. General that the fibers are varying. So the negro of Lagrangian is a little more complicated than that. However, it is true that the x does degenerate to kind of compactification of the cotangent bundle of branch. That's the yeah, the normal code of y is like a one-point compactification of the Application of the normal bundle model, the current anti-bundle model. So that suggests one possible approach to this problem. And I want to start by saying a little bit about this in the case of curves in K3 surfaces. So in general, if we consider the family of GMSG curves. Consider the family of genus G curves that lie in some K3 surface. Well, I guess really what I mean here is n is the family of pairs of a curve and a K3 surface that exists in. So there's a map from N to, you forget the curve, you map down to the K3 surface. And a genus G curve is going to move in a G-dimensional linear system inside its K3. So this is also PG bundle over the moduli space of the three surfaces. So altogether you see that. So, altogether, you see that this is going to be g plus 19-dimensional, because a moduli space of, I mean, the curve gives a polarization to the K3, so we're considering polarized K3 surfaces. So there's a 19-dimensional family of those K3 surfaces, and a PG bundle over that. And then there's another map where you forget the K3 surface, and you just map the curve to the moduli space of G curves. And this, of course, is 3G minus 3-dimensional. And if G is And if g is large enough, if g is at least 12, then you see that this n has to have smaller dimensions, should be a smaller dimension than mg. So the general genus G curve does not lie, you know, K3 seconds, just from this count of parameters. However, in this range of large genus, you can show that this map. You can show that this map is injective. So that if the curve lies in a K3 surface, the K3 surface is unique, uniquely determined by the curve. Second statement, same. Okay, so we call the curve that lies at the K3 surface a K3 curve. And so the problem now would be to say: if I give you a general curve, does it lie on a K3 surface or not? How do you tell whether it lies? K3 surface or not, how do you tell whether it lies in a K3 surface? And Lazarusfeld showed that the K3 curves are real no the general. So if you look at line bundles on these curves and the number of sections they have, there's nothing special about these curves from that point of view. So you need to find something a little more sophisticated to More sophisticated to characterize these K3 cuts. Okay, so I mentioned that earlier, that X would deform to the normal cone over its Lagrangian. So in this case, if the curve lies in a K3 surface, then the K3 surface should degenerate to the one-point compactification of the cotangent bundle of the curve. The cotangent bundle of the curve, or the normal cone of the curve. And so you can ask: like, what if we start with the curve and we take this normal cone and then we try to smooth it? Can we produce a K3 surface in that way? Or if not, what is the obstruction to doing that? So this idea was explored by Jonathan Wall, and he showed that if a curve lies in a K3 surface, if it's a K3 curve, then this map Then, this map, this is kind of the Gauss map, and I think it became known as the wall map. Then, this has to be non-subjective. So the co-kernel of this map is the space of first-order deformations of this normal cone of the curve. So, the idea here is to take the normal cone of the curve, which is Curve, which is a singular surface with a singularity at the apex, and then try to smooth that. And so we'll study the deformation theory of this singular surface to see when that surface can be smoothed. And found that if it can be smooth to first order at least, then this map can there must be something in this code coding of this gas map. Now, this turns out to be a Now, this turns out to be a fairly good characterization of K3 curves, but it's not perfect. So if a curve lies at a K3 surface, this photon has to be non-trivial. But on the other hand, there are some curves where this is non-trivial and yet the curve does not lie on the K3 surface. And the reason for that is because this is only the first order deformations. So it could be that you can smooth to first order, but not to higher order. So you don't actually smooth this singular surface to a This singular surface to a smooth surface, red K3 surface. Okay, other approaches to this problem of recovering the K3 from the curve are another approach that was described by Mukai. And so he looked at the case if you have odd genus and sufficiently large odd genus, then he looked at the real mobile lotus. The Brill Nova locus of inside the moduli space of stable rank 2 bundles on C with first churn plus the model of the curve. So he looked at the Brill Nova locus inside there of bundles with at least M sections. And he kind of described a general procedure of showing that this should be a K3 surface, and a dual K3 surface should then contain. Surface should then contain the curve. So, I guess the idea, say a little more about this, is that if the curve lies in a K3 surface, then on this K3, we take a modulized space of sheaves on that, which is another K3 surface. And so this is parametrizing sheaves on S, but then by restriction, it also parametrizes sheaves on C. And so then this is equal to this sheaves on C, but with some condition. So this is sitting inside the moduli space of sheaves, which is C. And so going in the reverse direction, it says if you start with C, then consider the moduli space of shoes on the curve, and then On the curve, and then this will know the logos inside it. That should be a K3 surface which has, as dual, a K3 surface that contains C. So that was the idea behind Mackay's instruction. And he did the details in the genus 11k. So, I mean, this is smaller than the genus I mentioned earlier, but it turns out that this map here is in Here is in g equals 11, these have the same dimension, but it's still injective. Something actually strange happens in the 12. It's not injective in the g equals 12 case. So you have to sort of skip 12, but it works for g equal 11. And then Amarella, Bruin, and Sanese, following Mackay's approach, they showed that this also works for higher genus converges of three models. Common to three models, more. And then the most general result of this direction is Sahela Fezbach, and she proved it works for genus 11 and all higher genus, including the even genus. And so she kind of extended Mackay's result to higher rank bundles on the curves and then used this wall crossing in in bridge and stability conditions to study these more delay spaces. Okay, any questions at this point? Okay, so now let me turn to Lagrangian vibrations. And I want to start by describing the kind of prototypical Lagrangian vibration known as the Lebrun-McKay integral system. This example comes from taking a family of comes from taking a family of take a smooth genus n curve and its linear system inside a K3 surface so you get an N-dimensional linear system and so you get a family of genus N curves linearly equivalent to C and if we're in the case that the neural severity of the K3 is generated by this curve then all the curves in this family will be reduced and irreducible and in that case you can define their compactive high You can define their repact of hydrochovians following the Alban-Kleinman definition of the Pact of Hydrocobe. So that's just, so in this family, you have the smooth curves and then you have singular curves in coefficient one, but if they're all integral, then you can define their compactified Jacobians as moduli space of torsion-free, region torsion-free sheaves. And so you can get a relative compactified Jacobian of this family. And And then it turns out that this family is then a Lagrangian vibration. So, the way to see the symplectic structure on the total space here is to reinterpret X as a moduli space of sheaves on the K3 by thinking of a line bundle on the curve as actually a line bundle on the K3 by sort of pushing it forward and thinking of it as a torsion sheaf on the K3 surface. So it's sheaves of rank zero. It's sheaves of rank zero, first churn class, class of C, and then some degree, depending on the degree we choose. So this is a moduli space of sheaves on the K3, and then by Mackay's result, it's a whole Maltic symplectic manifold, and that's how you see the symplectic structure on X. And then you have this vibration, and by Matsush's result, this has to be Lagrangian vibration. And as I mentioned earlier, And as I mentioned earlier, these modulated spaces, these Makay moduli spaces, all these deformations are the golden scheme of K3 cells. Okay, so I want to kind of work back and down and say, suppose we have a Lagrangian fibration whose fibers are Jacobins and curves. What can we say about the total space? And the first result in this direction is Juda Mark. Is due to Markoshevich, and this is in the genus II case. So he has a four-dimensional holomorphic symplectic manifold finded by genus by Jacobins of genus II curves. Or more precisely, he says you take a flat family of reduced and irreducible Garnstein curves of genus II and suppose that its compactified Jacobian is Lagrangian fibration. Then he proved that this must be the Bevil-McKay system. So the family of curves, I mean, McKay system. So the family of curves that we started with has to actually be a complete linear system of curves on a K3 surface. And so it sort of brings us back to this earlier problem of given the curves, actually in this case given the family of curves rather than the single curve, can we reconstruct K3 surface from them? And that's what Mark Chevysh showed that you can do in this case. So of course this is all So, of course, this is also the Jacobian genus 2 curve is the general principally polarized abelian surface is the Jacobian of Genus 2 curve. So, this is kind of the general situation of a vibration by principally polarized abelian surfaces. So, I want to just sketch a proof to this, and it uses another result of Matsushta, which is that the direct image of the structure sheaf of Of the structure sheaf of X, these bundles of forms on the base. So this is actually true for Lagrangian vibrations in any dimension, and even when x is singular, you still have this result. When i equals 1, this is saying that, I mean, you can reinterpret the left-hand side as basically the tangents to the fibers of the vibration, and the right-hand side, of course, is the The right hand side of course is the cotangent bundle to the base, which you're pulling back, it would be the conormal bundle to the fibers. So it's saying that the tangent bundle of the fibers is isomorphic to the conormal bundle, which is just the consequence of it being a Lagrangian fibration. So it's at least. So it's at least for smooth fire as you see for equal 1, this is basically saying that it's a Lorentz vibration. But what Matsusha, the real, the difficult part of Matsusha's result is extending this to the singular part. That sort of takes some complicated Hodge-theoretic arguments to do so. I think there's a more recent proof of this by Christian Schnell as well. Maybe using more powerful ideas in Hodge theory, but the Hodge theory, but the end proof is a little bit streamlined. So, in the case that we have a fabric by Jacobians of curves, one can also show that the R1 of the fibers of the Jacobians is the same as R1 of all of the curves. So, we have this identification as well. And so, this is the isomorphism that we use to prove Markovich's theorem. So, the idea. So, the idea now is to take this family of curves and to try to understand them and use their canonical embeddings. Well, not embeddings in this case, but the canonical map on the genus 2 curves. So a genus 2 curve, the canonical map is going to give the double cover of P1. And if you do this in the family, then what you're doing is mapping the family genus 2 curves to a P1 bundle over our base P2. And the P1 bundle is a projectivization of P2. The P1 bundle is a projectivization of this first direct image of OC, which, as we just saw, is isomorphic to P1 of the cotangent bundle of P2. So that's the first step, identifying this P1 bundle that the family of curves maps to. This naturally sits inside P2 cross P2 joule. And so the map then from C down to the P2 is just the family of curves. The family of curves. The map in the other direction is the one we'll use to eventually construct a K3 surface out of this. So the genus 2 curve is a double cover of P1 branched over six points. For the family, you get that the family has to be a double cover of this P1 bundle, branched over a locus which is a zero section of this bundle. So it's six because it's a So it's six because it's a on each fiber, it's a branch that's six points. Then there's some ambiguity. It could be a line bundle pulled back from the other direction, from the base, some degree. But this identification also allows us to determine this degree. And so what you find in the end is that the branch locus is a section of this bundle, which is actually just a section of O6 pulled back from the second factor. So what that So, what that means in the end is that the branch locus fall back from here means that all of the it means that there's a K3 surface coming from the branch cover of this P2 jewel over that sec stick. And the curves inside the K3 are then the K3 then maps down to that P2 and then The K3 then maps down to that P2 and then the curves are mapping down to the lines in this P2 jaw. So the curves in here and the line in this side, this P3 side. Maybe I describe this a little confusingly. I'll do another example like this later where perhaps I can explain it a little bit quickly. It's a hyogenous example where it makes it a little easier to see what's going on. Okay, in any case, the main point here is that we can discover a key free surface out of the geometry of these. And so this kind of led me to ask that is there a similar result true for higher genus curves, for higher dimensional Lagrangian fibrillations? And in fact I I think this question was also posed by Michael Sheagrich in some earlier papers. Earlier papers. So, given a flat family of integral Garnestein curves of genus N over Pn, and then take the compact Jacobian, the relative Jacobian of that, suppose that gives you a Lagrangian vibration. So you have this Lagrangian vibration by Jacobians. So then the question or the conjecture is that this must be Lagrill-McKay system. So the curves must lie in a single K3 surface. This relates back to this problem of the Lagrangian reconstruction. A consequence of this would be that if you're in sufficiently large genus, you can reconstruct the total space from a single fiber. And that goes through a couple of steps. So, first of all, if you take the fiber and that's the Jacobian of the curve, by Torelli theorem, that uniquely determines the curve, or at least if you have. That uniquely determines the curve, or at least if you have the polarization on these two curves as well. So, by Trelli theorem for curves, you can recover the curve. And then, if this conjecture is true, you would say that this family of curves, in particular each curve in the family, lies in a K3 surface. And that K3 surface is uniquely determined by the curve. So, you get from C to the K3 surface. And then finally, once you have the K3 surface, then it's also saying that X is this Gerdou-Machai integral system. Is this the vulnerable integral system constructed from that pig 3 surface? So you then have a way to recover x just from starting with a single finite. Okay, so it turns out indeed that this question has a positive answer, at least in some cases. So Markusevich's result was a genus 2 case. But genus 3, 4, and 5, I proved that it's all Prove that it's also true in those cases when the curves are non-hyperolliptic before and five. And in genus 3, it's also true in the genus 3 case, in the hyperelliptic case. In the hyperolliptic case, you still assume the curves are reduced, but they can't be irreducible. If you have hyperelliptic curves, then in this family, they have to break up into some of the. Family, they have to break up into some. Some of them are going to be reducible as well. So there's a kind of substitute for irreducibility here, which is this canonically positive two-connected, which is, I mean, it's not really poor, that means that's just sort of a natural condition to put on this family of curves in the Hyperliki case. So in both these cases, we can show that you get the rule kind of more systems from these. So, in other words, you can construct. In other words, you can construct K3 surfaces from these vampires at curves that I'd also like to just mention that if you have a Lagrangian vibration in dimension six, then the generic principally polarized abelian threefold is the Jacobian of a smooth non-hyperolliptic curve. So that's this case up here in the non-hyperliptic case. In hygienus In higher genus, in genus 4, 5, this is the general principle polarized abelian variety is not Jacobian of a curve anymore. But this result is applied to Jacobian. Okay, so let me describe how to prove, just in the case of n equal 3 and non-hyper elliptic. So again, we use the relative canonical map. In this case, it is an. Map. In this case, it is an embedding, so a genus 3 curve that's called hyperolliptic is embedded by its canonical map as a plane quartic. And when you do this in the family, then you get a map from the family of curves into this P2 bundle over P3. And once again, using Matt Sushi's result, we can identify this as a projectivization of cotangent bundle of P3, which again sits inside P3 cross P3 dual. It's like it's the incidence variety sitting inside there. Varieties that are inside there. And the family of curves, each curve is a quartic in P2. So altogether the family of curves is the zero locus of a section of this line bundle, which is a quartic on each fiber, and then up to some pullback of a line bundle from the base. But again, you can determine that degree and see that, in fact, the this. This band of curves is a zero locus of a section of a line bubble that's pulled back from this P3 dual background. So what that means is that you have this family of curves. Each curve maps to a P2, which is really a hyperplane inside P3 dual. And it's cut up by, it's a quadratic inside that hyperplane. But actually, Plane, but actually, as you vary the hyperplanes and get them varying the curves, all these quartics, there's actually just a single quartic inside P3 joule, cutting out all these curves. That's your K3 surface and the curves line on the map. Okay, now in hygienus, if you go back to the integral Garnsting curve, K. The integral Gorenson curve case, I showed that if you get a Lagrangian vibration from a relative compact fibrin of Gmus N curves, then the hypersurface in Pn that parametrizes the singular fibers has to have degree at least 4n plus 2. And if the degree is at least is strictly bigger than 4n plus 20, then I was able to show this is a boolean. Then I was able to show this is a Google Marketing Google system. And this gives us different ideas to the earlier results. Instead of looking at the relative canonical map of the family of curves, here I take the relative Abel-Jacobi map. So the Abel-Jacobi map of the curve is mapping the curve into its Jacobian. So you get a map from the family of curves into X itself, and then you can restrict the holomorphic symplatic. The holomorphic symplectic form on X to that family of curves. Now, if that is a coisotropic subvariety, then you can do coisotropic reduction, and that produces the K3 subs. And this actually goes back to an idea of Jacques Hertebes, and he sort of studied the same situation in the non-compact case. And so he used this idea of choisotropic reduction to produce a surface in which the curves sit. Now, in his result, there's a hypothesis that this subradium you get is chisotropic. And so that's one of the things you have to prove in this case is that we really do get a chisotropic sub-radi from this band curves, the evil Jacobi of Bandit curves into M. Than the curves into x. But then also I had to show that, so this is kind of a local result, whereas here I'm trying to do it globally. So I also have to show that the null foliation on the choir tropic subvariety has compact leaves and you can take a space of leaves and get a P3 surface. So yeah, also able to copy maps. Abu-Jacobi map, the derivative of that is the canonical map. So there is a kind of connection between the approach to this result and the approach to the early result. So the Able-Jacobi map and canonical map are related by taking derivative. And so I suspect there might be some way to sort of combine the two approaches and get a stronger result than either. Okay, let me also just mention here that, I mean, this condition on the degree of the discriminant level, this of course is a global hypothesis. If you take a single smooth fiber, it doesn't see that delta at all. So somehow this is not, I mean, in terms of the Ramjian reconstruction problem, this is not a reasonable hypothesis. And in some sense, it was a little bit artificial to introduce this here, but it's what was needed to make. This here, but it's what was needed to make the group work. Any questions? Yeah. The case for, you said case for any three and then four and five. What are the types of the K3 circles that you're getting for four and five? So for the genus. In genus three, I guess it's a quartic and P3. What are the genus four? What are the genus 4? It will be the intersection of the quadric and the cubic in default. And in genus 5, it will be intersection of three quadrics and defined. In fact, I mean, that's an important fact in these low genus cases. They really use the fact that if you take a curve and it's canonical benefit, you're low genus, you have that. Log genus, you have that very explicit description of the curve as a complete intersection. And then you're able, you're sort of able to enhance that to the description of the K3 in terms of the complete intersection. And that's why it only works in the slow genus cases. Once you get the genus 6 or higher, then the general K3 or general code is not a complete intersection anymore. Okay, so these Jacobians, of course, are all prints. Of course, are all principally polarized abelian varieties, and also want to look at the grounding vibrations by non-principally polarized varieties. Now, to have abelian varieties that still come from curves, the next thing to look at would be prim varieties, or really, I guess these are really generalized prim varieties. And so these are appealing varieties that arise from double covers of code. So you have C. From double covers of curves. So you have C, there's a double cover of D with a covering involution tau. Then, I mean, if you just look at the fixed locus of pullback by tau, so you take the pullback of line bubbles by tau on D, sorry, these are the cover. You take a pullback by tau for line bubbles on C, that gives an involution on the Jacobian of C. Fixed locus of that. Fixed locus of that is exactly the line bubbles that are invariant under the under the pullback. So they come from downstairs, they come from D. So they're just line bubbles pulled back from D. But as tau star is an involution, it has like a plus one and minus one eigenspace, in a sense. And this is the plus one eigenspace. The minus one eigenspace would be a fixed locus of minus tau star. So that's the complementary sub-variety of the Jacobian Athenian. Sub-variety of the Jacobin of D inside C. That's the prime variety of the cover. So it's a complementary abelian sub-variety in Jacobin of C. Its dimension is a complementary dimension. It's principally polarized only when the cover is unramified or has two branch points. Otherwise, it has this polarization type. It's ones and some twos. So usually at this stage, somebody asks me what the At this stage, somebody asked me what the polarization type is. Okay, yeah, good question. So let me remind you. Polarization of the abelian variety. So I just mean that if you have a polarization of the abelian variety to its first Chern class, that is a few symmetric pairing on the first homology. And you can choose a standard basis for homology that puts it into this form. And so the polarization type is this n-tuple of the integers, right? Same tuple of the integers with this divisibility, positive integers. So principally polarized is the case when these are all ones. And this is just a discrete invariant to characterize polarized units. In sorry, but in this defining the script. Yeah, that's that's the superscript zero is to take the connector component or the trivial. On the trivial. I think it's not always needed. Sometimes these turn out to be connected, but in general, you have to take that connection. You want to need it in the unramified case. In the what? Unramified case? In unramified case. It's disconnected in the unramified case and connected otherwise. Correct. Okay. Is it the same as a portion of Jupiter D or Gobiology? Which Which do you populate of D or why you put it in of C? I smoked the quotient. Yeah, yeah, it's a quotient. Yeah, the complementary is somewhere in the old quotient. Okay, so that's described a single prevariety. To do this in a family now, you want the We want a family of double couples of curves, and one way to construct this is to take linear systems in surfaces that are double covers of each other. So we take a K3 surface that's a double cover of another surface, and I want the covering involution here to be anti-symplectic on the K3 surface. And these K3 surfaces with anti-symplectic involutions were classified by. Involutions were classified by McCoulin. There's 75 families. The quotient surface T is either an Enrica surface in the unramified case or a rational surface, like the Dor Petzo or a Hertzberg surface. There's a complete classification of these using the lattice theoretic methods, but we've cooled it. And so then you can take a curve D downstairs in this surface T. In this surface T, and take its pre-image in the K3, and you get in this way a family of double covers of curves when you vary this curve. And the double covers, in general, the curves upstairs, they move in a bigger linear system. I mean, not every curve in the linear system of C is going to be invariant under tau. So not every curve here comes from downstairs. So I'm calling C tilde the I'm calling C tilde the big family of curves upstairs. Inside there, you have the ones that are pulled back from downstairs. And you could then, so we want to consider the family of prim varieties of these. And to compactify that family in a nice way, each prim sits inside the Jacobian of C. But then now we also have the family. But then now we also have the family of curves of these double covers of curves. This family of curves C sits inside this bigger family of curves in the K3. And so if you just take this bigger family and the relative Jacobian of that, then you get this, but you really get again a Baville-Mackay system of the Jacobians of all these curves. And inside here we have. Inside here, we have the curves which are double covers, and inside their Jacobins we have their primbrites. So the family of primbrites is sitting inside this much bigger space, and in fact, it's the fixed locus of an involution on this Pravo-Makai system. The involution comes from this the induced map of the involution, tau, on the Pravo-Makai system. Of the global chi system, composed with a second involution, antisymplatic involution, which is this five-wise duality. It's really taking a line bundle on the curve to its dual. And that's just because the prem, I mean, it's defined by, you have this minus, like, I mean, minus on a Jacobian just takes a line bundle to its dual. And that's what this map is doing. So you combine both of them and take the fix like this. So you combine both of them and take the fixed locus, you get the prim variety, but it gives you a way to globalize this and to compactify it. So inside this global Macca system, this map is a, I mean, in the end, this is a composition of two anti-symplectic involutions, so it gives a symplectic involution, and therefore its fixed locus is symplectic, and that's the relative prim. It's a compactification of the prime, of course. And this idea was first introduced by Marko Shevich and Tico Lu. First introduced by Markushevich and Tikomurov, and it was used also by Arborella, Sakhani and Feretti, and Mataini, who was a student of Markushevich. And the specific example studied by Markushevich Dikomirov was when you take a K3 that's a double cover of a degree 2 Del Petzo surface. In that case, you get a family of genus 3 curves that cover a family of elliptic curves. And so the primary And so the prime varieties in that case are surfaces of, million surfaces of polarization 0.1 or 2. Now, it turns out in this case, the Bilberch system you use over here is singular, and this fixed locus is also singular. So we get irreducible symplectic variety. In fact, it's an orbifold, and in this case, it has 28 isolated singularities that look like this. Singularities that look like this. And these, so you get a symplectic variety. In this case, the singularities can't be resolved symplectically. So we have to sort of step outside this holomorphic symplectic manifolds to get also consider also orbital. So just as we saw with families of Jacobians. Families of Jacobians of curves. We wanted to have a classification result for these families of prims as well. And the prim varieties in this case are abelian surfaces of polarization 1,2. But in fact, conversely, if I start with an abelian surface of polarization type 1,2, then if you look at the dual K3 surface, that's also 1,2 polarized. And if you take a curved Take a curve, an ample class in there, that gives a genus 3, a generic class here, which is a smooth genus 3 curve in there. In fact, there's a pencil of these. And then pulling back line bundles on A dual to line bundles on C, you get this map of, I mean, this was really just A again, you get a map from A into the Jacobian of that genus 3 third. And the quotient. And the quotient is then an elliptic curve. And so, in fact, this gives a description of a 1,2-polarized abelian surface as the prim variety of a double colour, of the genus 3 curve I remember. This description is not unique. As I said, there's a pencil of these curves C inside here. So there's actually a whole P1 worth of ways to describe this 1,2-polar execution surface as a prim drive. Okay, so generalizing Markoshevich's result for families of Jacobis of genus II curves, I was able to show a nice postdoc, Qin, that if we start now with a family of double couples of genus III curves over elliptic curves, such that their relative crime, compact fight relative crime variety, is a Lagrangian vibration, then we're able to show that this has to be this example of Markochian term. To be this example of Markovich and Tico Meolov. So, again, like with the families of Jacobians, what we need to do is reconstruct the surfaces from these families of curves. The a priori, the hypothesis doesn't say anything about these curves lying in any surfaces. It's just a family of double couples of curves. So, this is really the content of the theorem. The elliptic curves are lying in a degree to Del Petzo, and the genus 3 curves are lying in a degree. And the genus 3 codes are lying in the cubs. So, I don't want to go through the proof of this. It uses ideas similar to what we saw in the case of Jacobians. You take the curves and you look at the embeddings of those into projected spaces. Then you do it in a family, and then you show that the geometry of the embeddings of the curves points you towards a. It points you towards surfaces and the curves are lying on the surface. But instead, I want to say that at the moment we're trying to extend this into some higher-dimensional cases. So, again, following these general constructions of relative prime varieties, there are constructions of six-dimensional Lagrangian fibrations coming from. Coming from, well, in the case of construction of Mattini, he looked at K3 surface that's a double cover of a cubic surface. And in this case, you get a family of genus IV curves covering elliptic curves. And the prim variety is a free fold of this type. And this leads to a Lagrangian vibration. Again, it's a synthetic overfold that has singularities. Singularities of this type. And with my student Shen, using the same construction, we described an example coming from K3, that's a double cover of a degree 1 del Pezzo. But in this case, we have genus 5 curves covering genus 2 curves. And you get prim varieties of this type. And again, we showed you get a subjective variety of MG6 with. We have some orbit fault similarities. And so currently with my postdoc Chin, we're working on extending this sort of classification result to these other cases. So for example, starting with a family of genus 4 curves covering elliptic curves over P3, if that family of print varieties gives a Lagrangian vibration, then we want to show that. Then we want to show that the elliptic curves lie in that cubic surface, and the genus 4 curves lie in the painting double coupled curve. Okay, so well, I mean, I've talked about some so the the overarching goal here is to classify the ground vibrations in some of these low dimensions, four dimensions, six dimensions. So I've only mentioned a few of the examples here. So I've only mentioned a few of the examples here, but the Rumukai system and Markoshevich Tikhomirov system. But the ultimate goal would be to have classification results in all these other cases. So given a Lagrangian vibration by linear surfaces of polarization type 1 to 3, we'd want to show that it's this evil system discovered by Duval. And likewise in six dimensions. And likewise, in six dimensions, in six dimensions, there's a lot more examples. I've had this list of examples, but in each example, you can also consider the dual vibration. And that's kind of an interesting problem about how to construct the dual or describe it in a more geometric way. And there are quite a few results known in that direction about the geometric description of the dual vibrations. But again, we'd like. But again, we'd like to take these families of examples we know and get these classification results. Say, if we have an example with this polarization type, can we show that it comes from this construction method? Can we reconstruct the surface of Sethic curves like? And I believe that there'll be some more discussion about jolt vibrations in some of the evening sessions. Perhaps I could just skip over at this file. Well, let me just say, as far as the polarization types are concerned, I mean, here you only get these sort of polarizations of fairly small degrees, and that's the expectation that only these small degrees should arise. Benjamin Wienick proved that essentially the polarization type is constant in the family of the random vibrations. For any vibration on the manifold, On the manifold deformation equivalent to the Kumbh scheme over K3, polarization type should always be principal. That's like the examples we saw with Lagrangians. But these other ones, generalize Kumlis, which I didn't say a whole lot about, you get non-principal polarizations. But there's also some restrictions on the polarization type, and it's not, we don't quite know that there's finitely many types of polarization in each dimension, but there are. In each dimension, but there are some restrictions on the polarization part. For example, this result saying that in the case of polarizations by vibrations by surfaces, the product D1, D2 is restricted to these numbers. Most of these I would not expect would look. Okay, so let me just finish by saying a little bit about how Saying a little bit about how topological recursion may have something to say about this problem. So, if we have a general Lagrangian vibration, not necessarily compact anymore, over some base B, then Dan Fried and Nigel Hitchin showed that the regular locus, the open subset of the base parametrizing smooth fibers, admits a special Kayla metric. Where the tau ij here are the the the the uh the periods of the of the thibus. I think the these complex torus of the fibers. And also the coordinates on the base here is these are the coordinates adapted to the special Kayla metric. They come from, for example in the GLA intention system, they come from integrating this canonical one. Integrating this canonical one-form on the surface over that some subset of the basis of the homology of the spectral curves. And moreover, if you take the period matrices and you look at the this is almost time to stop. Is it still recording? Okay, if you take the derivatives of the period matrices. Derivatives of the period matrices. Then you get this cubic form, and this is the cubic form of Donald Martin, which discovered. And what Gavin Branger and his student Huang proved is that, in fact, not just the first derivative of these period matrices, but all the dimensions of the period matrices are related to the Related to the Enod-Lorentine invariance of the spectral curves. And so, I mean, they proved this in the GLN Hitchen system. And in particular, like the first derivatives, they've recovered the DeMargen-Machman cubicle in the base. And also, just the periods themselves are what we're giving the special payload matrix. Giving the special payload matrix. So, somehow the fascinating aspect of this is that the single spectral curve is telling you about all of the special halometric in the denying market on the base, which is really giving you the whole vibration in a way. And so, I think one of the things very interesting is trying to extend this to, well, first of all, other kitchen systems. I mean, this is. Hitchen systems. I mean, this is for GLN Hitchen system where you have Lagrange, where you have Jacobians of spectral curves, but other Hitchen systems you have Primbaran, as I've seen. But also extending this to the compact case. These curves in K3 surface are really sort of analogues of these spectral curves. So ask again, can we compute these sorts of invariants for K3 curves? And here there are some suggestions of how to do this by these authors. These authors, China Wong, Norbury, Swadon Tabako. In their case, they're using elliptic K3s so that you have that projection down to the base. Just like in the case of the Hitchens system, the spectral curves are lying in the cotangent bundle of sigma, so you have that map down to the base, which is really essential for doing the topological recursion. But in the general situation that curves in K3, so you don't have that. The curves in K3, so you don't have that map anymore. And so it's still a bit of a mystery about how to do topological recursion for those K3 curves. And finally, let me just mention that the cubic is really kind of coming from this normal bundle sequence that we saw right at the beginning when we were talking about the Wall's result about smoothing the normal cone of the curve to get a K3 surface. So if the curve lies in a K3 surface, then there's this extension class here, and that's the element that gave this non-trivial element in the co-kernel of the wall map. But that's really just related to, it's not exactly the non-night the Nagy Markman cubic, but it's related to it, right? Two of this map. And so it seems that this term is describing the family, but at the same time, if you have a single curve, you can ask, does it already know about this denial marking cubic? And therefore, is it actually able to tell you something about the neighboring fibers and to reconstruct the whole space from them? Okay, so anyway, these are just some. Okay, so anyway, these are just some other ideas that we'd like to pursue in this direction. But I'm out of time, so I'll finish that. Are there any questions, more questions, more questions? Yeah. Uh, just trying to get a few pictures. I'm not getting any news back here, but A lot of these constructions are giving new examples of sympathetic overfolds or sympathetic varieties. These techniques have not produced any new smooth sympathetic manifolds. I mean, most of them are singular. Like these. This one and this one are the smooth examples in non-dimensional two. The second one in each pair is a specialization of the previous one. And these are the new ones that they found here are all all the false. Likewise, in six dimensions, these are smooth, and these are smooth. Or grady six is smooth as well. But these intermediate ones, the Abarella Safara Freddy, example Metini, and the one with my students shared. Metweenee and one with my students shared. These are all singular. These are all. Well, again, I mean, using these ideas, you could say if they, I mean, the intermediate question could be, what about all the all the ones constructed by this green brightness? Um I think there's one additional one in addition to this. I think there's one additional one in addition to this. There's finitely many ways to get three-dimensional prim brothers. Like genus 4 covering elliptic, genus 5 covering genus 2, genus 6 covering genus 3. And I think there's one additional one in addition. Can you glean any information about X from Y if they are not compact? Or y, if they're not compact. If x is not compact? That's right. Or if y is not compact? Or if they're both compact? I haven't really thought a great deal about that question. I think maybe that's a question for human system people. I mean, is that anything like that known for half systems? You know a single spectral curve? Like if you have a geo-adhitching system, is the spectral curve does a single spectral curve neatly tell you if it's a rank R hitching system, then that single spectral curve is a R-fold cover of the base. Cover of the base curve. But I think that would be, generally, that would be unique. Like if the curve is an R-fold cover, but not a curve. Again, the general curve is probably not an R-fold cover anymore. I think there are probably quite similar results in that case as well. However, it doesn't need to be spectral to be the that's I guess that's what you're saying. I guess that's what you're saying. The cover? Spectral uh a curve coming down the curve doesn't need to be spectral. Curve coming down the curve doesn't need to be spectral. A cover of one curve by another doesn't have to arise as the spectrum of it. I see. I thought that's what you were saying. I'm just saying it back to you. That's what I was saying. I'm not sure what I was saying. I have a different question. So suppose you start with this initial case x over b in the spirit of sheet alpha san and i of x and so on. Let's assume that this is already PPAD Lagrangian vibration. What else can you impose it to bring it to already? So you mean in hygiene's case where principally polarized doesn't necessarily mean Principally polarized doesn't necessarily mean that you could. I don't know. That's another good question. I think there are examples of vibrations by intermediate geopodiums, of threefold. And I believe some of those are also principally polarized. Principally polarized into PDG coals. But those are, yeah, those are not, I have to check the dimensions thing. I think those are not Jacobians of curves. So that would be an example of what we're talking about. But they are deformations of they are deformations of, again, the Hilbert scheme. So maybe they specialize to the Specialized to the families of Jacobins. But I guess this relates to like shortcuts and that's the question. Do you expect them in that? No, so I think that's very much a high-dimensional analogue of this question about.
