Uh let's see. Oh, okay. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, looks good. Can you see it? Yeah, it looks good. Okay. Okay, so I think it's time to begin already. And so, with no further delay, I'm pleased to introduce Alexander Kislev from Duke University. And he will speak about boundary layer models of the Ho-Law scenario. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to give this talk, and thank you for the invitation. So, my talk will have So my talk will have quite a few things in common with Tom Howe's talk yesterday. It's essentially on the same subject, except that I will focus on the earliest work of Tong Hao and Guo Luo on their first scenario and attempts to understand it rigorously. So the main equation that I will be considering The main equation that I will be concerned with is Euler's equation. And so it's written here. It's an interesting fact that it's the second PDE ever written down, even though it's fairly complex already. It came very early in the story. And generally, if, like for much of my talk, I will be discussing situations where Discussing situations where there is a boundary and the boundary condition is not penetration. And it's often convenient to look at this equation in vorticity form. And it's written here in vorticity form. So we then think of vorticity as our main function, and velocity can be recovered from vorticity by Bios-Solar law. Generally, velocity is one derivative, beta. And in Vartesity 4, And in Vartishti form, one can see a clear difference between two and three dimensions. So in red, I have here water stretching, so-called water extretching term. And it is not there in two dimensions, just by simple vector calculus. And for that reason, two-dimensional case is quite a bit simpler, where questions of global regularity Of global regularity are concerned. And 2D Euler has been known to be regular since the 1930s. And the bound on the growth of derivatives or high-order derivatives of the solution has been known to be double exponential in time. And so I want to quickly comment on this before talking about the 3D case and About the 3D case and the Howlowist scenario. So, a few years ago, Vladimir Schwarik and myself we constructed an example that shows that this double exponential growth is actually sharp estimate. And in fact, there are solutions which exhibit this double exponential growth for all times. And we constructed a solution in a disk. Solution in a disk, but it's really like any symmetric domain, bounded, symmetric, sufficiently smooth domain, would have worked. And the symmetry we need because we need odd symmetry on the work DCT. And so symmetry is essential part in that construction. And in fact, our work has been motivated by Haulu numerical experiment, which was run just Experiment which was run just maybe a year earlier. And I will say more about this experiment in a minute. But let me make just one comment about the proof in this construction because it will enter as a building block for some models that I'm going to discuss later. And so one of the key observations in this construction of such solutions generating small scales very fast was a result. Very fast was a result that I'm going to call a main lemma. And it's essentially an efficient representation of the Bios-Savar law for certain geometry. So basically, it says that in the velocity, there is something that you can think of as a main term in certain regimes. So there is a Lipschitz part, which appears here, and there And there is a term that potentially has log-Lipschitz behavior that can lead to this double exponential growth, and this is this term. So as support of artisticity approaches the origin, this integral can grow logarithmically in terms of how close support of artisticity gets to the origin. So here this region Q is a quadrant where Y1 is greater than. quadrant where y1 is greater equal than x1 and y2 is greater equal than x2 so it's sort of a look back region and and that's exactly the term that generates double exponential growth in in our examples on the other hand this this term is Lipschitz and the bound on it depends on L-infinity norm of vorticity which is in two dimensions it's it's it's an invariant right so it's not it's not Right, so it's not growing for 2D Euler, and so now let me talk a little bit, and I'm sure many of you have seen this yesterday, but let me describe the Haulu scenario for like their first work. And so this is set in a cylinder, so this is cylinder with the real boundary. Cylinder with the real boundary and with periodic conditions in vertical variable. And so here is a representation of the Euler equation, axisymmetric Euler equation. So it means that all functions are independent of the angle. And so this is one of their representations. So they basically one can think of it that like there are two basic Of it that like there are two basic functions: the angular vorticity and velocity that equation reduces to. And the angular velocity times r so it's called the swirl, the angular velocity, so r times swirl, is just a vector in rz variables. And this is angular vertices divided by r, it's driven by the swirl. And then the U R and UZ can be recovered. R and UZ can be recovered through a version of Biosaurus law from the angular vorticity. So, already now I want to say that essentially when you are far away from the axis, as will be the case in our lost scenario, this is, for example, very similar to the usual Laplacian. So this system actually looks simpler away from the axis. Away from the axis, and I will make it a little bit more precise later. And so the scenario starts with just swirl and with odd symmetry with respect to Z and this swirl, though, generates angular vorticity, as you can see from the equation. And this results in toroidal holes created in the cylinder. So here I pick. I picture a cut of the cylinder, and you see the secondary flow. These are the steroidal rolls, and they create a ring of hyperbolic points on the boundary of the cylinder. And it's exactly near those points that very fast growth of vartistium is observed. Okay, so that's the setup of Haulo's scenario. And you can see that scenario and you can see that basically you know in in the example in 2d that i just described above it's actually very similar geometry so so the the growth happens near hyperbolic point on the boundary and varticity is odd so at least looking at the 2d Euler it's a it's a very interesting scenario for generating small scales of course there is an overall in 2D but but that that looks But that looks interesting. So, I want to do now a little aside. It's just a connection that I wanted to outline. This geometry of Haulow scenario is, of course, fairly special. And there are symmetries, there's axial symmetry, and there is this odd symmetry in Z. But of course, when you're trying to construct a Trying to construct singularity, symmetry is your friend. It helps control the solution, and this has a long history in trying to build singularities for fluid equations, deploying symmetry. But there is some evidence that sort of this type of geometry where this singularity happens is something relatively Relatively typical. There is a paper by Saul and several other authors where they run actually not numerical, but they run physical experiments. They have a cylindrical container and they create statistically axisymmetric flow in it. And there are particles in this container. So they can track these particles using camera. These particles using camera, and they can calculate the velocity field. And then they were interested in characterizing singularities. I mean, they call it singularities, I would call it near singularities, but these are extreme dissipation regions, regions in the flow where a lot of dissipation happens. So basically, the flow is turbulent and there are these extreme. There are this extreme dissipation region where much of dissipation happens, right? If your viscosity is very small, and one of Kolmogorov's postulates on turbulence is that the rate of dissipation stays constant. It doesn't go to zero as viscosity goes to zero. And so to enable this, like in the limit, if we were to go right to Euler, you would need to have outright singularities to have non-energy conserving. On NFH can serve all the solutions. But in a realistic setting, what you have is neosing alities. And so they characterize these events that happen in their experiment. And it turns out that most of them involve exactly colliding masses of fluids with essentially a hyperbolic point somewhere in there. And this is like 75% of extreme dissipation regions that they Extreme dissipation regions that they see. So, of course, these are not as symmetric as Harlow scenario would be, but it's the same, it's a similar type of geometry. And then they have three other types they characterize, but these are more rare. And so, as I mentioned, I want to write a little bit simpler system now so that. So, that we are less distracted by factors of R that appear in the 3D axisymmetric Euler. And so, this is a 2D inviscid-Boussinesque system. It describes buoyant ideal fluid. And in 2D, this is the corresponding picture here. One can take periodic boundary conditions in x direction and Conditions in X direction and boundary, non-penetrating boundary in Y direction. And essentially, it's the picture that we had in 3D axisymmetric Euler, but put on the side. And this cut, just put on the side. And if you look at the systems themselves, they are very similar. So R times swirl is replaced by temperature or density for 2D Business, and essentially. And essentially, this equation is also similar. So, angular vorticity divided by R is replaced by just vorticity. And here we have just Laplacian. And so this is a very similar but simpler looking system. And for this system, global regularity is open. It's well known that this system is closely connected to 3D axis symmetric Euler. And the problem about global regularity of this system also has been mentioned by Judovich as one of the 11 great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics. And it's a little bit easier to think about Bussyinesque, where of course the same scenario, how scenario also applies. And so, in the case of 2D Euler, we have this fairly good control over the solution, which in particular is provided by the main lemma. But if we try to now go ahead and understand rigorously how lost scenario, there are some difficulties that one has to deal with. And one issue is that in the Issue is that in the main lemma, we had these Lipschitz error terms, but they included L-infinity norm of vorticity. And so now, as vorticity doesn't have to be bounded, in fact, we expect that it grows, we no longer able to isolate this main term and say that. Isolate this main term and say that the rest is less important. These error terms can be essential, and so we don't get a simple term, and it's not known, apart from some results that I'll mention later, if there is a main term similar to how you get it in 2D Euler. And also the derivative forcing. So, the derivative forcing that appears here can generate vorticity of different signs. So, in 2D Euler, we could take odd vorticity and take it entirely positive on the left semicircle, negative on the right semicircle, and that comes in very handy in estimates. And so, trying to understand rigorously what happens in Haulu's scenario. Haulu's scenario. Let me give a little overview of what has been done. I will not obviously mention everything, but at least some of the progress. So it started with 1D models. And so here is the system, 1D system. It can be thought of as essentially reducing the Reducing the Bussinesk system to just to the boundary. And of course, when we do that, we need to have some sort of closure for the BSR law, because the velocity on the boundary depends on Vartis everywhere. So we should have some effective closure. And two models that I want to mention is the very first one was the CKY, and it's directly motivated by It's directly motivated by 1D analog of the main lemma, just kind of the 1D analog of the main term that appears there. And then how Lohr model, actually, this one was the very first. It appeared already in the paper with numerical experiment. The CKOR model was first proved rigorously. But this BOSOR law actually can be derived from Can be derived from the Biosava law in the half-plane by assuming that Vorticity only lives in the boundary layer, near the boundary, and in that boundary layer, it's independent of the second variable. So then one can integrate out the second direction and obtain the effective Beer-Sawar law like this. And of course, it's very similar to It's very similar to three, like the analog of the 3D BSLR law, right? I mean, u is one derivative more regular, and there is a singular integral operator here, which is Riet's transform in high dimensions, but 1D, it's a Hilbert transform. And so this is a slight simplification because A will enter, there will be an additional term here, but it's more regular. Term here, but it's more regular, and one can actually show that it doesn't matter for the regularity properties of the model. And so for these two models, it's been proved that they both have finite time blow-up. Okay, and so, in fact, on these models, one can track Models, one can track fairly precisely what happens. And the picture is like just following trajectories in one dimension. And the picture is we start with just density, similarly to the numerical experiment. And this density will generate vorticity, right? The gradient of the density will generate vorticity. So, larger vorticity, if we make this font sharper near the origin, and we can arrange for it to be smaller far away so that these two terms don't, this doesn't interfere much. And then this vacuity, growing vacuity will drive Bios-Savar law and the velocity will drive density towards the origin. And in the process, the gradient will steepen and. And this way it will generate even larger verticality, and then you get a non-linear feedback loop. And essentially, the kind of equation that you get, like if you take characteristics and log of characteristic will satisfy this differential inequality. I'm oversimplifying a little bit. I think it does satisfy this inequality, but the proof is a little bit more. Proof is a little bit more tricky than that, but morally, that's what happens. And this is, of course, very much Boati inequality. So that were a couple of the models. There have been more models considered later, but in all these models, what Either these were one-dimensional models or with quite a bit simplified BSR law. So I also want to mention a series of results, very interesting results that went through a different route, not considering smooth solutions, but rough solutions in this setting. And the first one. And the first works on this were by Elgindi and John, and they looked at the problem with the boundary. They didn't look at the half-plane, they needed to have a little angle at the origin. And Vartisti in their setting is C alpha, essentially with just one point where it's not smooth at the origin. And they prove a local regularity result. Regularity result for certain classes of artistis, which satisfy that. And the geometry of their examples is very similar to Haulow's scenario. It's also like a hyperbolic point at the origin. And they prove blue-up in the sense that L-infinity norm of artisty tends to infinity. And then this approach has been upgraded by Tarekovindi and he put. By Tarekovindi, and he proved singularity formation of axisymmetric 3D Euler with rough artistic without boundary in the whole space. But rough fortistity again is from C alpha plus. And then Chen and Howe have proved the finite time block for C alpha velocity in the exact Howell-Loss scenario, so on from the half-plane. And I think the like I will only. I will only say one comment: that in these works, alpha, the regularity of the vorticity, it plays a role of a small parameter. And so, in some sense, having this small parameter allows to extract, so to say, main term of the dynamics, which is sufficiently simple to perform rigorous analysis, although Rigorous analysis, although it's not really simple, but at least amenable to rigorous analysis. And so now I want to talk about joint work with Simine Ho that we recently, just this and last year, produced. So, what we tried to do is to build kind of next. Kind of next-order model and Richer model for evolution of smooth solutions and to understand the role played by two-dimensionality. So in 1D models, essentially, you can think of it as you disregard dependence on the second variable, kind of short-circuited. But realistically, the singularity happens in a, like if you look at the simulation, it happens in a thin bound. It happens in a thin boundary layer. And in this boundary layer, one effect that is present and potentially it could work to deplete nonlinearity is shear. So the velocity that drives the vorticity towards the origin where it grows and it creates singularity, this hyperbolic velocity, it's generally can decay. Can decay as you move into half plane. And so we wanted to get a feel for this effect and how important it can be. Can it really deplete the singularity or one can still overcome it? And so the model, I will discuss two models. And the first one is very simple, toy model. Model. But we designed it to get at least some feel for how this may be regularizing, this shear effect. And so in this model, and in fact in both models, we will disregard U2. So U2 will be zero. So one can think of this as a remnant of one-dimensionality where we don't have Where we don't have U2. Or we can think of it as: okay, so U2 makes the model no longer, if there's no U2, it's no longer compressible, of course. But this compression that we observe in U1, it roughly corresponds to exactly U2 taking things out. So maybe it's not a dramatic oversimplification. We still have some essential. To have some essential phenomena in our model. And so the BRSMR law for U1, explicit law, is written right here. Okay, and so basically in this law, again, it's intuitive, so it's just heuristics, but the negative terms are the ones that Terms are the ones that tend to push the blow up, right? So I think I have two minuses here. So this should have been plus, okay? Or I should have been minus in front of I. So this is a negative term and this is a negative term. And so they tend to push towards the origin, but there is also positive part and it exactly becomes pronounced. Becomes pronounced, like if singularity happens near boundary, then for larger values of vertical variable, this singularity will be pushing us back. And so that's what potentially can create this regularizing effect. And so to capture this effect in very, very simple terms, we'll drop the second term in this piosama. Second term in the SPO-SML law because it's always negative. So it's always, so to say, a friend of singularity. And then we can also compute the vorticity just by following trajectories. And after putting this back into the Eusava law and some simplifications, we get the following system on the integral of this expression i. Of this expression i. So this is just the expression in the ausseval law. And we also ignore all dependence on x1 in denominators. So i will now only depend on x2. And so e to the minus g can be thought of as location of the front. And so g location of the vartisti support. And so as g goes to infinity, that actually means that that blow-up happens. That blow-up happens. And this is now a very simple model. It's very much simplified, but it can be analyzed fairly precisely now, because this G will be linear in X2. So one can think of it as a sort of next order model. Like we don't take constant things in the second variable, but we look at the linear part. And essentially, And essentially, we can write it as a linear function and just analyze its coefficients and how they depend on time. And what we find is that this model will be globally regular in the sense that G will not get to infinity in finite time. In fact, B will grow linearly in time and A will grow logarithmically in time. And so A exactly describes. And so A exactly describes how quickly we approach the origin because the front is E minus G. So the front will go like something like T minus one third towards the origin at a power rate very slowly. But on the other hand, it will also be washed out very quickly. So it will be a very, very thin filament approaching the origin in this model, because this grows like time. And so when we exponentiate this, So, when we exponentiate this for the front, it will be something like E minus something like this. And so, this will be very, very right. I mean, the shear will thin out this filament at a very fast rate. And we will have a very thin filament approaching the origin and never getting there. And so, this is a very simplified. This is a very simplified model, but it shows that there is this effect that one has to contend with if you want to try to derive some estimates of who will blow up in this case. And so now the second model that we do is a bit more sophisticated. So we still make some simplifications, of course. U2 is still zero, and we replace draw. And we replace the derivative of rho with the mean field term. But u1 now is something on the boundary. So this term is motivated by main lemma. Again, we've ignored dependence on x1 on the boundary. But on the boundary, the derivative of u1 with respect to x2 variable is exactly vertices due to boundary condition, right? Because u2 just vanishes. Because u2 just vanishes on the boundary, then swirl, sorry, not swirl, curl, the vorticity is just dx2 u1. And we use this to extrapolate this into the bulk. So again, it's a sort of linear approximation, right? We move linearly into the bulk of the fluid. And for this, And for this model already, which is a bit more careful, although it still has this shear effect and still has this depletion associated with shear washing away the Vertisti support approaching the origin. Here we do get a finite time blow-up. And basically, Um, the initial condition leading to finite time blow up is just a kind of a front, right? So, this is the derivative of the density, initial vorticity is just zero for simplicity. And then to prove these results, we analyze the system in Lagrangian coordinates. And it's And it's fairly not straightforward, but in the end, the kind of differential equation that we get is that, so if we denote this main term in the Bios-Sava law on the boundary, and we kind of take a trajectory essentially on the boundary. Essentially, on the boundary associated with this main term, and then we integrate this trajectory. Then, for this quantity, we get the differential inequality, which is quadratic for the derivative. And so this will, of course, lead to finite time blow-up. Okay, so in some sense, these two models show that this shearing effect that you don't see Effect that you don't see in one dimension. It potentially can be problematic for singularity formation in this system. But in more accurate model, right, I mean, in the toy model, you see this effect very clearly and it results in global regularity. But in more accurate and more delicate model, the finite time block still prevails. And so And so, of course, this is still some distance from the real system. And in that case, the rigorous analysis still trails behind miracle experiments, the wonderful new numerical experiments that Tom described yesterday, which also show something very likely to look like singularity formation for the equation near the axis and just Near the axis and just the miss for Navier-Stokes equation. But so for the original How-Lord scenario, it does look very promising in the sense that every model suggests a finite time block except the very toy one. But yeah, the question is still open. And I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you for the Okay, thank you for the very interesting talk. Are there any questions? Can I? Yeah, please. Okay. So very, very, very interesting talk. Do you have any information or or something you expect specifically about blow up rates? specifically about blow-up rates in the, I mean, more precise blow-up rates in these last results? Well, analytically, right here, we get this differential inequality. So you could say something based on that. But we don't have full confidence that it's optimal inequality. So it's a lower bound. Lower bound. So, in this sense, I think that like numerical experiments, of course, provide more intuition about what can happen. And there you can see what the blow-up rate appears to be. Of course, as usual, in numerical experiments, the drawback is that you don't know for sure, almost no, but they look very, very high quality. Look very, very high quality and extremely careful and very convincing. But until you prove it, you don't know for sure. Okay, thank you. Shasha, this is a very interesting talk. This is Tom Howe here. A very nice survey. And you also done something on the 2D model, right? The last two models, 2D model, right? The last two models you mentioned, is it 1D or 2D? I think the last model is 2D, yeah. So the last two models are 2D, and I don't know what they can think of as next, can be thought of as next order models, because we extrapolate objects linearly into the bulk, as opposed to saying, okay, we have a boundary layer where vorticity is constant. We say that either velocity is... Either velocity is linear in x2, with kind of just we know what derivative is on the boundary and we extrapolate it up linearly. Or in the case of the first toy model, we make an assumption on how the front looks. Okay, it is 2D, but actually, it's only valid near the boundary layer. You have a very special 2D structure. That's right. Yeah, it's kind of linear. That's right. Yeah, it's kind of linear approximation. Not a constant, but a linear approximation. Right, right. But what about energy? Does it still have finite energy? Because you have a finite cutoff, maybe that maintain the finite energy? Yeah, so I think that these models, they are fairly. Let me think about it for a second. Since we dropped the second component, there will not be a conservation law, right? Energy will not be conserved, but I don't think it can grow. I would have to think of it. I mean, the BOCR law is a model, so I cannot be too sure about that. But I would be surprised, right? Because it's of the right order. So I would expect that you probably. That you probably for the energy, you have sufficient control, but that's a very good question. I will check more carefully. What about incompressibility? Is that by setting U2 to zero, do you violate incompressibility as well? Yeah, yeah, of course. It's like, you know, in 1D models, you also lose incompressibility. And by dropping U2, you also lose it. But we keep U1 exactly as it is in the system. In the system. So U1 will feature some compression, but since it's exactly the same as in the system, one can think that this compression corresponds to U2 washing out. But this is, of course, just an excuse, right? It's a model. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, let's move on to the next sort of. Let's move on to the next. Let me again thank Alex for a bit of luck and then to keep on schedule.
