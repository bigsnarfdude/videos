Okay, guys, can you all see? Yes, maybe you need full screen mode. Sure. Like that? Guys, can you see it? Yes, yes. Okay. So the topic of my today's presentation is cross-frequency coupling framework in brain networks of epileptic patients. Patients. Should do this, I guess. So, I'm going to discuss what is cross-frequency coupling, present our data, give a brief overview of the metrics we have used and camp on one specific metric, and then present the results. So, for the introduction, what is cross-frequency coupling? Cross-frequency coupling is interaction. Cross-frequency coupling is interaction between oscillations at different frequency bands of brain signals. So to start, natural brain frequencies. So our brain operates at certain frequencies. These frequencies, alpha, beta, theta, delta, and gamma are each responsible for a particular physiological role. For example, alpha frequency is more active at the reflexive, rest. Reflexive restful state and gamma frequency is more active in a focused mode. So, cross-frequency coupling is when the two signals or the different frequency bands of one signal interact with one another. So, how it graphically is represented is: say, when you have two signals here, one is low frequency and one is high frequency. And one is high frequency, if there is no coupling in between them, these signals do not correlate. There is nothing in common, no common spikes at a certain places. They just look independent. However, in the presence of coupling, here at this picture, I don't know if you can see my mouse, we see the high-frequency spikes coincide with low-frequency signal spikes. The types The types of cross-frequency coupling include phase amplitude coupling. It's when the phase of a low-frequency signal modulates the amplitude of high-frequency signal. Also, amplitude-amplitude coupling and phase-phase coupling. Chris and I were studying, Chris, Elena, Daniel and I were studying phase amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling. So cross-frequency coupling is well studied. Is well studied. Well, it's well studied. However, there is more information to follow about the physiological roles. So far, it's found that it plays a role in memory function. It also plays a role in communicating distant areas of the brain. And it provides a mechanism, PAC provides a mechanism for spatial exploration and visual. Spatial exploration and visual perception. And what we focused upon was that possibly, potentially, it plays a predictive role in epileptic seizures. So for the data, we were very fortunate to have four data sets coming from two patients. So for the first patient, we had two data sets, and for the second patient, we had two data sets. For the first patient, we have First patient, we had a data set for the focal bilateral tonic clonic seizure, which is an active seizure, and the impaired awareness seizure, which is a quiet seizure often that goes unnoticed even by the patient itself. So here is the configuration of electrodes schematically shown on the human brain. For the second patient, also we had focal bilateral toniclonic seizure data set. Toniclonic seizure data set as well as impaired awareness seizure data set and the electrode configuration according to the brain regions. For the metric, we used modulation index, phase login value, and generalized linear model out of all the possible metrics that have been so far studied in terms of cross-frequency coupling. So, we're going to briefly discuss modulation index and phase lock index. Modulation index and phase login value, and then we're going to be more detailed on generalized linear model. The algorithm of approaching work with data for us started with taking a raw signal and then splitting it into two signals: a low frequency band signal and a high frequency band signal. Then we would apply here. We would apply Hilbert transform to these two signals we obtained to extract instantaneous phase and instantaneous amplitude. For the low frequency signal, we extracted instantaneous phase. For the high frequency signal, we extracted instantaneous amplitude. For the modulation index, after the two steps that I just described, we created composite time series. So we correspond. So we corresponded Phyllo the phase of low frequency signal with amplitude of high frequency signal. Then we would bin the low frequency signal data into N beans and we would compute the average of amplitude of the high frequency signal for every beam. After that, we would create a distribution. So we would take the ratio. So, we would take the ratio of the average of the high-frequency signal to their sums. And in this manner, we created a distribution that is a positive with all the values summing up to one. So, it characterized normalized amplitude as a discrete density probability function. So, since it behaved as a distribution, we could apply the theory. Um, the theory of distributions to it. In fact, we did apply the Kullback-Labor divergence, which is the measure that computes the distance or the difference between our distribution and the uniform distribution. And this difference divided by log n was the modulation index that we computed that measured. Index that we computed that measured the cross-frequency coupling. So that was the method number one. For the method number two, the phase locking value, we did not, for that method, we did not split the signal between the two. We were looking at how the phases of two different signals communicate. So for that particular algorithm, we would not split the signal into two. We would just take instantaneous phases and instantaneous amplitude. An instantaneous amplitude by applying the Hilbert transform and create analytic signals. And after that, we would compute the POV, which stands for phase lock-in value, through the differences in instantaneous phases. And again, we would measure this numerically. And if this index PLV, if it equals to one, it means that the phases are completely phase-locked. And if it equals The phase locked, and if it equals to zero, it means that they do not communicate. So, for the generalized linear model, why we use generalized linear model? Well, one of the reasons is it works well with gamma distribution. And gamma distribution is the distribution that, well, somewhat closely resembles the distribution of a human brain. So for the GLM, we used amplitude as the response variable and the phase as the predictor variable, which means that we're going to approximate amplitude by the function of phase. So for the gamma distribution, again, it provides a good fit for human data. And here is a sample of our data which we took, which was gamma distributed, as you can see. Distributed as you can see. So the GLM algorithm goes like this. First, we filter the data again into frequency bands, high and low. Then we apply the Hilbert transform. Next, we use the link function of amplitude to approximate sorry, we use the amplitude. Link function of amplitude is approximated by the spline functions of phase of the low frequency signal. Phase of the low frequency signal. As Pline functions are third-order piecewise connected polynomials, then compute the parameter R, which is the numerical measure of CFC, and confidence interval for the robustness of the procedure. So we here assume two models, a new model in the in the present in the In the absence of coupling, and the spline model in the presence of coupling. This formula here connects the mu parameter, which indicates the amplitude, with the functions of the phyllo, the phase. In the case of null model, nu is average amplitude across the phases, and fk are all constants, and we just have one coefficient. In the case of SPLINE model, In the case of spline model, we have amplitude dependent on phase, and we have spline functions which are not constants. And these spline functions are determined through control points, which we compute through AIC criterion. So we define how many control points we need by the number which minimizes. By the number which minimizes the AIC. So it minimizes the spread. Then we compute this R parameter as the maximum of absolute value of the difference of F ratio A spline, which is amplitude in assumption of the presence of coupling, to A null, which is amplitude in assumption of the absence of coupling. And then we determine a confidence interval through Confidence interval through the bootstrap procedure. So here we have three types of coupling presented mathematically. The phase amplitude coupling is just what we discussed. In case of amplitude-amplitude coupling, we do not have spline functions, we just have two coefficients, and we have a relation of the logarithm of mu, which represents. Which represents the amplitude of high frequency to the amplitude of low frequency. And we have a formula which combines both. So we can actually numerically measure phase amplitude and operated coupling at the same time. So, how it's done numerically? Practically, we compute surfaces. So, we fix one parameter. Fix one parameter and we compute the other two while one is fixed and we create lines and from these lines we create surfaces. And then we take surface coefficients and we compute RPAC and RAC through the ratio of the surface coefficients. So here are our results. For the synthetic data, we took pink. The synthetic data, we took pink noise because it's somewhat closer to the natural brain signal, and we filtered this noise into high and low, and then we computed this coupling. So, as you can see, in the presence of no coupling, we have these surfaces coincided. They're not connected, they don't affect each other. In the presence of phase amplitude coupling, we have one of the surfaces remaining. One of the surfaces remains unaffected while the other two tilt. And again, in the presence of AC coupling only, it is a different picture. And then when we have both coupling represented, we have all three surfaces correlating with one another. So, for the results for our data set, here is an actual An actual AG data mapped in MATLAB by the brain region. So what we have done here, we took one signal and then we took four time windows before, during, at offset of the seizure and after the seizure. And for every time window, we computed phase amplitude. Phase amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling. So, we cannot establish a pattern here because these are just four windows. However, we can conclude that the presence of both phase amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling was detected throughout the duration of the signal. So, what we have done next, we analyzed in such a manner numerically. numerically the numerical measure of PAC for every signal in every time window. And we measured it in three metrics, which is the GLM metric, MI metric, and PLV metric. So these are all three metrics to measure cross-frequency coupling. And as you can see, we see definite intense rise in CFC throughout. In CFC throughout the section of noise and right at the offset after the seizure. So, for the second data set, which is a toniclonic seizure for the second patient, so this how colorful the MATLAB mapped EEG data looks. And again, what we have done, first we took one signal and then we took four weeks. And then we took four weeks before, during, right at offset, and after the seizure, we measured PAC and AAC, and we detected the presence of both PAC and AAC in these four windows. Then again, we have measured, we have analyzed all the brain signals of our data for every time window we had. Time window we had, and we computed the CFC measure numerically in three metrics, and we compared it. So, again, as we can see, these three metrics behave similarly, and they intensify at the onset of the seizure, and the intensity goes down after the offset. So, then we went a bit further. So then we went a bit further and we decided to analyze cross-frequency coupling not only within each signal, as we have done before, except for the PLD metric when we just looked at the phases, but here we decided to apply the CFC metrics to the brain signals across all brain. So we took different signals from different parts of the brain and we saw, like, we just looked at how low. Looked at how low frequency part of one signal corresponds to the high frequency part of another signal. And what we have done, as here you can see one pixel of every picture here represents the numerical value of R, which is a CFC measure, for two different signals at a different window moment of time. Moment of time. And for the pre-ictal phase, we can see that there was some intensity in CFC. We see the higher intensity throughout the ictal phase, and we see lower intensity at offset at post-iectal. So, what this picture here represents, it practically shows us that throughout the seizure, during the ictal window, throughout the seizure, Throughout the seizure, the cross-frequency coupling numerical measure rises throughout the whole brain. So the whole brain, the frequencies, different frequency bands of the whole brain of the different signals communicate with each other. So here is the picture of the FBTCS2 data set between the FITA and gamma frequency bands, and we called it cross-level. And we called it cross-electrode coupling. And here is also the MVPCS2 data set, and this time it's beta and gamma cross-electrode coupling. And here is the bibliography. Okay, I'm done. Thank you.
