This is a joint work with Melanie Bertelson, and I speak of this construction of conformal symplectic structures. Well, personally, I don't like much locally conformal symplectic structures. It's a little heavy. And I agree that it's a little more correct than conformal symplectic structures. Symplectic structures, but maybe I will say conformal symplectic structures where we would say locally. So the theorem is as follows. So it's on Closma defaults, it's real, it's a very real thing. So a close to unmanufactured. So, a closed 2n manifold, and on which you take one form, which will be the leaf form, of course, closed one form, and you assume that it is not exact. Exact. In fact, this construction will give conformal symptomatic structures in all cases, but the exact case that is, but the case where we would be trying to build some genuine symplectic structure. And so also So also the base, at least we need that M has at least one non-degenerate to form. For example, if M is a complex manifold, it's done. So let me call it omega to the A. A is for almost. I think of it as an almost conformal syntax structure. Formal syntax structure is just a two-form which is non-degenerate. Then there exists an M to form omega. Which is which is eta closed, that is where d eta is the usual differential somehow twisted. Yes, thank you. And so this is the first property. The second property is that so omega is non-degenerate. Is non-degenerate and is homotopic to the given one omega A as a non-degenerate form and so this this means that in particular So, in particular, omega is a conformal symplectic structure of Lee form eta. This is followed from I and I, and moreover, you can prescribe. You can prescribe since eta is a closed-band form, we have this Novikov cohomology, which gives the cohomology of the Which is the cohomology of the differential operator d to d eta. And you can describe the class of omega, you can prescribe the class of omega as in this Novikov cohomology so that's the theorem Sorry, just one quick question. Having this non-degenerate two-form omega A is the same as having almost complex structure topologically? Yes. So sorry, you could take omega equal to omega r. Omega R no, because omega R is not supposed to be closed, eta closed. It's just a non-degenerate form. For example, if you m is a complex manifold, you take any Hermitian metric and you take its imaginary part. But of course, it's not eta-closed. Okay. Okay, to be clear. That's typically an H principle. You start from a data which is omega A, which is easy to find because there is no integrability prescription, no holonomy, as one says sometimes prescription. One says sometimes prescription, and then you deform it, you deform it in its homotopy class until it becomes integrable, which here means deta closed. Okay, so what was known before is there's three. This result of Elias Berg and Murphy, which is the same thing, but in a special case. The case where eta is a large multiple of an integral one form, one one of rank one. So I mean, the class of eta. So, say the class of eta over C is an integral cohomology class for some positive large constancy. I mean Large constancy. I mean, so the let me insist a little with this construction. So this is H1 of M, a real vector space, finite dimensional. It comes with It comes with a lattice of integral points, the clusters which are integrable. And so the Ellen-Berg-Murphy case says, so this is zero. If you take a rational line, a rational real line. Rational real line, then on for every point, every point far away from zero on this line is realizable as a leaf form, as a leaf form of a conformable symplectic structure. And we do all the points except zero. Okay. So the proof, I will essentially give the ideas of the proof. Well, the proof is uses a curve. The proof is uses essentially applies to powerful tools, which are the Bohemian agent but Murphy eight principle for other twisted contact structures. And the second tool that we use, which is very powerful, is the Eaton-Murphy simpletization of copper dismantle. Okay, so we shall apply to this well so good to Well, so to begin the proof, I will first make there is an obvious and well-known little trick I have to do this so the So, the exact case is enough. If you can do the exact case, that is, in this anode class of non-degenerate two forms, you have found. two forms you have found omega with class of omega which in zero in the novikov chromology then it's obvious to realize all the other ones for any class for any novicov class Class for only Nabikov class of degree two, say the class of a two form which is the form the class of a form P of course there is this little trick that you you you take P plus k time. plus k times omega with a large k large real positive k and then this this solves the class of a mechanical this is obviously cohomogose to to p and non-degenerate And non-degenerate, since omega is non-degenerate for k large, it becomes much bigger than p okay. So we are reduced, of course, to the exact case, or maybe we could say the Italiouville case. So, actually, we look So, actually, we look now for one form such that its eta differential is non-degenerate and belongs. And belongs and is homotopic to the given one omega a as a non-degenerate to four. So we're looking for a kind of Liouville form, but except that it's not its differential, it's the eta differential. So I can call it the eta uvil form. So now we know what we are looking for. Let us first make a few remarks on the supposing that the problem is solved, what is how to think geometry. How to think geometrically and locally of such a form. What is the geometric the local geometry of a italy will form and And I take it in, I think, really local in a small open set and in a small open set where it does not vanish. Of course, there is, so it's much like, it's much like in the classical standard genuine case of a dual form. Case of a dual form, of the genuine Leuville form, because everything, since you're in the small open set, eta has a primitive there. And so up to a conformal rescaling, almost everything becomes genuinely juvenile, genuinely synthetic. So first of all, you have a vector field which is kind of dual. Vector field, which is kind of dual, which is a kind of eta-liu-ville vector field, which is the one such that zotta lambda equals lambda, and it generates a foliation. Of dimension one called characteristics and actually you have what is called for the the camel see Of the lambda, which is a hyperplane field, is what is called an even contact structure it's it's a maximal it's a maximally non-non-definitely. Non-integrable hyperplay field in even dimension. And it's lambda wedge d lambda d eta lambda to be n minus one is non-definitely. It's not zero and its kernel is easy, and you have in fact you have a one-dimensional fadiation which is transversely contact. contact that is some someone it is said that lambda that one has a basic contact structure that is locally This is these verticals of the falliation, the characteristic foliation Z. This is the vector field Z. So lambda contains Z. So C, sorry, Xi contains Z and X is actually locally the pullback of a Of a contact structure on this disk, which is a D to the which is a D to the 2n minus 1. So, this is what you have luckily. This even contact structure, and there is one more. So reciprocally, if you are given such an even contact structure, there is a condition that lambda is actually eta-uvil. In the classical non-twisted case, the condition is that eta is, you can say it like this. You consider Can say it like this. You consider the function key to the lambda, such as that lead derivative of lambda along z is e to the lambda times lambda. And so the condition that lambda is eta-luid is just. is just that this kilometer is larger than the function with eta of z. The function kilamda must be everywhere larger than the function which is eta against the vector field C. So that's that's the object That's that the object, the local description of the object we are looking for globally, except that it can have zeros, but the description outside from the zeros. Sorry, I'm confused. So, Z is defined because lambda is italyville, right? Right, right, right. So, I don't understand. Right, right. So I don't understand this like L, like being etaluvil if and only it's a little it's a little short. If you have an even contact structure and you fix arbitrarily a non-singular vector field Z generating the characteristic variation. Okay. You have a key that. You have a key, then you have a key lambda for your form lambda, which depends on the choice you made of G. And lambda is eta u v if and only if this k lambda is larger than eta of g okay okay in fact yeah yeah it's it's a little not clear because in fact k to the d lambda also depends on z okay So now there is a very, a very, very naive idea to get such a luxury form. Globally and M. Well, a fixed MOS function, just a little like in the Stein case, fix a MOS function F and M and And look for et al Yuville vector field as our preceding Z Among the pseudo gradients, the gradients like vector fields. So, this extremely naive program works, of course, very well apart from the singularities. But at the singularity of the critical points, namely thinking to a level to a level set of F. So, first of all, there is There is a hyperplane. There is naturally a hyperplane field, a homotopy class of hyperplane fields on every level set by introducing in the form omega A. Any gradient Z. So, this the kernel gives you a hyperplane field on the level set. And this hyperplane field is not only a hyperplane field, it's also almost symplectic. There is by restriction of omega A. So, this. So, this is the formal data to make a contact structure on the level set. And by the Bormann-Evielberg-Murphy H principle for over-twisted contact structure, there exists an over-twisted contact structure. An overtwisted counter structure C to dt on every level set F minus one of T and you can have you can make it very smoothly with the level T and so this is almost all we need because moreover Moreover, by so it depends mostly on T by Gray's theorem. A one parameter family of contact structures is always given by an isotopy. So this says that if you choose well To choose well the direction of Z gradient, pseudo-gradient vector field, its flow will preserve the family City. This is great because now you have this. You can define a hyperplane field in M, which is this CT sum Z. And you have this even counter structure. Contrast structure and so there is this growth this growth you need this growth property, this growth condition to make any lambda defining C into so now you take lambda defining C, you have Lambda defining C, you have this growth condition to make it eta UV, but it's easy because as the epsilon gradient has no dynamics, you can choose lambda to grow faster than the function. What was it? What was it? Z of eta, or eta of z. I don't think of that. Okay, so of course, this is a very naive attempt because we shall have little problems to extend this around the critical points.  So consider the critical point of index I. So we have two kinds of difficulties, which of course are enormous. The first one is that so for the for the indices the For the indices, the intermediate indices, not local extreme. Well, a Leuvel pseudo gradient. So in a neighborhood of a critical point C, if we are in a small neighborhood, eta has a primitive there, and so after And so, up to conformally scaling, we're looking for a genuine Liouville form. So, it is well known that a Liuville pseudo gradient can exist only if the index. If the index is at most m, this is the Weinstein construction of dual handles. But if we accept that That lambda is that to have a vector field which is a Louis vector field but not episode gradient, a more complicated thing in a small neighborhood of C's, then the simplicization of comports will furnish that. Let's Let's consider the standard neighborhood of the critical point. So it's a handle with chopped corners. Like this, the usual drawing so So, pseudo-gradient close to the boundary will be like this. Aha, yes, oh, yes. I'm used to negative pseudo-gradients. So, the entry set will be here, the exist set will be there. And it will be tangential to these small boundaries of neighborhoods of the corners. Okay, this is the usual drawing. So The usual drawing. So the simplestization of cobalt theorem of Elijah Bern Murphy tells me that there is a complicated UVL form inside. Genuine you will form such that the close close to the boundary, Z will be epsilogradiant like the one. Be a pseudo-gradient like the one I've drawn, but inside it will not be, it will be very complicated. And moreover, so such a structure, of course, makes the exit set and the entry set put on them a contact structure, which is just Which is just which is given by the interior product of Z with the simplicity form. And moreover, all these contact structures on the entry set and the exit set are over twisted on each connected component if there are several connected components. Of simple connected. Well, this is this theorem of syntactization of couples. The essential thing here to apply the theorem is that the entry set and the exit set are both non-empty. So Once you have this, you have to glue it as a small in the as a small neighborhood of the contact of the critical point. So if v is the critical value, so here is f minus one of v minus epsilon, there also, and that is f minus one of the plus epsilon there also. An important point is that all the contact structures that I have on the sets and on the boundaries of H are overtwisted. So after this unicity part This unicity part in the theorem in the H principle for other twisted contact structures I can glue and if I multiply this lambda in H by a sufficiently large constant a real constant I the They or maybe sufficiently small. Excuse me, I have a question. So why don't you just directly apply the Elias Berg Murphy to the wall? Why do you have to go to the handle and just don't look at the two-level set in between? You're very right. You're very right. It would be even simpler. Because I'm also preparing the things for the second part where I will do the same in a foliated situation where, well, if I have some time, we'll see. It's a good question, yes. Even more simple. Simple. Okay, so the real point is for local extreme extraction. So we consider a local extremon. And of course, I'm in a very, very bad situation, it seems, because also, so it's uh also so it's i repeat that since it's no ball uh looking for etal uvil form is a month to look for uril form and uh so close to the minimum close to the local minimum i'm looking yes my episode gradients are descending so i'm looking for a genuine juville vector field Vector field entering a ball and which exists also inside the ball. And of course, this does not exist. A vector field expanding a volume form and entering a ball. And entering a ball, it's very difficult. And close to a local maximum, a priori, the situation could look better because I'm looking forward. You will back to field hitting outside the ball, but unfortunately, also recall that the. So, recall that the level sets, all the level sets of F are over-twisted. So, here I have an over-twisted contact structure on the boundary. And such a situation, of course, does not exist by the Elgeberg form of And that a convex boundary is not overtwisted. So this is where the where the where the fact that we have that we are in that eta is non-exact will save us. Savers of looking for a function f which is actually Norse, we shall make a function f whose local extrema are circles around Botmore's function. And so instead of this of this ball, there will be d to the 2n minus 1 process 1, a solid torus of dimension 2n and layer the sigma. And I can arrange that this local extrema of F have are circles of critical points which are on which I can choose that the integral of eta is large. Or maybe it has to be largely negative. I guess I think so. I will see the order of magnitude which is necessary further, and I can take a loop in M which makes a lot of terms. So the integral of eta is large and make, of course, a function such that this will be the minimum and the same for the maximum. So the last so the last So, the last part of the construction of a etaduvil form in a solid travus. So I'll denote by digita the volume form on S1. The lemmas say that there is We must say that there exists a constant depending only on the dimension, such that for every large constant, so that for every larger Larger C there exists a minus C eta. So this will be my eta. It's not the volume form from the circle, it's a large negative multiple. Um on T such that the corresponding Lu Vigen vector field is transverse to the boundary. You can choose it to to exit or to enter, both work. To enter both words, and that the so the so lambda on the boundary is a contact form who argue that it is over twisted and moreover actually. Actually Z is G theta of Z is positive. So this is exactly what we need. It will be our kind of symplectic caps. Of course, this is very special to conformal symplectic structure. This is the little object that would not exist. Not exist in the symplectic world. Let me give an idea of the construction. It will be again an application of the eight principles for over-twisted contact structures. So I'm thinking of mine Solitaurus first of all, by so let's say that, for example. For example, we want a vector field that enters. So, first of all, by the H principle for over-twisted contact structures, we have an over-twisted contact structure. On the boundary, which is in the formal homotopy class of the interior product of such an entering vector field with omega A. And so we can so we choose rather arbitrarily Rather arbitrarily our vector field positive with respect to digital and entering everywhere. And by pushing, by pushing a little this over-twisted contact structure inside, we already have an even contact structure on a neighborhood of the boundary, on a small colour neighborhood of the boundary. On a small colour neighborhood at the moment. But then, in particular, on each of the disks, we have an over-twisted contact structure on a colour neighborhood of the boundary of the disk, which is pushed from the boundary. And by the by the H principle for By the H principle for over-twisted contact structures, it extends to the interior. So just a little as we did with the level sets of F, but no, instead it is the disks. We have on every disk, theta, a contact structure depending on theta, and just as before. The vector field Z extends so that by gray, by Gray's theorem, it extends so that it preserves this family of upper twisted contact structures on the disks. And so we have an even contact structure inside the terrace with. With this characteristic foliation, well, probably the dynamics of Z in the interior of the solidarity is very complicated. But the important thing is that it is transverse to the disks. And now We consider any form lambda which defines this even contact structure and we have this k lambda this function k lambda says that L Z lambda equals zero. Z lambda equals q lambda lambda and we consider the function k lambda and it has a minimum so if we if if the constant c is large enough it is larger than minus minus k d theta of z I think this is a positive function so you choose C a large constant C so that K lambda is larger than minus C d det and you have the growth condition and so lambda is eta U ville Eta durial form where eta it is that's all well I shall yes I shall no I shall not stop here I will just say question but actually it's Jash Bergen Elias Berge, who asked this question in view of this result, which is a kind of program, maybe. Well, it's clear that I have work in the flexible world and so the The first part of the question is: Is there for conformal symplectic structure a dichotom overtwisted vs tout in some sense just like Just like for contact structures, so that the over-twisted one will be in the flexible world and the taut ones in the rigid world. And if yes, if so, if they just as for Just as for contact structures, it's a full H principle for over-twisted conformal symplectic structures in particular. In particular, unicity optuizotopin okay, so this was Joshua's questions and uh. And I think that there are good questions. There has been some, so it was asked in our March workshop. And I think that some people have thought about it. I don't know what the status is of these questions now. This is the This is the end of this talk. Thank you.
