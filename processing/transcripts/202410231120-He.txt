So, this is the work mainly done by my former PhD student, Wang Ching-hu. And he is now a postdoc at South Tech and also in Shenzhen, another university. So the title of my talk is about modeling and simulation for Vascular and Geophysical Dynamics by immersive method. And here, this is the outline of my talk. this is the outline of my talk. First, I will give the basic introduction and then I will mainly present two works done by my student and one is by using the inverse monitoring method for simulate the deformable memory problem and mainly we are trying to develop the energy stable method, the energy stable inverse monitoring method for simulate this problem. And secondly, we are trying to use this inverse funnel method for simulate the thermal migration The thermal migration of stephagnent linen droplets. And finally, if time loss, I will also discuss the actual dynamics of this surfactant linen viscoelastic thread, but study the effect of the viscous elasticity induced by the surfactant. So here, let me basically give the introduction first. And actually, these vessels, they will always have this thin and flexible membranes. Membranes and these membranes are widely appeared in biology and in biomechanics, such as this red black cell. So, for these cells, usually it will have this little bilayers and it has this memory and it plays important role in human body. So, in blood flow, they have a lot of these blood cells. So, similarly, the blood cells is actually quite important in any. Important in engineering applications. And not only that, actually, the motion of the droplets and bubbles also play an important role. And to manipulating these droplets and bubbles, they are fundamental in microfluidic devices and inkjet printing. And usually, temperature gradient are widely used to manipulate this droplet, to migrate these droplets. The many important factors, they can be infilled. they can be influenced the droplet migration. For instance, the rheology property of this fruit and also the surfactant usually will be used to manipulate this droplet and also the size and shape of these droplets. And regarding to the reality property of the fluid, usually the fluids will be classified into two groups. One is the Newtonian fluid, that will be non-Newtonian fluid. So the Newtonian fluid So the Newtonian fluid and the non-neutronic fluid basically have different behaviors. The non-neutronic fluid usually behaves much complicated comparing to the neutronic fluids. So for instance, here, for non-neutronic fluids, usually it will have this so-called Weissenberg phenomenon or this load clamming phenomena. So if you have a cup of water here, that's what we neutronic fluid. If you have put a load there, you rotate it, then the fluid will be move away from this load. Uh, move away from this load. So, this would be so-called like this convex shape. Or here, if you have this load, you put it into the polymer fluid, then you rotate it, then the fluid we are trying to clamp up with this with load. So, this is called the Weisenberger phenomenon. And also for non-Newtonian fluids, usually it will also have so-called dash-wheel phenomena. So, if you have this Newtonian fluid in some cube, if you're pulling it out, then in the you're pulling it out then in the downstream the radius of this fluid would be similar as this uh of as this tube so this uh the the radius will usually not become large however for polymer fluids if we're pulling it out then in this downstream then the radius will become large so this kind of phenomenon is called dice wear phenomenon and not only that also the surfer is widely used to manipulate this trophy To manipulate these droplets. So the surfactant are usually have this hydrophilic tear and hydrophobic tear and hydrophilic head. They can absorb into the interface. And this can actually reduce interfacial tension and give rise to the so-called melagon effect. And not only that, the recent research states that under the suffragant actually they are aggregate on the interface. They can On the interface, they can give rise to the so-called surface stress tensor, which is also important to affect the dynamics of the fluids. And also, in flow mechanics, there are another phenomena which relate to liquid thread or liquid jet is related to the so-called relay plateau instability. So, if we have this long and thin thread, it will break up into small pieces, break up into small Small pieces, break up into small droplets. And this size of droplet would be related to many industry applications, such as inkjet printing. So when this ink pulling out the nosome, then the thread will pinch off into small pieces, and there will be have some radio droplets and satellite droplets. So from an engineering point of view, how to eliminate these satellite droplets would be greatly important. That's actually related to the product or the quality of the The product, the quality of this product. So that's like actually the basic introduction. So now, let me just present the first work we have done related to the membrane or this vascular dynamics. So here, let me just review a little bit about in this direction using in-mouth-bound method for simulating the vascular dynamics. Indeed, in the later video, there are a lot of the works, and also Professor John Stoger is here. Professor John Stoger is here, and he has done some work in this direction. And also, Professor Mingji Lai has a series of papers in this direction. So now for us here, we're trying to consider this deformable memory problem with elasticity and with bending in two-phase flow. So, this would be our mathematical model. Let's see in this IV formulation. So, we consider that. So we consider that this equation 1A after 1f. This would be the momentum equation. And we consider that the memory inside memory is one fluid, outside memory is another fluid. So we have the density and viscosity that different inside memory and outside memory. And also we include the elastic force, which is given by 1C, and also the bending force, which is given by 1D. And here, for simplicity, the And here for simplicity, the elasticity, this force is just using this the Hookey's law. So that would be the model we are trying to discuss in this first part. And then since we are using inverse volume method, so here the parameters, the interface curve is actually parametrized by using this time independent variable alpha. And also S is the arc length. Is the arc length, and this would be the model where on the continuous level we have. And here, H would be the indicator function, which trying to connect the density inside and outside of this memory, and also viscosity and inside and outside the memory. And in the case that we can represent the interface, we could have the The interface, we could have the usual Cartesian coordinate representation, or we can represent it using this arc length and the angle siton representation. So here, we're using this arc length and angle siton representation, but introduce the surface velocity, the normal component, and the tangential component. Actually, following this, the paper done by Tom Hoi in 2040. In in 2040, that's actually we can we can find this kind of two equations for angle theta and the arc length. So then we can actually put this kind of equations into the previous equation. And notice that in this case, we're talking about this density and that's not constant. That's actually different inside and outside the memory. So we add this kind of tone in the remote equation. And then we also write down this. Also, write down this elastic force and bending force in terms of this angle and this acclimates so that we have this kind of equations, this kind of formulations. And then we can actually look at the energy of this system. So basically, under this zero velocity bonding condition or paleoordic bonding conditions, we can consider that the total energy of the entire system would satisfy this relation. system would satisfy this relationship. So that would be here we have the kinetic energy, we have the elastic energy, and also we have the bending energy. So that the three parts sum together would satisfy this relationship. So that the total energy will decay. So the first purpose here, we're trying to develop this energy stable inverse boundary method to solve this deformable memory problem that's given by this model. This model. So, here we are using the standard boundary inverse boundary method. So, that is, the inverse boundary method is sort of this Lagrange and the Eula method, the mixed sort of method. They're using this Lagrange markers to check the motion of the interface and using this UI coordinate to capture the motion of flows. So, we're using this standard mark and seal scheme. Under Mark and Seal scheme, that's actually a finite difference method. And we can write down the system in this way. We do discretization. And actually, here, for simplicity, we're just using first order time stepping. And for the space discretization, we're using second order method. So because this system is slightly complicated, they're actually all things are coupled together. So we are not able to develop this fully. Able to develop this fully coupled scheme, but instead, all these terms are coupled together. But luckily, is that by doing this, we can show that the total energy of this system in discrete level satisfies this dissipation law. So here, I should mention a little bit about the momentum equation. Here, we add up this term so that we can show that they're at a discrete level. At the discrete level, the kinetic energy would satisfy the dissipation relation. And here, this would be, here I didn't list the detailed proof, but here I just show the result that the total energy here satisfies the dissipation relation at a discrete level. And since this scheme itself is actually a non-linear scheme, so that Is a nonlinear scheme so that iteratively we have to solve it iteratively at each time step so that we actually develop a numeric scheme to solve this nonlinear system. And basically, we are developing sort of this predictor and correction method to solve for it. So that is, we're starting from this at each time step when we do the iteration. If we know this current velocity step, L, then we can solve this theta and can solve this theta and this at length equation and then we can update the interface to some some some some location here i'm i'm using this l ply and after that we can calculate this indicator function which given by this equation and then we can add this material um properties or flows like the density and also the viscosity after that we can After that, we can solve for these interface forces, like this surface tension force and the bending force. And then we can solve the Navajo Stokes equation. Here we are solving it. We couple these two equations together, and then we solve it by the GMIS. And then we can use the velocity we obtained to do interpolation to the intermediate mark point. Then we can update the intermediate velocity. Then we can update the intermediate velocity. And then we're using this velocity, we can solve this acclience and angle CETA equation again. Then this sort of like this correction step. Then we can do this kind of steps and we can do it iteratively until the conceptive two steps, they satisfy this sort of tolerance. Of this sort of tolerance so that the relative LO would be small, and then we can finish one step. So, that would be our algorithm. So, the good thing is that, although it is a non-linear scheme, but we can do it iteratively. And the good thing is that we have the energy stability. So, that here, let me show some numerical result. So, first of all, we do the accurate test. That is, we test in the That is, we test in the share flow. That is, we can see that it's actually consistent with the reporting in the literature that the convergence order is roughly first order. And that would be the shear flow test. And also, we test the energy decay properties. And we see that in case that we impose paleoordial boundary conditions, and then the energy would be decay, and with respect to time t. And with respect to time t. And if you look at the figure config, if you look at the shape of this memory, initially, if we have this elliptical curve, then it will converge into a circular. That would be the numerator report. Not only that, actually, if we consider a nearly extensible VESCO, that means if we take this number. This number, this C here is a C A sigma, which will relate to the subtang force. If we make this sigma zero, it's much larger. That means that the memory is nearly inextensible. So in this case, in the shear flow, two kind of emotion could be observed. One is called take trailing, that is called tumbling. And we also compare this avoidment result with this cellar. Result with this theory, the KS theory. And we see that the agreement is actually not perfect, but it's okay. And not only that, we also observe the tumbling in the simulation. And here, actually, we also studied the effect of this density contrast or the density ratio. And we found that when this density ratio became larger, When this density ratio becomes larger, at a steady state, the inclination angle will become larger. So, that would be our numerical observation that we can study the density ratio. So, here we show two snapshots of this commutation, when t equals to 5 and t equals to 40. So, initially, we'll see that when density contrast is larger, the inclination angle is actually small. But however, when the time goes. But however, when the time goes uh goes through, it becomes larger, then the inclination angle becomes larger. So at a steady state, when the density contrast becomes larger, then inclination angle will become larger. So that's what we the first part I want to present. And we are basically using this inverse monitoring method to simulate this deformable memory problem. And secondly, And secondly, I'm also trying to discuss how to use this sort of method to compute the thermal migration problem. And actually, this is also well-studied problem in the literature, and many papers have been published in the fluid mechanics journal. And we are trying to consider the case that when the fluid, the droplet move on the thermal migration, and also we are coupled with this effectant. Not only that, we Suffectant. Not only that, we also consider the fluid rheology property. That means we consider the non-Newtonian droplets in non-Newtonian fluid matrix, that is, visco-elastic fluids. So that's what we're trying to say is that we're looking at this kind of model. Here we have this droplet inside it, is the visco-elastic fluid. Outside is also viscous elastic food. And we have some material properties, and we have the And we have the thermal gradient. So, here, let me give out the equations. So, this would be the equation we are trying to study. Here, we have this standard Novistox equation. The things here, we have top P, which is actually the elastic stress. And then, this is the temperature equation. And this would be the top P. Here, for simplicity, we consider that. Simplicity, we consider that it actually satisfies the order V constitutive relation. And we are trying to consider this kind of problem. And we are actually also the indicator function. And on each side of the droplet, then the density, viscosity, and also some other material properties, they could be different. So that's the thing we are trying to simulate in this case. And here, one thing I should mention is that. One thing I should mention is that the interface tension actually is dependent on both surfad contribution and also the temperature. And the surfactant contribution actually satisfies this convection diffusion equation on the interface. And as we are trying to using this inverse matter method for simulated at advanced deformation, one drawback of this method is that the macros will become close to each other. Come close to each other. So, that would be give some problem instability. So, one technique we can use is that we can add some sort of this artificial velocity into this markers to make all these markers are equally distributed. So that we add this artificial velocity into this equation. Then, the modified subfactor equation would become this equation 11. 11. So we are basically using this equation to compute the surfactant evolution. And here, these are scalars of this also dimensionless parameters for this problem. And actually, there are many parameters. And we have density ratio, we have the viscosity ratio, and also we have this two Weiserberg number, and we have this the polymer viscosity to the solvent viscosity. We have two different. Solvan viscosity, we have two different relationships, beta one and beta two, in two different regimes. So, numerically, actually, we are trying to develop a sort of this implicit method, sorry, explicit method to solve it. And we decoupled the system. So the first thing is that we can do interpolation using this temperature field. And this temperature field is actually on this EUR grid so that we can first using the calendar. Can first using the calendar temperature point to the interpolation onto the Lagrangian macros. After that, we can compute the interpretation tension by using this equation in dimensionless form. And then we can compute this tangential vector and also we can compute the interface force on the interface. And this is the king step. After that, we can solve this. We can solve this indicator function, and then we can update all these material properties by using this indicator function. And then we solve this heat equation. We can update the heat equation, and then we can solve the Nova Stokes equation. And here, because also this dense, this viscosity is not constant. So that here, one trick we are using is that we will split this part into This part into the summation of two parts. One is just purely Laplace part, and the other is the other operator. By doing this, we can treat the Laplace part implicitly, but the other part explicitly. So then we're using this projection method to solve this Lava-Stokes equation, basically. And then once we have this velocity, we can do the update for the we can do interpolation for the mark point. Can do interpolation for the mark point, then we can move the mark point to the new place. And also, we can update the factor concentration by solving that modified equations on the mark points. And then the different thing here, also one of the most important thing is that we want to update this elastic stress. So here, for simplicity, we just look at the elastic stress in terms of kind of ODE. terms some of kind of ODE because the right hand side if we know if if if if it is known at some certain time step we're just using the second order longer quota method to solve for it that would be the numeric scheme we have adopted and then we first of all we want to test our result with some theory so in case that we have the zero Malagonian number with which means without a sufficient and also small Linus number And also a small Linus number. Then, in a long time ago, this Young had developed one theory about how this migration velocity of this droplet. So, we tested these cases and we compare our numerical result with this theory. That actually is not a perfect match, but it's close. And here, we also do the benchmark test with our result, with some result obtained by Result obtained by Green Children in 2003. So that see our result actually agreeing with this previous result. And also we do the numeric convergence analysis. We see that the method is basically first order convergent. And also we study the effect of the surfactant. We can see that the surfactant actually affects the migration velocity. Affect the migration velocity. When surfactant appears, the migration velocity will become smaller. So when E is yellow, it means that no surfactant. When E is non-zero, then there is suffragant. So that the migration velocity will become smaller. That would be the first finding we can observe. Not only that, we also want to study how these elastic polymers affect. Elastic polymors affect the evolution of these droplets. And so, first of all, we consider the first case that is the Newtonian droplet in the order B fluid matrix. That's here I denote as NO. So, we studied the effect of the polymorph solvent with scarcity ratio, that is beta 1 in this case. So, we see that in case that the beta one is non-zero, then the migration velocity will become smaller. And when beta becomes And when beta becomes smaller, the migration velocity will become smaller. So that means the polymer viscosity in the outside ODB fluid will greatly affect the migration velocity of the droplet. And also here, this would be the stress we can plot. That's the first normal stress difference for three different situations. That would be the first effect we can study. Not only that, we can also Not only that, we can also study another important factor, which is the Weisenberger number in this floor matrix. And actually, surprisingly, we found that this Weisenberger number does not affect the migration velocity greatly. So you would see that for three different situations, the migration velocity are actually quite close. So that the migration velocity is actually not sensible. Actually, it is not sensible to this parameter. That's what I'm finding. And also, we can study the opposite situation. We consider the OJB drop dynamics in this Newtonian fluid matrix. Then here I denote the ON. Then similarly, we find that this beta, this polymorph, the ratio of polymorph viscosity to the solar viscosity has great impact on the migration. impact on the migration velocity. And when beta is become large, then the migration velocity becomes smaller. And also here, the Weissenberger number has a minimum impact. That's for the case, the second case. And also here, for the last case, we studied the audio B droplet dynamics in the audio B fluid matrix. Actually, the similar situation can be obtained. That is, the beta. Obtained that is the beta one, beta two, they have greater impact on the migration velocity. However, for these Weisenberg numbers, they have minimum impact. So that's actually the second part of my talk. Actually, these two parts are mainly done by a former PhD student. So let me look at the time. Okay, so finally, actually here. Actually, here, I would like to mention the last point about the non-Newtonian fluid mechanics part. Here, actually, the related talk work, which is done with my collaborator, who is in USTC mechanical engineering department. And this is the joint work with Feng Li. Actually, she is a professor at the Mechanical Engineering Department at USTC. At the USTC, and let me look at and talk about a little bit about this thread and also the visco-elastic thread. So here, we can consider that the very parallel instability is actually related to the lipid jet. And the lipid jet would be have this kind of structure usually. And at the larger deformation, it will have this so-called beat-on-strand structure. So that means at the larger deformation, it will... Large deformation, it will appear the large droplet will connect with the small droplets, and sometimes there will be secondary droplets appear like this. As I mentioned previously, how to eliminate this kind of secondary droplet is greatly important in engineering applications. So, and also we found that the surfactant can affect the dynamics of the fluids. In particular, the surface visco elasticity induced by Elasticity induced by the surfactant and how it affects the morphology of this kind of evolution of this threat is actually has not been well studied. So that's actually the motivation of our current work. So to do this, actually, we have developed this following model. We consider here we have the long and thin liquid. Then on the interface, that would be an insoluble factor. this would be an insoluble surfactant and then this um we have this liquid stretch we're trying to look at how this surfactant evolves and also we want to study how this surface visco elasticity affect the surfactant so here we consider this kind of model and we we adopt this so-called finity model and we look at this problem. at this problem we consider that this is the asynchronous model for this thread and outside is the fluid is sorry outside is L. So we just simply neglect it. But on the interface we have the fractured. And then for simplicity we consider this problem is an asynchronous model. And then we look at this problem. We look right down this equation. That's what we have this moment equation. We have continued it. Equation: We have continuity equation, and also here we this is the case that we're looking at the whisker elastic fluid. So, we also look at the elastic stress here. It's written in this tense form, and we consider this is the asynchronic model. And so, we only have this fine component, and two of these are actually the same due to the symmetry. So, we consider this problem. So we consider this problem in asynchronous form. Then we write down these equations, this moment equation, this continuity equation, and also we have this relationship. That is the relationship between the elastic component, or sorry, the elastic stress and the conformation tensor, A. So we would have these equations. That would be given by this conformation tensor. We have this kind of equation. Answer, we have this kind of equations. And then we want to study the effect of surfactant. So that is, we have using this equation, that's the evolution of this surfactant concentration, which is also similar as the previous one. And this is only valid on the interface because right now we are working on symmetrical coordinate. So it's written in this form. And this is the kinetic boundary condition. So we have. Kinetic boundary condition. So we have this equation 20. And then we want to actually include the surface visco elasticity. So we need to look at how this surface force balanced on the interface. So that actually give out the equation 21. And this would be the surface visco elasticity. Oh, sorry. That would be the surface stress tensor, and which can be modeled usually by using. Can be modeled usually by using equation 22. And here, the kappa s and mu s, they are related to the surfactant shear and dilation viscosity. And these two terms, these two terms are the new force we want to include in this model. And also this so-called volcano approximation. And then the surfactant control, the interface tension is actually related to the contrastation of the The condensation of the factant by using the Lameis equation, which is given by 23. So that's actually the equation we have. And then in syrupic coordinate, we will have 21 and 26. That's the entire model we have. And then, eventually, because the model is very complicated, so that in this case, we are not using the purely immersed funding method to compute it, but actually we are. To compute it. But actually, we're still working on that. But however, here for simplicity, we are using so-called slam-body approximation. We are looking at the so-called long-wave equations, and we derive the asymptotics for this model. And eventually, we find the 1D equation. That would be equation 27 up to equation 32. Okay. So here we have two dimensionless parameters. dimensionless parameters, this B kappa infinity and B mu infinity, thus quantify how this dilation viscosity and shell viscosity. And also here the substantiation is related to the surface concentration in this way. And we studied this problem. Actually, we perform numeric computation simply by using finite difference method. And we have a set of parameters and And here, let me just briefly show one of two of these important results we found. In case that in the order B model, that means infinite B model, if we let the extensibility, this parameter, L, okay, to be large here. If we put this L to be large, it will be reduced to order V. In this case, actually, we found that the Sephardic congressional The surfand condensation, the surface visceral elasticity will actually eliminate the second droplet. That's all this B, B kappa infinity, B mu infinity is large, then the second droplet will eliminate it. That's the one important finding. So the federal can help to eliminate the secondary droplet. That's the one most important finding here. And also, we find that this vector. We find that this effectant can greatly delay the pinch-off of phenipine threat. That would be another important finding we obtained. So that's actually the conclusion for this part. And for this part, we are using the long-wave model. We are still working on how we can capture the full model directly. So I think that would be all. Okay. And And here we have two publications related to this talk. And if you are interested, and we can have some for the chat. Okay. So because of time, and also I'm thinking a little bit quick. So thank you very much for listening. Thank you.
