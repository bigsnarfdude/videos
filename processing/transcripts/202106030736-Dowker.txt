Can you hear me? Am I unmuted? We can yeah, we can hear you and we see your slides. Great. Let me. See your slides. Great. Let me see if I can go to full screen. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. We see full screen. Perfect. So the next speaker is Faye Docker, and she will speak about recovering general relativity from a Planck scale discrete theory of quantum gravity. Please, Faye. Thank you, Alessio, and thank you to Flaminia, Lucien, and Rob for organizing this really nice conference workshop and for giving me this chance to speak. For giving me this chance to speak, I'm going to present an argument that has just appeared in a paper with Jeremy Butterfield today on the archive. And it is an argument. We're provoking an argument. And we fully expect and welcome what my philosopher colleagues delightfully call pushback. So that Pushback. So that's if you're in a seminar and you want to violently disagree with the speaker, then you can put your hand up and say, if I may, I'd like to push back a little on. Anyway, so that's so please push back in the discussion. And we would very much welcome and like to hear what your thoughts are. So the argument is about a quality. Is about a quantum gravity theory, X, which could be any quantum gravity theory that currently exists or doesn't exist yet. And we're going to make two assumptions about this theory X. The first assumption is that it recovers general relativity. And the second assumption is that this theory is discrete at the Planck scale. So at the moment, I'm setting So, at the moment, I'm setting out the plan of my talk. So, I'm going to make a series of comments, flesh out these assumptions by making a series of comments on them in a moment. I'll then introduce three concepts. Within the comments, I'll, along the way, introduce three concepts of grounding state, discrete physical data, or DPD, and And discrete continuum correspondence or DCC for this putative theory X. I'll then state and briefly justify two claims. The first claim is that causal sets can recover general relativity space-times. The second claim is that there is no other proposal to date for a set of discrete physical data that does the job. Data that does the job. If there's time, I will then explain why quantum uncertainty does not invalidate this conclusion. And I'll conclude, but I'll give you the conclusion now in case I don't get there. I'd like to finish with plenty of time for questions. So if I don't reach the conclusion, here is the conclusion. No matter what theory X is fundamentally, if the X is fundamentally, if the assumptions hold, then at the point when a GR space-time needs to be recovered, there is at present no other entity than a causal set that will do the job that discrete physical data must do. Okay, so let's get going. Yeah, we've had this problem before. I apologize. I I can't advance my if you click with your your mouse on the slide it should uh should work if you click on the slide and then you start okay perfect oh that's magic thank you yeah excellent so quantum gravity theory X we assume recovers general relativity as an approximation in certain In certain states or physical situations at macroscopic scales. That's our first assumption about it. And we also assume that theory X is physically discrete at the Planck scale. So let me expand upon these assumptions by making a series of comments. So it's useful to bear in mind analogies for how. Analogies for how more fundamental theories recover theories which more often than not have occurred in history prior or been held sway prior to the more fundamental theory. So for example, general relativity recovers Newtonian gravity. Molecular dynamics recovers fluid dynamics. That example is particularly pertinent. That example is particularly pertinent to our argument because that's an example where the continuum fluid dynamics is recovered or is emergent from a fundamentally discrete theory. And the third analogy is that quantum mechanics recovers classical mechanics. And here, of course, there's controversy about whether and or how. Or how that statement is actually the case today. And so, in order to finesse that controversy, all we need to do in making our argument is to assume that that is either already the case and there's some argument that makes it the case, or it will be the case in the future that we'll be able to explain and understand. Be able to explain and understand how quantum mechanics recovers classical mechanics. So we have to assume that that's the case, and we do assume it for our argument. Theory X must recover a large class of four-dimensional GR space-times, including gravitational waves, large portions of Minkowski space, black holes, and expanding cosmologies. All the GR space-times which are phenomenologically interesting and important to us. Interesting and important to us. All these GR space-times that have to be recovered are assumed to vary slowly on Planckian scales. Theory X has for each GR space-time, ng, to be recovered, a grounding state which contains or produces or gives rise to a set of discrete physical data or DPD from which DPD from which that space-time eng can be recovered essentially uniquely. In other words, another way to say that or express that concept is that the space-time MG, the continuum space-time MG, the GR space-time, is a good approximation to this discrete physical data set. The discrete physical data set contains no geometrical information about the GR space-time. About the GR space-time at smaller than Planckian length, time, volume scales. Now, we make no assumption, the argument needs to make no assumption at all about the nature of the grounding state. It might be a state in a Hilbert space. It might be a co-event in a quantum measure theory, or it might be some other thing as yet that doesn't yet exist, we haven't created. Yet exist that we haven't created yet in theory. And the argument makes no assumption, need make no assumption about how this grounding state gives rise to the discrete physical data. They might be expectation values or eigenvalues of certain self-adjoint operators, or not. They might involve some kind of coarse graining of the full information in the grounding state. And the The production of the discrete physical data from the grounding state might require more or less anthropocentric maneuvers or all sorts of other things. But we need to make no assumption. All we need to assume is that the grounding state gives us the discrete physical data. I'll make four more comments on the assumptions. The assumptions imply Imply that there must be in theory X a statement of a discrete continuum correspondence or DCC dash X for theory X which tells you how the discrete physical data and the GR space-time are related and it tells us up to some tolerance when the GR space-time is recovered from a discrete From a discrete physical data set. And the analogy to bear in mind here is that with a molecular state that recovers a fluid state. So we know how to deduce a fluid state if we know the molecular state. The fluid state is recovered from the molecular state if, when we consider a large enough region of space, the The density function, the continuum density, does not vary much in that region and is given approximately by the number of molecules times the mass of the molecules divided by the volume of that region. So that's the example to have in mind when I say discrete continuum correspondence. Correspondence. Essential uniqueness is necessary for this discrete continuum correspondence to hold water. If two space-times, mg and m prime, g prime, are both recovered from the same discrete physical data set, according to this discrete continuum correspondence. Suppose the discrete continuum correspondence tells us that both mg and m prime g pound are recovered from this. Pound are recovered from this by this discrete, the same discrete physical data set. Then, those two space-times must be approximately isometric. It must not matter. The slight differences between them must be physically irrelevant. And again, the example to bear in mind is that of the fluid state, which corresponds to, which is recovered from, the molecular state. If we have two fluid states, State. If we have two fluid states, two continuum descriptions of the fluid, which are both recovered from the same molecular state, then they must be approximately equal, up to differences which are irrelevant physically, at the scales at which the fluid description is valid. Okay, so this essential uniqueness here obviously raises the question in one's mind, well, what about superpositions and or even duality? And/or even duality? Well, here those are interesting and important questions, problems, but they're not questions that are relevant to the argument because our assumption is that theory X recovers general relativity. And in general relativity, the world is one space-time. So the assumption is that this singleness of space-time can be derived in Can be derived in X because we're assuming that X recovers general relativity. So we must be able to explain why, derive the fact that there's one space-time. And we take the discrete physical data set in hand after this has been done, however, it's been done, and we're just assuming that it can be done. And then finally, And then finally, just to stress that this argument does not target the use of either piecewise flat Lorentzian manifolds as continuum approximations to continuum geometries, nor does it target the use of discreteness as a regulator, as a regulator that is to be taken away, discreteness length that's been to be sent to zero. Discreteness length that's been to be sent to zero and a continuum limit obtained. Okay, so having fleshed out those two assumptions about theory X, let me make the two claims. Claim one is that a causal set or a locally finite partial order. Locally finite partial order is a set of discrete physical data that, taken as being discrete on the Planck scale, can recover a GR space-time as a continuum approximation. And the slogan here for this claim is that order plus number equals Lorentzian geometry. The second claim is that there is in the current literature no other proposal for a set of Planck scale discrete physical data that can recover a GRC. Data that can recover a GR space-time as a continuum approximation. Before I get on to the briefly justifying those claims, let's recall what it is that X must recover, theory X. What is a GR space-time? What is a Lorentzian geometry? Well, I've just drawn this light cone to remind you of the structure of Lorentzian. You of the structure of Lorentzian geometry and the fact that it's very different from Rienanian geometry. The existence of null directions and the light cone structure and the causal order differentiates Lorentzian geometry very substantially from Riemannian geometry. And also recall that causal order is central to the physics of general relativity. Black holes are the epitome of GR and they are defined in causal terms and all the physics of black holes And all the physics of black holes, such as the singularity theorems, the uniqueness theorems, black hole thermodynamics, they all depend on the concept of an event horizon defined in causal terms. Now, one way that Lorentzian geometry is bordering on, is very, very different from Riemannian geometry is the fact that it is, if not actually non-local, bordering on non-local. The notion of physically close. The notion of physically close is not well captured in any picture. The chosen frame of the picture is a huge impediment to understanding. So I want to give you this example here. Let me, I've drawn these points on the diagram, and they're all one unit of proper time away from the point P. And they're very non-locally related to P in the diagram. You can see that, and they're all equally close. And they're all equally close to P physically, but of course, in the diagram, they look like they're far away, but that's because we're putting our Riemannian Euclidean eyes on this picture. But in the actual physical Lorentzian geometry, they're all equally close to P. So the points one Planck time in the future of P in Minkowski space lie on an infinite spatial hyperboloid that sits inside the future light cone and asymptotes to the future light cone. And totes to the future light, kind of okay. So, the claim one is about causal sets or discrete orders that Samati was speaking about. Another phrase that's synonymous with causal set or discrete order is transitive directed acyclic graph. Here's a five-element transitive directive acyclic graph, very simple. And the idea is that this is the discrete underpinning to This is the discrete underpinning to space-time to a continuum approximation or a fluid-like approximation to the discrete underpinning. So the evidence, I'm just very briefly going to sketch what evidence we have for my claim about causal sets, but it depends on, I said that part of the assumptions that we're making is that there has to be a discrete continuum. To be a discrete continuum correspondence in any theory X. So for causal sets, the discrete continuum correspondence takes the following form. We say that a causal set recovers a space-time mg if this causal set faithfully embeds in the space-time at Planck density. And faithful embedding means that the number of causal sets that's embedded in any large Embedded in any large enough physically nice region is approximately equal to the volume of that region in Planckian units. And it respects the order, that is, the causal order of the embedded points in the space-time is the same as the order of the elements in C in the causal set. Now, as far as we know, this DCC implies that and is implied by. That and is implied by the causal set being a random sample of the space-time Mg. And here are three, briefly, three pieces of evidence for the claim that this does the job, that Mg is indeed recovered by a faithfully embeddable causal set. First of all, there's a continuum theorem called the Kronheimer-Penrose-Hawking-Malamint theorem. Hawking-Malament theorem, which says that in the continuum, the causal order, space-time causal order, and volume information gives you the Lorentzian, the full Lorentzian geometry. I'm sweeping a few details under the carpet there. Because a causal set is a random sample of the order and it furnishes the volume for free by counting. You just count the number of elements in any large enough region, and that tells you. Any large enough region that tells you the volume, then this is strong evidence that causal sets will do the job, that they do indeed encode, carry with them the geometry, the geometrical information at larger than Planckian scales. There's a continuum limit. It's not precise proof because we're actually interested in finite density, but at infinite density, a faithfully embedded causal set is. Set is it tells you the full space-time, the full, the full manifold, the full geometry in the limit. And the more direct evidence is that we can read off from a causal, a facefully embeddable causal set, the dimension information, geodesic proper time, at least in Minkowski and other geometric quantities, at least in Minkowski space, and for approximately flat manifolds. Okay, so claim to is obviously a big claim because I'm claiming something for everything that exists in the literature. But to justify it, I'm going to concentrate on one thing, one entity, which I've called a combinatorial Lorentzian Regge complex. So let me explain what that is. So, let me explain what that is. So, this is a proposal for an alternative discrete physical data set. And what it is, is it's a simplicial complex. There you are, 20 minutes. Thank you, Alessio. It's a simplicial complex, but it's a combinatorial simplicial complex, meaning that it's just the combinatorial information about the vertices and which vertices are connected by one. Which vertices are connected by one simplices, which one simplices, which triples of one simplices are filled in with triangles, which form triangles. So I misspoke there. I didn't want to use the word fill. So it's just combinatorial connectivity information. Plus, Lorentzian edge length information, including, if appropriate, if the edges are If appropriate, if the edges are time-like or null, direction information. So, these here's an example just in two dimensions of a combinatorial 2D Lorentzian complex, a simplicial complex. To be a reget complex, one would decorate all these one-dimensional edges with Lorentzian lengths. So, either space-like lengths, time-like or null lengths. And if they're timelike or null, they would have directions on them as well. Well. And those lengths are no more than a few in Planck units. And to be a combinatorial object, to be truly discrete as per our assumption, we must not include in this object any geometrical information in the interior. So do not think of these triangles as being filled in by pieces of flat space. That is not part of the Part of the discrete combinatorial Lorentzian Regi complex data. If you fit any kind of flat filling would be continuum information that we're not allowing by our assumption that the data is discrete. Okay, so I'm going to provide evidence for claim two. Here is a discrete continuum correspondence for this object. A combinatorial Lorentzian-Regi complex recovers a space-time Mg if that complex is the combinatorial information in some triangulation of the manifold M and it can be embedded in M such that the geodesics between the embedded vertices in the continuum have lengths which equal the edge lengths in Planck units approximately. Approximately. Okay, that's a very natural discrete continuum correspondence, and we claim that it is any other proposal for a discrete continuum correspondence will be very similar to this. Now, this fails. There exists a CLRC that, according to this discrete continuum correspondence, recovers both Minkowski space and a space-time that's a perturbation. And a space-time that's a perturbation of Minkowski space with a physical plane-fronted gravitational wave burst. I'm going to show you what that counter example is. So this counter example is based on an integer lattice in three plus one dimensions. So here I've just drawn the integer lattice in the Tz direction, but the X and the Y directions are suppressed. So there's an integer lattice. Each hypercube, each unit hypercube, is triangulated. Hypercube is triangulated into simplices. So this is indeed a simplicial complex. Each edge is labeled by the Lorentzian ledge, Lorentzian length of the edge in the corresponding triangulation of Minkowski space. And this does, by the DCC, recover Minkowski space by fiat. That's how you set it up. However, it doesn't just recover Minkowski space. It also recovers a gravitational wave burst. Gravitational wave burst such that the burst is non-zero only in this blue shaded region. So I've written down the metric here. The wave, the packet is described by h of u. u is a null coordinate. And h is only non-zero in the blue shaded region. The blue shaded region. There are no embedded vertices in that blue shaded region, it's a void. And that's the reason that this, there's almost no, very little data that the CLRC provides for the space-time in the void. And there's not enough data to fix the geometry there. And in fact, this CLRC recovers the geometry here. Now, you may say, well, that's not a very fixed. Now you may say, well, that's not a very physical space-time because this wave lasts only for a Planck time. So it's an unphysical space-time. I don't need to recover it. But that's just, it's a trick of the frame. That region, the blue shaded region, is perfectly nice, large, and physical. And you can see that by looking at this in a different frame. If we boost to a different frame, do a boost in the Z direction, then A boost in the z direction, then that blue region can stretch as much as you like, depending on your boost factor. It can, let's say, stretch by a factor of 10 to the 44, in which case the height would be the top, the boosted wave burst would last for a second. So, this is a perfectly nice, well-behaved perturbation of Minkowski space, and it's something that we do need to recover if we are to claim that we. Recover if we are to claim that we recover GR. Okay, so I'm going to skip over those things and I'm going to jump to my conclusion, which I gave you before, and I'll leave you to read it and stop here. Thank you for listening. Thank you very much, Faye. Very nice talk. Let's start with the questions. And the first one is Chaslov. Please, Chaslov. Please, Chaslov. Hi, Faye, and thank you for a very nice talk. I'm definitely not in the field and I learn a lot. And so I understand that from your talk that the causal sets appear to be maybe even a unique solution, which in some kind of approximation, continuous approximation gives general relativity back. Back. And I also understand you didn't talk about that, that cosocytes also have this potential to go beyond that and to see some fluctuations at the maybe Planck scale. Now, what I would like to understand is what about those superpositions of space-time, so to say, that are on a different range of the spectrum and what some of the people were talking today. Some of the people were talking today, maybe if you have a really macroscopic superposition of a large mass, which doesn't seem to be a fluctuation on some classical space-time. Could you comment on that? Yes. Hi, Chasa. Nice to see you. Thank you for the question. So, that's a question that's beyond the scope of this argument. This argument really is. This argument really is, it pertains to general relativity, and the examples that you are referring to, the situations you're referring to, would not be described by general relativity because, as you said, indeed, they would involve, in some sense, superpositions of macroscopically distinct space-times. So, that possibility, which I think, of course, we would all hope. Which I think, of course, we would all hope can be realized because that would be super exciting, is not in the scope of this argument because it's not in the scope of general relativity, full stop. So this argument assumes that there are certain physical situations in which GR holds. And if X can recover G R, then the argument is, we're in business to carry this argument through. Carry this argument through. So, whether or not these other situations can occur is uncertain, we don't know. Yeah, I think we do, everyone here surely hopes that they're experimentally achievable. And that would, yeah, everyone would love that, I'm sure. So, I'm not sure how to answer your question. No, I understand that this was not the scope of your argument. I was thinking whether in the community of causal sets somebody think about recovering also these situations, as I understand the causal set has the potential to be a quantum theory of gravity, or if I'm not wrong. Yes, that's very good. I mean, own no. Good. I mean, no, not in detail. And using, I mean, I can't point you to anything in the literature where people have actually studied the possibility that there are these macroscopically realizable superpositions of macroscopically distinct causal sets, for example. So, yeah, I mean, we are interested in it, obviously. And we are interested in it, obviously. And one question that one might try to address is whether causal sets really could distinguish between the different space-times that supposedly arise in these scenarios. Or whether they're in fact indistinguishable in the sense that there's too much, that the quantum fluctuations or uncertainty at the Planck scale is going to. Scale is going to spoil the distinguishability of these space-times. But it's, I mean, it's something that we haven't addressed directly. So thanks for the question. Thank you. We have now a question from Alex Kissinger. Yeah, hello. Thanks for the talk. I found it very accessible, also not coming from this background, so that was very. Not coming from this background, so that was very nice. Um, I had a question about your counterexample involving the simplices. Uh, it seems like you could get a partially ordered set from this pretty straightforwardly by taking just the vertices as your elements, and then you take the ordering of there being a null or a time-like path connecting these vertices. Very good. Very good. So, is that thing not a causal set? Is that how you escape running into the same problem? Or is there something else going on here? Good. Thank you. That's a wonderful question. So indeed, there's an induced causal set that you can create from this CLRC in exactly the way that you describe. So the CLRC, in some sense, contains a causal set. It contains a lot more information than a causal set, but it contains. More information than a causal set, but it does contain a causal set. However, this embedding of the causal set, let's say, into Minkowski space, is not a faithful embedding. It does not satisfy the discrete continuum correspondence that we require if we're going to say that a causal set recovers a continuum space-time. Space-time. It doesn't, and in particular, what it does not obey the number-volume relationship. So, in particular, this blue shaded region is a nice, large, physically well-behaved space-time region, and it's void of elements. There are no elements embedded in it. So, it's it completely just fails the discrete. It just fails the discrete continuum correspondence for causal sets. So we would not say in this case that this space-time is recovered by the causal set, which is hidden in the CLRC, because it fails to satisfy the discrete continuum correspondence for causal sets, because it fails to respect the number-volume criterion. I think that makes sense. So, does that imply that if you have any, what you say, these kinds of nice physically meaningful volumes, that there's necessarily infinitely many points inside of that when you embed it. That depends on whether the volume is infinite. So, if certainly, yes, if the volume is infinite, then there's necessarily infinitely many data points, if you like, or vertices. Data points, if you like, with vertices embedded in it. If the volume is finite, then the number of vertices embedded in that region must be approximately the volume of the region in fundamental Planckian unions. Oh, I see. Yeah, because it needs to be the same. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Thanks. Okay, I see that we have several questions here. It's very nice, but I would like to ask the other people to. Would like to ask the other people to hold their questions for the discussion section because we are a bit over time. And with this, I thank you again, Faye. Let's thank again Faye for the nice talk.
