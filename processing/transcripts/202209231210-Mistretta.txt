Let me start with two motivations for the theorem that I want to state. So, well, the first motivation is a very general one, and so the relationship between differentials and Between differentials and topology. Well, of course, there are a lot of since the last century, a lot of studying of relations between differentials and topology in particular from Kaler in 32 to Severi in the year from the 30 and 40 and 50s. And so let me. And so let me severi in thirties until the fifties. And then these were in more modern times. They were the severity telling, they were interpreted, reinterpreted by Manford. And one sentence of Manford, which is particularly meaning in my mind, is that which he Mind is that which he refers to Severi, and in the same time he criticizes Severi. I mean, he finds some error in Severi's work, but in the same time, he says that it is exactly Severi's method, which he is using for proving his theorems. And he calls this method the influence of regular two forms on rational equivalence. And in a more controversial In a more contemporary setting, what I will talk about is how related to a question or a conjecture of Elena. I could not find the, I mean, really, the source of this question, but I did find the statement. And so the question is the following. If we have a compact Kayler manifold, Suppose that we know that the fundamental group is of infinite cardinality. So the cardinality of the fundamental group of X is infinite. Then does this imply that there exists at least one symmetric, one non-vanishing symmetric differential, so that the space H0 of the sim M of omega 1. m of omega one x is different than zero for some positive m so this is the question and this question was uh i mean the answer to to this question is yes due to a recent work of brunenbarb klinger and totaro of 2013 i think but in the case where the fundamental group admits a representation over any um over any Over any field of a finite dimensional representation over any field with infinite image. This property is not exactly equivalent to the fundamental group being infinite. However, it is not known any compact Kayla manifold with infinite fundamental group that does not have this property. So the answer, let's say it is yes. It is almost in all known cases and almost everywhere, it is yes. It is yes. Then one can wonder whether the converse is true. So, yes? Seem M of the first omega one. So these are called symmetric differentials as opposed to the differential forms where you would take the alternate omega m and but of omega one. Okay, so it is one. Okay, so it is one particular component in the tensor product of omega 1x. Is the converse true? So suppose we do have a symmetric differential. Is it true that the fundamental group is infinite? Well, in this case, if m is equal to 1, the answer is yes due to Hodge theory. Okay, so if m is equal to 1, suppose that we have that h0 x omega 1 is different. Omega 1 is different than 0. Then by Hodge theory, we have that H1 of X, the Betty, first Betty number, is different than 0. And therefore, over the integers, we have that H X Z modulo torture is different than 0. And therefore, it is an infinite. I mean, the fundamental group must be an infinite of infinite cardinality. However, the answer is no in general. Due to a very nice result of Brodbeck of 2018, he shows that if we take a very general complete intersection in PN where of high degree Of high degree where the dimension of x is bigger than two and smaller than n over two, then this one has an ample omega one. Yes, yes, yes. Also, also equal to two. Then we have that omega one x is X is ample, is an ample vector bundle. Therefore, some symmetric product has as many sections as one can find, and in particular, some symmetric product is globally generated. Okay, but such X by left check. By Lefshetz's restriction theorem, since it is a complete intersection, has a vanishing fundamental group, such as is simply connected. Therefore, it contradicts the possible converse. It has a lot of symmetric differential, but vanishing fundamental group. And such X, the C. Group and such x since omega one is ample, this means that also its determinant is ample, and so such x is of general type. Okay, so I will the theorem I will present is a somehow gives some other possibility to have to have a convex. So, in which sense, when we do have a lot of We do have a lot of symmetrical differential. Can we say that the fundamental group is infinite? I will get to it precisely. First, let me say why I did consider this kind of problem. And so my point of view was that of exactly of ampleness of vector bundles in general. So second motivation: ampleness, or more in general, sample. Or, more in general, some positivity properties of vector bundles. And so, through this, I can also connect to the theme of this week. And let me say in which sense I want to consider positivity of vector bundle. So, suppose we do have a vector bundle on X. So, the framework where I want to work with when X is compact scalar, but even more generally. Compact Keller, but even more generally, a compact complex manifold. In this case, okay, but this can be stated in general. When do we call ample of positive vector bundle E? Well, in general, there is the following construction. Let me write it here because I will need it later. So we can consider the projectivization of E over X. And by projectivization of by projective space, I do mean the Grothendieck. Space, I do mean the Grotendik point of view. So the space of one-dimensional quotient of a vector bundle. This is a projective space. And therefore, if E is a vector bundle on X, then we have pi star E is a rank R vector bundle on P E, and this carries a natural rank one quotient or tautological rank one quotient, which is OP1. And this has the properties that if we consider its twist, so we tensor this bundle. Tensor this bundle with itself several times, then we get OPM by definition. When x is a point, this is exactly the tautological bundle and its twist. And this has the property that it's pushed forward, it's the symmetric product of. So, pi star of O V E M is P E M is sim and O V. And therefore, global sections of this one here are the same as global sections of the symmetric product of E. And then we can give a definition. Then we say that E is an ample vector bundle if this line bundle is an ample line bundle. And the same we can say to for nestness or other properties. So let's say that E, let's say that E. Let's say that E is ample or nef if or nef on on X if O P E one is emple or nef on P E Yes, yes with amplitude. With amplitude, one can also have various different definitions, in particular, something like the SERT theorems A and B for this for the for this definition of ampleness, or one can take that as definition. The reason I was looking at ampleness is that with Stefan Urbinati, we were looking at some properties of what we call the stable base laws for the vector bundle E. Because if one can show that One can show that if, let's say, if one point over P E, if on one point, or let's say the opposite, if E is globally generated on one on one, if global sections of E generate E on one point, X, then by pulling back, this is surjective, then also this is generated by global sections on all the points above that one. So we were talking. That one. So we were trying to study some relations between the various base loss of this line bundle and some definition of base loss of this vector bundle E. And we could actually define also stable base locus, augmented base locus, restricted base loss, all these kinds of base loss. And they were nicely related with positivity properties of vector bundle. However, there is one, let's say, surprise that we had on studying. Surprise that we had on studying vector bundle and lies in the following definition. So, definition A for amplitude. What about semi-ampleness? Semi-ampleness for a line bundle, it means that some higher tensor product of the line bundle is base point-free, is globally generated. We can give two different definitions for semi-ampleness. We can say that a vector bundle E is weakly semi-ample. If OP1 is semi-ample, and then we can say that E is strongly semi-ample if some symmetric power of E is generated by a global section. So if So if sim ME is generated by global section, it's globally generated for some positive m. So the surprise was to find out that these two properties are actually not equivalent. Of course, if this is globally generated, then for the same reasons that we were stating, there is a surjection from the symmetric product of that to the symmetric product of that, which is OPM. And therefore, also this is. And therefore, also this is globally generated. Some power of this is globally generated. However, the converse is not true. So, in general, big, so weakly semi-ample does not imply strongly semi-ample. And this is the reason for the choosing of the words. This was a big surprise because I remember that when I was a student starting to study vector bundles, To study vector bundles, in some articles, I found the expression: well, these two are obviously equivalent. And so, as all we do, when we are students, we try to prove in any possible way how come that this is obvious. And then it was just a surprise I found out that it's not obvious because it's not true actually. Let me give you a couple of examples on this, which are the motivations of my talk. Of my talk. So, one easy example is the following one. So, counterexample, let's say. So, the first one is the following. Let us pick a curve C. And let us suppose that we have a line bundle in peak zero of C, which is a two torsion line bundle. So, same can happen for M torsion. Same can happen for m torsion. So L tensor 2 is trivial, but L is not trivial. As soon as we have the curve of a genus greater or equal than 1, we have such a line bundle. Then if we pick the vector bundle E, which is also direct sum with L, one can show that this is actually a weakly semi-emple. How to prove this either directly. Either directly. So by hand, one starts computing the OP1 of this one and finds out that the OP2 actually is globally generated. Or one can consider, since this is a flat bundle and it comes from some monodromy representation, one can show that this monodromy representation has one sees directly that the image is Z over 2Z. is z over 2z and therefore the the two the the two the two symmetric power of uh o1 i mean there one has to work it out of course but this is this shows that the two two tensor the second tensor power of o1 is a trivial why is not why is this so this is weakly semi-emplex oh two is trivial On the P E cover it uh you take take uh you place the basic point or two vector functions and back to space right two if I mean if uh you are right you are right uh something. You are right. What happens with the O2? I'm not sure about it. Anyhow, the theorem I want to use is the following one. Look at the monodromy representation of P1. So this is a flat. This is a flat bundle, therefore, we have a mere representation over G2L C. So, if this has a finite image, then the OP1 is a semi-ample. So, this is fair enough. And also, but also yeah, this question of three, I will think about it now. But also, one can look by hand what are. one can look by hand what are generation generators of the sim two of e which are the global sections i mean not generator global section of seam two of e these are the same as the global section of o2 and what are these if we look at the symmetric product m times of e well we have a direct sum and so there are all the all the Some and so there are all the all the components like O and then L and then L square and so on until L M. But since for L all M there is a component of L which has no global section, this can never be globally generated. And this is so if we if we start, if we look at the O2, we have only this part and one can see that actually for global generation See that actually for global generation, one needs only a non-vanishing section, one does not need the triviality. And for a section not to vanish on some point, one just needs it is enough a section of here or here. So this is basically the reason why this is weakly semi-emple. However, the fact that here there are no global sections is a reason why this is not strongly semi-emple. So the example is very simple and shows that actually Actually, there is a counterexample to this equivalence. Why was it thought that in general weakly or strongly are the same? Because for m equal one, this is the same. So for m equal one, this is globally generated if and only if the on P E, if and only if this is globally generated on X. And so this allows one to easily get Get the what? So this is globally generated for m equal one, if and only if this is globally generated. Okay. For m equal one, yes. For m equal one, so the global generation is the same, however not for a higher m, as these examples show. But let me get to a more geometric example, and which is more meaningful. More meaningful to me. And so let us show that there exist varieties that have the cotangent, which is weakly semi-ample, but not strongly semi-am. And the variety is the following. So let us consider a bielliptic surface. So another counterexample. Let us consider a bi-elliptic surface. So, X is the product of two elliptic curves quotiented by a group acting freely. We can also take the group Z2. This is the one particular biolliptic surface. So, this is an etal finite quotient. Since this is it is an et al. It is an etal finite quotient, then let us call pi this quotient. Then, if we consider the pullback of the cotangent bundle on x, it gives us the cotangent bundle on the product of two elliptics, of two elliptic curves, which is trivial. So, pi star of omega 1x is the same as omega 1 e. One E times or F and this is trivial. So it is O2 O2 times. Direct sum. Direct sample. So this is trivial. And therefore, it is obviously globally generated. Therefore, so this one here is globally generated. And in particular, strongly semi-empower. My animal. And this, the fact that under a finite map, there is the pullback of this vector bundle here, which is semi-ample, implies that in particular, omega 1x is weakly semi-ample. Weakly semi-empower. This is because, in particular, the O1 of that, of the pullback, the O1 of the pullback is the same as the pullback of the O1, and therefore being globally generated is stable under finite pullbacks. However, Omega one x is not strongly semi-ample. Why is this? We can say because of the following I mean of the following theorem, but before that stating the theorem, we can observe that a bioliptic surface is a surface of Codeira dimension zero. surface of Codira dimension zero if that if it's if it's suppose that omega one was that was not not its symmetric power but omega one was if that were globally generated then quadratic dimension zero and globally generated implies that this is trivial and therefore it would have to be a an ellip an abelian surface because a trivial trivial cotangent bundle well the same actually holds for a some symmetric product and this is the the And this is the content of the theorem that I want to state. And stated in this way is actually the content of various theorems, of various generalizations. And the reason why we obtain this is because of the first, somehow, of the question on how based loss I are made for vector bounds. Based loss I are made for vector bundles and somehow how these the presents also some the the the converse of L n question. So the theorem is the following and this is I mean with various generality the first time we were looking for something similar is with Urbinati in 2017 and then other we continued some other We continue some other some other on what the z fraction is something like you call by minus one like e and spectrum like l so for the elliptic uh for the elliptic surface yes the the when when we have z two is minus one on one and a translation by two torsion point on the other ones so by the translation this is a free a free action and the quotient has the property that it is a minimal surface and it Minimal surface, and it is one of the let's say classes of minimum surface in the codirea classification for surfaces, and this is why it's called billiptic surface. Sometimes now, this kind of quotients, the quotients of a billion variety are called hyperelliptic varieties. So, hyperelliptic surface, yeah, and by this action, maybe one can imagine why this is not for any symmetric product is not. Any symmetric product is not globally generated because, to be globally generated, one would have to look at some global sections here, so on the pullback, which are invariant by this action. But the action acts by changing the sign somehow. Here they are all constant. So the action acts by changing the sign on one and not changing the other one. Therefore, when we take the symmetric product, there is the same kind of problems. So there is always some component which is not which is. Which is not, which has no invariance. Okay, so but actually, exactly, this kind of computation is really the model for the proof of the following theorem. I state in the part of this theorem is still work in progress, but I try to state as if it were finished. So, in the most general case, so let's suppose that X is compact complex manifold and the dimension. And the dimension of x is equal to n, and then we can define the quadratic dimension of x. Okay, then we have the following properties of omega 1x. So the first one is that if k if we are in codira dimension zero, zero so the same as the the biolliptic surface then omega one x is strongly semi-emple if and only if x is a parallelizable manifold so x is parallelizable manifold Manifold, but this is just another way to say that actually the cotangent of the manifold X is trivial. So this theorem means if we are in quadrature dimension zero, suppose that some symmetric product of the cotangent is globally generated, but in quadratic dimension zero, it means some symmetric product of the cotangent is trivial, then the cotangent is already trivial. This is another interpretation. This is another interpretation of the same property. The second one, well, the work in progress is the fact that the second one I stated for x projective. If s is projective, then omega 1x is weakly semi-emple, if and only if it is an etal quotient of an ability. If it is an etal quotient of an abelian variety, so the biolliptic case is an example. If and only if, let's say, there exists pi from A to X finite et al Galois. Galua cover with A and abelian variety. And then the third point of this theorem is to, well, very partially answer to a converse of the lengthen question. So in this case, with the weak semi-employment, Weak semi-empleness, we can say that if the codaira dimension is not the highest, so if x is not of general type, so if kx is strictly smaller than n, and then omega one x weakly semi-ample implies Implies that the fundamental group of X has infinite cardinality. And so this tells us that, of course, it's not an answer even in this case of the converse to L question. However, there are many, many global sections of a symmetric product of omega one X, so many to global generating. To global generating. In the not general type case, this is enough to imply that we have an infinite fundamental group. And then, in particular, we see the bialictic case here, because in this case, we do have that omega one. Have that omega one is weakly semi-ample, but it cannot be strongly semi-ample because we are in code dimension zero, and otherwise we would have a parallelizable manifold. But the parallelizable manifold in the case of a projective variety, then it is an abelian variety. So here we are X projected. Basically, two Basically, to prove this here, one has to consider the vibration induced by the Kodira maps. So it's called the Itaca vibration for the variety X, and then the fact that this omega 1x is weakly semi-emple, it means that at least birationally, this vibration is a vibration on the fibers are abelian varieties. So this is mainly the reason why this is. This is of an infinite dimensional subgroup because it contains abelian varieties. In the case of a quadrial dimension, N, this etaca vibration is not a vibration, it's just the identity, not the identity, but is, I mean, it's a dimension n, let's say, the basis dimension n. Okay, so this is the reason. Let me just remark that this parallelizable manifold, so A parallelizable manifold. So, in case one, a parallelizable manifold. Well, if X is projective, this means that X is an abelian variety. If X is compact Kaler, this means that X is a torus. And if X is just a compact, complex manifold, it means that X is the quotient of a complex Lie group by a discrete subgroup. This is, I mean, the definition of a parallelizable manifold, it is exactly that the cotangent is trivial. The characterization for compact and complex such manifolds is that it is a Such manifolds is that it is the quotient of a complex Lie group by a discrete subgroup, a compact quotient of a Lie group by discrete subgroup. In any case, here one can see that the tangent space is the cotangent space is trivial. Okay, so this is the state. This is the statement of the theorem. What got me recently to this theorem actually is something I will talk at the end if I have time. So I wanted to try to give also some birational or bimeromorphic characterization of abelian varieties using this kind of positivity properties and codio dimension in the cotangent boundary. So, how about the proof? So, how about the proof of this theorem? Yes, sure. Do you know when it is not this is not one of those cases? So, when it is a finite cover but not a parallelizable? No, no, no, exactly. Okay, what I want what I want to ask is how long we say you know that A1 is what happens there and one. Yes. Yes, so it is the following. Suppose that you do have such a quotient. Yes, you're right. This is a good question. So you suppose you do have a quotient. So it fails exactly like in the billiptic example. So suppose you do have a quotient. So you have A and X, which is And x which is finite equation by a finite reaction of the finite finite group. Then this is an et al map. So, like we were saying, we have, let us call this f. So, we have f star of omega 1x, which is actually omega 1a, but also, of course, f star of the symmetric product m times omega 1x, which is the symmetric product m times. The symmetric product m time of omega one a. Therefore, let's say that the space of global sections of this one over x, these are the same, this is the same or it's isomorphic to the space of global sections over A of this symmetric product here, which is trivial. Behavior, okay. So of sim m omega 1A, but those which are invariant by reaction. So suppose that you do have, I mean, suppose that the ones which are invariant by the action are not all of them, then this space is strictly smaller than this space here. But the dimension of this space, since this is trivial, is exactly the rank of this vector. Exactly, the rank of this vector bundle. So, if you do have a strictly smaller vector space of dimensions strictly smaller than the rank, it can never generate. Okay, so thank you for the question. This is basically, I mean, basically, it is somehow the proof of that fact. So, in order to generate globally, you need that all the invariants. I mean, for some M, you need that the. For some m, you need that the invariance, all sections are invariant. This means that for some m, the action of g is trivial on sim. I mean, and this action here, this space here, of course, is the same as is a vector space, which is sim of h 0 a omega 1 a. So the cotangent space in a point. So we need that, so we do have an action g on this space here, and we need that the And we need that the symmetric product m times of this action is trivial. And then one can see much or less that this happens if and only if the action is by translations on the abelian variety. And therefore, the quotient is another abelian variety. It is an isogeny. The quotient is another abelian variety. Okay, so this basically is the idea of the proof of the Of the first point. So, if you do have that the symmetric product is trivial, then already the omega one is already trivial. Okay, how about the other points? So for the other points, the proof is based on the following factor. The proof in the compact complex case is based on a fact. Fact that somehow, I mean, there are some properties which in the projective case are easy to show. But as we have seen, some even very simple questions on vector bundle and generations, sometimes it's not, I mean, even if one thinks that it is obvious, sometimes it's not so obvious. So the lemma I need for the proof is the following one. Is the following one. So the first point is to show the following thing. Suppose that E is weakly semi-ample, weakly semi-ample vector bundle on X. And suppose that the quadiral dimension of the determinant of E. Of the determinant of E is zero. This means that when you take the tensor product of this line bundle, either you have only one sections or you have no sections. And okay, and suppose furthermore the determinant of E is semi-empod, it's a line bundle, and it is semi-empower. Then what does And if it's semi-empower, then what does this mean? It means that some tensor, this is a torsion line bundle, some tensor product is trivial, and that's all. I have to add this hypothesis because in the compact complex case, I cannot prove that weakly semi-ample implies the determinant of E is ample. This is true for sure on projective varieties, and there is a proof. I don't know what. A proof. I don't know whether it is. Um, I can, I can, I will give you the proof, but I cannot, and it seems to be something which does not depend on really how X is projective or not. However, I cannot, I can, I, I hope I can prove it, but I'm not so sure about it. So I have to add this this this hypothesis. So suppose the determinant of E is my ample, then there exists this finite et al. Galois cover, so F. So f from x till to x finite et al galois cover such that the pullback of E is trivial. One would think that since we have this property, the determinant of E is torsion, then any torsion line bundle. Then any torsion line bundle gives you a cyclic cover of X. So one would think, okay, let's take this cyclic cover and pull back E over there. And this is going to be trivial. Actually, one has to work a little bit more. However, it is true that there exists a finite cover which is trivial. And then you can extend it to a Galois cover. Okay, then, so this is one point. And then one can apply to omega one of x one once that one knows that this property holds. And this means that there is a finite Galois cover with the with the, since it's finite Galois, there will be omega one of X t, which is trivial, and therefore, in such a way we do have the abelian variety. However, the second point concerns this. Concerns this hypothesis. So if E is strongly semi-ample, this means that some symmetric product is globally generated. Then one takes the determinant of the symmetric product. This will be power of the determinant of E, and therefore this is globally generated. Therefore, determinant of E is semi-ample as well. Is semi-ample as well. So, this is for strong semi-ampleness, this is immediate. Third point, which is the one I wanted to talk about because it's really a very buzzy question, and so I'm a bit annoyed that I cannot be sure about the answer, is the following. Suppose that E is weakly semi-ample. And that X is projective, then the determinant of E is semi-ample. Therefore, for X projective, we just need this if we are in codiral dimension zero, codireal dimension. Are in quadrial dimension zero, quadiral dimension is exactly of a variety, the quadrature dimension of the C1, so the determinant of omega one, and we are done. So, what I'm saying is that we can apply points one, two, and three to omega x. And therefore, we have f star of omega one x isomorph is isomorphic to omega one of x tilde. This is trivial for some finite voloir cover f in the case that we have. In the case that we have omega one, which is strongly semi-ample, but also weakly semi-ample with this property. So we are in the case codira dimension zero. And then one has to, one can argue also if we are weak, say my ampleness and the the the this uh say property of the of the determinant, then this means exactly that there exists a finite Goloa cover. That there exists a finite Goloa cover, and then the difference is what I was talking about. So, the presence of strong semi-ampleness implies that this finite Galois cover is actually an isogeny of abelian varieties, because the group acts by translation. So, this is the idea of the theorem. So, let me finish with the question. So, why do we need projectivity? Projectiveness, projectivity here. And so, this is the question that I would like to address now. Let us show what happens in the projective case. So, the theorem would be, I think, I don't know, I can state it as a theorem of Fujivara because this is the reference that I, when I looked for this, I found, even though when I was asking, yeah. Even though, when I was asking around, it's considered to be a well-known fact. And so, it's the following: suppose that we have X projective variety. By projective, I mean smooth, of course, a smooth projective variety. Suppose that E is weakly semi-ample. So, this O1 is the OM is globally generated for some M, then. For some m, then the determinant of E is semi-amp. So, how to prove this and why for the proof I need projectivity? The proof is fairly simple. So, since we know that O1 is semi-emple, it means that some high power of O1 gives us an embedding. One gives us an embedding. An embedding of what? An embedding of PE. So we have. But you're asking the deep semi-ample question. Yes, weakly semi-ample, it means that O1 is semi-ample. So some power of O1 gives us a power of O1 is globally generated. Therefore, it gives us a map, the map by the linear system. Therefore, what do we have in the semi-emple case, in the weekly semi-emple case? So the semi-emple. Emplement, so the semi-empleness of this one, we do have a map to some projective space, some pn. And in order to have this map, we do not need the projectivity of x. We do have the map as a complex marine. Now we can pick the proof. This is the proof of Ujivara. So we can pick our general sections of OPEM. Let us call them sigma 1. Let us call them sigma one, sigma r in h zero x or p m on p yes where r is the rank of the original vector bundle so the dimension So the dimension of PE is n the dimension of x plus the dimension of fibers, which is r minus one. So if we pick our general sections, then we can call v the zero locus of these sections. Okay, now this is inside PE. Now, Now, if we are all projective, we can work with the Chow groups. And I don't know whether it's called the projection formula. I mean, one can compute the classes in the Chao groups. And so we have, let us call V its class. This will be, yes, this will be one segregate class. So I will call it V. I will call it V, which will be, since we are intersecting hyperplanes, our hyperplanes in CHR of PE. And then we have a projection map. And if we look at this class here, if we have the C1, so this class here will be the same as M times C1 of E. This is one second. Of E, this is one section, to the power R. And this is the same as M to the power R C one of D to the power R. So once we push forward this class to the variety X, we get, by a computation, we get a push forward of, let's say, of the class B. Say of the class B in X, it will be in CH1. Okay, so we have of X. And which class will this be? It of O1, you are right. Of OPE1. These are. Yes, yes, yes. These are because every single one is just a hyperplace actually. Yes, yes, sorry. O P E one. And then when we look at the push forward, this will be the same as M to the power R. So M to the power R, the push forward of this one. Push forward of C E O C E O E one to the power r messing with the parentheses and and this is actually the determinant of E. We are in the chow group, so the class, the chow one, this is exactly the same as the peak one, the peak of the variety. Therefore, we have a class in here. This class is the terminal. As is determinant, as element of the peak one, it is determinant of it tensor mr times, because it's mr, this is one here. So now what happens? Suppose that we have C one by lowering the C one. Oh, you mean underneath? Yes, I'm under this isomorphic, I'm mixing up. mixing up so under this isomorphism under this isomorphism we could say here this is the determinant determinant of to the power m mr okay because i mean the formula gives us the i don't know whether these are called exactly projection formulas or formulas for segregated classes i don't know but it's a this is a usual computation in the in the chow groups involving exactly the definition if we want of chow classes of a of a churn of Classes, of a churn, of churn classes, and the fact that the child group of this one is a module over here. So we are in this case, but now what happens? We have to think about what is this V. So assume, suppose that V is empty, what does it mean? It means that we can intersect this global section and they give us the empty cycle, so they give us zero. And so this means. So they give us zero. And so this means that this is actually trivial. What happens if this is not empty? Well, let us pick a point on X, so a point below. When we pick a point on X, well, the fiber over this point is exactly the projective space over the fiber of the vector bundle here. So if we pick a point on X, the fiber will have dimension. The fiber will have dimension r minus one. But when we are intersecting r times, cutting by hyperplanes here, it is the same as we look at the image here. We cut by hyperplanes, r times something of dimension r minus one. So we are in the empty set again. So this means the following. If we fix an x, we can choose sigma one m sigma. sigma one and sigma r so that when we consider the intersection of this one here which is pi minus one of x with this variety v this is empty okay but then this means that x does not belong to the image of this variety d and now the computation of child And now the computation of Chow groups tells us that actually, when we look at the image of V, either it is zero or either it is zero or it is a cycle supported on a divisor. And so we are saying that X does not belong to this divisor here, but this divisor here is a divisor which is in the linear system of this determinant. To the power m mr, m to the r. And so this means exactly that we can choose the global section for any given point, and this means exactly that this is semi-m. Let's say the term, this implies that the terminal of E is generated by global, the x is not a base point, so it's generated by. X is not a base point, it's generated by global sections on X. Yes, I mean, but you know, when we have a compact complex manifold, because it's compact, X is compact. So if we have a compact, complex manifold which is embedded in Pn, it will be algebraic. No, no, this is the hypothesis. Hypothesis. I'm saying you don't need a hypothesis. You said you need an x to be saying you just need x to be ah okay okay you're right it's more it's more general it's more general it's slightly more general x could be a proper algebraic variety uh not necessarily embedded in in pm you're right x is proper proper and algebraic but what puzzles me is that apart from the use of child groups in the proof there is there In the proof, there is not algebraicity. I mean, there is in the tool we use, but somehow. And so one can wonder: okay, what happens in the non-algebraic setting? Well, we do have this sub-complex space, what is it called? Well, let's say sub-manifold. We do have this sub-manifold V. But if we are forced to work with homology classes instead of Classes instead of Chow groups, we do not obtain an element in here. And this is strange because, I mean, at least if one, I would like to try and work it out at least locally, because locally, this PE, it is as algebraic as one can imagine. And it also has the fibers, which are the fibers here, they have a map to PN. And these are the maps that we use. So, and the kind of result it doesn't really seem to need the algebraic. So, this is the. And the assumption of that O1, right, as is base 13, is this map, that means that gives you sections of this bundle, right? Yes. And if I take the image of a section and then I I take the image of a section and then I follow yes, yes, yes. We can apply this argument for sure. I think, I mean, for sure, what we can say is that if the, I mean, there is a macro X to project in space. That's all I want to say. And no, no. This is from P of E. We could also have. Yes, the image of a section is mapped to PN. Yes, the image of a section is mapped to Pn. Yes, this works. But what we do not get is a section of the determinant if X is not algebraic. So we do have the, let's see. So one has to show that one with this construction, you do obtain sections, you do obtain a sub-variety. In here, the image of this sub-variety, one has to show that the image of this sub-variety. One has to show that the image of this sub-variety, either it is empty or it is a divisor. But even in the empty case, suppose we have the image is empty, we don't have a section of the determinant, which is, we don't have triviality of the determinant. In the empty case, in the algebraic setting, if V is empty, then it is the zero cycle, then the image is the zero cycle, and then we are saying that actually this determinant here. This determinant here is linearly equivalent to the zero cycle, so to the trivial line bundle. Okay, well, this is a good because I tried to use like forms, scalar forms, currents, but still I couldn't obtain a section of a line bundle. So maybe, yes. So maybe, yes, maybe the. I'm not very familiar with the K-naught, but maybe it is the good tool to work with. Yes. C1 of a line bundle and take the area as one minus the two of the line. So we missed. Okay. Well, maybe this is a good advice. This is a good advice. So, this is the question, the question that I still have about all this work. Let's say that then the constructions are fairly easy. It's not really, I mean, even in this proof, there is not something really, really very technical or complicated. There is this problem and this question, and then everything that I showed in the theorem, everything follows. I will not write anything else. Will not write anything else. Let me tell you that I tried to, why was I interested in the compact complex case or also in the Kaler case? Because I was trying to give also some... So this somehow we can interpret this as a characterization of abelian variety. Maybe not so strong because we are saying that an abelian variety is characterized by having the trivial cotangent band. Or what we are saying here is the trivial symmetric power of the cotangent bond. So not very strong. Cotangent bound, so not very strong, but it is a characterization of abelian varieties. I was trying to give a bimeromorphic or a birational characterization as well. And what happens if you take a blow-up of an abelian variety? Well, the cotangent is not anymore globally generated because on the exceptional locus, it's not generated by global sections. However, there are global sections of the cotangents, which comes from below, and this generates everywhere except in the exceptional locus. And so the same happens for a symmetric product. happens for isymmetric product so my characterization was the following suppose that you have a variety codiral dimension zero and suppose that the cotangent bundle has this property you pick its symmetric product and its global section generated in on an open dense subset then the variety must be birational to an abelian variety this was my question and the answer is yes but in order to prove it again i need some uh some more hypotheses Some more hypotheses. So, what I need is that X admits a minimal model program classification. So, it admits a minimal model with abundance in the minimal model. Then I can use all the tools, the recent tools of characterizing varieties with the trivial canonical class, and then I can work it out and I make this theorem works. But the hypothesis of having to use a very strong tool like minimal model program was a bit annoying to me because I thought, okay, but it's really too. Me because I thought, okay, but it's really topological considerations. So I tried to see what extends to the compact Taylor case, what does it extend to the compact complex manifolds, and so on. And therefore, I was looking to this. Okay, with this, I am done. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. To finish the workflow. So, if there are there is more questions, there are more questions from the audience here. Mark? I'll add later. Okay. Okay. What about the chat? No. Then we can ring. Okay, yes, I'm the last speaker.
