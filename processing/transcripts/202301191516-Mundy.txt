Thanks for the introduction. Thanks for the presentation and the organization. So I'm going to talk about a number of things, I guess, that are listed on the title part here. At the end, so the first half will be about sort of all of these things. Then at the end, I will, or I guess in the second half, Or, I guess, in the second half, I'll focus more on the pianic deformation, automorphic representations part of the story. So that's sort of what the second thing means there. To get started, oh, I got wrong direction. To get started, I'm going to just state the main theorem. Let me, there's a little hand on that. Cool. State the main theorem. Cool. State of the main theorem. So the setup for the main theorem is as follows. So I'm going to fix a prime p. p can even be 2, I'm pretty sure. And I'm going to fix an eigenform, just a GL2 eigenform, that I'm going to call the F with even weight at least 4. You can probably say a little bit why at least 4 here in a moment, but even weight K at least 4. You can make k at least 4. Level n with p not dividing n, and trivial central character, trivial net character. And then to this we can attach, as usual, a custom automorphic representation of GL2 and as well a Galois representation of the absolute Galois Q into GL2 of QP bar, let's say. I'm going to just work with the coefficients in the algebra. Coefficients in an algebraically closed field for the Galois representations. Okay, so the main theorem looks like this. So I'm going to assume a number of conditions, one of which, many, I think most of which are mild, and the first, maybe in order of mildness, or in reverse order of mildness, I guess. So order of severity, if you want. So I want the I want the L function, the symmetric Q L function of this automorphic representation attached to pi to vanish at its central value to odd order. The odd order is sort of the, you need this to vanish, period, in order for this to conjecturally be true, but the odd orderedness is the heavy hypothesis here. I'm going to also assume that f is not cm. For a technical reason, I'm going to assume 4 and 9 do not. Reason I'm going to assume 4 and 9 do not divide n. So if you want, you could just imagine n is not applied 2 or 3. It's okay. And that the hecca polynomial f at p has simple roots, which is conjectured to be true, I think, in general, but I'm going to assume it because we don't know this version in general. So then, and then here's another severe hypothesis. Under Arthur's conjectures, I'll say a little bit more about Arthur's conjectures. I'll say a little bit more about Arthur's conjectures for what in a moment. Under Arthur's conjectures, we have that this Block Cardo Selma group is not trivial. This Block Cado Selma group is the one you'd expect to be... I think I have a comment about this. Yes. The Block Cado Selma group is the one that you would expect to be, whose rank you would expect to be equal the order of vanishing of this L function at its central value. So this is just So, this is just the appropriate twist you have to put in, given the conventions that I've taken here. Are there any questions about the statement of the theorem? No? Okay. So then let me make a few remarks about it. So I want to first note that in the special case that the level of the modular form big F is 1, As 1, then the four bulleted hypotheses in the theorem before are automatically satisfied. Let me actually go back up to them so you can see them again. Of course, 4 and 9 do not divide 1. f is not cm in level 1. And in fact, this L function does vanish to odd order in the central value at the sine of the functional equation, always minus 1 in the level 1 case, for the symmetric cube L function. In general, Yeah, in general. And then the heck of polynomial F does not have simple roots, that's essentially a computation of what you need. And so the theorem then reads: this summer group doesn't vanish under R. So the proof of the main theorem will then make use of a p-adic deformation of automorphic representations, and it will turn this pedic family of automorphic representations into a p-iadic family of Galois representations. This p-iadic family of Galois representations Family of Galois representations will be the source of this non-trivial class in the cylinder. It'll come via some kind of extension via a Skinner-Ur-Braun type RT or a Rivet type RT. And the automorphic representations involved here are on the exceptional group G2, which I'll recall a little bit about in a moment. And then finally, I'll remark on Arthur's conjectures. Remark on Arthur's conjectures is that you need both the local and the global conjectures for these things. So, proving a multiplicity formula for cat forms on G2, so cat forms are just plus boards that look like Eisenstein series, hecka theoretically. You need to study those cat forms at infinity, so this is like proving that these cat forms are actually the Cap forms are actually the G2 analog and polymorphic, so they're quaternionic, actually. And then you also need hardware to get cases of functoriality from G2 to GL7 in order to construct the Galois representations you need. On to G2 for a bit. I'm going to take G2 to be this group, which gives you absolutely no intuition about how this group looks. How this group looks. Except that you get a little bit of feeling of, you know, if you're used to root systems, you get a little bit of feeling of how maybe parabolics and unified radicals look inside of this group from this, but otherwise this gives you essentially no intuition. Although this is how I think of the group, really. I think of it as some group that has some two-dimensional torus, which is. It has some two-dimensional torus, which is like, oh, I can use the pointer, which is like this point right here. And then you have a Borel, which is these six roots right here, six-dimensional unipod and radical of that borel, and you have an opposite borel. And these things, these different parabolics, will intersect in different ways, et cetera. So let me say a little bit about that, because it will be important. So just remember that I'm denoting the long root by alpha and the short root by beta, which I think is actually. Which I think is actually somewhat backwards than what you see in a lot of the literature, so I apologize for that. But alpha is the more important root here, so that's why I'm giving a priority in the alpha thing. Right, so you have, because you have a log simple root alpha, you have a parabolic whose levy contains the uniform group attached to that root. And you also have another parabolic that I call a p-check that will contain. That are called PCHEC that will contain the short root. So P is the long root parabolic, P-Check is therefore the short root parabolic. And both the levies are isomorphic to GL2. And the reason I'm giving these notations right here with the check is that G2 is isomorphic to its own dual group. And if you pass the dual side, you're essentially switching the two long short groups for each other. So the con-group attached to the long root would become. The cow root attached to the long root will become the short root on the dual side. Let's see. Well, okay, let me ask if there are questions about this or anything so far. Okay. So we're going to examine some automorphic representations for this group and we're going to locate certain automorphic representations in cohomology. Automorphic representations in cohomology. So the first step is to locate this, or to define an Eisenstein series and locate it in cohomology. In a way, I'll make it more precise. So for this step, so I'm going to, throughout these three steps, the hypotheses that I had in the first, in the slide on the main theorem, will sort of triple in. So at the beginning, you can Do things quite generally. So n is arbitrary. There's no p in this first step on cohomology anywhere. So f is even allowed to be cn, but you just want to assume that the l function vanishes, not necessarily to automorphism. It's a metric Q of L function. Under these hypotheses, what we want to do is parabolically induce this automorphic representation attached to our modular form along this long root parabolic. Long root parabolic. But remember, the long root parabolic, or either parabolic, but in particular the long root parabolic, has Levy which is GL2. So you can identify this pi F as an automorphic representation of a Levy of this P. You'll get something that I'm calling big pi, which is an automorphic representation of G2. More precisely, it's the unique irreducible quotient of this induction I've written here right in the middle. Right in the middle. So maybe a couple comments. This induction, I guess the way I've written it is a non-unitary induction, so I'm making it unitary by inserting this 1 half here. And then this 1 tenth is an extra normalization factor you have to throw in to get everything to match up with the central value of the symmetric QBL function. I'll say where the symmetric QBL function appears here in a moment. So. So, maybe I can even say now where the symmetric cube L function appears here. So, when you build the Eisenstein series out of this parabolic induction, the symmetric cube L function right here appears in the constant terabyte-Eisenstein series. And it appears at the value s equals one-half because of this one-tenth that I've put here. So, if you assume that this Uh so if you assume that this uh L function vanishes in this then the um the Eisenzide series is holomorphic at that point that at that point s equals 110 I guess. So does it appear in like should be 100? Yes, yes. And so yes, exactly. So this is the Langman Shahidi method, exactly. You see that the Eisenstein series will have a constant term that looks like a section and then some intertwined section times an L function. An L function vanishes because of this and therefore you get a regular Eisenstein series. And therefore, you get a regular Eisenstein space. More precisely, the L function vanishing cancels out a certain pole in the order 20 hour. So when you say hole van, you mean like it's holomorphic in the S parameter? In the S parameter. Exactly. Sorry, yes. Yeah. There are no holomorphic automorphic forms on G2. There are only quaternion automorphic forms. G2, they're only quants already on a holomorphic close like G2. When I say holomorphic, I mean in the parameter that I'm inserting one-tenth into right here. So then what we want to do is locate, for reasons I'll explain in a moment, we want to locate the finite part of this unique irreducible quotient of this induction in the cohomology attached to the locally symmetric spaces coming from G2. And so And so, when I write this expression right here, what I mean is I'm taking the locally symmetric space attached to D2 and a compact open subgroup of the finite and L's. And I'm taking that compact open subgroup, that level subgroup, to get smaller and smaller. And I'm taking the direct limit of the associated cohomology spaces. And this will carry an action of G2 of the finite index. Of G2 of the finite analysis. This is what I mean by locating a finite ideal representation inside of that colon. So the weight lambda naught in this coefficient system right here is just my shorthand for this particular weight. This weight is multiple of the rate. Multiple of the root that was pointing upwards in the root lattice for G2. So, in particular, it's a non-regular wave, and that will come up again later, the fact that it's not regular. Okay. Oh, yeah, like what the middle dimension is maybe. Oh, sorry, yeah, that's a good question. So, the middle dimension is 4. This thing is 14 minus. This thing is 14 minus 6 dimensional, this xg2 here. And so the middle dimension is. And a priori, like how many dimensions is going to make you will be GT. Like how many dimensions by the floor of this cohomology a priori can kind of come? Oh. So the question was how many uh like which degrees the cohomology can leak into away from middle? Yeah. Can leak into a way from middle. Yeah. Okay. So this, this, at least for this particular pi f, it could possibly appear in degree 4, or it can appear in degrees 3 and 5. Those are the only places it will ever appear. That's something I can show. And I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment. Okay. So we need to locate pi f separately. Separately in both Eisenstein coavology. So Eisenstein coevology is, well, the way I would define it is the image of Eisenstein series, or the natural complement built out of Eisenstein's series to the cusp forms inside of the space of all automorphic forms. I would embed, I would take the space of all automorphic forms and view its GK cohabology. Cohomology as the cohomology I wrote down on the previous slide using Frack's theorem. But in any case, so there's a complement to the customable cohomology called the Eisenstein cohomology, and I need to locate this automorphic representation in there, or the finite part of it. And the way you would do that is, like I said, you get some regularity for this, for the Eisenstein series coming from this. This is some holomorphicity. The Eisenstein series that you build out of pi in this way, big pi, are holomorphic at infinity. And so you can describe the piece of the Franker-Schwermer decomposition that contains them. So the Frank-Schürmer decomposition is a decomposition of the space of automorphic forms into particular spaces of Eisenstein series and cusp forms. And the space of Eisenstein series, you can. And the space of Eisenstein series, you can actually compute the GK cohomology of that explicitly, and this is how you compute every instance of pi f in Eisenstein cohomology. And then in custom cohomology, you have to find these cap forms that I mentioned earlier. These cap forms are cus forms that at every finite place will look like this pi f. You have to use Arthur's conjectures and Arthur's multiplicity formula in order to make predictions. In order to make predictions about exactly what these cat forms look like. And in particular, you need to know what they look like at infinity. And by knowing what they look like at infinity, you see just by a GK cohomology computation what degrees of cohomology there appear in. So Matt's question, with respect to Matt's question, if the sine of the symmetric cube functional equation is minus one, then I can prove that. Can prove that using methods in real leaders due to Adams and Johnson, that this Eisenstein theory, or this Caplor will be quaternionic at infinity and then will appear in middle degree 4. Otherwise, it's a non-tempered Language quotient of a induction of discrete series from GL2. And that non-tempered representation will appear in degrees 3 and 5. Well, I have appear in degrees 3 and 5. This is how you see it. How do you know that you're going to cut? Like, you get to make a scrolling good, but how do you know that it's cut? So you use the first bullet point, you use the methods of the first bullet point to rule out any residual Eisenteits groups. You do get it essentially from Rockerschormer plus Arthur's conjecture is pure. Any other questions before I move on? Yeah, I guess this is what I was saying. It depends what the sign of the functional equation for the symmetric cube is, but you get it in degrees 4 or 3 and 5. And we're interested in the case where it appears in degree 4, middle degree. And that's when the sign of the functional equation is transformed. Okay. So step two is Step two is making the pi addic deformation of this pieth, or more precisely, a certain p-stabilization of this pieth. I'll come back later to what I mean by that. But for now, we're assuming that p now does not divide n, so p now comes into the picture, and the sine of the symmetric cube functional equation is minus one, and therefore this cat form should have, and in Eisenstein's theory should both appear in. And in Eisenstein's theory, it should both appear in degree four. So you take a certain critical p-stabilization of this. So I'll come back to what I mean by that in a moment. It's akin to picking a certain, like in the, you imagine you were working with GL2 automorphic forms instead of G2 automorphic forms. It's the same as picking a root of the heck of polynomial IP. I'll come back to that when I talk about this a bit more thoroughly. About this step more thoroughly. Can we just remember you remote like an ordinary app system? So the slopes can be slopes can be anything. The slopes for the GL2 form can be anything. There's no ordinary app. There's a sensor which you can still detect in G2 like a critical some kind of yeah they're they're they're going to be there's so yeah when you pass to G2 you have one piece stabilization for every One piece stabilization for every group, every element of the bio group, so for every, in this case, 12 different piece stabilizations, and some of them are critical, and some of them could be ordinary if the form you started with was ordinary, et cetera. We have to take one that's critical in order for the Galois side to, you know, the Pianic Hodge theory on the Galois side to work. But what happens with the Galois ones? The other ones, you could try to do the same thing, and I guess like Trying to do the same thing, and I guess what probably what happens is you would obtain an element almost in the Solmer group, except that it may not be crystalline, I think. It's not big, but the critical is not. Maybe you need some attention just to make sure that in your family enough just moving to the cat family. I really like this big way, but like you don't have to like your job to buy any family and any kind of cat. In any kind of capital. Oh, but you actually do want that to happen. This will be a two-dimensional family. So you could have a one-dimensional family of cat form slash Eisenstein series along that 2 alpha plus 3 beta line. And then when you move this way, you'll. So the stabilization is not guaranteeing the caspo relative non-catness, it's just a dimension. Right. Right, yes. Cool. Exactly. So moving this way in the root lattice gets you away from the capness, away from the Eisensteinness of the family, and moving this way preserves the Eisensteinness. So one uses the location of this pi sub f inside of comology to compute a cuspidal over-convergent multiple. A cosmodal over-convergent multiplicity of this pi-f crit. And this cosmodal over-convergent multiplicity is another thing that I will get to in the second half of the talk. But it depends on the classical multiplicity, as I just said, of If and cohomology. And discussional organic multiplicity can only be shown to be non-zero when the sign of the symmetric cube functional equation is minus one. Because it essentially Essentially, there's a difference of three between the plus one and the minus one case due to the fact that this cat form will appear in degrees three and five instead of four. So when you're alternating some over degrees of multiplicities, the difference between minus two and one, I guess, is three. In any case, then you'll get a pietic deformation of this piF crit and a genetic. This piF crit in a generically customable family over all the anti-lights of G2. And one wants to use the theory of types for G2, which is due to Finson in this case, to show that the members of this cuspidal family at the bad primes, the primes dividing n, have the same ramification properties as IF itself. So like when you're deforming into cus forms, you don't get anything more ramified at More ramified at the primes dividing kind of. This is important for the Galois side to show that the class you construct is, the seller class you construct is really unramified at those primes dividing. But I think that's all I'm going to say about the primes dividing F in these cases. Okay? And then you pass to the Galois side. And when you do that, you have to assume that F is not CF, so that the Galois representation has large enough image. Representation has large enough image. In particular, the sim square and the sim cube will be irreducible. Maybe I, maybe, or maybe not. I'm not sure whether I'll say anything about the sim square in its multiple. Maybe it's too. Okay, so you construct this Galois representation, which you should view as a family of Galois representations. This Galois representation is a representation of the absolute Galois group of Q into G2, the R. So you pass to the fraction field of this family E, or sorry, of the ring of rigid analytic functions on this family E. Pass to the fraction field, you take the algorithm closure, and you have a representation to G2 of that. And it sort of interpolates in some way the Gala representations attached to each of the cus forms that are in E. So to do this, you actually use the LaForc pseudo character. Actually, use the LaForque pseudo-characters to make sure that these are feature valid. You construct a particular lattice. I'm not going to say in this case what I mean by lattice, that would be a different talk. L inside of row E, and what you do is you specialize that lattice at the original point in E that corresponds to this pi F crit. And what that does is it gives you, I can show you what gives you into GL7 essentially. I can say a little bit. Say a little bit. So this row F, what this gives you, when you specialize in IF grit, is a representation that looks like this. Yes, this is correct. Minus over here. So this is a seven by seven matrix. G2 has a seven dimensional representation. Has a seven-dimensional representation. These blocks sort of correspond to the short root levy, which you're seeing on the dual side because you started with a long root levity on the root side. And essentially what you're going to do is you're going to find right in here, this guy is going to give you your extension, I guess I called it sigma, inside of the Selma group right there. And so this looks like it, if you write down the Selma group for For if you write down x1 of this by this, then what you're getting is something six-dimensional because there are six, I mean, something, you're getting a similar group of some six-dimensional Galois representation. You're getting, I guess, this times this dual or something, or maybe one of the, I think this times this dual is what you're getting. And that decomposes into a simcube and a standard. And that standard. Standard, and that standard goes away because this factors through G2. The image of the star, when you project to the standard Selmer group, vanishes because this whole thing factors through G2. This is sort of where the, right here is where it matters that you have some square big image. Yes? Will you need to know that those other stars are trivial? So the question is: do I need to know that the other stars are stars? Uh so the question is, do I need to know that the other stars are trivial? Um you need to know this one is trivial. This one is dual to this one. So these two are linked by duality. And this one, showing this one is trivial is somewhat hard, but it can be done. This is analogous to like in Skinner or Bob's work on GSP4, they need to show that some extension of Qp by Qp of 1 is trivial. This is analogous to that. Twist. This by this twisted by one. I was going to message what you were saying with the G2 versus GL7. Here you have an extension of the squared by F. Right, so this entire thing in GL7, this entire representation of GL into GL7, factors through G2 inside of GL7. And that's the transition from the sigma on the board to the E on the screen. The E on the screen. Yes. Okay. Yes. So, well, that's the translation from the specialization of this L to this sigma here. Or this E. Thank you. Any other questions? Okay, so if there are no more questions, let me just give you a picture of the whole method here. All method here, just very quickly. So, this is what I call the Skinner-Urban method because Skinner-Ur-Brand were the sort of the first ones to do it from GL2 to GSP4. So we start with a Levy, GL2 Levy, induce our, I guess in this case it's our pi F here, up to a big pi up here, G equals G2. And you want to sort of build extension. To sort of build an extension of something over here, or maybe something composed with a, in this case, the sign cube of this thing. You want to build an extension of that by the trivial, or extension of the trivial representation by that. The way you do that is you pass to the speaker group, consider a family of Galois representations on the other side, and you specialize to a To the original point in this family right here via some lattice that you construct. This is just a general, you know, a somewhat general picture, but in this case we apply it to g equals g2 and pi equals pi. Say that one more time. Uh s say that one more time. So you have the right star volumitions in your matrix. Oh yeah, exactly like if you're checking these onions. So uh the question is why do I need to know that the upper right star vanishes? Um what do I is that what I need to know? I need to uh for a second uh sorry. Sorry, I guess I don't need to know that the upper right star vanishes. I need to know that it's somehow determined by this star. Essentially, I mean, what should I say? Yeah, no, it's not that it vanishes, because it won't vanish. You can't build an extension like this with this dual to that without this. Like this, with this dual to that, without this being non-zero. But I guess what I need to know is that it's not crucial. It's not so crucial, yeah. Maybe I can come back to this at the end. Yeah. Okay. Right. There are several ways you could try to organize this. This so when you specialize the lattice, you could have like an extension over here instead, or something like this, and that would mean you swap these two factors, and then you want to know something about the star that should appear there. They know that it really is in the correct order. But anyway, yeah, I can answer this after, I think. Okay, so now I'm going to talk more about the theatic family of automorphic representations called step two. So I'm going to focus on step two now. So, I'm going to focus on step two now. The overview of step two was to construct this family Curly E, forming a finite part of our Eisenstein series, but really a destabilization of it, using Urban's eigenvariety. And as I mentioned, G2 does have discrete series, and Urban's eigenvariety is an eigenvariety that is constructed for groups with discrete series. Is constructed for groups with discrete series. And the family E will really be a family of representations, not a family of physical forms. So you're not deforming modular form or automorphic forms on G2, you're deforming automorphic representations. And I'll say what I mean, what this means, what kind of object the Pianic family E is eventually. Okay, so there are several preliminaries to get through. I hope some of them. I hope some of them, it's mostly notation. I hope some of them I've chosen good notation so you can keep everything in your head. But in any case, let's start with this. So, B is the fixed Borel inside of G2. It has maximal torus I'm calling T, and U to put radical U. And then I'm going to fix a level subgroup inside of G2 of the finite NLs such that my automorphic representation, or the finite part of my automorphic representation pi. Auto representation pi has fixed vectors by this level subgroup Kfp. So Kf away from P, right? So this is a subgroup of, compact open subgroup away from P, and then I take a hyperspecial level at P here. So I want there to be fixed vectors by this. And since P does not divide N, there are fixed vectors by some. There are RFX vectors by some group like this. And then we're going to take I instead of G2 of ZP to be the Iwahori subgroup at P. So it's defined this way. It's everything that reduces to the Borel modulo P instead of G2 of ZP. And then in order to define a certain Hecke algebra on the next page, I need to say that there's a certain monoid inside of the QP points of the torus T defined. The Taurus T defined in this way. They're everything that shrinks the unipod and radical network CPU values into itself, further into itself. So I guess the way you should think about this T plus is that it's spanned by dominant co-characters evaluated at P, essentially. Dominant, including the trivial co-characters. Including the trivial program, right? The element one is in this group, or in this monoid. We use that monoid to build this HECA algebra of UP operators. I'm calling it curly UP, as Eric does on this paper. This is the ZP subalgebra of the Hecke algebra, the ZP value in Hecke algebra, Kibahori Hecke algebra, defined by. Yuvahori algebra defined by, or generated by elements of this form. So I divide by the volume of the Yuvahori, and I take the characteristic function of the double coset given by any of these things of T plus. In any case, I can build, so that's the HEC algebra we're interested in FP. Away from P, it's just the full HEC algebra of KFP bioinvariant functions on. KFP bioinvariant functions on G2AFP evaluated QP. This is a QP Heke algebra. It's a fact a sub algebra of the Hecke algebra for G2 right here with coefficients C as long as we identify QP as a subfield of C. And we can do that just by fixing the seismic office. Now we have our groups, we have our Heck algebras, and then we can use everything to define. Then we can use everything to define certain distributions on these Hecke algebra. For a dominant integral weight of the torus, I'm going to define this distribution. So I'm going to take the cuspidal cohomology. Remember, this is defined as a certain direct limit over all cusmital cohomology groups of symmetric species attached to G2 with values in this coefficient system determined by this weight. So I'm going to This weight. So I can trace Heka operators instead of this thing right here on them. So I could have also, by the way, fixed the level subgroup to be Kf at P, Kf away from P, sorry, here, and also maybe Hiwahori level at P. So it doesn't really matter. The trace is defined essentially by taking those invariants. Okay. Okay. Then I want to sort of deform, or Eric or Bob wants to deform this, these distributions over p-adic weights, not just these dominant integral weights mu. So one defines this weight space to be, in this way, to be continuous homomorphisms from the ZPD points of T into L cross, that's the L valued points of this weight space. L-valued points of this weight space for L over TPF finite extension. So it defines some rigid analytic affinoid space. And a weight mu, a dominant weight mu, like this, is just defined by, you know, you take an element of this torus, you evaluate mu on it, and you get an element of QP cross. And that sits inside of any such element. Okay, and then, so we're going to define. And then, so Irvan defines for any such mu a certain distribution. I'm not going to define it here, but he defines a certain distribution of the Hecke algebra denoted like this. So this is zero down here is meant to look like a cuspidal distribution. This thing is meant to look like over-convergent. This weight, and then there are some decorations having to do with the level subgroup and the weight. And here you can insert a heck operator, you get an element. Insert a heck operator, you get an element of QP bar. And moreover, these distributions vary analytically in mu. So there's some distribution into an affenoid over, sorry, the affinoid algebra of x, whose specializations at dominant integral and regular weights mu contain these classical. Contain these classical distributions I define earlier. So contain means these are directs, these are sum ends of these. And what does it mean if there be a sum end? It means that there are other representations whose traces are living in here such that these form the complement of those other representations. Other mules, well, what do you mean by other representations? Other, sorry. representation other sorry so there so this this guy right here is the trace of a uh of is I guess a convergent p-etic sum of traces of smooth admissible representations of this hec of the of the Hecke algebra right here and this is a sub sum n of that psi that's what I mean does that make sense but you're simply the dagger theme is on something a little easier than So the comment was that you should view these as the traces of hec operators on all classical forms. This is a, and the space of all classical forms should morally be a subspace of the space of all over convergent forms. Converging forms. And so you see this trace as a sum, or as a constituent of that trace. But is the difference between the over-convergent and the classical one in this case, also the over-convergent one, like the vial shifts of mu, or the non-trivial one to the bile? Say that one more time. Like, is the over-convergent one minus the classical one equal to the sum of the over-convergent ones, except evaluated at shifts of the weight mu by vial elements? Yes. Violence. Yes. So this. Oh, okay. Maybe that's a good question. There's a BGG spectral sequence, which I just wanted to check if that theory was kind of happening. Yes, it is. And as long as you remove the zero. Okay. So I'll get to that in a moment. Okay, great. So then I could say what I mean by p-stabilization now. So it's irreducible smooth G2 of AF representation. I'm going to call it Of AF representation, I'm going to call it sigma here, with fixed vectors by the Evil Hormy subgroup times this fixed level subgroup. Then establishation of that is, by definition, an irreducible constituent of that when viewed as an HP KFP model. So an irreducible constituent. So I took something irreducible here, but it was irreducible as a representation of this. Now I'm sort of restricting to Io-Hori fixed vectors instead. So now there's only an action of the Igor Hori heckalge. An action of the Higo-Hori Hecker algebra, you have UP operators there. So this will decompose into finitely many pieces, and any of those pieces is a piece of sigma by default. Okay, and as I just said, they're determined by the IFX vectors inside of the local constituent sigma p of sigma f. And each piece stabilization moreover has an associated weight, a Q-valued weight, called the slope. Q-valued weight called the slope. Of the torus, and it's determined by the p-adic valuations of eigenvalues of the operators inside of the CPP algebra. Okay. So, right. So, I'm taking a particular piece stabilization of my representation in a moment. For now, I want to show you a theorem of Erbon that. Of ERPON that tells you when you can deform certain cusp forms. This theorem, unfortunately, will not apply in our situation, and I'll discuss how to get around that. But just to fix ideas, I'm showing you this theorem. So if mu is dominant integral and regular, so our weight lambda naught will not be regular, that's one problem, and tau is an irreducible constituent, so tau is already p-stabilized here, I suppose. Stabilized here, I suppose, of this classical space, space right here, or this classical distribution, whose slope is not too large with respect to μ. So this is the, this is, you can make this precise, not too large. The words not too large, you can make them precise. And this is the look at the definition of the word non-critical here. So in this situation, there's a generically customed alkyetic family of Pietic family of automorphic representations, or p-stabilizations of automorphic representations, really, passing through tau. What that means is there's a rigid analytic space that I'm calling gothic y, which is generically finite over a neighborhood of this weight we're starting with in weight space. That neighborhood I'm going to call gothic q. Distribution from the Heke algebra into the ring of analytic functions on y such that when you specialize. When you specialize at a certain point, y naught, lying over this weight μ, you'll get the original automorphic representation tau back. And moreover, for generic y's inside of this y over dominant integral weights muy, the specialization of y Of y, of i at y as a constituent of this classical distribution. In other words, so maybe I can even say it on the slide, but you're, I said it out loud, but I didn't say it on the slide. So this y naught, when you specialize at y naught, you're getting a sum of distributions which contains tau. And when you specialize at any of these y's, you're getting a sum of distributions contained, generically at just one distribution. And generically, just one distribution, one irreducible distribution contained inside of this classical custom space. Yeah, generically irreducible, yeah. Did I say that on the slide? No, I didn't. So I guess I accidentally omitted a few things from the slide. So just to reiterate, tau is a suman of the specialization at y0 of this pi. Of this I. And generically, this constituent at y is irreducible. Trace of an irreducible representation occurring in the cohort. Is that also true? Is it somehow irreducible also at the non-classical frameworks? No, it could be it could degenerate to reducible things. That can definitely happen. Including at the point, why not? Including at the point why not be able to generate something reusable there. In fact, probably does. Um any other questions? Okay. So the problem with using this theorem is that, well, it doesn't apply in our situation because the p-stabilization, first of all, is critical. So the hypothesis of the previous theorem was that you wanted non-critical slope. And that you wanted the view there to be regular. Here are lambda naught. To be regular. Here, our lambda naught is irregular. So, what do we do about this? We use the theorem that we use sort of the construction of these families more directly. So, Urban's theorem is a corollary of this one, which says if now mu is any p-iadic weight, tau is an irreducible constituent of this distribution, then actually you still get the customer family, generically custom family you started with for any. Started with for any, yeah, so for any your distable constituent of this distribution, you get a custom family passing through it. So you have to somehow show you anyway that at the point lemma not here, at the point lemma naught, you have to show that pi f crit is a constituent of, I guess I should have written lemon naught there, is a constituent of this hesital overconvergent distribution. Over-convergent distribution at the point lambda dot. So I just want to show you very briefly how you would do that. So to do this, you examine the definition of this I naught dagger. And I guess the main point, the point to take away from all this is that even if you're not a regular Even if you're not a regular weight thing, or a regular weight onomorphic representation, even if you're not non-critical, there are still techniques you can apply from Urban's construction of this eigenvariety in order to show that you have a customer deformation. So, the first thing to do is to look at this distribution here that we've been cooking about. It's defined in terms of a non-customer distribution here. Cussipral distribution here, and analogous distributions for smaller levies of G2. And I just want to show you what the definition looks like. I don't want you to read the definition carefully, but I want to point out some things, namely that this is a sum over smaller parabolic subgroups and over certain vile elements, and you take certain vile twists of these constant terms of these HEC operators and evaluate analogous distributions for the levies on them. Analogous distributions for the levies on them. So these are all going to be, all these MQs are going to be GL2s or TORA. So when you do this, you can sort of make explicit this part of the whole song, or at least the appearance of pi F crit inside of this part of the song. You can make that very explicit. But then, of course, when you make that explicit, there's also this term right here without the zero at the bottom here. The same thing. The same thing. So I naught is defined in terms of some over-convergent distribution, not some cussable over-convergent distribution, over-convergent distribution, and in terms of cussable distributions for smaller legislation. So what do you do about this I naught? Well, you use the suggestion of John here. Well, you use what John was asking about. You use this BGG spectral sequence, which gives you an expression of. Which gives you an expression of this classical thing in which, by step one, we understand the appearance of piF crit in terms of vile twists of all of these over-convergent non-custom distributions. When you do that, you show that when you pick IFGrit, one of the things you do is you pick it cleverly enough so that Enough so that certain considerations about how critical its slope is show that piF crit only appears inside of this distribution for w equals 1 or the reflection across the short group. So there are only two subands of this width can actually appear, so you're reduced to checking a difference of two subands of that something. And then you combine these things with a definition. These things with a definition of I naught, I naught dagger. And you can explicitly evaluate everything and obtain this theorem, which says that, which, as I alluded to halfway through the talk, it says that IF crit appears with multiplicity at least 3 inside of this if the inside of the symmetric cube functional equation is minus 1. So let me say over here the I coal of the Um the multiplicity of this pi f crit inside of this i classical over here is by step one equal to two. In this case, uh sine is i is one. So it's appearing as a cat four months, it's appearing as an isenstein series once. So on this side, what you do is you rewrite all of these i daggers in terms of i0 dagger from the previous slide. Or maybe I can go to the previous slide. So you move this term over here, you move this term over here. This term over here, and then you get a, these things you know are all the sum ends of these appear with positive multiplicities, so this is a theorem of Herbot. So if you want to evaluate how many times φF crit appears in here, you would evaluate all the times it appears in here, which can be done explicitly, and you would do an analogous computation for the vile twist, the W beta twist. Again, that can be done explicitly. Again, that can be done explicitly. It's a long computation, but it can be done. And then you'll get what you'll get is that, I guess what you get is that this thing equals 3 plus this term for w equals w beta, by a twist of that term. That is positive by Eric's theorem, and so you get, it appears with multiplicity at least 3. It appears with multiplicity at least three. I expect it appears with multiplicity exactly three, but well, that seems hard to show. Okay, so that is the summary of step two. And since that is all I have, I guess I will thank you for listening. Recording. Oh yeah, sure. Cool. Okay.
