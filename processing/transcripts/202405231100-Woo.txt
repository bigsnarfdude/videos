Can I ask you one? So when you say an action on the space X, what does that mean? That means that, so an action, I'll tell you what this means. This means that there is a map, let's say an algebraic map, meaning complex, agrees with a complex structure, from t cross x, satisfying. Satisfying what that identity the identity across any point goes to that point and if I take t1 and this will go to a point t1x um and then I can take right this goes let me say Let me say, let's call this map A. So action map taking T1 X, that should get T1 acting on X. And then that's a point. So I can act on my T2 on this. This is equal to that. We should just take T1x, T2 times T1x is T2 T1. Is T2 T1? Yes. Yes. So being an action just means that we have a map that for each group element, we send every element in the space to another element in the space such that this action, this map, works well with the multiplication of the group. Okay. Okay, or you might think we have a bunch of maps from x to x, one given by each element of the group, and these maps compose just like the group elements multiply. Okay, that's what a group action is. So here's an example of a group action with this group. X might be the space of all n by n matrices. might be the space of all n by n matrices and my action will just be multiplication okay matrix multiplication with with a diagonal with my diagonal matrix okay this is actually not that far from the example we're talking about okay now i'm going to put more hypotheses on what's going on okay On what's going on, okay. Which is paid by half lines, and then I'll tell you vaguely what. By affines, and I'll tell you vaguely what this means. This means that X can be cut up into pieces, each of which looks like C I'll say C D I for some I for some D I. Okay, so you should think this is sort of like a simplicial decomposition of my triangulation of my space, except that I happen to be able to do it only with even-dimensional triangles. Okay. There are more hypotheses, but I'm not going to worry you about that. Okay, then I'll tell you a fact. And I'll tell you a fact, which is that a free module basis is given by taking, let me give these pieces a name, pieces, let's call these pieces xi. Okay, I take the xi, these are pieces that look like these that look like complex d-dimensional space for some d. I take their closures in. Some D, I take their closures inside my space X and I can associate some classes, which I will tell you a little bit more about in a moment. Second of all, this is not just a fact that's paid by FI, this is a general fact. We can calculate this thing. By finding equations for this guy around each fixed point E and sine x. So, what do I mean by this? X is, in this case, a manifold, okay? A complex manifold. That means around my point P, I can find a neighborhood of P that looks like a complex d-dimensional space, or complex N-dimensional, complex some-dimensional space. Okay. And once I do that, then I can. And once I do that, then I can find equations that define this thing in the neighborhood of this bar. What do you mean by bar, x, i? Closure. The closure. And then the brackets. The bracket literally means take that geometric object and somehow associate it with it a spine. Okay. And I'm going to tell you, in some sense, how to associate a spine to it, or at least one way of associating a spine to it. Way of associating it as well. And in particular, so let me remind you of something. Let me remind you of something. So the fixed points, these correspond to, let's call them chambers in my domain. Right, so we're talking about splines over some spine space. My space, my actual geometric space that I'm taking splines over is cut up into places where my spine is actually a polynomial. Where my spine is actually a polynomial. These triangles are the same spatial dimension because you have like C D I to some
