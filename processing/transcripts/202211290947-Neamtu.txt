Uh this is our summer team up first of all the fourth of the world, so you guys received. And um I would like to present some what would be thought was very surprising results that we have especially an extended system where there exists a lot of distributions to have uh without any mechanism that was built. So it's just a site that's going to use some resources. We don't know maybe clients are. Not normal maybe clouds are emergent speeds on against them on the way. Um this starting with this PDE, so especially the unit system driven by um my noise, this looks very, very complicated. It is um people spend uh act at least a very lifestyle this information. Um, it doesn't actually matter, like, you can almost ignore it, just know that it exists. Uh, people uh work with it from the mathematical side, from the physical side, so it describes magnetization about the nano layout. Um and I only want to focus on some key ingredients that we realize in the movie. So the first one is it's written by Gaussian, a white box. The second one is it's non-preserving, so there's an N cross everywhere. So the norm of the initial condition determines the sphere and the the solution is bound. This is three components this and then one two and three is one two e n takes dissipated uh the gamma lambda um that controls the dissipation, so lambda positive. Um there's a translation invariance, so this is a new first step. Uh second derivative need here. And there And there are fun solutions in the data. So, if we ignore the noise here, then these are the three components. So, this is M1 component with the tangent profile, and there's a statue profile for M2, and so this is a stationary solution in the DFC. So, now we switch on the noise, we want to see what happens to the solution. And what we see is And what you see is this, this is uh space type problem, this is space, this is time. So here this is the M1 solution. So we start with this tension profile, so this minus one and this plus one for bit, and against this disruptive interface, which is kind of strange stochastic processes. And if we do this for much, much longer time, this emergence of what we see is very dramatic. So these are discrete drugs in the phase of the class. I have to say this is not quite a numerical simulation by the SPD. I'll then explain how this is done and why this is relevant to the experiments. And so this is to us very surprising. And we claim the first time that an observer with spatially extended system is anomalous species. We were expecting this, so this is some joint while one was expecting it to exist. There's some joint workers in No. There's some John Walker's a few years back where we sort of have a universal view on spatially extended system and their deducing behavior. I won't have time to go into that, but we knew that it was possible, but we never found an example. So this is the first example that we can actually write down, not just on an abstract level, where you have this emergence of this limified. Emergence, I'm saying, because it's just Gaussian writing, right? We don't put anything, we don't put any limified or any alpha state. We don't put any new supply or any other step processes applied on. And there's also not an academic printed on these equations that would tell you, yeah, you know, how you should observe this. So I want to guide you through that. And first of all, what would we expect? So we know from the symmetry perspective, so some people here are experts on this. So if we just have a PDE that's equivariant with respect to some symmetry rule, then under certain conditions we can spend. then under certain conditions we can split the dynamics in these base dynamics and uh of course not split the dynamics at all. So think of it if you're a translation crew and you go into moving frame of reference, so the base dynamics is just the only E that you get when you go to a moving frame of reference and the dynamics on the crew is just, you know, let's say that your variance P is just P dots equal to the velocity. Um so what we expect then if we switch on noise, But the group dynamics is neutral. There's no contraction there. It's a neutral dimension. So that's where the noise can actually act, and where we can see the field. And so we would expect that we can see the And so we would expect that, you know, the longer translation would always diffuse up, okay? So that, you know, the formula interface is kind of where you see the style of problems. Not unexpected. But the question is, what type of noise? And initially I would have said, well, that's just driven by Gaussian noise. So I've got something or something distributing my Gaussian noise. So I want to start first telling you what are these. First, telling you what are these alphas they call maybe for lines are, but they're just a very brief rundown. So these are special random variables, x. So I have one head. I draw out of this hat, you know, lots of uh resolution x j. I sum them up, I scale them appropriately, and then that's distribut distributed according to the same net. That is another random variable, however, the same net. So you already know one of them, like you know Gaussian variables, right? We sum up Gaussian variables, and this V and Gaussian variables, then this VN would just be scalable. And that's again a Gaussian variable. So you know, when you find out one stable process, which is a Gaussian technology process, um, are there more? And you can calculate them, you can calculate them by three parameters, the stability parameter. So that tells you the width of the um so I'm not equal to two, this is the Gaussian case, and it tells you the other uh look at the in the f. Um In guess. Um, so in black is almost equal to two, but then if you go smaller and smaller, you get finite parameters. Uh of tails, yeah. So that means, you know, there's a you can get very large descriptions. And there's another parameter, the screen parameter, v tup, that tells you if you are on one side, is it v ten equal to one, um, or if you're symmetric, v ten equal to zero, v t equal to minus one, which is v once. Um this the n also is determined, it's just n to the one on alpha. So um the smaller alpha is, the more you have to kind of have an alpha. And the stronger you get, like with the V assemble these, the stronger you get that small loss with that scaling factor. And then they have this, because of these heavy tails, they have this property that not all moltens are defined. Okay, so the moments are defined if you So the moments are defined if P is less than alpha, but if they're larger than the moments I'm P. So in particular the second moment I'm definitely for the Axis. And we can't write down a PDF for it, an analytic so an analytic expression for it, but it's defined to the characteristic function. So this is like the you know the Fourier transform of the density, and it's all determined in terms of these volumes of stream parameters. And so this is for random variables, but we can make this into an alpha-stable process that gives a realization for some of those parameters. And you see here, there's actually jumps. You could think that these are just sort of this very normal random motion, and then there's kind of jumps, but that's not true, we got jumps on also. Okay, so it's a clap-like process, so it's continuous and pushed, so it's not a continuous So, it's not a continuous uh continuous process anymore like random motion, we have these discrete junctures. Okay. So that's just so that we know roughly what they are. For this talk, it's just enough to say that they are junkies, right? And that's what we've seen over here. Um now I want to tell you some mechanisms that are known how to generate alpha-stable processes. So how to generate these processes. And actually I'm going to uh gonna do that And actually I'm going to uh wanna do that uh entirely deterministic. So how you can generate a stochastic process that is dynamic diffusive, but where all the components are deterministic. And I want to start just with um the normal weak center uh a function central limit theorem is um where we have what we call your scroll chaos. So this is a uh logistic map, so we know what's the emails from the art. Um and then I And then I drive a variable V here, where I just add up the mean process, uh mean zero processor. So I subtract the mean, so just one half of this x here, and just basically sum up. So I have a character process, and I sum it up. And then from the central limit theory, you would expect, yes, this should give us Running motion, and indeed this is the X, this is a logistic map, and this is kind of the integrated or the summed up voice, and we get Running motion. Noise and we get round motion. So, this is all uh very well known. Um you have these spherical sums, this is just you know, really dispersive just the dynamics where we iterate. Um, and then we have the central limit here and we go and the diffusion is given by this principle of four. So, what we need here, these are correlations T there is the dynamics, you know, some of these are the correlations need to be summed up. So, if you have some of the correlations we're good. But it's not just some of the correlations we're good, we also need Just some of the correlations we could, we also have here the input here is output. So now what happens if we have an unowned? Okay, so we have the same which is the math. So it's nice, strongly caloric dynamics, but now when x goes to zero you get a big G. And then what you see is a bit um What you see in the dip in the phase. And so here, I take one on the gamma divided by one on x over gamma. Every time x goes to zero, we have these little big excursions and they correspond to this to this point gamma. Is that uh sorry? What's the choice for gamma? Uh less than two choices. Probably for thirty one point three is that um Um okay, so that's one mechanism. And um just for the completeness, um I'll show you another mechanism here. Uh that's when we have big chaos. Um so I just say that this you can prove that this goes to uh alpha statement voice, and the alpha depends on gamma. So if this were uniformly distributed, uh the x, which is isn't, then actually alpha would be one of them. Uh how would also like to I would also like to make a connection here to stoastic generation. So this is all deterministic we and that's a work done by Rachel that's you know quite old already but um very important and I highly recommend this paper. It's where you have this uh correlated uh edited amount of noise. Then you know similar similar signages here where you can also show that you can generate that stuff basically. can generate that stochastically, you know, starting from something that's Gaussian. By summing it up, you get ultra stable noise. So for completeness, a different way to generate ultra-stable noise is through weak playoffs. So here's a momental time map that has a neutral fixed point zero. So when you when the dynamics is close to zero, it stays there for a very long time. You get the stamina period, then you get back into this sort of hypotenuse region, you know, where you have some kind of strong patterns. You know, because how strong pad is, you can re-inject it and so forth, and these reinjection times can be arguably long. Um, and this is what we see. So, here we have this lemon periods happening, and these lemina periods correspond to this ballistic flight, because this is basically a constant, right? If you're near the near the fixed point and zero, then this is a constant. And you can even do what's called deducing. Um, so you spot the clock when you're in this highlight. You stop the clock when you're in this high in this terminal region, so when you're in this place, and you start the clock again when you're outside of the region, that's you know, so the clock you're using and then you can just I won't have time to talk about this, um but these ideas here of deterministic generation of um statement modeling we can you can actually integrate this into numerical integrator, if you can make this into the vertical integrator, that's to the integrator that solves complicated, non-lethal coefficient um SDEs driven by other state models. So if people are interested in that, uh of this. Um but let's go back to the SLRG actually. And this is just some telling, giving you an idea of how we generate a hyper state process. Let's go back to this one. So um to understand what type of map so we observe this. We observe this um observe this um um this um along the future and yes g equation. Let's try to understand what's the mechanism that justifies this problem. And we're going to use this method of coordinates that um Melan Kalprich was a PhD student whose me uh and I developed this for SPDEs um and that's the following. We just say we have this sort of our core is this deterministic solution here um and then we say that the noise the effect of the noise will be The effect of the noise will be to affect those parameters here. So we have the width, we have location, they now time dependent. And we also know that the solution has to be on the sphere. So we just allow for sphere-dimensional rotation, and all these angles are now random uh random constants. Yeah. And so the aim is to get an S DE for those what we call the quote-collected uh vector constants. Vectors of that area. So that means we reduce the infinite dimensional X P D E to a set finite dimensional set of X V D E C. And what this basic is, it's a Galocan approximation, we want to do a Galocan approximation, at least probably quite better, minimize the arrow then residual. And then we get this S T D for those collected questions. And so what we get, if we remember we had a And so what we get, if we remember we have the shape and the group dynamics, so what we get for the shape dynamics are this is the set of S T E's for the the width of the uh in front of the interface and for the angles that describe where our sphere my screen is. And the phi is the interface. So the phi, the group dynamics, is what we expect to become as is another sort of um so we can I haven't written them down and you know they're not very informative uh for us here. Um For us here. Um, but first, can we trust? This is no rigorous right perspective. And um, we don't unfortunately have a rigorous theory or the method. But can we trust the method? So there's a special case, one, zero, zero is a G that determines the direction of the noise. Um if it's one zero zero, then there's an analytic solution with an additional rotational symmetry, and this method becomes so that's good, that's a pass. But even if we have you know a a different gene here, then we can If you're gene here, then you can just say, Okay, fix the time, find lots of realizations, and do we get the statistics right? And here are um not very well visible um figures of the use of the graph along many realizations of the uh S V D before S V D and of the coordinates for all those angles. The angles we uh we figured out from just because of fitting what we've got. So that's confidently spying. Now let's try and understand Now let's try and understand now the mechanism behind the um the anomalous distribution. So it's sort of rather than looking at the angles, it's it's sort of more instructive to look at the amplitudes that provide our solution not in terms of the angles but in terms of amplitude of the change and of the set sphere. Um and you see they're they're all on the on the uh on the sphere. And now we are able to look at the chain of events Chain of events for this honor. So this is the M1 amplitude. So this is our A, so this is the amplitude of the tension in the first one moment, which one here. And in red is the amplitude of the section. So they fluctuate. But whenever you have a flip or a near flip, so whenever the tang here, so this is a magnetization profile goes through almost zero. goes through almost zero and is either going a near f uh flip or a near flip. What that causes in the inverse widths here is well at peak, right? Because if you kind of go through zero, then the width is you know infinite for your switch. So you get this you get this p in the width, this kind of unbounded p. The width really goes to zero, but if you really have a flip, But if you read over flip, you will actually have uh this duct section. So it's unbounded driver. And then the five, which is where we want to see. So this is a driving, this is the driver here, driving dynamics for the group dynamics. Um so this peak here causes in the um in the translation variable here um the jump. And you can see that the um with this drift term Um, this drift term here at phi is just v w times something uh. So it's this method of an unbounded, you know, you have nice dynamics with good statistical properties, you know, caused by the Browning motion and this kind of random motion on the sphere. But the group group dynamics experiences is unbounded on the sphere. So we're quite happy to uh So we're quite happy to sort of isolate it this effect here. And just as a comparison, you know that sort of what our kind of collective overnight approach and what the actual interface looks like kind of looks similar, which we can't just computerists or you know we don't have similarities here. And you also see this um this kind of jumpiness or you know the switches between phi in the peakiness of your phi. the pdiness of your fronter interface with stuff. And what's important to note is that you can't you could never observe this in the actual uh SPD numerically. Because you know you start with something like like US shape or under conditions and then you want the frontal interface to go to zero, you're not gonna that's not the solution, because at some stage you do the actual solution would uh violate for fixed you know, for fixed data. For fixed domain multiplied by other features. So that's why I think it is never going to observe in numerical simulation. You can't integrate for that long, which is this. Um normal summary here, we showed strong evidence that the uh this SBE exhibits emergence super diffusion. So again, emergence means none of the mechanisms that I showed here, this is CDOs, was built in, which is just Gaussian noise writing. Um and Right. Um, and we see this soon as you see this data of the interface. Uh we identified the underlying dynamic of the mechanism, which is nice providing dynamics as good as industrial properties, but unbounded, um uh unbounded observable. And uh this means our uncertainty on boxes. And so what's what's to do? Um so first can we prove this convergence uh today? prove this convergence um to make noise um by using the symmetry perspective. Um so can we to avoid you know what's very good now for the PDE, in that case, can we avoid this for the SPE? And I think that's so that would be uh um rigorous. And that would also exclude the possibility that we can't exclude that this is just transitory. Screw transitory, um uh somebody used uh eventually S V E D that will in the actual S V E D um just transitory but Since our method is not rigorous, we couldn't just classify that. There is, at the beginning I said, I'm not really interested in the physics or in the context of this equation, but there is some interest, there are some interesting attributes to follow. So one is that there are these high-factor screen models that kind of you know what what uh Incon talked about yesterday, that is, you know, there is kind of finite finite particle size models for this continuing debate. For this or GD libid, and people showed that they are the models of the KPZ universal universality class. So, one of the connections here that just means that the coordination function is described by the KPZ equation, so that something in SPE that shows per se. And there's an interesting effect, the one-causing effect. So, one causal effect is you have a a wire that early heavy setups observed and a wire that has a strongly very magnetic field.  You basically mentioned that this whole thing comes out of the choice of the observable. Right, so you have an observable that can blow up the infinity. Either is that sort of an artifact of choosing the wrong observable. No, no, no, no, no. So it's in the same state, but um this one. This is not something we chose. This is something that comes out of the collectible act. So the observable you get out is the natural thing that's a general system. So they're not avoid having an observable that blows up something, exactly. So this is this is your result of the finding the end of the light of this plate. Yeah, but yeah, I can use that. Yeah, in the end you sort of mentioned this Barkhausen effect, so have these things indeed they can observe in experiments? Or Barkhausen effect complete this or? No, Barkhausen effect is an experiment. Yeah, but I know, I know, but because I did this thing, sort of it's it's just related. I mean, I think it's just related. I don't want to make any change or not. LG is anything but the sessions or has it been observed here in CPTA. Okay, I'd like to see if this method works on this sometimes a boring project. Also, relating it to both questions in a way. So, you said, right, that you have these two effects, so you can see these kind of alpha-stable homogenization processes. So, one is by the abundant observable, the other one would be by a driver which has bad chair propagation properties. So, that's just not getting it. So, the second case of So the second case of the web detail correlation properties like in this common little kind of map, that you also observe this in that kind of light property, so this other photo might be so happy to just raise the second method. So our objective path and not that it should exist. So if there's some kind of underlying baseline that means that it has to be then. But we don't know all of them. But we don't know an explicit example. You can cope with that. You can make it up to an explicit example, right? But use an actual example. And therefore, it's the correct button, which is but it's always in yeah, right? I mean, sort of how do you project on correct coordinates? How do you project a collective points is usually used in the casual drives analyzing the assets of what is their natural gradient structure in here or something. It's not the tool. I mean, you said it it probably matters somewhat in terms of how you're sampling from far away what kind of projection you're using because you haven't thought about that for any kind of
