Hello, everyone. And so, I would like to begin by thanking the organizers for giving me this opportunity to talk about my work over here today. Of course, I could not be there in person mode, but I'm happy that I could join in in the hybrid mode and all of you can listen to my talk virtually. So, welcome. And today, I'll be talking about Hilbert Moon's multiplicity of powers of an idea. This is my recent joint work with Arina Manager. Joint work with Arinda Manerji and Jugal Verma. So that's the outline of the talk roughly. I'll be beginning by defining what is called as a Hilbert-Samuel function. Then we'll move to the characteristic P part of the talk, where I'll talk about Hilbert Kuhn's functions, Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicities, and the main part of the talk, which is Hilbert Kunt's multiplicities of powers of an ideal. Gradually, we'll move to the main results of our paper, and next we'll talk about generalized Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicities. We'll talk about generalized Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity, which is kind of a characteristic free version of the Hilbert-Kunt function and Hilbert-Kund's multiplicities. As a general case, we'll talk about phase rings of simplicial complexes, ideals over there, and then we'll try to address a conjecture which we saw in one of the papers and we'll give a counterexample to the same. So let's begin. So, kind of throughout the talk, we'll have the ring R to be a Northern local ring. The dimension will be denoted by T, the maximum ideal will be denoted by M, and I will be an arbitrary ideal. But in order to define a Hilbert-Samuel function, we need the ideal to be M prime G. In particular, this ideal should be a finite length ideal. So, the Hilbert-Samuel function is actually a length function, which is length of r over i to the n. And we also know that for large. And we also know that for large values of n, this function behaves like a polynomial. In particular, there exists a polynomial with rational coefficients, which we can write in the following form, and it is called as the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial of I. And the Hilbert-Samuel function coincides with this polynomial for all large values of the n. The representation of this polynomial that we prefer to look at is a linear combination of binomials of such a kind. But over here, what is important are the coefficients. What is important are the coefficients of these binomials e0 of i, e1 of i, and so on up till e sub d of i, where d is the dimension of the ring. These coefficients are what are called as the Hilbert-Samuel coefficients of the ideal i. What we know about them as of now are that these are integers, the first one being a very special coefficient, which is called as the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the ideal. This coefficient can also be seen as the asymptotic limit of the Hilbert-Samuel function. And of course, this And of course, this coefficient has connections. It has a lot of connections with algebraic geometry. There are various ways to study it. But what is even more interesting about these coefficients is that these coefficients have been used in the past to study properties of the ring. Not just multiplicity, even the first coefficient E1 of I also plays an important role in characterizing various rings. I won't go into much details of those things, but these coefficients will appear in the later. Coefficients will appear in the later part of the talk and will also play a very important role. Next, as I mentioned, that the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial and function coincides for large values of n. So let's quantify this value. Let's give it a number. We call this as the postulation number of the ideal. We'll denote it by ni, which is a maximum value of n for which the function and the polynomial do not coincide. Or in particular, the function and the polynomial coincides. The function and the polynomial coincides for all values strictly bigger than n. Next, I'll quickly define what is called as a reduction of an ideal. So, again, we have an ovarian local drink. I is in our ideal. An ideal j contained in I is called a reduction if it satisfies the following equation. J times I to the n is equal to i to the n plus 1 for all large n. And since we say for all large n, it's better to set a number beyond which the equation holds. Which the equation holds. So we call this number as R sub J of I, which is the minimum value of n such that the equation holds for all n bigger than equal to n. Next, quickly, we'll say what is a minimal reduction. This is a reduction which is minimal with respect to inclusion. And once we have minimal reductions with us, and for every minimal reduction, we have this number r sub g of i. We can finally define what is called as the reduction number of an ideal, which is the minimum over all these values r sub g of i, where j wave. These values are sub j of i, where j varies as a minimal reduction of the i. The kind of ideals that we be frequently looking at throughout the talk are ideals which are reduction number one. And these ideals are what are called as stable ideals. And these ideals have interesting properties, which help us figure out a lot more things later. Just a quick setup of notation. G of i is what we'll be calling as the associated graded ring of i. This is an n-graded ring. Of i. This is an n-graded ring whose nth-graded piece is i to the n over i to the n plus one. So we have defined a postulation number, we have defined a reduction number, and then we have this graded ring which is called as the associated graded ring to the IQ. Now, these three elements have close connections with each other, something which we will also be using in the later part of the talk. So, let me quickly state what this connection is. So, let R be a D-dimensional Kohen-Macaulay local drain. A d-dimensional Kohen-McColley-local ring. We have an M prime d idle I, such that when we look at the associated graded ring and its grade, the grade is at least d minus one, where d is a dimension of the ring. Then this was proved by Marley in his thesis that the reduction number and the postulation number are connected in the following way. The reduction number is precisely the postulation number plus the dimension of the ring. Next, let's come back to the characteristic weak case. So I'll quickly define what is a Hilbert-Kohl's function, a Hilbert-Kohl's multiplus. Hilbert-Koul's function and Hilbert-Koul's multiplicity. So we have another in local ring, but now we assume that the characteristic of the ring is a positive prime, t is a dimension of the ring, and Q is an integer power, or rather a natural power of the prime p. Firstly, we'll define what is the Frobenis power of an ideal. So the way we had the Hilbert-Samuel function to be a function corresponding, or rather a length function corresponding to the ordinary powers of an ideal. Corresponding to the ordinary powers of an ideal, in characteristic P, we look at what are called as the Frobenis powers of an ideal. The way we define them is the following: we'll denote them by I square bracket Q, and it's precisely the ideal generated by A to the Q where A varies over the elements of the ideal I. And one can also easily check that the Frobenis power of an ideal is contained in the corresponding ordinary power of the ideal. And now once we have this ideal, the next step is to define the length. The next step is to define the length function, the corresponding length function, and which is what we call as the Hilbert-Kunz function of an ideal. And of course, we can do it in general for any finitely generated R module. So let M be a finitely generated R module. We have an M prime ideal I. Then we define the Hilbert-Kuhn's function of the module with respect to the ideal I by the following length function, which is length of m over i square bracket p to the times m. Of course, as we all know, Of course, as we all know, the reason the Hilbert-Punz function became popular and kind of became a central source of study was because of this characterization by Ernst-Kunz of regular local rings using this function. He proved that a ring is a regular local ring if and only if, when we look at the Hilbert-Kunz function of the ring with respect to the maximal ideal, that length is precisely q to the d, where d is the dimension of the ring. And this holds for some as well as for all q. Is for all q. So once we have this, the next step is to look at the asymptotic limit of this function. And the question is whether does this asymptotic limit exist or not? This was proved by Mancy in 1983, where he proved that indeed there exists a real constant such that for all large values of Q, the Hilbert-Kuhn's function can be written in the following form. Or in particular, when we look at the asymptotic limit of the Hilbert-Kuhn's function, that limit exists and that limits the function. That limit exists, and that limit is what we call as the Hilbert-Kuhn's multiplicity of the module with respect to the ideal I. So, as we started with the Hilbert-Samuel function and multiplicity, now in characteristic B, we have Hilbert-Kuntz function and multiplicity. One would want to explore if there's a connection between the two numbers, between the two multiplicities. And since we saw that the Frobenius powers are contained in the corresponding ordinary powers, some kind of inequality between the Hilbert Point's multiplicity. Kind of inequality between the Hilbert Prince multiplicity and Hilbert Samuel multiplicity is something that one would expect. And that's what actually happens as well. So recall that the Hilbert Samuel multiplicity is the asymptotic limit of the Hilbert Samuel function. And using the containment of powers and a few reduction techniques, one can easily prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the ideal is actually sandwiched between the Hilbert-Simul multiplicity over d factorial and the Multiplus G over T factorial and the multiplus G itself. But what is also worthwhile to note over here that these inequalities can also be strict. Rather, they are strict in high dimensions. It's only in dimension one that one can easily see that they coincide, but that does not happen for high dimensional rings. So once we have these inequalities with us, what else can these two multiplicities or these two functions share or not share? Functions share or not share is the next question. So we saw that the Hilbert-Samuel function is a polynomial function, but unfortunately, that may not be the case for Hilbert-Kuhn's function. Just to quickly give you an idea, this is the result which is proved by Monski in the same paper, where he considers one-dimensional rings. Of course, the ring is not there in local. The characteristic is prime. He proved that even in one-dimensional rings, the way the Hilbert-Kuhn's function looks like is the following. So we have an M prime reaction. Following. So we have an M prime ideal I, then the Hilbert-Kundz function of the ring with respect to this ideal looks like the following. Of course, the leading coefficient is the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity times p to the E, because we are in one-dimensional case. We have a linear part and a constant part, nothing more than that. But this constant part is actually a very interesting thing. It's not really a constant, but a periodic function in E for large values of E. In particular, even for one-dimensional. In particular, even for one-dimensional rings, the Hilbert-Kuhn's function turns out to be a quasi-polynomial function for large values. So, studying these functions is a little unpredictable and uncertain, and this is kind of makes the theory a lot more interesting. So, if the Hilbert-Kuhn's function is having interesting characteristics, a Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity cannot be even far behind. So, we know that Hilbert-Samuel multiplicities, they are integers, but when we talk about Hilbert-Kuhn's multiplicity, But when we talk about Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicities, they can even be rational, which is just as a quick example, I would like to state here is a result by Vatanati Vishita, where they prove that if we have a field and for some value n bigger than equal to one, the ring is the corresponding quotient of the power series ring kxyz over xy plus z to the n plus one. Then the Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity of the ring with respect to the maximal ideal is the following, which is a rational number. And just to keep the story even more, And just to keep the story even more interesting, there's actually a result which was proved by Brenner very recently, where he proved that the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity can even be an irrational number. So once we have this literature with us, let's look at the main part of the talk where we want to compute the Hilbert Kund's multiplicity of powers of an i. We want to go a step further and look at this number, which is E sub h k of i to the k. And we want to write this as And we want to write this as a function of k and see how it behaves. So, what was really the motivation? How did the idea came through? So, this was in the paper of Ilya in 2019, where he proved that if you have a noetherian local ring and an M prime ideal I, then the Hilbert-Kunst multiplicity of I to the K has the following form. It can be written as a function of K. The way we have the representation till now is the following. Till now is the following. It's a linear combination of the binomials where the first coefficient interestingly turns out to be the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the ideal, and the second term is the asymptotic limit of E1 of I square bracket Q. Of course, there are other terms which are in lower degrees of Q. So once we have this result, it's a natural question to ask if the similar pattern can be extended further. In particular, Eliya asked the following two questions in the same paper, which are as follows. In the same paper, which are as follows. So, firstly, can we do this asymptotic limit thing for other Hilbert coefficients, Hilbert sample coefficients of the idea? In particular, does the asymptotic limit EI of I square bracket Q over Q to the D exist for all I bigger than equal to one? And in cases where the question one indeed has a positive answer, can we expect that for large values of K, the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity of i to the k can be written in the following form? Be written in the following form. In particular, we have the entire expression, which is the alternating summation of binomials of such a kind, where the coefficients are asymptotic limits of EI of I square pattern Q. So before really getting into the questions, one would want to look at some very obvious cases where, let's say, both the questions have a positive answer. So, what are those? So, let's say we have a Kohn-McCullough local ring and we have a parameter eye. Then, this means I square. will i then this means i square bracket q is also generated by system of parameters in particular when we look at length of i r over i square bracket q to the k then it can be written as length of r over i square bracket q times the binomial which is further the multiple state times q to the d times the binomial which further tells us that all the further ei's of the ideal i square bracket q are zero and taking the asymptotic limits on both the sides in the first equation we get the asymptotic We get the asymptotic the Hilbert Samuel multiplicity of I to the k is the usual multiplicity times the binomial t plus t minus one plus t. So, one very obvious case where both the questions of Ilyas have positive answer. Let's look at a little more complicated case. This was result of Atanabi and Yishida, where they proved that if you have a Kern-Mokali local ring, dimension at least two, and I is a stable ideal. Or just to recall, I has reduction number one, then they prove that for all. One, then they prove that for all values for all powers of i, the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity of i to the k has the following form: where the leading coefficient is the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity, and the second coefficient is the difference of the two multiplicities. So these are two cases where one does have answers of the questions. But what are further cases where one could say yes or no about the questions? And this is what led us into the exploration of. Exploration of computing the Hilbertmann's multiplicity of i to the k, in particular, computing this particular length function which we see here in the equation. And that's one of the first theorems of our paper where we prove that if we have a Cooks-Wharm ring of dimension D with prime characteristic P, and we have a parameter idea, then we have kind of the parallel results the way we had in the Gohan-McCullough case. But as of now, we only required the ring to be a Pooksboro ring. It's kind of. Books bombing. It's kind of a little more generalization of the Kohn-McCalli case. But the result that we get are the same. We get the asymptotic limits of the EIs are zero for all i going from i to d and the Hilbert-Kohn's multiplicity of i to the k is only dependent on the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity times this binomial. Next, look at a few more interesting cases. That's our next result where we prove that if we have a Kohl-McCullea local ring, If we have a Kurd-McCulleau local ring, dimension D, plane characteristic D, we have an M prime D eigen. Now, the only extra assumption we put here is on the grade of the associated created ring of the eigen square bracket Q. And we want this grade to be at least T minus 1 for all large values of Q. So let's see what just this single assumption can help us with. So once we assume this, we have that the asymptotic limits of these EIF I square bracket Q has the following form. So not only The following form. So, not only do we say that it exists, we also can precisely calculate how it looks like and what it is dependent on. So, if you look at the equation on the right, of course, it's a little complicated equation, but what are really important factors to note here are the summation is dependent only on the reduction number of the ideal. Even the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicities of powers of I, which appear in the equation, can go only up to the reduction number of the ideal. Number of the ideal. That's the highest power of i that can appear here. And of course, as expected, the other number which is there in the equation is the Liberts and Microphys G of I. So we have that the asymptotic limits exist. You also have what is the precise way of writing them. So next question is, do we have a formula for the Hilbert once multiplus G of i to d k? So once this value n is bigger than equal to reduction number minus the dimension plus one, the Hilbert Plus one, the Hilbert-Kunst multiplicities of i to the n have the following form, which was kind of expected from Ilya's second question. This is the alternating summation of the asymptotic limits times the binomial. So while this expression kind of says a lot, but just to give a better idea of things, I guess I'll quickly say what happens in dimension two and what all do we need to compute in order to get the final answer and how easy that. Answer and how easy that task can be once you look at the equation number one here, or rather, how equation number one makes the task easier is something I would like to briefly say about in dimension two with a quick example as well. So that's really the result in dimension two, is an M prime reital, R is Cohen-Macaulay, and we are assuming grade of the associated graded ring of I square bracket Q is at least one. At least one. Then the formulation in the dimension two case gives us the following equations where the asymptotic impact of E1 relies only on three factors: the multiplicity, this is the Hilbert semi-multiplicity, and it only requires computing Hilbert-Kuhn's multiplicity of just two powers of i, i to the r, where r is a reduction number, and i to the r minus one. Similarly, is the case with the asymptotic limit of e2. And then, once we put the equations together in the final, The final: it's only the three numbers that need to be computed, which is the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of I, the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity of I, at the reduction number, and at the reduction number minus one. So let's quickly see an example and see how it goes. So in this example, measuring is the power series ring F3 in XYZ over the element X cube minus Y cube Z. The characteristic is 3. Maximal idle. I'm denoting it by M. This is the equal 2. I'm denoting it by m. This is the equation divided by xyz. So let's first compute the reduction number of the id. So i equal to y, z is a minimal deduction. One can easily check this and the reduction number is true. Something which requires a little more checking, which comes from the result of trigger and vala. This requires actually computing one intersection condition, helps us say that the associated graded ring of m bracket q is Q and Macaulay for a large Q. Requires some checking, but it's actually a one-step thing. Checking, but it's actually a one-step thing. I don't want to stress over here, but this is indeed true. But what is important here is what is the consequence of this result? What is the consequence of this assumption being true? So once the assumptions of the theorem are true, this means we can substitute things in the final equation to compute what is the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity of m to the k. As we saw, it relies only on three numbers: the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity, Isabelle-K of M and Isabel. E sub h k of m and e sub h k of m squared because the reduction number here is 2. This means once we compute these three numbers, we can precisely know what is the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of m to the k for all values of k. So it's easy to check that the Hilbert sample multiplicity is 3 here because we have a hypersurface here which lies in MQ but not in M4. Then the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity of maximal ideal is 3. This is something we used Conca's paper to. used Konka's paper to compute. He computes Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity of maximal ideals in rings which are quotients of single hypersurfaces, or rather single binomials. So using that paper, one can easily compute what is the Lilbert Kunz multiplicity of maximum ideal. Next, in order to compute E sub h k of m square, we need to compute the first length here. And using Rabner basis, passing to the initial ideal, one only needs to compute. One only needs to compute the left, the length on the right-hand side, which turns out to be 9q squared. And in particular, the Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity of m squared is 9. So once we have these numbers, 3, 3, and 9, we have to just substitute them in this equation. And this gives us Hilbert Kuhn's multiplicity of M to the K for all values of, or rather, for all powers of the maximal ideal. So that's really the strength of the main theorem. Next, once we have all this set up, we wanted to go a step further, go to a setup where things are kind of characteristic independent. So in order to go to that setup, we have to firstly define what are generalized Hilbert-Kuhn's functions and generalized Hilbert-Kund's multiplicities in that characteristic free second. And this was defined by Konka in his 1996 paper, where the setup is as follows: we have a D-dimensional variant local ring. We have a D-dimensional variant local ring with maximal ideal M, M prime ideal I, or we have a standard gradient ring with a maximal homogeneous ideal and a graded m prime ideal i. In the setup, what he did was the following. We fix a set of generators of the ideal and then correspondingly define the square bracket n power of the ideal, which is generated by the nth powers of each of these generators. But what is important to note over here is that this definition is dependent. This definition is dependent on the set of generators we choose for the id. Now, once we have this i squared bracket n defined, we can parallelly define what is called as a generalized Hilbert-Kuntz function and a generalized Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity. But the only thing over here is that the Hilbert-Kuhn's multiplicity, or rather the asymptotic limit over here, may not always exist. But of course, if we have a characteristic P case, and then we have the power to be, the element n to be the pure power. The element n to be the pure power of p, then the numbers that we are defining, or rather, the functions that we are defining, they do coincide, the generalized ones and the Hilbert quince function and multiplicities. So once we have the so-called characteristic free version, we kind of looked at what are called as class of phase rings of simplicial complexes. And the idea was to compute the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity or the generalized Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity of powers of ideal in these classes of rings. So let me quickly quickly So let me quickly recall what is the setup here. So let's say delta is a simplicial complex, which is k minus one dimensional. It is a simplicial complex on R vertices. We have a corresponding polynomial ring in R vertices over a field K. Then for a phase set F of delta, so by a phase set me, I mean a maximal dimensional phase of the simplicial complex delta. So once we have a phase set of delta, the simplicial complex, we can define a This initial complex, we can define a corresponding prime, which is the set of all the variables x sub i, such that the i is not a vertex of the facet f. So if we have a collection of facets of the simplicial complex, we have a corresponding ideal. Since these ideals are generated by just the variables, these are prime ideals. So corresponding to each facet, we have a prime ideal, P sub F I. Once we intersect these ideals, Once we intersect these ideals and we denote it by I delta, this is what is called as a standard Eisener ideal corresponding to the simplicial complex. And the phase ring of R, the phase ring of delta, which we denote by R, is actually the quotient of the polynomial ring by the standard Reisner ideal. Since the simplest complex delta is T minus one dimensional, the phase ring has dimension D. So these are the classes of rings that we'll be looking at. These are quotients of polynomial. Be looking at these are quotients of polynomial rings and r variables by an ideal i, which is the intersection of these prime ideals. Now, each of these prime ideals also has a special property that these are just generated by pure powers of variables. This is one important thing which will help us later in the proof. So, let n denote the maximum homogeneous ideal of the quotient ring R. So, this means it's of the form M over I, where M is the maximum homogeneous ideal of the polynomial ring. idle of the polynomial and the kind of ideals that we want to look at you know to come uh the ideals where we will be computing their hilbert kung's functions and multiplicities are ideals of the following form these are the ideals generated by q powers of variables and since we want these ideals to be m primary or rather n primary here in this case we want all these powers to be strictly bigger than zero so the ideal j which we'll be considering are is the ideal generated by x sub i is the ideal generated by x sub i to the power v sub i where v sub i's are strictly bigger than zero for all values of i so let's look at the main result so once we have a d-dimensional phase ring of a simplicial complex we have the ideals uh the ones which i just defined these are pure the ideas generated by pure properties of the variables that we prove that when we look at the generalized hilbert guns function which is length of r over j square bracket k to the k it's a polynomial PK. It's a polynomial. But what is more interesting here is that it has polynomial natures starting for all values of q and t and n. Not just that, when we look at the asymptotic limits of EI of j square bracket q, they all turn out to be zero for values i going from one to d. It also holds that for all k bigger than equal to one, we have a precise formula for the generalized Hilbert-Kunn's multiplicity of j to be k. And it is only dependent on the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the ideal times. Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the ideal times the binomial. And of course, as we saw, the asymptotic limits of EIs are zero, so they don't appear here. So let me quickly sketch the proof, or rather, what are the main ingredients which help us prove this result. So the setup was as follows. We had a polynomial ring in our variables. We have an ideal generated by the pure powers of variables. The pure powers of variables. And then this ring that we want to look at is a quotient of the polynomial ring by an ideal I, which is the intersection of prime ideals, these ideals which are generated by subsets of the variables. So once we have a setup of such a kind, for all q and n, the very first length here on the left-hand side is what we want to compute. In order to compute the Hilbert-Kuntz function of function of the ideal j to the n. We want to look at the length of s over i plus j square bracket q to the power n. So since this ideal i is the intersection of these prime ideals, one can quickly do some checking and prove that this length function can be written as the alternating summation of lengths of such a guy. That's step one. Next step is the observation that each of these primes are now generated by subsets of variables. Are now generated by subsets of variables. This means when we look at the quotient ring s over pi, then each of these quotient rings are actually isomorphic to polynomials. This means in order to figure out the nature of the lens on the right-hand side of the equation, we only need to figure out what is the nature of the length function of a polynomial ring over an ideal generated by J square bracket Qn. And now we come back to the fact that J is generated by pure powers of ferrital. J generated by pure powers of variables. In particular, this length, which is length of a polynomial ring over j square bracket q to the k, has the following form. Just for dance to the fact that we have a polynomial ring, modulo, an ideology of parameters, and its corresponding ordinary curve. So the very first equation, the length on the left-hand side, is what we want you to compute. Steph 1 told us that it can be decomposed. Told us that it can be decomposed as alternating summation of certain lengths on the right-hand side. Now, each of these lengths had the polynomial nature because the quotients s over pi continued to be polynomial rings. And then when we look at the length functions here, they turn out to be a polynomial in Q as well as K. And once we put everything back together, it not only gives us a polynomial nature of the function, it also precisely helps us compute what are the coefficients and Coefficients and in particular also help us pick out what are the asymptotic limits of EI of j square bracket q, which actually turned out to be zero because as a function of q to the d they have lower powers of q coming up making the asymptotic limit to be zero. So that was briefly the idea of the proof. Let me quickly give you an example just to absorb what just happened. So it's a very small example. Of course, in the paper, we have a lot more examples. Of course, in the paper, we have a lot more examples in higher dimensions as well to kind of explain the nature of the result and its proof. So if you have a one-dimensional simplicial complex on four vertices, which is almost like a path, then when we look at the stalires ideal, it's actually the intersection of these three prime idles, P1, P2, and P3. So we have the first facet F1 to be x1 x2. This means the idle. x1 x2 this means the idle pf1 or p1 is generated by x3x4. Similarly, for the phase 8 x2x3, we have the idle generated, the corresponding prime idle to be generated by x1, x4. And for the phase set x3, x4, we have the corresponding prime idle to be generated by x1, x2. And our standardizing ideal is the intersection of these three prime ideals. Our phase ring is the polynomial ring in four variables, quotient lit out by this ideal i. It's a two-dimensional ring because the simplicial complex is dimension one. Because the simplicial complex is dimension one. It's Kohn-Macaulay, that's also easy to check. And like eta denote, like n denote the homogeneous maximal ideal of the ring R. And in order to compute the Hilbert-Kuntz, the generalized Hilbert-Kuntz function of the ideal n to the k, we have to compute this length r over n square bracket q to the k. Of course, one thing which I guess I didn't mention was when we look at the fraudulence power and ordinary power of an ideal, they kind of commute. Power of an ideal, they kind of commute with each other. That's why you do not see any brackets here. The frobinous power of an ideal followed by an ordinary power is the same as the ordinary power of an ideal followed by the frobenous power. That's a very quick, easy exercise to check for which holds for furtherness and ordinary powers. So let's come back to the sketch of the proof in order to compute the length of such a kind. We saw that this can be decomposed as alternating summation of lengths of such a kind where the Of lens of such a kind where the pi's appear in the following fashion. We substitute these values here the way we have in our example. So let's just quickly look at the first term. So S is polymering in four variable. Pi's are just by symmetry, we can look at just one of the Pi's. These are two of the variables. This means S over Pi is a polynomial in two variables. And the idle that we are modding out by is M square bracket K to the K. This means we have a To the k. This means we have a polynomial ring in two variables, modulo, a parameter ideal, m square bracket q, then hold to the bubble k. This length turns out to be three times the polynomial k plus one, choose two times q square. Similarly, we do it for the other summations as well. And the length finally turns out to be the following length. So now that's the interesting part. We have this length function to be 3 times k plus 1 choose 2k squared minus 2k cube. This is our polynomial function in both. This is our Lawl function in both K and Q. And how we read this information is what makes things a lot more interesting. So, since I said these ordinary powers and fermions powers commute, this means this length on the left-hand side can be seen as the Hilbert-Samuel function of the ideal n square bracket q, because this is length of r over n square bracket q whole to the power q. So, if I read this. Q. So if I read this in the sense that this is the Hilbert Samuel function of the ideal n square bracket Q, this means this will say that the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of n square bracket Q is three times Q square. E1 of n square bracket Q is 2K, and E2, because there is no constant term here, turns out to be 0. But if I commute these powers, this means I can see the right-hand side length, sorry, the left-hand side length as the Hilbert-Kunz function of the The Hilbert-Kunz function of the ideal n to the k, then the equation on the right-hand side will tell us that the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity or the generalized Hilbert-Kund's multiplicity of n to the k, which should be the asymptotic limit when we go modulo q square, is 3 times k plus 1 choose 2. So it's really the commuting nature of Robin's powers and the ordinary powers, which help us commute, which help, which help us compute not only the coefficients EI of Only the coefficients EI of n square bracket q. They also give us information about the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity of n to the k. And of course, all of this kind of falls in line with our result. The Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity of n to the k for all values of k is only dependent on the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity times k plus 1 shows 2. When we look at the asymptotic limits of EIs, so over here, the dimension is 2. This means if I go modulo q square and take the limit, I get zero for both E1. I get 0 for both E1 and E2 because E1 is a linear function in Q. E2 is, of course, in this case, turns out to be 0. So things do fall in line with what we just proved. So this was really the story about the Hilbert, the generalized Hilbert Samuel functions and the multiplicities and how they behave when we look at a class of ideals in what are called as phase rings of simplicial complexes. But as I mentioned, these But as I mentioned, these coefficients, the Hilbert-Seimbund coefficients, which you also see appearing over here very frequently, they have been used in the past to characterize various properties of rings and ideals. So I would quickly like to shed some more light on this before I wind up. And for this, I would like to recall the following result by Notgott. So what he proved was the following. And of course, this is a characteristic independent result. Independent result. So DG Northcott proved that if we have a Kuhn-Macaulay local ring and is an M prime t idle, then the first coefficient E1 of I is bigger than or equal to the Hilbert-Samuel multiplus G of I minus length of R over I. So the next question is when is this inequality can be expected to be an equality? And this was independently proved by Hunike and OSHA in 1987, where they proved that in this equation, equality holds if and only if I is a stable ideal. In particular, I is equal to equal. is a stable ideal. In particular, I has reduction number one. So perhaps, I guess, this kind of motivated area to propose the following conjecture in the same paper where he proposed all these questions. And that's what he stated. So if we have a Kohn-Macaulay local ring Rm, we have an M prime D ideal I, then is it so that the stability of the ideal I can be characterized using the asymptotic element of E1? In particular, is it so that In particular, is it so that i is stable if and only if the asymptotic limit of even of i square bracket q equals the difference of the Hilbert-Samuel multiplus G of i and Hilbert Kunds multiplus G of i. And staring at what is going on in the whole slide, one can easily see that if indeed i is a stable ideal, then equality holds in equation number one. In particular, if you replace i with i square bracket q, because the reduction number of i being one also implies that the reduction number of i also implies that the reduction number of I squared bracket Q is equal to one for all Q. We can replace I with I squared bracket Q in this equation. We know equality holds. This means once we look at the asymptotic limits on both the sides, we actually get the right-hand side of the conjecture. In particular, the forward direction of the conjecture is always true and hence the heart of the conjecture is really proving the other direction, the backward direction of the conjecture. In particular, if the asymptotic limit is equal to the If the asymptotic limit is equal to the difference of the two multiplicities, is it so that the ideal is a stable n? And for this, I would quickly like to recall what we did for the case of base rings of simplicial complexes to say that the converse of the conjecture may not always be true. So, let's just quickly recall what we saw in the case of phase rings of simplicial complexes. So, we had a phase ring of simplicial complex R. We had the idea. We had the isolation generated by pure properties of variables. We saw that the asymptotic limit EI of J bracket Q, all of these asymptotic limits were zero. We also saw that the Hilbert-Kuntz multiplicity of J to the K had a particular form, which was only dependent on the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of J times the binomial. In particular, if I put k equal to 1, this will say that the Hilbert-Kundz multiplicity of J is equal to Multiplicity of J is equal to the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of J. Asymptotic limits are zero. Hilbert-Cohen's multiplicity coincides with the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity. So now let's come back to the conjecture. And look at the equation on the right-hand side. So once we have a phase-range of asymptotic complex, j is generated by great powers of variables. The asymptotic limit of E1 is 0. The two multiplications coincide. In particular, the right-hand side of the conjecture is always. The right-hand side of the conjecture is always true for any ideal generated by pure powers of variables in a phase ring of central context, irrespective of the ideal being stable or not. In order to put this on paper more effectively, let's just look at an example. So let's say we have the simplicial complex on four vertices, which looks like this. It's a one-dimensional complex. The triangle here is not fed. It's just a one-dimensional simplicial complex. In particular, the ring is the quotient of polynomial ring in four variables by intersection of these four prime ideals. It's a phase ring which is two-dimensional and coherent-McCallic. As we saw using our result, when we look at the maximal ideal n, then the multiplicity and the Hilbert-Kunst multiplicity of this ideal coincides, it's equal to 4, which is the number of facets of the simplicial complex. The result also tells us that the asymptotic limit of E1. Assert that the asymptotic limit of E1 is zero. But we over here now claim that this maximal ideal n is not a stable ideal. One quick way to say that is using the following observation. So since the ring is a Kohlman-Coller ring, one way to figure out the reduction number of the maximal ideal is by looking at the Hilbert series of the ring. Then the degree of the numerator of the Hilbert series of ring is what gives us the reduction number of the maximal ideal. So we'll be using kind of this small fact here. kind of this small fact here. So since we know what our simplicial complex is, we know what are the F vectors and the H vectors or even just the information about phase vectors can help us figure out what is the Hilbert series of this ring. In this case, it turns out to be 1 plus 2z plus z square over 1 minus z whole square. And as I mentioned, since the ring is called Macaulay, the degree of the numerator of the Hilbert series, which in this case is 2, is the reduction number of the maximal L. Is the reduction number of the maximal idle. So, just precisely, we have a counterexample where the maximal idle of a phase ring of a simplicial complex is two, but the right-hand side of the conjecture is satisfied. In particular, the conjecture does not hold, at least in the case of phase rings or simplicial complexes, or in general for rings which are reduced. So, of course, the next question one can ask is under what extra Under what extra assumptions can we expect the conjecture to be true? And this is what we are currently working on. But yeah, that's the story till today that we have with us. And with this, I would like to end my talk. These are the few references which I used in my talk. Of course, the paper is upon archive. The very first reference gives us the archive number. And yeah, thank you for your attention. Thank you for listening to the temperature. Other questions for teacher? Other questions to Zoom? Somebody wants to make a question in Zoom, you just unmute yourself. In the meantime, I ask a question. So, in your resources, I asked a question. So, in your research, you focus, well, part of your research, you focus on simple complexes. And I mean, those have very nice communication. If you move to other kind of rings that also have communatory structure, for instance, binomial HIVLs, you can obtain something in a similar direction. This is coincidentally one of the examples that we plan to look on, especially the binomial. Look on, especially the binomial editors, but the level of difficulty kind of increases very rapidly once we are looking at binomials and not monomials. Because binomial editors are kind of, it's just not the quotient of a ring by a single binomial. You'll have a bunch of binomials appearing in the denominator. And once we have this, even the computation of problem bases turns out to be difficult. And over here, we are looking at this ring modulo, the maximal ideal, which is an. Modular, the maximal idle, which is generated maximal idle to the Fermi's power to the ordinary power. So, of course, as you mentioned, we do have these rings in our current work project, but the level of difficulty is really high as compared to rings which have just monomers appearing in the penalty. Yes. Thank you. Well, if there are no further questions, let's thank Kayla. For questions, let's thank Katie. Oh, sorry, sorry. Can you? Yes, I do have a question. Sorry. So, early, when you gave us your first example of something satisfying your main theorem, you had some example where you said for large Q, the Frobenius powers, their associate greater rings were coherent-Macaulay. What were the conditions? You said it was a theorem of somebody else. What were the conditions in that theorem? Okay, so in our Okay, so in order to check the depth condition on the associated cradle ring, there's a very nice result by Walaprigga and Vala, which says that if we have a regular sequence in a ring and it also satisfies one intersection condition. So let's say this ideal here is maximal identity and we have regular sequence x. Then I'm just denoting it by x, it has to be a sequence. So x times m to the n should be equal to x intersection m to the n minus equal to x intersection m to the n minus 1 for certain values of n which only go until the reduction number of the ideal so you only need to check these two conditions uh checking these two conditions will say that the images of these elements in the associated crated ring will give us a regular sequence in the associated cradle ring i can help you with the reference of uh this result i guess i i can mail you that paper it's a result of valuabre and vala yeah it holds an accident Yeah, it requires actually a lot more generality. It also works for filtration, it's not even ideals. Great, thank you. Is there another question soon? Okay, well, we can do three again.
