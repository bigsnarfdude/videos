One of the things we looked at was we checked the topology, so we looked at Hodge numbers. A more powerful test would be a check of the complex structure. So by the Torelli theorem, it's enough to compute an integral of An integral of the holomorphic form, the middle holomorphic form along all the cycles, a basis in the middle homology. And if you know all these numbers, that tells you the complex structure. Now, these numbers are actually, in a sense, too much. They're overcomplete. But I'll come to that a bit later. All right, so now there's kind of two main approaches that we have for looking at these integrals. And as far as polylogarithmic integrals are concerned, they're pretty much equivalent. You can take cuts or you can apply differential operators. And in a sense, they play some... And in a sense, they play some dual role. The cuts give you information about symbol entries starting at the beginning, and the differential equations give you information about symbols at the end of the symbol. Now, what I want to argue is that once you start talking about Carabiao integrals, there's a bigger difference. It's not just as simple as they should give you the same information in the end. Information in the end, but they give you the same information in very different ways. And I believe, based on rather preliminary information at this point, that the approach based on cuts will turn out to be more efficient. Okay, so here's the contrast between the two. I'll have more to say about this later. The cut approach only needs the hologram. The cut approach only needs the holomorphic top form from the chromology. And then the other information you need are the homology cycles, but out of those, the algebraic cycles are actually going to give you trivial answers where you integrate over them. They give you zero. So really, only the non-algebraic cycles give you non-trivial information, and thus the physics. Information, and that's the physics. That's the physics that you can extract. And the approach based on Picard-Fuchs equations, in principle, requires a full understanding of the middle-dimensional cohomology. So you want to understand all the differential forms that arise in middle homology, including the ones that are not holomorphic. I mean, most of them are not holomorphic. And the size of this space can be very large. I mean, you can easily hit thousands here. So I'm going to look at some examples. The simplest example, everybody there, I think, is very familiar with this example by now. It's the sunrise integral. We look at it in two dimensions. We don't do any dimensional regularization. We don't do any dimensional regularization. This is defined, well defined without regularization. And p is going to be the external momentum, and q's are the internal momenta, and I have three masses. Now, we cut this, when we cut it, we get integrals of this type. So you can either write them as a four-dimensional integral of a product of three delta functions, or you can write them kind of this residue form where you have a one. Residue form, or you have a one-form integral. And the first thing to notice here is that, well, if we can solve the problem of the elliptic sunrise, there's a sub-problem we need to solve first, which is, well, this simpler integral. This arises as a cut of the original integral. So, somehow in the final answer, it should be present. So. So, what are we dealing with? What we have is we're looking at a space where all of these denominators vanish. So, it's a four-dimensional space and we impose three equations. And the intersection of these three equations will give me a curve. So, I'm imposing the three equations, I get the curve C, and we can consider a complex. And we can consider the complex points of C or the real points of C. Now, on this on the complex curve, we have a holomorphic one-form. Now, the holomorphic one-form is obtained from the original integral by just taking residues. Sorry, taking residues when these propagators vanish. So, we take three residues and we end. Three residues, and we end up with a one form. This one form can be written more explicitly, but here I prefer for symmetry reason to keep it in this form. Now, this is a holomorphic one-form if the curve C is smooth. So, for some values of the parameters, like the masses or extended momenta, the curve C will not be smooth, actually. And I will come back to a discussion of those. Come back to a discussion of those examples. So that's the cohomology side. And this illustrates what I said at the beginning that in these problems the one form or the top holomorphic form is given to you by physics. You can just compute the residues and you get a holomorphic form. Now the homology, so we need to integrate this. Homology, so we need to integrate this. Turns out that one homology class is also given to you by physics. But before I get there, the general story here is that for this curve, the homology, the first homology is two-dimensional. And actually, the real points of the curve will always be a homology class of the complex curve. And as I will show, it's an integral. And as I will show, it's an integral homology class. And actually, in the case of the sunrise, it's always divisible by two. It's a funny funny fact. Now, this is not an algebraic cycle, which, well, in this case, is rather trivial because it's actually odd-dimensional. So it means it's not defined by an algebraic equation. And just as the holomorphic form omega, this is part of the physics input. Form omega, this is part of the physics input, right? Not all these cycles are created equal, and one of them is special and it's given to you from the beginning. Now, if you have another one, then you can define this period vector. So you integrate this holomorphic form along each one of them, and you get two numbers. Now, as I said, you have one cycle. Have one cycle that's given to you, and you want to generate a basis for the whole homology. So, one way to do that is you start with this cycle you have and you transport it together with the curve it sits in around a singular point. So, these are the singular points I mentioned before, and these are the Landau singularities. So, you take in this moduli space of the curve. Moduli space of the curve, which are basically the kinematics of the problem. You take the curve, C, and you transport it around one of the singularities and the cycle inside of it as well. And by the time you come back, you get a new cycle, gamma prime. So if you start with gamma, you get gamma prime. And the difference between two, the two, gamma prime minus gamma, is prime minus gamma is up to a multiple a numerical factor which mostly not going to worry about a you get a new cycle delta now in picarlevscheid's theory which i don't have time to introduce here this is called a vanishing cycle so just remember this term it's called a vanishing cycle because if i move the If I move the curve together with this cycle towards the singularity, this is going to pinch. It's going to pinch and it's not going to be a cycle anymore at the location of the singularity. Now, another way of saying the same thing is that this function, this integral, of omega along this homology class gamma is a multi-valued function. So if I transport it or I analytically continue it. Port it or analytically continue it around the singularity. By the time you come back, you obtain well the same thing plus something else, which is the same numerical factor that multiplies the integral of omega along this vanishing cycle. And in fact, the full period vector transforms, so you can have this right action of a two by two matrix in this case. By two matrix in this case. And one thing to notice here is that this is not unipotent. So in the polylogarithmic case, you have some zeros. It has a triangular shape, which you don't have here anymore. That's a difference from the other simpler case of polylogs. Right, so here's an explicit way to parametrize the curve. The curve. I'm mostly not going to use this parametrization, but I'm just going to give it to you just to see how it can work in practice. So this is the Feynman diagram, and then you can look at it in position in dual space. So I'm taking these vectors and putting them back to back. And by momentum conservation, I get the closed polygon, and I can parameterize this polygon. Polygon, and I can parameterize this polygon by these two diagonals x and y. And this is a two-dimensional picture. X and Y are not independent, right? So we have a curve, so we can write a relation between them. And well, geometrically, the relation between them is basically the constraint that the volume of this would-be tetrahedron. Volume of this would-be tetrahedron should be zero, right? So you can think of this figure here as being a tetrahedron which is flattened to two dimensions. So you can get a pretty explicit formula for the relation between x squared and y squared, which has some coefficients. I'm not even writing all of them because they can get complicated. All right. All right. So I already told you about dual space. So once we impose the constraints of the cut propagators or the delta functions, we can build a quadrilateral. And we have x03, which is the external momentum, and we have x01, x, x00. x x 1 0 x 2 1 and x 3 2 which are the momenta q 1 q 2 q 3 they add up to p and we also have the constraint that the the distances here this distance is m1 this distance is i'm not sure if you can see the pointer this distance between x1 and x2 is m2 and this distance between x3 and x2 is m3 and so now the elliptic curve The elliptic curve is the space of configurations of this polygon, of this quadrilateral. So, for every quadrilateral that satisfies these constraints, I get a point on my curve and conversely. Now, here I did the Euclidean version. You can actually do Lorentzian, no problem. No problem. So, in the Lorentzian case, what happens is just that the triangle inequality has the reverse sign. All right, so let's look at some of these configurations. So, what I was saying here is that if you think of the point X2, well, and the point X2 has Well, and the point x2 has to be inside of, has to be inside of an annulus that has its center at x0 and it has radii m1 minus m2 and m1 plus m2. Right, so and it also has to be on a circle that's centered at x3 and it has radius m3. So that's what I'm drawing here. I'm drawing here is that the possible values where x the possible locations of x2 the locus of x2 is this this arc of circle here between the two circles in this annulus center at x0 and now for every x2 here on this arc there's actually two values of x1 and that will obtain one That are obtained one from another by reflection. So I can, for every point here on this arc, I can choose, I can have two configurations of my polygon that correspond to it. So in other words, I have two points on the elliptic curve. Now, if I go to one of the, I'm not sure if I have a figure. If I have a figure, if I go to the ends of this arc, in fact, the reflections, the line x0, the points x0, x1, and x2 are along a single line. So reflection doesn't add an extra copy. And so what I can do is to make a cycle, you see, because this looks like it has a boundary. Is this looks like it has a boundary? What happens is that you should double this curve and the points that you're talking about. Sorry? Can you geometrically describe the reflection you're talking about? Yeah, the reflection is in this line x0, x2. So you see, the reflection doesn't change the lengths of the sides, right? So if I have one. And so, if I have one configuration, in fact, for this elliptic curve, I can have lots of reflections. So, I can generate more points from points I already have. If I have one configuration, I have a point, and then I can apply reflections. I can apply a reflection in X3, X1, for example. I can apply reflection in X0, X2, right? So, I can apply a reflection in X0, X3. And so, this is one of these geometric. So this is one of these geometric facts that you don't really see if you just have an equation, right? It might be hard to see, but once you draw the picture, it becomes obvious. So the whole point of this discussion was to build, to show you what a cycle looks like. So the cycle in this case looks like this arc, a circle. This arc of circle, and it's got double copy on top of it so that it doesn't have any boundary, right? So, the boundary points are joined to the second copy. So, in fact, this is the slide where I described what I just told you. For each point in the interior of this arc, there are two solutions for exposure. This arc, there are two solutions for x1. So these are x1 plus minus here, and we glue the two copies of the arc along the boundaries to make a cycle. And this cycle has a topology of a circle. And in fact, there are two circles because I should have also looked at this cycle here. Right, so the geometric constraints imposed by Constraints imposed by the delta functions define an integration domain, which is, well, it has a topology of two circles, as you've seen. And now, there's other configurations. There's something that's called a Grassov condition. So, if you have a polygon, a quadrilateral with side lengths a1, dot, dot, dot, a4, and if they satisfy this condition at the sum of the minimum. This condition that the sum of the minimum and the maximum is smaller than the semi-perimeter, well, in that case, one of the vertices is free to move along a full circle, while the other ones are moving along an arc of circle. And it's a fun fact is that this is how your windshield wipers work. So here's an example. So I have the same polygon as before. The same polygon as before: x0, x1, x2, x3. And I'm looking at the location of x2, and x2 can be along this circle. So you have to choose the side lengths appropriately for this to work. And in fact, it has a double cover because just specifying x2 doesn't uniquely specify a point on a curve, but it specifies two points on a curve. Two points on a curve. So, to pick which one, you have to pick which one of the two circles. So, I mean, this is something we already knew that one cycles and elliptic curves have topology of a circle. You can think of them as circles. But we recovered it from a different perspective. Okay, maybe if there are questions here before I move on. If there are questions here before I move on to a more complicated case, no, I think we're happy. All right. So now look at the three-loop sunrise. This is, well, it's kind of the same story. You have this three-loop integral. You have p equals q1 plus q2 plus q3 plus q4. You look at the cut integral. This is familiar. This is familiar. And now you take the residues as before, you have a six-form, and you take four residues, so you get the holomorphic two-form. And again, if you parametrize explicitly, you can write this much more explicitly. Here, I just chose to keep it kind of in an implicit form for symmetry's sake. Now, as before, this holomorphic form is this form is. This form is holomorphic as long as the surface sigma is smooth. So now this surface actually turns out to be a K3. And for K3, the cohomology can be split into various types of holomorphic, anti-holomorphic pieces, and they form what's called a Hodge diagnostic. And they form what's called a Hodge diamond. So, specifically for K3, it looks like this: you have a one holomorphic form H20, and then you have 20 one, one forms, and then you have another one anti-holomorphic in middle cohomology. And dually, to this 22 To these 22 forms that form the two-dimensional cohomology, you have the two-dimensional homology. So there's 22 basis of 22 cycles. You should be able to find a basis of 22 cycles for the homology of the surface. And I'm calling them gamma i, and then you can form a period vector. Vector by just integrating omega along all of these 22 cycles. And here again, you have a Torelli theorem that tells you that the complex structure is completely determined by the period vector. Now, one of the cycles can be taken to be the real points of this surface. And this is actually the one that's relevant for. And this is actually the one that's relevant for physics. And the idea here would be the same. How do we get the other cycles? We can try to transport this first cycle that's given to us around singularities. And now, gamma one is not algebraic. It has dimension two, so that's not a trivial statement now. And I will try to show you how to construct it. To construct it, so the construction goes pretty much along the same lines. So I have a pentagon now in two dimensions, and it has fixed side lengths. So what is the configuration space of the such pentagons? Well, it's a K3, turns out. And so to build it, So to build it, I'm going to pick one of these dual points x2. And just like before, it has to be in an annulus with center x0. And it actually now has to be in an annulus with center x4. Before it had to be on a circle, now it has to be inside of an annulus. So these inequalities define a domain. And for every point in a domain, there's actually four configurations for my polygon. Polygon. So I'm drawing it here. So you see the furthest you can get from x4. Let's actually do x0. The furthest you can get from x0 is m1 plus m2. So you're going to be along this line. The closest you can get is along this arc of circle. And the same thing for x4. So x2, no matter what, has to be inside of this domain. This domain that's defined by four arcs of circle. And for every x2 here, there's two solutions for x3 and two solutions for x1. And again, these are related by reflection between plus and minus x1 and plus and minus x3. Now, if x2 is on the boundary, but I have an accord. Boundary, but not on a corner, there's actually only two possible values, and they are related by reflection. So you can see this here. If I take my point x2 to be along this arc of circle, well, the points x0, x1, and x2 are actually along a line, so reflection doesn't create a new copy of x1. This is invariant of the reflection. But you still have the two. Have the two copies of X3. So you still have two points in the surface that are defined by this position of X2. Now, even more special, actually, you can also play the same game for these other sides and you get the same conclusion. And even more special configuration is if you're at the corner. And if you're at the corner, there's really only one possibility. So this point here corresponds. So this point here corresponds uniquely to a point in the in the K3 surface. So we have to glue these things together in some way. And the way you can glue them is that, well, there's four copies of the two-dimensional patches D. There's four curves, each taken twice. So the four curves are these arcs. And each one is taken twice. And each one is taken twice. And then there's four points, which are the corners. And each one of these points is actually taken only once. And if you look at it, well, you can glue them and you get this. You get a torus. So the integration cycle is a torus. And in fact, there's two copies, just like before, because you can. before because you can reflect in the line x0 x4 and you get another copy i think we should be x0x4 yeah and you also have these analogs of grassroots conditions so depending on the lengths of the different sides you get different configurations so here I picked this special one All right, so maybe I should stop for questions at this point. Is there any question? Okay. You can keep going. So another thing we have for the homology is an intersection form. Now for two dimensions, this is symmetric. In even dimension, it's symmetric. In odd dimension, it's Even dimension is symmetric, in odd dimension is anti-symmetric. So, for elliptic curves, this actually be anti-symmetric. And general results tell you that it's an even cell dual lattice of signature 319. And as it turns out, all these lattices have been classified. So, really, after a change of basis, an integral change of basis, and this is given by this lattice lambda 319. 319, which is formed by two copies of the Cartan matrix of E8, actually the negative of Cartan matrix of E8, and three copies of this hyperbolic matrix so that's something. So that's something we should be able to see if we look at the cycles. We should be able to somehow reproduce this. Now, coming back to the story I was announcing before, we want to build cycles using Pikachalevsh's theory. So the basic idea is that we have some space parameterized by t. Parameterized by t and for each value of t we have this space y of t this fiber and inside of it we consider homology classes and there's various singular points t zero and as we take a path in t along around t zero we we come back to a deformed integration cycle so the explicit formula So the explicit formula, this is the first time I write it here, goes like this, right? So gamma gets transformed to gamma plus. There's some numerical factor, there's some intersection between the two cycles, and then that multiplies this delta, which is the vanishing cycle. If you apply this for k equals 2, you get a simple form. And actually, if you assume that delta is a sphere, you get that. You get that delta squared is minus two, and if you do the transformation twice, you get back the same thing. So, you get these vanishing cycles that are spheres. All of these, if you multiply this by minus one, all of these minus twos here on the diagonal should be some kind of two spheres. This relies on a result that the self-intersection of an n-sphere has this form. As this form. So I'm not describing in detail what these intersections are. If you are really interested, you should ask me because I can explain this. Christian, I have a question. Yeah. Is the interpretation of this involution property that you're looking at? Sorry, I can barely hear you. Is this interpretation of the involution property you just highlighted, a statement that you're looking at an algebraic singularity? The singularity could be of type square root, even though it's from for a function which is not, yeah, it could be some elliptic function that can have either square root or log singularity or some something else. So it's not implied automatically that it's a square root, not a logarithm from this property? It would imply that it's a square root, but the function it's coming from can be a pretty complicated function. It just happens to be a function. Be a pre-computated function, it just happens to have a square root singularity at that point. Yes, good. Okay, thank you. All right, so yeah, so this is what I just said. The 16 homologic classes of intersection minus two, we should try to get somehow. There are six homology classes with self-intersection zero. These are from the diagonal of this hyperbolic matrix, three copies. Three copies of it. And now the gamma one I showed you, which is a torus, has vanishing self-intersection. So, well, you can see this in several ways. One of the ways is that you can do a deformation, complex deformation, and that can be described as a small vector field that tells you the imaginary direction in which you're going. And you can choose a normal. Going, and you can choose a nowhere vanishing vector field on a torus, which is something you couldn't do on a sphere. And that's how you see that you can deform the initial cycle to a neighboring cycle that doesn't intersect it at all. So the intersection number is zero. You can have some other version of this for algebraic cycles of genus G. I think I'm just going to go over this very quickly. Go over this very quickly. Now, what we have, the K3s we're dealing with here are algebraic. And if there's an algebraic curve C inside of sigma, this is also a two cycle. And you can show that you can dualize it to a two cycle in the intersection of the integral. intersection of the integral second homology of sigma with h11 and it's called the picard group and the rank of the picard group is called the picard rank and it's an important invariant of k3s it's something it's a very refined invariant of the k3 and if we have several of them we can define a an orthogonal We can define an orthogonal lattice with the orthogonal with respect to the intersection form. And that's called a transcendental lattice. And it's transcendental because, as far as omega is concerned, this is the only part that gives you something non-trivial. The algebraic cycles give you something vanishing. So for physics, these algebraic cycles are completely invisible. You never see them. See them. Okay, there's some more about reflections. This is something I couldn't help but point out. So there's these vanishing two cycles that somehow should exist in the homology. They have inter self-intersection minus two. And then under this action of a this trans transport under this Transport under this monodromy of homologies or the action of the fundamental group and the homology, you by Pikalevschitz, you get this formula. And actually, this is also a reflection. If you look, what happens if you reflect in the vector v, well, that's exactly the formula that you have. And the only slow. The only slight unusual thing is that you're reflecting in a vector of negative norm, but that's not so there's reflections and there's also reflections in the eight simple roots of A3, of E8, sorry. And in fact, there's eight singular points. If you look at the Landau loci. At the Landau lossi of this k3, there's eight singular points, and this is kind of an interesting numerological fact. And now I'm quickly running out of time, but you know, the previous approach with transporting a cycle along a singularity and coming back, well, it may be workable, but that's a difficult thing. But that's the approach we first tried. It's maybe workable, but it seems like there's a simpler way. So, a simple way to do things relies on the fact that this surface has a lot of interesting properties, one of which is the existence of various vibrations. So, take a look at this figure. So, here I can pick x0. Here, I can pick x0, x2, and fix it. I just fix this length. And then, well, then I go back to the problem I had before of this quadrilateral. The triangle is fixed up to a reflection, so x1 gets reflected. But then I have this quadrilateral, which is an elliptic curve. And so I have a vibration if I fix this side length. This side length this side length will parametrize more or less, it's actually not quite the right variable, but if you can think of it roughly as parametrizing the P1 down here. And if you fix this value, then well, what you have is an elliptic curve. So you have this elliptic vibration over P1. And in fact, you have more than one. You can pick the other diagonal and And that's going to give you another one. Or you can permute the edges and pick diagonal in the new polygon. So then you can try to construct a cycle based on this idea of Lefschetz thymbal. So I'm just going to quickly explain this. Keep in mind this. Keep in mind this picture here. I have P1. I'm going to pick a coordinate t in P1. And in fact, for some values of T here, you're going to get a degenerate singular elliptic curve. I mean, you can see that if I take this side here so that it corresponds to some Landau singularities, so that this polygon, this quadrilateral here, degenerates itself. Here degenerates itself, then this is going to be a singular elliptic curve. So now the idea is we have a singular point in P1 and it's got this singular fiber, but let's take a path around it and come back. So I start with some one cycle now, sigma, and I know that the one cycles of One cycles of the elliptic curve from the previous construction. They're just circles. So I take this circle and we go around the singularity, we come back and you get another one, which is this L sigma. But now if you think of this whole surface, right, so sigma, sigma swipes a surface. Sigma swipes a surface as it goes along this cycle and it comes back to a different one. And if you can find another L, L prime, in the first homotopy group of P1 based at T, and that gives you the same L star, right? The same cycle after coming back, and you take the difference. And you take the difference, then you get a second homology class of sigma. An alternative way of doing this would be instead of going around, you go straight to the singularity, you drive straight to it, and then this cycle shrinks to a point. And I think that's probably more accurately what's called a Lefschetz symbol. And then you can find another point and you drive straight into it and it shrinks again. And this is, well, you can come. And this is, well, you can convince yourself you can build the cycles for a hyperliptic curve in this case if you describe it as a double cover branched at a number of points in P1. So message so far, some of the cycles will be algebraic. They are real two-dimensional. The integral along them is trivial. And the The only differential form that comes from physics is omega. So sometimes you may have other differential forms representatives of cohomology classes, but they're not given to you by physics a priori. The iterated discontinuities are integrals of omega over various homology two cycles and we only need a transcendental lattice, the one the ones that. That is the ones that the cycles that give you something non-trivial. Now, Picard Fuchs works in a very different way. For Picard Fuchs, you have some differential form and it's got this moduli t that it depends on. And you can take a derivative with respect to the moduli and re-express that as a linear combination of a basis of differential forms, a basis of your cohomology, and And the total differential. So then you can write a differential, a system of differential equations of this type. So it gives you, in principle, it gives you more than what you want, not just integrals of omega, the holomorphic top form, but also the other ones. And here I just want to illustrate one point is that if you don't do any differential equations, you might have... If you don't do any differential equations, you might ask, okay, how are you going to compute this answer? And I think one way to go about this is to ask, what do you do also in the simplest case of an elliptic curve? The way to compute this answer is not by computing an integral. You don't do an integral. If you try to ask your favorite software to compute this, it's not going to do an integral to compute it. It's going to use the properties of this function. And And especially for the elliptic case, an integral of this type can be computed very quickly by iteration. So here you just apply this several times and you get that this function is a limit of, this is very easy to obtain. Geometrically, this has to do with an isogeny of the elliptic curve. To do with an isogeny of the elliptic curve. So the idea then would be if you want to compute an integral here, well, you can apply the isogeny fiberwise and see. Then you can do this fiber integral. And then finally, you do an integral along this type of cycles here in the base in P1. And that should be, I think, reasonably efficient. And it And it gives you the answer wherever you wanted in the physical region, for example. You don't need to analytically continue or anything like that. So that's one way you can think of actually obtaining this period vector that you want. Now, with higher genus, we have a slightly different story in the sense that. A different story in the sense that there is G holomorphic forms, but only one of them is given by physics. Again, you're not a priori if you just have a Genus G curve. You don't know which one to pick. But physics gives you the one you need to look at. And instead of looking at the matrix, you can look at the vector. At the matrix, you can look at the vector. For physics purposes, all you need to care about are all these integrals of omega along the A and B cycles. Okay, thank you very much. Great. Thank you, Christian, for that talk. Are there any questions here? We have one for Roger. Thank you for your. Thank you, Christin, for a very nice talk. So at the beginning, you say you ask whether there is a notion of a unique geometry, and you get these cycles and elliptic curves and K3s in a way that it's mostly determined by physics. Is it by any coincidence this elliptic curve isomorphic, isogenous to the other representations? Yeah, so well, the the first test you can do The first test you can do, and I think it's already a pretty good one, is that, in fact, this uniqueness of the integration cycle and the form works for all representations. It's not just momentum space, you can have it in Feynman space. And well, if you can compute the integrals in both cases and compute, The integrals in both cases and compare, I think that's already a pretty remember that these forms are also normalized. You know, they're not, you don't get to multiply the form by two, you know, because physics just gives you a normalized form. And, you know, you might decide to pull out various factors for various reasons. You know, if you want to apply a differential operator, maybe you don't want to include some factors, but the way it comes. But the way it comes from physics, it is normalized in a canonical way. Maybe it's not appropriate for some techniques you want to use. But so I would say that, yeah, if you compare the two cases and you get the same answer, the same numerical answer, it's a pretty good indication that you're dealing with the same thing. Now, that does not mean that The curves are the same, right? So there's this story of isogenies, exactly the idea here that I was using, and that you can rewrite the same integral. So basically, every iteration you do, you change the curve. You can change it an infinite number of times. And it becomes, in a sense, it becomes skinnier and skinnier topologically until it, you know, you can. Until you can't distinguish it from a circle, and then you can do the circle integral. That's kind of the picture. Now, whether analogous phenomenons happen for Calabia's, I don't know. It would be fascinating if they did. Like if you had cases where functions, this kind of these period integrals had properties of this type that would allow you to iterate and. And relate them to the same period for other moduli or something of this type, that would be a very nice result. But as far as I know, this is not okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions? If not, I've got a couple. So, one question I have, Christian, actually, can you confirm you can hear me out of this mic as well, Chris? I can hear you. I can hear you. Great. So, one question I had was: you were saying these algebraic cycles are not relevant for physics. Just to make sure, as a statement, that these cycles can't appear as vanishing cycles in Picard Levschetz, therefore they just can't contribute. I think they can vanish, but the problem is that you see, at the end of the day, you want to integrate. So if the integrals along them are zero, you know, it's not. Can you hear me now? Oh, what happened? Hello? Hello. Can you hear me? Oh. Can you hear me? I think oh. Oh, sorry, yes, we unfortunately lost all that answer because our internet here for a second. Um but but now we can hear you again. But now we can hear you again. Okay, so so if you see, if they um even if they are vanishing cycles and eventually you you want to apply picarlephs, you end up with something like this. And if that gives you zero, you know, it's like that singularity wasn't there. I see, but is it obvious that this happens for all algebraic cycles? Yeah, so what happens is that you can get these cycles. At these cycles, typically the way the simplest way you can understand them is if your variety comes with an embedding, which for us it does in some space, some projective space or products or projective spaces or such, you can intersect it with hyperplanes of various types. And that by definition gives you an algebraic cycle. So now, you know, if. You know, if it's a hypersurface in a projective space, you integrate, intersect with a hyperplane, it gives you a cycle, and then all of the other hyperplanes give you an equivalent cycle. So you're not getting another one by intersecting with a different hyperplane. But in some cases where you have products, you can get different ones depending on you, you know, you put the hyperplane to sit at the point in one of the factors or the other. Or the other. So, yeah, the more special this calabia or varieties are, in the sense of having lots of cycles, the better it is in a way, because it means that the period vector only has fewer non-trivial entries, and some of them are going to be zero. And some of them are going to be zero. I see. So I guess the point is that these algebraic cycles, nothing special is happening in the form omega along those cycles. So that's why. Yeah, they're kind of invisible. You don't really see them. If you just probe them with omega, if you probe with something else, you're going to see them. But the point I was trying to make is that for physics, only omega is important. And then the other last question I had was: you highlighted a number of reflectants in the K3 case. Are those manifesting some symmetry of the original integral, or is that just symmetries to the K3 case? Which symmetries, sorry? Oh, well, you talked about a number of reflections you get in certain analytic continuations. No, so there's symmetries of K3. So Well, yeah, the symmetries of the cut integral before, not really. Okay, cool. All right, thank you. Are there any other questions in the room before we break? All right. Well, let's thank Christian again then. And maybe, Christian, you're willing to stick around in case someone wants to come up and take the mic during the course. Thanks. Let's thank Christian again.
