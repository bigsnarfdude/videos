What do we do? I think we can probably start. Are you are you ready, Justin? Yeah, I'm ready. Okay, so uh I'm pleased to introduce our our next speaker. Introduce our next speaker, Xiao Ting Su, who will talk about identification and estimation in many-to-one two-sided matching without transfers. So please go ahead. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting together such an insightful workshop. So today I'm glad to present a paper that is titled Identification and Estimation in Many to One Two Siding Matching. In many to one to side matching without transfers. So, as you should know, that optimal transport has a lot of applications in the matching models. So, this matching model I'm presenting today is slightly different from those kind of matching models. But hopefully, there is a connection that we can find between the optimal transport and this kind of matching models that will be great to. Will be great to add to the literature. So, in this paper, we study many-to-one matching without transfers, so with non-transferable utilities. This model is a two-sided model in the sense that each side has preferences over the agents on the other side. And also, our model can be applied even if the market is not a centralized market. So, basically, Markets. So basically, it can be applied to both decentralized and centralized markets. So, to think about the applications of such a model, you can just think about college admissions in the US and Canada, where students basically can apply for multiple colleges, and then they may receive multiple offers. And finally, there will be a match between student and college. And other applications include primary and secondary school. And secondary school admissions, and also like nursing home match. So, now the main question we answer in this paper is as follows. Suppose we only have data on the matching outcome of one market. That is basically if we only observe who matches with whom. Then, in this case, how can we identify and estimate the preferences of the agents on both sides? On both sides, we answer this question by first of all showing non-parametric identification of the distribution of agent preferences of both sides. This is based on the variation from excluded variables. Then we construct non-parametric and semi-parametric estimators based on the constructive identification results. However, our simulation. However, our simulation study shows that these kinds of estimators only perform well when the cursive dimensionality is not severe. So lastly, we resort to a parametric approach that is basically a parametric Bayesian approach with a GIF sampler, which turned out to work well in a realistically sizable problem. And then we illustrate our methodology. We illustrate our methodology in empirical application of middle school admissions in Chile. This is like a sized market with 9,000 students and over 100 schools. And it is a decentralized market where students choose schools, but also schools can choose students. So it's a two-sided problem. So as I mentioned, the problem is set up as The problem is set up as a college admission problem. So, specifically, we consider a continuum of students and a finite number of colleges. So we index student by I and college by C. And also student has an outside option with which we use zero to denote the outside option. We also assume each college has a capacity that is. Has a capacity that is exogenously given, which is denoted by QC. Then for each student, I, the student has several observed characteristics, I mean, the characteristics that are observed to the researchers. And these observables can be partitioned into three parts. Basically, ZI here refers to the kind Here refers to the kind of variables that could potentially affect both student and college preferences. You can think of, for example, students' family income or mother's education that could affect both student preferences over colleges and colleges' preferences over students. In addition, we introduce excluded variables. So YI are the variables that only affect Variables that only affect student preferences, and WI are the excluded variables that only affect college preferences. And then for each student I and college C pair, we assume there is a scalar unobserved taste shock on each side. So optional IC is on the student side and adapt CI is on the college side. We collect for each student I, we collect For each student, I, we collect all her observables in this vector, and we assume this vector is ID distributed across students, and they can follow a fully non-parametric distribution. In this way, actually, we allow for arbitrary correlation structure within the observables for each student. Now, let's look at the specifications. Let's look at the specification of the utility functions. Utility of student I, when matched with college C, is UIC. It is separable into a non-parametric function of ZI, that is like a student's family income, mother's education, and so on, plus an index that depends on the excluded variable YC plus the N-observe. Plus the unobserved taste shop optional IC. And the utility of the outside option is normalized to zero. And for college preference utility for student, we denote it as VCI and specify it in a similar form. Here we make some assumptions about the college's preferences. Colleges' preferences. First of all, we assume that a college evaluates each student individually. In this case, then the college is trying to rank its, so the process is that the college ranks students and then try to admit as many students in the high rank as possible until their capacity is filled. If we do not make this assumption, the problem will become The problem will become intractable because then we have to specify a college's preference over all possible subsets of students. Also, we assume every student now is acceptable to every college, so college is always waiting to accept student if there is any vacancy left. This assumption will be, it actually can be relaxed, and then we discuss this in our paper. So the pressure. So the parameters of interest here are the non-parametric function UC, RC, VC, and also the joint distribution F of the n-observables. But for today's presentation, let's just assume Rc is an identity function, so that you can see that basically the coefficient of the excluded variables are both not. The excluded variables are both normalized to one. So then the parameters of interest will be UC, VC, and F. We use stability as a solution concept, which is typical in the matching literature. And as Vio and Leshno 2016 show that a stable matching exists and is generically unique in a setting like ours. So the key assumption here to guarantee the unique Here to guarantee the uniqueness of the equilibrium is that the number of students goes to infinity and the number of colleges remain fixed. Then we then follow their micro-theoretical results and use cutoffs to equivalently characterize a stable matching. Remember that VCJ is the utility of College C when. Of college C when matched with student J. So you can think of it as some overall score assigned by college C to student J. Then intuitively, the cutoffs can be defined as a minimal score among all the matched students. This delta C is a finite number if the college has a binding capacity. Basically, you can then define Can then define the cutoff using the minimal score. But when the college does not have a like, when the college capacity is not binding, it means that the college is still willing to accept the students. So anyone who wants to get into the college still can get in. In this case, the cutoff is said to be negative infinity. So in this model, actually, we have an Actually, we have an equivalence between stability and a multinomial discrete choice problem. But because of the two-sided nature that students choose colleges, but also colleges choose students, so a student cannot choose among all colleges in the market. She can only choose among the feasible colleges. And the advantage of having this cut-off structure. Of having this cutoff structure is that it allows us then to have an explicit form for feasibility. So we say that college C is feasible to student I if she clears a cutoff. Basically, the score she obtained from college C is above the cutoff. Then, in equilibrium, every student will be matched with her most preferred feasible college. Although here we have an explicit form for feasibility, but the problem is still challenging because, as you can see here, the cutoffs are defined in terms of college preferences, which are unknown to the researchers. Therefore, the cutoffs are still unobserved, and it is determined by the equilibrium. And as a result, the feasibility or C-feasible sets are also. Feasible sets are also endogenous and observed and personalized. So here is an example of feasible sets in the case of two colleges. In this table, it lists all possible feasible sets in the two college case. So, first of all, the outside option is always available to the student. So Student, so zero appears in all possible feasible sets. Then there are only four possible feasible sets. Only college one is feasible, only college two is feasible, both colleges are feasible, or neither college is feasible. And for each case, we can express this case using the inequality between V and delta. For example, For example, for the first case, it is a case that V1i is larger than delta 1 and V2i is below delta 2. Then let's define the conditional probability that a specific set L is individual I is student I is feasible set. We use lambda L to denote this conditional probability. In our example, for example, For example, we can write the lambda of one zero to be the conditional probability of the following inequalities. However, it's worth noting here that although we have an explicit form, but we do not observe which college is feasible to the student. So, this conditional probability cannot be recovered from the data yet. Now, this is a key equation for understanding our identification strategy. So, it is essentially a mixture model. On the left-hand side, we have the conditional probability of matching with college C. And it is something that we can estimate from the data. We use sigma c to denote this conditional probability. And then the And then the right-hand side breaks this into a summation over all possible feasible sets. And for each even feasible set, the blue term G is the conditional probability of selecting college C when L is the feasible set. It is then multiplied by the red term lambda L, which is a conditional probability of L being the feasible set. Of L being the feasible set. So, from this equation, you may want to estimate this equation directly, treating lambda L as a nuisance parameter. But here the problem is that the number of possible feasible sets is 2 to the power of capital C. So it's 2 to the power of the number of columns. Two to the power of the number of colleges. So, when the number of colleges increase, then for a large number of colleges, this number of feasible sets becomes large. However, this equation provides a structural decomposition so that we can decompose the problem into the student part and college part. So, for any given L, actually, you can see. given L actually you can see that the blue term by definition if we fix L the blue term will only only depends on student preference and the red term will only depends on college preferences. Now it's natural to introduce a set of excluded variables. So because YIC only interests a student preference, it can act as a demand shifter. As a demand shifter, and because WIC only enters college preference, it can act as a feasible set shifter. An example for the excluded variable in college animation could be YIC could be the distance between student I and college C that only affects student preferences. And WIC could be some specific observed score assigned by college C. Or assigned by College CT student I. So here are the identifying assumptions. We assume that all the covariates are continuous, and this actually can be relaxed to some extent. And then the following two assumptions just impose smoothness on the nonparametric function and the joint distribution so that the conditional match probability will be different. Match probability will be differentiable. And also, we make the standard exogeneity assumption that the n-observables are independent of the observables. So now let's identify the partial derivatives of the non-parametric functions first. So let me illustrate the intuition using a one-college example. In this example, there is only college one, and the college preference. And college preference and student preference are specified in our model. And then there is also an n-observed cutoff delta 1. For simplicity here, just consider R1 is an identity function. Now let's fix the value of the observed characteristics, z, w, and y. So for any given value of the observable, Any given value of the observables, we can actually partition the space of the unobservable into four parts. So now here the horizontal line separates the space of eta1 into two parts. Above the horizontal line, it is the case that V1i is larger than delta one. So it means that college one is feasible. And below the horizontal line, And below the horizontal line, it is the case that college one is not feasible. And then the vertical line separates the space of abschnele into two parts. On the right-hand side, it is the case that UI1 is larger than UI0. So college 1 is acceptable, meaning that college 1 is better than the outside option. And on the left-hand side, it is the case that college 1 is unacceptable. That college one is unacceptable. And the match occurs if and only if the college is feasible and acceptable. So that corresponds to the yellow area in the graph. Now let's consider how the variations of y, w, and z affect this graph. So first of all, if we consider decreasing the value of w1 by delta w, this Delta W. This will make college one less likely to be feasible. And because W1 only appears in V, so W1 only affects college preference, you can imagine that now decrease the value of W will shift the partition only vertically. And that will lead to now this yellow area is the condition. Now, this yellow area corresponds to the conditional match probability, and I2 corresponds to the change in the conditional match probability. And formally speaking, we can write down the following equation. On the left-hand side is the effect of W1 on sigma 1. And it is only affected, like its impact is only realized through the longer term, which for Through the longer term, which corresponds to college preference. Similarly, if we decrease the value of Y1, it will make college 1 less tractable. So because Y1 only affects student preferences, you can imagine that then the change in Y1 will shift the partition horizontally. And now I1 highlights. I1 highlights the change in the match probability corresponding to caused by the change in the value of Y1. And formally, writing down a relationship, the effect Y1 on sigma1 will be realized only through the G-term, which corresponds to student preferences. What about changing Z? Because Z. Because Z affects both student and college preferences. So changing the value of Z will move the partition both vertically and horizontally. So that is highlighted by the area I3. And also another difference between the variation in Z and the excluded variable is that because here the Because here the coefficient of w and y are normalized to one. So when w moves by one unit, v will move by one unit as well. But z is different. The effect of z on v depends on the shape of the function v1 and also depends on the shape of the function u1 as well. So the basic idea. So, the basic idea then is to combine all these three kinds of variations, and then we can recover the shape of V1 and U1. So, here is a formal expression of what I mentioned. So, these two equations are those you have just seen previously. That is, we use the effect, the variation. We use the effect the variation in y to trace out the variation in student preference, and we use w to trace out the variation in college preference. For z, the equation is a bit more complicated because z affects both sides and also z's effect depends on the shape of u and v. Now we can combine these three equations basically plugging in the first two equations. The two first two equations into the third and get rid of the summation terms. We can get one linear equation as follows. And if you look at this equation, it is basically a chain rule expression. On the left-hand side, it is the effect of z on the conditional match probability. And this effect is realized. This effect is realized through both student and college preference, and for each side, it is realized through these effects on the utility multiplied by the effect of utility on the final match probability. And also in this equation, the sigma, the derivative of sigma 1 are all observed in the population data, or say it can be a state. Data, or say, can be estimated from the data. And the remaining two terms in black are our unknowns. So it may seem that we have one equation with two unknowns. However, remember that this equation is obtained by fixing any value of z, y, w. So in principle, we can change. We can change the value of w to vary the derivative of sigma terms and then having two such equations. That is because when you change w, w's coefficient is normalized to one, so it will not increase the number of unknowns because z is still fixed. So once you have these two equations, Once you have these two equations, it's just solving a system of linear equations, given certain rank condition holes. And then we can identify the derivatives of u and v. And in the paper, we also discuss how to identify the r1 function. So this is a key step because knowing the derivatives of the utility functions are sufficient for a lot of empirical applications. Of empirical applications, or you can further integrate because now basically our result identifies the derivatives at each given value of z. So basically, you can integrate it out over the full support of z to get the level, the value of the utility functions. To generalize this one college case to multiple colleges, the idea is still similar. The idea is still similar. Here we have two equations with two unknowns. When you extend it to a general case, you will have two C unknowns, two times C unknowns, and you can still find two different values of W to construct two C equations. In this system equations, the first half, the top half, corresponds to one specific value. Corresponds to one specific value of w and the second half corresponds to another specific value of w. And each line corresponds to one college. We have sea colleges, so there will give you C rows. And then the identification, here the unknowns are the derivatives of u and v, and all the other terms are. And all the other terms can be estimated from the data. Therefore, the identification reduces to solving the system of linear equations. And as long as we have a full rank of this pi matrix, we're done here. And actually, we show that the rank condition for the pi matrix are satisfied in the commonly used logit or probate models. And also, we derive a set of sufficient. And also, we derive a set of sufficient conditions for this full-run condition that requires the large support of W and also a version of connected substitutes condition. And also, you know, in the paper, we show identification of the joint distribution F, and then we also discuss several practical issues. I will skip the empirical application, and because I'm running out of my time, I will. Running out of my time, I will just sum up. So, in the paper, we study a many-to-one matching model with non-transferable utilities. And we consider the case where preferences on both sides are unknown. And the key identification idea is to use the variation from the excluded variables. And then for estimation, we consider non-parametric, semparametric, and parametric methods. The first two suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Suffers from the cursive dimensionality and the parametric methods is more like turned out to be applicable in the realistic application problem. And then our empirical application is to study the decentralized middle school admissions in Chile. So thank you for listening. I know Mark has a question. I know Mark has a question. Are you able to hear us? Yes. Okay. Yeah, I have a question about the excluded variable W. Question and including it. The question is, so think of it as a grade in an exam, right? That's the example you gave, right? So the students grade in some exam. Do you need the exam to be this school specific? Is specific, or can it be a centralizing thing? Oh, yeah, that's a good question. So, actually, for the full identification of, you know, for identifying the full hydrogene, we do need the grade, the score to be college-specific. But in practice, we understand that a lot of cases, in a lot of cases, there is not group school. There is not group school-specific score. So, in that case, it turns out that in that case, we cannot identify college-specific utility functions. In that case, we can only identify like a utility function that is homogeneous across all the colleges. So, the key idea is that there is always a trade-off between the identifiable heterogeneity and the And the excluded variables you have. And the degree of heterogeneity you can identify heavily depends on the kind of excluded variables you have. One more quick question in this panel, observable for the college preferences that correlate between. That correlates with the covariance, some kind of fixed effect. Can you accommodate that in Flammont? Is that so? You're asking about the correlation among college preferences, right? And our model actually covers that because here, if you look at the unobservables, we do not assume that the observables. And observables are independent across colleges. My question is: Can you allow that whatever there is a correlation be correlated with the observed characteristics? The correlation? You mean like whatever unobservable at the college or the college, but it's unobservable to the econometrician, but observable to the college and correlated with characteristics. Sorry, I cannot. Uh, sorry, um, I cannot quite hear you clearly. So, you are asking about the correlation among colleges in terms of observables? Yeah, yeah, sorry about that. Can there be correlation between eta and z, for instance? Oh, I think actually we assume that away because I think the reason. I think the reason is that we consider the conditional match probability given the observables. So, if that there is correlation, then this term will become complicated, more complicated. There is not uniform functional form to characterize this one. So, we just assume that away. So, we assume the observables are exogenously given. As I gave it. Okay, so let's thank the speaker again. Thank you.
