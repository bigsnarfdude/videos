Thank you, Frank. Okay, so thank you, everyone, for attending the second lecture. Today, I want to move a little bit more into twisted character varieties. I want to define them for you. So I would need additional assumptions to do that. Basically, I will suppose that my group G is now a reductive affine algebraic. Reductive affine algebraic group over C, and that my fundamental group pi1x is finitely presented. So, again, this is very standard if you think about all the examples we know. Maybe X is a compact Riemann surface and G is just G and C and we are in a familiar setting. What is slightly less familiar, perhaps, is these assumptions that we had yesterday, where we have somehow a non-trivial action of Non-trivial action of the fundamental group pi1x on the automorphism group of G. Okay, and we saw that in that situation, we had a special set, a non-abelian cohomology set defined with respect to this non-trivial action here or arbitrary action here, where the co-cycles are just the cross-mode. Are just the cross-morphisms, so normalized cross-morphisms. So the way to read this is just to remember that when this morphism phi here is trivial, then this is just a usual group morphism, okay, this row, but otherwise it's twisted by this non-trivial action. Okay, and what we proved yesterday is that this set parameterizes Well, certain geometric objects that we called G phi sharp torsors, where G phi sharp is this group bundle, actually group covering, because I'm taking the discrete topology on G now. The group covering defined over X as this quotient. Okay, so maybe I didn't write it explicitly here on this slide. Write it explicitly here on this slide, but the way an element in the fundamental group acts on an element here is just by the usual action on the universal cover and this phi action on the group. Okay, so because phi gamma is a group automorphism, this group covering will descend to a group covering. Descend to a group covering of X. All right. And these objects were the so-called twisted local systems in the title of this minimal. Okay. All right. So basically today, what we want to do is to have a more algebraic version of this. So we want to turn this This set basically into an algebraic variety. So, in general, it's not possible because, as you know, when you are taking quotients like this, you may run into some problems. But of course, the point of having these two assumptions here is to have this set here be an affine variety, and then the reductive action of a linear group on an Group on an affine variety will give me an affine quotient by a geometric invariant view. Okay, so these are the standard assumptions to replace this quotient with GIT quotient, which will be an affine variety. Okay, and this will be our so-called BETI mobilized space. Okay, so the first observation that I want to share with you today is the fact that it is possible to Is the fact that it is possible to replace these twisted representations that we were considering yesterday by usual representations. And to do so, you just have to basically enlarge the group that you are looking at. Okay, so how to do that completely? Well, okay, we start from the twisted representation. So we have a twisted representation row here, and we will send it to a so-called extended representation. A so-called extended representation, which will have two components. So, okay, so it's a map into this semi-direct product, but okay, as I said, this is just the Cartesian product. So, it has two components. The first one is just the twisted representation rho, and the second one is this phi, which was this action. Okay, all right. So, what I'm claiming is that What I'm claiming is that, maybe you should write it. The claim is that row hat is a group morphism. And this is not difficult to check. And in fact, it's exactly what the notion of cross-morphism comes from, if you will, because basically if you Because basically, if you have a group morphism into a semi-direct product, the first component will be a cross-morphism. So that's just equivalent to say that a row is a twisted representation and to say that rho hat is a representation. Okay, so now what is the image of this map? Well, obviously, because of the second component here, the second component here is quite special, right? The second component here is quite special, right? So it's exactly looking at those group morphisms such that this diagram is commutative, where here you first you have, as a first map, you have this action phi, and the second map is just a second projection. So if this diagram commutes, basically it forces the second component to be this, and then your first component, as we have said, is just a twisted representation. All right, so that is the image. Right, so that is the image. It's clearly an injective map. And what you can check is that it is also g-equivariant. Actually, this is kind of the point to introduce these extended representations instead of sticking with the twisted representations. Is that when you embed in this way, the G-action that we had here, which was this Which was this twisted action. So, okay. So, on a twisted representation, it was defined like this, right? It was not exactly conjugacy, but twisted by this phi. And it would now become the usual conjugacy action in this larger group. Okay, it's just a conjugacy by a subgroup. By a subgroup, okay. This g is naturally a subgroup of this symmetric product, obviously. You just send well a g to g identity. All right, and okay, what I'm checking here for you is that if you embed this twisted representation, so if you take Twisted representation. So if you take the extended representation of this twisted representation, what you find is just the conjugation of the extended representation rho hat by G, okay, in this larger group. Okay, so this is actually much more convenient to handle. And in fact, okay, I haven't said this explicitly, but now is as good a time as any to do it. Do it. So, the case in which we are interested is the following: where the image of phi is a finite group. So it's basically the only important case, but it's also the only case that really comes up in examples. So there's not even a case to justify this on a theoretical level. It's just like all the examples are like this, so we may as well. Examples are like this, so we may as well assume it. Okay, of course, it's also true that if the group has a trivial center, you can just really get rid of this. I mean, really get rid of the part that is not finite. Basically, you can get rid of any non-auto-automorphism, any inner automorphism. Okay. Anyway, we will assume this. And then just as I was writing a G semi-direct product with the G semi-direct product with the automorphism group. I can just take this because, in any case, if you look at my embedding, I'm considering as an image, as a second component, the image of phi. So it's really the same. And maybe here it's slightly clearer that because I'm assuming pi1x to be finitely presented, and this is as a space, it's a product. As a space, it's a product of a finite number of copies of G, so it's an affine variety, and then this will be also an affine variety, it's a sub-variety of a certain number of product of G semi-direct product with F. Okay, and so if we have this affine variety and now we have an action of G, well, by reductivity of G, we have a GIT quotient, which is also an alpha. A JIT quotient, which is also an affine variety, okay, and it's usually denoted like this. So, yeah, I think that replacing, like I was doing here, twisted representations by extended representations is the best way to see that this has a natural structure of affine variety. Okay, but also it's important for the G-action, and this will play a more evident role later on. Okay, so let's see what else we can get by considering these extended representations. Maybe we get a more, I mean, yeah, quite nice geometric picture. So again, assume that phi is just. So again, assume that phi is just an action of pi1x on g by grouped morphisms, and that the image is denoted by f. So now we will look at the kernel of this group morphism. So it defines a subgroup, actually a normal subgroup of pi 1x. So it also corresponds to a Galois covering of this of the space x, right? And in fact, if f is finite, And in fact, if f is finite, this is a finite Galois covering. So, in this geometric situation, where we have this covering now, an extended representation, which is just a special type of morphism from pi 1x to the semi-direct product of g by f, like this, special because it makes this part of the diagram commute. Well, if you restrict to the subgroup, This subgroup, which by definition is the kernel of this map, you will fall into G, right? By simple commutativity of this part, this falls into the kernel of this, which is G. All right. But then the point is that, okay, now this one is not only This one is not only a twisted, sorry, yeah, it's a group morphism into G. And actually, this group, just by construction, acts trivially on G. Okay, so it means that now we can interpret this set that we had earlier in two different ways. So the same thing we did yesterday, which is isomorphism classes. Isomorphism classes of well twisted local systems on X, okay, where we define this group covering of X, which is non-constant, it's not a product. But also we could pull this back to Xphi, and since the pi one of X acts trivially on G, then actually this bundle, this group covering is constant on X V. Constant on x3, okay, and it carries an induced f action. So the point is that, again, it's the same trick as yesterday. You just pull back these torsors on X to torsors on X V. But these are torsors under this group, under the pullback, right? But the pullback is a constant group. So it's just a principal covering for this. A principal covering for this group. Right? And it has an F-equivalent structure. So it's really equivalent. And maybe this covering is sort of canonical with respect to this action. But what is also true is that there are more than one covering such that the pullback of this This group bundle to it is trivial, and they will all correspond to the same torsion. It's just the equivalent structure that will be larger or more complicated. But yeah, the point is that there are many coverings of X whose pi 1 acts trivially on G. And at the end of the day, they all correspond to the same objects, namely these torsors on X. Okay. Okay, so maybe I should go over the examples from yesterday one more time. So the first one I was considering is sort of a local picture where I was looking at this involution on the unit disk, okay, and at a differential equation on the unit disk given by a Unit disk given by a matrix with holomorphic coefficients. All right. So actually, I want to look at a basis of solutions because remember that I always want to have principal bundles. So I take a basis of solutions for this equation. So yeah, okay. Uh this is slightly wrong. Let me correct this. Of course, you will have our columns. It's yeah, it's basically an invertible matrix. It's written here. Okay, so geometrically, the situation is as follows. This D, of course, is simply. This d, of course, is simply connected. So, this pi one here is trivial. And it really depends how you see the quotient in order to get a non-trivial pi one, which is something you need to do if you want to parametrize non-trivial objects, right? So, here it's what I was mentioning yesterday that I really need to see this as norbifold in order to get a non-trivial fundamental. Okay, and it will just be this group sigma. This group sigma. Okay, but that's just a side remark. The really important part is the following, which I mentioned yesterday but did not quite prove: is that if you assume that the differential equation that you start with has some type of symmetry, namely this one, then each time you have a solution, this m of z here is a solution, then you Then you can construct another one by applying the symmetry. Okay, and which symmetry? Well, basically, this one. So, here is the proof that if you differentiate this new matrix, then, okay, so the transpose doesn't really matter. And then, because there's a minus sign here, I don't get it here. And I just have to remember what the difference. Remember what the differential of the inverse is. And now I get this in the middle. But m is a solution. So m prime of minus z is a of minus z, m of minus z. Okay, so I just insert this here, take the transpose, and then this one will vanish. And what I will stay with is exactly this. Okay, but then I'm assuming that there is a symmetry on the coefficients of the equation. On the coefficients of the equation, and so I get that this new function is again a solution. Okay, so you see how is that parametrized by extended representations? Well, here the fundamental group of x of the quotient is just this group sigma. Okay, and so in fact. Okay, and so in fact, the group bundle, I mean, to define a sorry, a twisted local system on the quotient, I could just take the trivial cross-morphism, okay? But it corresponds to a non-trivial extended representation. In fact, it's just the identity on sigma. The identity on sigma. Okay, so yeah. Okay, I just wanted to point that out that even if the cross, the twisted representation is trivial, the extended representation is not necessarily trivial. Okay, so let's do the global version of this example. So again, the situation is as follows: where you have a Riemann surface endowed with an involution. With an involution. Okay, so here I choose one which has no fixed points. It's more traditional in the literature to look at this hyper-elliptic example, but then you really have to look at the quotient as in all before, exactly as in the local picture. So the construction of the group covering of the quotient is, of course, like, well, the one we know, and it will be local. And it will be locally trivial on the quotient, but not globally trivial because the action is not trivial on this group. And actually, if you look at it on an orbifold, then it's only, I want to say, isotrivial. It's only when you locally, when you pull back to a cover, to the total space of a cover, that you get triviality. Plus an action or an equivalent structure. An action or an equivalent structure. Okay, in any case, this type of computation that we did here shows that the anti-invariant local systems that I defined yesterday, so which were the ones where we had a vector bundle, okay, or a local system of vector spaces, plus an isomorphism between this local system of vector space and its dualized pullback, okay. Dualized pullback, okay. And now we just express them as extended representations in this sense. Okay, extend representations of the pi one of the base. Okay, so if you don't like, I mean, the message is in all of this, if you don't like twisted morphism, you just replace them by extended representations. And then the condition that you must remember is the commutativity of. Is the commutativity of this diagram here? Okay, so this is it for the examples and for the definition of the Betty moduli space. But now I would like to understand a bit more the points of the Betty moduli space, which is defined as a GIT quotient. Okay, so of course, if you know geometric invariant theory, you know that since this is an affine variety, Since this is an affine variety, the points of the affine GIT quotient are just the closed G orbits in this affine variety. But this is a kind of abstract characterization of the points. And we would like to know a more representation-theoretic characterization of stability, right? So, in terms of the twisted representation. The twisted representation or actually the extended counterpart. Okay, so luckily, this is already studied in a recent preprint by Cheng Shu and this is what I'm going to talk about now, but mostly results, I mean, follows from results in his paper. Okay, so again, G in all of this is an affine algebraic group, which I'm assuming is reductive. I don't want to assume it's connected because I would like to be able to incorporate groups such as the orthogonal group or certain finite groups, subgroups of GLRC, but finite. Okay, in any case, these are the usual. In any case, these are the usual examples that you know. And you can always think in all of what follows that I'm talking about one of these groups. Okay, so occasionally I will denote G0 than a neutral component, and I still have this finite group of isomorphisms of G. And the G hat will be exactly this semi-direct product, which we have already seen quite a few times. Quite a few times. Okay. Okay. And an affine variety, which will play a very important role, is this product of g hat with itself a finite number of times, actually as many times as I have generators in my group pi. Okay. Yeah, okay, maybe x is not a great notation here. Let me call it v. Let me call it view. Okay. Yeah. So as we saw earlier, in our context, it's the diagonal G action on G hat that matters. So I'm emphasizing that this is not G hat here that we are looking at, but G, like this subgroup here. So maybe I'm taking. Maybe I'm taking. Yeah, is there a question? No. Okay. So let's look again at the embedding of the twisted representation variety, which is the same as the extended representation. So now we want to embed this into the product of g hat with itself. So assume you have n generators for the pi 1 of x. n generators for the pi one of x then there will be n copies here and your external representation has components and then you just take the image of each of these q n components of the generator sorry okay so i think here it's um fairly clear that the image of this map will be an affine subright. Will be an affine subvariety. Okay, so basically, I'm just saying that if you have all these elements, the final presentation of pi 1x will give you algebraic relations between them. And these are the equations that define your sub-variety here. Okay, so it's a little bit more complicated than in the case where you don't have these elements, but it But it's still true that if you have all of this and the gamma one, gamma two, gamma n generate pi, then from these this data, you know the full representation. And that's exactly what it means that the image is this a fine sub-variety. Okay, maybe a good exercise is to try that with the usual parameter group of Riemann surface, of a compact Riemann surface. So you have this problem. Of a compact Riemann surface. So you have this product of commutators, and convince yourself that if you know this, then you can check, like compute the commutator. Okay. Okay. So again, what we know from this picture, from geometric invariant theory, is that this quotient is in bijection with the set of closed g orbits now in this product. Now, in this product, okay, because I'm realizing this affine variety as a closed subset of this product. So again, this is how you see that you have a natural structure of a fine variety on this. Okay, so the notion that we will need to characterize stability in this context is the following. Is the following. It's a notion of complete reducibility. So recall that a closed subgroup of the algebraic group G is called parabolic if the homogeneous space G mod P is complete. Okay. So yeah, if you have yeah, okay. Maybe I should have given some examples, but if if G is uh G L R C. Uh, GLRC, then a parabolic subgroup is a group which can be written, I mean, it's conjugate to a group that is written upper triangular blocks like this. Okay, so the one thing you need to know about parabolic subgroups is that they give rise to a spittable short exact sequence where you take the radical unipotent. You take the radical unipotent, the unipotent radical, sorry, in English, unipotent radical of P. It's a subgroup, it's a normal subgroup, and the quotient is, of course, reductive. It's called the Levy factor, and actually, it can be sent into P. Okay, so this, we can think of this quotient group as a subgroup of P. And then a closed subgroup of the group G is called completely reducible. Is called completely reducible if, well, assume that you can find a parabolic subgroup which contains it, then actually it's contained in the Levy factor of this subgroup. So again, if we look at the example in GLNC, where you have this block upper triangular group, this is P. So then L, the Levy factor, is just this group here. This group here, okay, and so what I'm saying is that a subgroup H, which is completely reducible, if it's a subgroup of P, it's actually a subgroup of this L. Okay. And in fact, this is a characterization that works in all characteristic. And in characteristic zero, it's equivalent to saying that the group A. Saying that the group H is itself a reductive subgroup. Okay, so now we are in a good position to use the following result by Richardson, which characterizes closed orbits inside this product of G-hat. So it's not entirely clear, maybe at first, why this is enough, but remember that we had this. Remember that we had this affine variety, which was just a closed sub-variety of this product, okay? And it's also G-invariant because this embedding is G-equivariant. So you see here why it's important to have the usual G-action here so that this embedding becomes G-equivariant. Okay, and so with Richardson's result, we can So with Richardson's result, we can characterize points X in this product whose orbit under the action of G hat is closed. Yeah, it's exactly those points X such that the risky closure of the The Zariski closure of the subgroups, subgroup of G hat generated by these elements is completely reducible in the previous sense. Okay, so it's a reductive subgroup of G hat. So here I wrote it for G hat. It's actually the same for G because you see G hat is closed. Well, G hat X, the orbit of X. g hat x the the orbit of x under g hat is just a finite union of copies of the orbit of x under g hat zero okay so the neutral component but um but it's also the same for gx okay it's also a finite union of copies of this so it will be closed as well okay so the point is that this is exactly the representation theoretical The representation theoretic condition that we wanted. Okay, so maybe let us rephrase this more specifically for extended representations. So again, this is where we use that this has been embedded into a gene variant closed subset of this product, okay, and that this has finite index in this. Has a finite index in this group. So, in particular, this is what I was saying that this orbit will be closed in S in my sub-variety here if and only its G hat orbit is closed in G hat. Okay, so we're using two things that the fact that S is closed in here and the fact that G has finite index in G hat. Okay, so now let's take a look. So now let's take an extended representation. And in fact, because the extended representation, you see here, rho hat is entirely determined by these points, these endpoints in G hat. Well, in fact, what I called h of x here can also be defined as the Zariski closure of the image. Of the image of the group morphism rho hat. Okay, so it's a closed subgroup of the semi-direct product of G by F. And then this is closed in this affine sub-variety if and only if this subgroup is a completely reducible subgroup. Okay, this closed subgroup here is a completely reducible subgroup of G cross F. And again, this means exactly that if the image If the image, okay, so of course, parabolic subgroups here are closed. So I don't need to put the Zariski closure here. I can just look at the image of the extended representation. So it's a subgroup of G. Maybe it's not close, but it's okay. I take the image of rho hat, and if it's containing a parabolic, it's actually containing a levy factor on this parabolic. Containing the levy factor of this parabolic. And that's exactly what it means to be completely reducible. Are there any questions? Okay. So this was a characterization of closed orbits, right, in the affine variety of extended representation. Variety of external representations. So it's what's usually called poly stability in the context of geometric environment theory. And it's a little bit more subtle to get GIT stability. So stability in the sense of geometric invariant theory means that not only is the orbit closed, but also the stabilizer is as small as can be. So basically, Basically, it's finite if you take into account the kernel of the action. Okay, so you take the stabilizer of the representation, you mod out by the thing that stabilizes all representations, because this doesn't really count. And if the group that you get in this way is finite, then it's actually saying that your orbit or your representation rho hat is stable. Representation of row hat is stable in the sense of GIT. Okay, and the point is that again, we have a characterization of GIT stability in the representation theoretic sense. And the characterization is the following, that GIT stability of row hat is equivalent to this group that we had earlier. So, the Zariski closure of the image of Rohat. The fact that it's not contained in any proper parabolic subgroup. Okay, so a subgroup, a closed subgroup H that satisfies this, which is not contained in any proper parabolic, it's called irreducible, an irreducible subgroup. Okay. All right. So, yeah, of course, if you're not contained in any proper irreducible subgroup. Irreducible subgroup. Well, the condition that whenever you are containing your parabolic, you're containing a debrif factor is automatically satisfied. Okay, so irreducible implies completely reducible. The only things, I mean, the only group that is not considered here is G itself, but G is also reductive, so it's its own lemming factor. Okay, and also it's compatible with the Also, it's compatible with the fact that stability implies polystability because this was a closed orbit and this is closed orbit plus something. Okay, so of course it implies polystability. Okay, so this is just an observation. And maybe slightly more important is the fact that you see when we identify this. You see, when we identify this with a closed sub-variety of the product, then what is the stabilizer? So, the stabilizer of rho-hat, or equivalently, the stabilizer of these n points here is actually the centralizer of this group that we define. So the Zariski closure of the image of Rohat. Okay, you take that and you take its centralizer in G. That's exactly the stabilizer of Rohat. Of row hats inside this. Okay. And basically, it follows from the definition of H row hat. So it's again, it's a simple observation, but it's important to have this in mind. Okay, maybe from the point of view of modelite theory, you could say that this is sort of the automorphism group of this. Automorphism group of this representation. Okay, anyway, are there any questions? Okay, good. And then the third thing I would like to mention, third and final thing I would like to mention for today's lecture is the point of view of integrable connection. Integrable connection. So far, I was a little bit ambiguous about a couple of things that I did is when we start with the complex algebraic group G and an action of pi 1 x of g, I wasn't always very careful between of the yeah to stress the differences between the kind of objects that I was constructing. So I can construct two That I was constructing. So I can construct two things. The first thing is a group covering. So basically, it arises when I put the discrete topology on G and I consider for this action, which remains the same, this group covering. And then the torsors under this group covering are by definition what I call features the G-local systems on X. Okay, but I can just perform the same construction. But I can just perform the same construction without altering the topology or by putting the complex topology on G, okay, not the discrete topology. And then this one will not be a group covering anymore. It will be a group bundle. Okay. But it will still have torsors. In fact, they are constructed in the same way from the, I mean, you can get examples in the same way from representations. But the point is, which GP tosses arise in that way, right? Or come from G5 sharp tossers, if you prefer. Which are the G5 tosses, which come from Phi twisted G local system. Okay, so to characterize those, the first thing you need is a connection on a GFE torso. So let me define that for you in a way that In a way that just slightly generalizes Attia's definition of a connection on a principal bundle. So, the first thing you do is given a torsor, you define its adjoint bundle. So, how do you do this? Well, the first thing you need to realize is that this group bundle G phi has a Lie algebra bundle. Okay, it has a Lie algebra if you. Okay, it has a Lie algebra if you want. And how is it defined? Well, just in the same way that g was defined as x plural cross g model by pi 1x. Okay, I can just do the same construction but replacing g with its Lie algebra. And the action of pi 1x on the Lie algebra will be obtained by composing the action on g with the adjoint action. Okay, so you get this, you can form this. So you get this, you can form this Lie algebra bundle over X, and then you can take a fiber product over X, and it will be acted upon by G phi, because G phi acts on E, because it's a torsor, and on its Lie algebra, well, because by the adjoint action. Okay, fiberwise adjoint action, if you prefer. Okay, so you get this adjoint bubble for any G torso and then you And then you have the so-called ATIA bundle, which is the bundle of G phi invariant vector fields on the torsor E. And well, by construction, you have a short exact sequence of vector bundles where, well, okay, if you have a vector field on E, because E fibers over X, you can project. Project a vector field on E to a tangent vector or to a vector field on X if you prefer. Okay, so you get this map here. And the kernel of this map is exactly the adjoint bundle. It's basically the vertical part of this vibration here. Okay, and then as was suggested, I think, by Tia, is I think by TR is the fact that a connection on the G phi torsor E is just a splitting of this short exact sequence. Okay, so that's what a connection is. So of course, we get a direct generalization of a TS theorem, which is saying that such a connection exists. You see, when does such a splitting exist? When does such a splitting exist? Well, basically, when this bundle is the direct sum of this and that, okay. But any class like this, any short exact sequence like this, has a, well, it's an extension of tx by add e. So it has a class in the h1 of x with coefficient in this bundle, homomorphism from tx to add e. To add E. So this can be also written like this, as like dualizing by dualizing this one here. Okay, so you have the cotangent bundle here. Okay, so basically the existence of a splitting says that the extension of a class is trivial. So in principle, you can compute this. Well, you can just. Well, you can just, yeah, you have this criterion saying that the connection exists here, or a connection exists here, if and only if the class of this extension is trivial in this H1. Actually, when the dimension of X is one over C, so if you have a Riemann surface, for instance, then by cell duality, you can just replace this H1 with this dual space of this H1. Well, dual space of this H0, okay, because this one will get cancelled by the cell duality here. So it means that your extension class is a dual to this H0, but okay, H0 of this is just an endomorphism of add. Yeah, okay, so it's a section of add E. So basically, your class here is something on which you can, well, which you can evaluate. Well, which you can evaluate on sections of add E. So, what I'm trying to say is that there should be a way to have a more numerical characterization of what it means for this class to be zero. So, that's exactly the way that Etia proves Veil's theorem on the existence of a connection. Yeah, he will say that. I mean, the criterion is that this class is zero in the H1 or equivalently here, if and only if when you decompose, okay, it's specific to vector bundles, but when you decompose the vector bundle here, E, as a direct sum of indecomposable vector bundles, then the sum of each factor, the degree of each indecomposable factor, should be zero. Okay, and this is something that you can compute explicitly. So it's yes, a degree. Anyway, okay, enough about that. So I just want to mention briefly what happens with the notion of integrable connection. So if we retake the short exact sequence defining what a connection is, so we see that locally, locally, well, this bundle here, E. This bundle here, E, is trivial, right? It looks like U cross G. So the adjoint bundle looks like U cross the Lie algebra. Okay, and the point is that, yeah, here you see from this local picture that a local trurization of the bundle will define the connection. Okay, so this is a TS observation. Okay, so this is a TS observation. And a local trivialization of this is actually just a section of this principal bundle. So for us, it's not really a principal bundle because it's twisted, but you can make it work. And so this locally, it's always true. And when it can be, when this construction can be made sense of globally, so when you can define a connection by gluing this sort of This sort of local connection, so defined by true relations here, then the resulting connection is called integrable. Okay, so it's not a very formal definition, but if you read a TS paper, you will see exactly what I mean. Yeah, okay. So with this, we can now characterize completely the torsors that are defined by twisted representation. That are defined by twisted representations. So we start again with the phi twisted representation for this action. And here you see I'm not doing local systems, I'm not putting the discrete topology on G. I'm just looking at this object, which is exactly the construction I did yesterday. And so I have this action of pi 1x on this product bundle. On this product bundle. And this will descend and define a bundle over X, which is a G phi torsor. But of course, this one is a product bundle. So by the previous observation, it has a canonical integrable connection. And what you have to realize is that that connection is in fact pi 1x invariant. And so it descends to V of rho. So when you perform this. So when you perform this construction from a fee twisted representation, not only do you get a G phi torso, you get a G phi torsor with an integrable connection. Well, because you start from one, from a principal G bundle with an integrable connection and everything was pi one x invariant. Okay, and then the theorem, which is proved again exactly as in the TS paper, is that conversely, if you have a G-fit also with an integrable connection, then it comes Connection, then it comes from a p-twisted representation. So, what I'm trying to say is that we have for these twisted objects a sort of Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, actually a Riemann-Hilbert correspondence. So you fix any action, it can be non-trivial. And then we have these on the one hand, the G phi sharp tosses, which are these phi twisted local systems. Which are these fee-twisted local systems that we defined yesterday. And on the other hand, these flat G-fee tossers, which we defined today. Okay, and these are the same thing in the sense that both are parametrized by this group of. This group comology, okay. What a non-trivial action, okay. Um, yeah, so I think I went a little fast, but but that's okay. I don't really want to say more today, and uh, so yeah, I think it's a good place to stop, and tomorrow we'll talk about uh Higgs Bond. If there's any questions, I'm happy to try and answer. I'm happy to join us. Thanks very much for the very nice second lecture. Are there any questions in the audience here in Oaxaca? No? How about the world? I hope you can hear me. Everything is very happy, it was very clear. Everything is very happy, it was very clean. Thank you very much. And we will look forward to your third lecture. And if you could send me the update, the updated slides for the second lecture, then we can put them online again. No problem. I will send them to you right away. Great. And now let's thank Floron again for a nice talk. Thank you.
