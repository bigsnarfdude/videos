And we'll start off this conference with very cool idea. This is going to talk about combinatorial types of theory. A few examples. It'll take me a minute to get ready. It'll take me a minute to get ready. Remind me how long my talk is? One hour. One hour, including myself. Okay. It's great to see everybody. Thank you to my dear Colombian colleague for the introduction. Yeah, it's great to see you all. Lots of old friends, lots of new friends, lots of familiar faces. Lots of familiar faces. And thank you so much for the organizers for bringing us here in person to do this. Really excited for this week. So I will be talking about combinatorial intersection theory. I will be saying what I mean by that. And basically, I just wanted to survey some kind of main ideas about what this means. What are some of the techniques that are out there? What are some of the examples that I like. Like. And I'll begin by saying that I'm going to talk about many people's work, including many of you in this room. The work that I am involved in, that I will be talking about, is all joint with Cardi Clements, Graham Denniman, Junha, Chris Jurg Valupenagio, Juan Cordero, and Ayong Kim. And the summary, what I hope to come. What I hope to convince you of today is that intersection theory leads to very beautiful problems right in the middle of where algebra, geometry, and combinatories meet. And I find it really fun to think about those problems and those constructions and those techniques. And they turn out to be very powerful and they turn out to prove theorems that we really don't know how to prove otherwise. Really don't know how to prove otherwise. So let me get started with a motivation, which is not historical motivation. This actually happened later, but the motivation is this map coloring problem that I have a map, in this case the map of the United States, and I want to color each Color each. By the way, let me preface also by saying that there's so many experts in the room, but I've often been considered an expert and I don't know what the speakers are talking about. And I try to force myself, okay, if I don't know, then I should ask a question. So let me start by saying that also, that I don't want to assume, I mean, there's a lot of expertise in the room, but I don't want to assume that we know everything. So feel free to interrupt me if there's any questions that I have. And so I'm going to tell you about the not coloring problem, which is that you have You're trying to color the states of a map or the countries of a map, and you want neighbors to have different colors so that you can tell them apart. You have T colors, and this team of people actually computed the grammatical of the United States. There's three things that I. I'm not sure which year this is from. There's three things that stand out to me. One that I don't like. One that I don't like is that Canada is not in America according to according to them. And if you can see the leading coefficient, you can also learn that Hawaii and Alaska are also not in America. Or rather, they are, but they thought we can just factor those out and then T to the 48. I like the color scheme. And I like seeing a big chromatic polynomial, which I actually had never seen before. Had never seen before. And looking at this, I was actually showing this to my students last week, and I just asked them, What do you notice? And somebody said, I love the rainbow. And somebody said, I love the rainbow shape of the polynomial. And it had never occurred to me that this is exactly log concave. So this is something that I learned last week. That log concave means that you're rainbow-shaped. Because the number of digits of a number is the logarithm. Because the number of digits of a number is a logarithm. So, how long this is the sequence of logarithms say that this is this is concave exactly exactly about concavity. And I've always wondered how people zeroed in on what concavity, and I wonder if they were just writing Paul Longwilson speak this nicely. In any case, in 1970, Jacques Carlo Rota computed many examples and guessed that this was a lock-in case sequence. This was proved by Jul Hott in his PhD thesis. And this was. And this was the beginning of part of this story that I think is really beautiful, that I think we will be hearing about a lot of this week. So, what is intersection theory? I'll start by saying I'm not an expert in intersection theory, but I've learned enough to know how it plays with the kinds of combinatorics that I like thinking about. So, I'll give a very rough idea. Intersection theory basically studies: if you're inside an algebraic variety and you're looking at how the sub-varieties. And you're looking at how the sub-varieties inside of it intersect. And a very uh classic example is uh uh Bezou's theorem, which says that if I have two cubic polynomials, like I do here in one variable, or in the plane, if you have two cubic polynomials in the plane, the number of intersection points is going to be nine, which is three times three. The degree of one times the degree of the other. This is a parabola and a quartx, so they should intersect at two times four points. This is one of the foundational theorems in intersection theory. And you basically want to think about questions like this, and it gets very subtle very quickly. The first thing that you know, even in the plane, is that you have to be careful with how you count multiplicities and so on. But then also, this needs to behave well with respect to rational equivalents, things like this. And then the theory gets subtle, but it's basically about studying how. But it's basically about studying how sub-varieties have a variety. And a lot of the subtleties get organized when you think about the chow ring, which is this ring that you associate to a variety that organizes these computations. And because intersection theory is hard in general, that means that chow rings are hard in general. But if you start with the toric variety, The Tauric variety of a fan. And let me also say: if this is not familiar, I'm going to talk about it briefly, and you won't need it for the rest of what I'm going to be talking about. But I guess what you need to know in this slide is that whenever I have a fan, and my favorite fan is the one given by the rate arrangement, x equals y. Right equals z equals x. So you have this arrangement, or in general, any fan, rational, there needs to be some conditions, but you get a variety, a tarp variety out of it, and then now you're trying to understand how its sub-varieties intersect. So this is the tarp variety of the fan. And something that Fulton and Stormtroves realized is that when your variety When your variety is a tar variety, then this towering actually has a lot of very beautiful structure. And computations can be described much more nicely. So one thing they showed is that it can be described polyhedrally. So elements of this towering can be thought of as balanced sub-fans of your fan. So for example, Of your fan. So, for example, here, a balanced subtan would be something like this: that is a subtane of this fan, and it's balanced kind of in the sense of physics, that if you pull on it, the forces balance. And then multiplication is done by this stand displacement rule that I will describe in a moment. So, they basically show that if you want to do computations inside this channel. The computations inside this towering, you end up having to understand a lot of beautiful polyhedral geometry of subclass. Lu Bilera, motivated by issues in supplying theory, realized that this tank can also be thought of as. This stand can also be thought of as the ring of piecewise polynomials on your fan. So basically, you're going to put polynomials here, and they should be piecewise polynomials. So in each piece, they should be polynomial. They should flu correctly across the boundaries. Modular global polynomials. And so basically, if you want to do these kinds of computations, then instead you can think of what do piecewise polynomials functions on here. Piecewise polynomials functions on here look like. And the operations are just kind of multiplying and adding the pieces. And then Danny Love and Brion showed that if your fan is a simplicial fan, if you're in D dimensions, then every cone is generated by D rays. Then there's also a very beautiful algebraic combinatorial presentation. So basically this thing is a quotient of a polynomial ring, so it has some generators, it has some relationships. Polynomial rings, so it has some generators, it has some relations, and then you can just do algebraic combinators and transform. And I've spent years just looking at this and just wondering, like, how can it be? This is just really beautiful. And not only that, but actually the dictionary is not as simple as you might hope. You might think, oh, there's kind of trivial translations, but there's a lot of depth to why these things are the same rate. But it tells you that if you want to do computation, But it tells you that if you want to do computations, then you have very different techniques, and you can kind of choose your own technique with whatever you're profitable with, and go from there. So let me say this a little bit more concretely in the case of the permutahedral variety, which is what I chose here. So this is the normal fan of the permutahedron. The permutahedron is the convex hall of the amfactorial permutations. You take the normal fan and you get just the Fan, and you get just the fan of the grid arrangement given by high point x, high points of j. And so I want to talk about three ways that you can think about this charing. Basically, I'm saying the same thing as in the previous slide, but now in this specific case. So one is if I want to think about it in balanced subtense, then the elements of my towering look like this. So here's one. Another one might be the same thing but inverted upside down. The same thing, but inverted upside down. And the way that you multiply things inside this ring is basically that you intersect them by... So if I want to intersect this with this, and I mean these are really on top of each other. I just want to distinguish them for a moment. So what you do is that you shift one of them a little bit. Maybe I put it right here. And I find that that there's there's two intersection points. And then I started with a displacement, so they used to be kind of sitting on top of each other, and now I displace it a little bit, but then I send that displacement to zero. So basically, as I bring these things together, then these two points are going to come closer and closer to each other. They are going to come closer and closer to each other and they end up with being a just the point in the middle with a weight of two. So that's how you intersect in this case. And I should say that in general, balanced soft fans have weights here. So here my weights are one. But what you want to do is you want to study pure sub fans in every highest. Sub fans in every highest dimensional phase, you want to put a weight, and it's with those weights, which are kind of the pulling weights that you would pull into physics, then this should balance. So, this is how you intercept. So, it ends up being this very polyhedral construction. So, this is what Fulton and Storm has realized. People did n did not use to talk about tropical geometry in that time, but this is clearly at the roots of tropical intersection. Of tropical intersection. For those of you that have seen more modern treatments of that. If I want to think about this in terms of these other polynomials, then I'm really just saying, let me put some polynomials here. So let's say maybe I've put here x squared, then I need to put a polynomial here that should agree with this one along x equals y. So maybe I'll put xy here, and then maybe I'll put yz here, and then maybe I'll put y squared here. for y squared here. Can I get this correctly? xy xy. That's an element of the chow ring. The one thing that I was being careful about is that whenever I pass a wall, these two polynomials should agree, like in this case when x is equal to y. And that's it, that's the towering, and you just multiply piecewise, you add piecewise. You add these ones. And the third way of thinking about this, which is the dialogue-Brian presentation, in this case it looks like this. So you have a polynomial ring with one variable for each subset. So here you get one x. 1, x 2, x 3, x 1, 2, x 2, 3, x 1, 3, and if you don't include the full set or the empty set, modulo, two relations. So the first relation is that if two sets are not subsets of each other, then their product is equal to zero. So for example, x two times x13, you bought out by that because two doesn't contain one. You bought out by that because 2 doesn't contain 1, 3, 1, 3 doesn't contain 2. So there's things like that. So those are the first kinds of relations that you get. And the second kind of relation is that whenever i and j are different from each other, then the sum of the sets containing i is equal to the sum of the sets containing j. So, for example, if I look at 1, the things containing y are x1, x1, 2, and x1, 3. So x13, so that should be the same as if I do x2 plus x12 plus x23. So this is a relation. And so if you like computing with polynomial rings, this is really fun. And you get to discuss the computations on a ring that was. I'll say a couple of things. I'll say a couple of things. This, of course, is very specific to this fan, but it works for other fans. So, here, this is the Stanley-Wiesner ring of this imperial complex. And so, what I should say even before anything is that the generators here are the rays here. So the reason that I get these things is because the rays here are E1, E2, E3, E12, E13, E23. So these are the rays of the fan. E23. So these are the rays of the fan. These are saying what are the non-phases, which sets of rays don't form a phase. And these are some linear functions that are very precise. I think I had them in the other slide. So again, you have these three ways of computing that are very different from each other, and for some reason they give us any answers. It's fun to do each one separately. It's fun to think about how they Separately, it's fun to think about how they relate to each other and so on. So, this is basically, I mean, the main thing that I wanted to discuss, and what I want to do is show you a bunch of examples of how that becomes relevant to those of us who love Matrix, which I think is what many of us have in common. I'm going to run to get my water. Okay, so topical intersection theory. I'm oversimplifying everything because there's only one hour and this is not the main thing that I want to talk about. But very roughly speaking, if you have, let's say, a projective variety B, you can tropicalize it and you get this. Tropicalize it, and you get this variety tropy. I should have said it the way I'm doing it here, it should be complex varieties. And so you are basically looking at how your complex variety behaves at infinity. So you look at in the, in the, at infinity, what directions does this variety go into? That's what this does here. And so you basically convert your algebraic variety into a piecewise linear object that looks like. And this is roughly capturing the behavior of the original variety at infinity. Of course, you lose a lot of information. You're only looking at the behavior at infinity, but you retain a lot of information also. So some things that you retain are the dimension of the variety and the degree of the variety. And I'm very interested in this equation. So the degree of the variety equals the degree of the topical variety. So let's talk about how we define degrees. How we define degrees, and in particular, how should we define tropical degrees so that this equation makes sense. So, classically, if you want the degree of a variety that has codimension D, you intersect it with a plane of dimension D and see how many points it has. We do this like, why is that parabolic quadratic? Because you intersect it with a line and you hit, I mean, it's in two points. That's what this is saying. That's what this is saying. And so classically, that's what the degree is. And so tropically, we want to do the same thing. So to get the degree of a tropical variety, we intersect with a linear space of complementary dimension. Now, the thing, though, is that you have to think about what is a linear space. Because we're in the tropical world, and I'll ask you to trust me for a moment that the analogous thing of a generic linear space is a generic shift of this fan. This fan, sigma n n minus d, which is basically the set of points. You can basically think of this in Rn if you're not used to thinking about TPN. The set of points in Rn where the smallest d plus 1 coordinates are equal. You're in Rn, and if you look at the points where the smallest d plus 1 coordinates are equal, you find that it's one of these bipolinear things. And that's what you have to intersect your tropical variety with to get the degree. And that's what makes it true that if you And that's what makes it true that if you take a variety, tropicalize it, you can compute the degree of the variety is tropical. So we can compute degrees coming at the earth. As I was saying, a tropical variety is, there are varieties that don't come through tropicalization, but they're just the Come through topicalization, but they're just their own objects. And this is just like a matrix theory. Initially, there was in the history of matrix theory a resistance to non-linear matrix. Initially, people wanted every matrix to be linear. And they kind of thought over this, and eventually they realized now that theory works a lot better if we allow matrix not to be linear. And the same thing is true in tropical geometry, that tropical geometry started with tropical accessions. But people realize now for this theory to behave well, we really want to allow these more. Allow these more general abstract objects, pure d-dimensional polyhedral complexes where there's a weight on each facet, and there's a balancing condition that holds across each d minus one-dimensional space. And then it makes sense to define a tropical linear space to be a tropical fan in the sense of degree one. That would be the natural object. And there's very few people. And there's a very beautiful theorem due to Alex Fink, and I think it was stated earlier by Mikhalkin and Ziegler, that topical linear spaces are exactly matroid in some sense. So this very general definition of a topical linear space, those spaces are exactly the matroid fans that Carly Clemens and I had studied earlier. So when I give this talk to topical geometers that don't like thinking about matrices, I'll say a matrix. That don't like thinking about matrix, I'll say a matrix is a topical final degree one. That's one way of defining matrix among the many cryptomorphisms of matrix. And that basically tells you that to move forward with this theory, you need to think about matrix, and that's good news for us in this room. So I'm sorry? Tropical in your fence. Tropical in your fence. Did I say that? Yeah, that's why I was kind of hiding. Yeah, that's why I was kind of hiding this and yes. If you want to consider not just the fans, but all the tropical linear spaces, then you get this very beautiful theory, which Davis Pire worked out, where you get these kind of valuated matroid fans that correspond to matrix subdivisions. It's also a very beautiful story. Okay, so matroids, I'll say briefly. I'll say briefly, we start with a set of vectors, we look at the bases in there, and we find that they satisfy this exchange property that ends up being the definition that it's interesting how the history of mathematics works. And about the same year, Nakasawa and Japan and Whitney in the US came up with the same definition, saying we should define, we should study these kind of abstractions of linear algebra. What are the subsets, what are the collections of subsets that satisfy the exchange? Collections of substances that satisfy the exchange property, the basis exchange property. So this includes the basis from linear algebra, but it's much more general than that. The intended examples that they had in mind is that they realized that linear algebra and graph theory shared this property that when you look at the basis of a vector space and you look at the spanning trees of a graph, they satisfy the same basis exchange problem. So that was kind of the So that was that was kind of the intention of this theory. But then all these other things started sneaking into the theory also. So field theory, where you think about algebraic independence and field extensions, the theory of matchings, the theory of routings, all have notions that satisfy the same axioms and many, many others. And one important point that I hope to make is that the unintended examples are equally fundamental to the theory. Examples are equally fundamental to the theory. You don't want to just focus on the let me define matroid fans or Bergen fans. So you already know what the flats of a matroid are, you know. If you don't, then I think what's most useful is to think about the representable case. You have a set of vectors and you consider what are the subspaces stand by this. The subspaces stand by this. We have the lines A, B, C, and D, E, the planes A, B, A, C, A, D, E, B, C, D, E. And then the full space and the origin. Those are the flats. And now, this is a definition theorem. I will explain why. I want to make a fan out of these. And what I do is that I take this, which is the lattice of flats of the matrix, a positive, which has the structure of a lattice, it has a meet and a joint. Of a lattice, it has a meet and a joint. And I want to make a piecewise polyhedral object by, so first I'll tell you what the rays are. So the rays of this picture, A, B, C, and so on, correspond to the flats. So, and then, for example, when I have a flat A D E, I have a ray A D E, which is not just a picture, this is discovered with coordinates. So, A D E means 1, 0, 0. So ADE means 10011. Because A is in there, B and C are not. So you get these very specific rates and then you fill in some cones according to the flags here. So for example, A is contained in A D E, so that's why I fill out the cone between A and A D E. But I don't fill in the cone between, for example, D E and A C boot because they don't contain each other. Because they don't contain each other. I hope it reminds you of this, where we are multiplying things that don't contain each other. So this is the matrix find. Now, this was originally defined in a very different way by Bernstern-Hulst. It's some set of points in Re such that on each circuit the minimum is achieved twice. And our theory with cardiac claimants is that parent definition. Is that fairness definition could be thought of more combinatorially, and there's many ways in which this description ends up being more useful for proving. So when I talk about matrix fans, these are the fans that I'm talking about. Now, what was the motivation to study this object? So I mentioned So I mentioned that tropical geometry starts with varieties and and goes to tropical varieties. And so it reduces questions about al a kind of classical algebraic geometry to combinatorial questions in eachwise linear things. And nobody in this room would say then you just do combinatorics because we all realize that the combinatorics can be very hard, very interesting. And so this was actually like a very early example where we thought, okay, let's actually topicalize something. Where we thought, okay, let's actually topicalize something. What should we topicalize? A linear space. It just doesn't get simpler than that. And when you go to see, okay, what do you get when you topicalize a linear space? You get exactly the fan that I just described. So it's the kind of common authorities that arise in a simplicity. So when the matrix is realizable, then it's the topicalization of all the edge space. Of a linear space. And because of some work of Jordan, this implies that this is pure-dimensional, connected, it's a wedge of spheres where this is the Mobius number of the matrix and so on. Now, I want to go back to this theorem. A tropical fan has degree one, if and only if it looks like this. It looks like this. So let's stop there for a moment. Because topicalization preserves degrees, we know that if I had a linear space that had degree one, so when I topicalize it, it still has to have degree one. So we do know that realizable Bergman fans have degree one. But this is saying two more things. One is that the Bergman fan of any matrix has degree one. That has to be proved combinatorial. And what I find very remarkable is that the And what I find very remarkable is that the converse is true, that any fan that has, any tropical fan that has degree one, has to be one of these. And one reason I like this theory is that, again, it tells us you really should not just be thinking about a linear matrix. You want every matrix to be included so that this theorem is true and you have a kind of a robust theory of matrix gives the correct evolution error. Yes, yes. Yes. I was talking about tropical intersection theory. My favorite treatment for this is the book of Mikalkina Rao that I really hope to see one stay in my hands. I keep asking, I keep asking. And this is this is what I was showing a moment ago. This is what I was showing a moment ago. So, if I have two tropical fans, and if I shift one of them a little bit, intersect them, and then kind of take the shift away, it turns out that the intersection itself has a structure of a tropical fan. That structure is actually independent of the shift vector. It comes with it with weights. So, X and Y come with weights on the cones, and so there's a recipe for what weights you get here. There's a recipe for what weights you get here. And so you get a tropical fan that's independent of D. In particular, if you take tropical fans where the total of the co-dimensions is n, then when you intersect them, you end up with a fan of dimension zero, and so it's basically a multiplicity of a point. And that tells you that when you intersect k topical varieties of K topical varieties of coordinations adding up to n, there's a number called the degree which is the intersection of it. And this is the number that I'm going to be talking about for the rest of the examples. And one reason, as I think many of you know, one reason that the mathematical community became very excited about this is the work of June Ha and many others that the Haush-Riemann relations under The Hajj-Riemer relations, under suitable hypothesis, you have this inequality, which is the lock and cavity inequality. And by choosing clever choices of L1, L2, and X, and you need geometric insight to choose the right things here, you get beautiful intersection theory computations where you have to compute these numbers and you find that they have very nice answers. And you get beautiful lock and cavity problems. That were in many cases compared to decades ago. What happens when the codimentions don't add up part? So if the codimentions add up to more than n, then you get zero. If they add up to less than n, then you get tropical varieties that are very interesting. And you'll see an example of that in a moment. So this is equally or maybe even more interesting if the coordinations don't add up to end. And we're thinking about even if you're not trying to do dot from cavity. I think that's. I think that's one point that I want to make: locking cavity is a very deep, beautiful part of the story, and there's also questions like this that are very and I know I'm preaching to the choir because many of you have done computations like this. So in my next slide, what I'm going to do is have a very long list of examples that I'm going to go through very quickly. And then we'll see what time we have to talk about some of them. Okay. Um so many important tropical varieties have a risk commonathoidal structure. For example, linear ones have the structure of a matroid. So a lot of the varieties that we care about have an automatic structure. So when you go to computer degrees, you get which come in a totics. Okay, and so here's a bunch of examples. Again, I'll go very quickly and then I'll go most slowly one by one. One by one. So there's a notion of to a root system you can assign a tropical surface. And my master's student, Monte Corda Monse Cortet, computed the degree of that. I'll go in more details in a moment. The degree of these kind of mixed degrees of the Bergenfranc give you the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials and then later. And then later a little situation on cats. L'Opes and Lano Riconcha computed the degrees of what I call the turn-short-marked classes of a matrix, and you get the MBCH vector. With Graham dead image and how we got the same numbers in a very different setting, something that we call the co-normal fandom. Bergen, Spink, and Seng got a closely related, not the M to CH vector, but the H vector, by intersecting the Bermuda fan with another very beautiful family of tropical fan. Okay, I still pause there, but then with Chris Euro, they gave this very general formula. This very general formula that I think includes many of the ones before. I know you include many of the ones before, where you get the coefficients of this, the evaluation of the top one. And very recently, with Chris Ro and Robinagio, we computed the the introduction number of the of the Bergman fan and the Cremona transform of the dual of the contraction. There's a reason why we wanted to do that. Contraction. There's a reason why we wanted to do that. So these are some examples, and if anybody wants to spend more time talking about them, come find me afterwards, and we can talk about each one of them. Let me just give an idea of how this goes. And I wanted to start with this example because it's very beautiful, because I'm part of the beautiful work of my master's student, and because I think it gives us a good idea of what this actually feels like to work. So this came from a conversation that June and I had, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago of just, you know. 10 years ago, of just thinking about tropical surfaces. What are some examples that we could think of of tropical surfaces? And so in this work with a group of master students, Chiamikato, Jill Macmillan, Isaac Perez, and Anna Schindler, we realized that you can make tropical surfaces out of any crystallographic root system. You take the comics out of the roots, you look at the edges of that polytope, and you take the corner of it. Polito, and you take the conau of it. And it turns out that that balances balance. And we just said, let's do combinatorics on that and see what you get. So the master season of Monkonde, Cordero, is finding the degree of the tropical surface of A minus 1, and this is it. So this is the convex hull of the root system A3. So this is the tropical surface, and so you can see it's this kind of flower-looking thing. Flower-looking thing, very, very beautiful. This was linear object. And so, if you want to compute the tropical surface, you have all these three different ways that you could do it. We proceeded with this one. They proceeded with this one. So, choosing a convenient displacement vector, and it's often useful to just say, okay, let's fix an order and make it increase really fast. And now, what we need to do is take this fan. Take this fan and intersect it with the topical linear space of the corresponding complementary coordination. And that's what that power of alpha to the n minus 2 was in basically the topical linear space of that coordination. And you have to do it. And so basically you know the equations of each one of these cones, you know the equations of the other one, and it's a fun combinatorial problem to say which cones intersect which other cones and let's find the intersection points. The intersection points. And so they did that, they found only intersection points. One thing that I think I have not mentioned yet is that when I mentioned it very briefly, that each one of these intersection points ends up having a multiplicity which is arithmetic. So you need to think of lattices that are here. There's a lattice structure in all of this. And you have to think about what is the index of the sub-lattice generated look. So for each one of those intersection points, they have to do that. Very strangely, they found that. Very strangely, they found that all but one of the intersection points have an index one, and there's one that has index three. Do the computation, and you get this. And so I think this is a good prototype of what these computations look like. Is it the topicalization or something? We don't know. So that that's a question that that I have is is is is this topical root surface a topicalization of a of a actual geometric surface? Actual geometric surface. Probably. Is the question about the motion space? I'm sorry? Is the question about the motion space? I don't know. I mean, if we take our hyperscale, it's not the normal, it's the edge skeleton. It's the edge skeleton and the error skeleton. Yeah. So I'll say I'll say that I don't know if this is a topicalization of something, and if you do, I would love to talk about it afterwards. And that's one question that I wanted to pose to. Can I ask more basic question I'll ask about this? What's the coverage overall given to groups for when there's gains between them? EIJ is like to EIK and to EKJ. Direction. So, if you change, you always get one, one, one, three, no matter how long you're going to do that. That's a great question. This three is because we chose this direction, and there's another direction where you get a different number of intersection points, and so on. That's right. So, these are the kinds of issues that arise. Is that a symmetric edge polytope? I don't know. Let's talk about that afterwards, maybe. Yeah. Yeah, okay. It is the symmetric edge quality of the code of the complete graph. No, so that's specific to the displacement vector. And let me make a comment about that, actually, which is that when I, okay, you're an advisor, you gave you a certain problem, you hope it's a good problem, and then Mont came in and did this. Mont came in and did this and quickly came back to me and said, You told me this, the answer doesn't depend on B, but it does depend on B. And they did it in one way and they got 11, they got it in another way and they got 9. And we spent months thinking about like, why is this? Because if there's anything that I know to be unimodular, it's this. So I thought there was no arithmetic here. And they realized, no, the problem is that even though this might look unimodular, actually, because you include the intersections, you get more. You get multiplicity, so you can't just count points, you have to really do the indices, and that was all that to say that different B's can give you very different ways of getting the same answer. And I actually think that that's an interesting combinatorial problem also is, you know, when you choose different B's, they give the same answer, and so you get identities that I think can be interesting in some cases. Let me speak about a couple of other examples. So, this, I'm choosing the formulation of this in the paper of. Using the formulation of this in the paper of June and Garrick, so in Hotland Cat Sin 11, they take the intersection of the bourbon fan, a certain number of copies of the tropical hydroplane, and the cremona transform of that. So cremona just means take this and just turn it around. And so there's two proofs of these. So the first one historically was The first one historically was tropical, and I have a typo here. This should be an H. This is Hancatz. So, what they did is that they showed that, and I think this is partially answered to your question, Carly, if you take the Bergman fan of a matrix and you intersect it with alpha, so that you don't have the complete co-dimension, and so you get some variety. It turns out you get exactly the topical variety of the first truncation of the matrix. And that basically tells them how to deal with the alphas. And now you have to think about how to interact with. You have to think about how to intersect with betas. And to do that, they did that topically in the way that I just described. So they intersect sigma m with now this minus sign is because you have that cremona transform and then they have they find the intersection points. It's a beautiful computation. And they show that the multiplicity of each point is one and the number of intersection points is the Fk, which is the coefficient of the characteristic problem. Later they have, in their later paper with Aleppa Sito, they have a different proof. With Alipasito, they have a different proof that goes through this presentation. And they say, okay, those fans correspond to some polynomials here, and then this basically corresponds to just, you take this huge polynomial that simplifies to a number, and you need to find out what that number is. And it's a very beautiful argument for why you get fk. In both cases, the answer is given by the theory of basis activities of tut. So that's another. So that's another early example. This is a very beautiful paper by Lucia Lopez de Medano, Felipe Renkorn, and Chris Schoch, where they define the Chern-Schwarz-McPherson classes, cycles of a matrix. So this is classically kind of a theory of turn classes for singular varieties. And they realized that for every matrix, there was a natural notion inspired by the wonderful quantification of. The wonderful quantification of what should be the CSM classes of a matrix. So you basically get these subtrans here. These classes are supported on the Bergmann time, but actually on the K-skeleton. So you have the Bergman time, which I've already told you is a variety. It's a tropical variety. But now they go to the K-skeleton, and then the thing doesn't balance. And then you have to say, okay, so can I make it balance? And then they found these very beautiful specific weights that make the fan balance. And again, you need geometric insight for this. Again, you need a geometric insight for this. I don't imagine you just kind of thought, let me put these weights, they're beautiful combinatorial weights. They balance, and then they computed the degree, and they found that this was the quotation of the characteristic colon of L2 plus 1. And the way that they did it was tropical geometric, and here you start having, you're here, but you also are in toric land, and you can do kind of toric morphists between things. Can do kind of torque more distance between things. And so, what they did is that they related the fan of the matroid of its deletion of its contraction, and they found through this push-forward and pullback mass between them that actually the left-hand side satisfies the deletion-contraction recurrence and there. So, it's the same classes. Alpha is still the same class. Alpha is always going to be the hydrogen. So alpha is the topical hyperplane, and then alpha to the n minus k ends up being the topical linear space. So it is the same class as before. They also had this very beautiful observation that CSM classes are, this should say valuation invariance. And what this means is that if you take a, so every matrix has a polytope associated to it, the basis polytope. The basis polytope, and if that matrix polytope can be cut up into smaller ones, p of m is cut up into smaller ones, then the function of the matrix equals the alternating sum of the pieces. And that ends up being a very... So this is part of the theory of matrix evaluations, matrix subdivisions. Again, I'll go back to Davis Fire's paper that did some very beautiful early work on. That there's some very beautiful early work on thinking about tropical linear spaces. Alice Fink and Harm Gergson did a very thorough study of these things. And this is basically saying that these kinds of intersection theory problems fit in there. And I think this might be the first paper that said that in the context of intersection theory. And I think that was a really important observation. And I'll say more about that in a second. So a later paper with Brown. So a later paper with Brown and with June studies this co-normal fan. And this is motivated by Varten's Cospitical variety. I'm thinking of the kind of con-normal version of the Bergman fan. But you end up with this very concrete thing where you take the Bergman fan, you multiply it by the Bergman fan if it's dual, and you want to intersect it with powers of alpha, which is the hyperplane. So this thing lives in Pn times Pn. So this alpha is the hyperplane. times Pn. So this alpha is the hyperplane of the first Pn, and then this delta is this kind of, what's the word flat flow? It's this hyperplane that's kind of like faced in a weird direction and that makes everything beautiful and interesting and complicated. And you actually get the same numbers of the paper of Lucia and Felipe and Chris. So we initially We initially actually didn't make the connection. But let me talk about how we prove this. So our proof is goes in this language, of computing with polynomials in this polynomial ring. But that means that you need a torque variety to put yourself in. And because these are not just Bergman times, there's something else, you need a new top. Birmingham, there's something else, you need a new torque variety. And so, part of the work was figuring out what is the torque variety that this should live in. And we needed that torque variety to come from a polytope so that we could use these kind of lock and cavity inequalities. And so it ended up that we actually needed to build this new polytope, which we call the biker mutihedrum. And we said, okay, let's work on the torque variety of that thing. And we chose it because it's normal fan supports all of these three fans, and it's implicit, so it has all the These three fans and it's implicational, so it has all the nice properties. And then we compute in Brion's presentation. And it's, I don't know, I had, I'll speak for myself that I had several years of fun computing this. I know we all have different ideas of fun, but for me, this came to a very beautiful matrix combinatorial. So, actually, our first proof was combinatorial, and it was really just: let's intersect this and work really hard and understand everything. And then later, we realized actually we're getting the same numbers as Lucia, Felipe, and Chris, and this probably speaks to a deeper connection there. And we realized that because this thing projects to the Berberman fan, there was potential of distort morphism connecting the two, and so what we were able to prove is that this CSM classes of a matrix are, as I said, they're beautiful and they're interested. As I said, they're beautiful and they're intricate. And they end up being images of some much simpler classes in the conormal plan. And this is a tropical analog of a theorem of Saba in CSM theory. And once we do that, then the degree of this is equal to the degree of this by the production formula, and then we get this proof. In both cases, we had to work hard, and there's this. There's this theory of biflats and biflats of combinatories that came out of that. That I think is interesting, and we ended up using some very deep ways this work of Las Verney basic. Let me so I'll speak about the last ones briefly. So the degree of the Briefly. So, the degree of the Bergman time intersected with these one Windows 7 Tasman Cascade width gives you the coefficients of what's called the Schelling polynomial. And the way that they prove this is particle combinatorial by, again, doing the intersections. And here you get this very beautiful combinatorial problem where you have matrix length here, you have this combinatorics of kind of type A partitions. And then to compute that intersection, they have this very nice. Compute that intersection, they have this very nice starting sets and they compute the intersections in that way. So in their later paper with Chris Ewer, they are inspired by tautological K-classes and Turing classes. So they define these classes in the Bergman fan, sport on the Bergman fan. And they compute the degrees of these powers. And you get the And you get this transformation of the top polynomial. And one thing that I want to say is that this is the first result that I'm aware of where log concavity is now not only in an array, but in a sequence, but in an array. So they prove that the sequence of coefficients of this as an array is log concave. So it's not just a rainbow, but it's like a mountain. And they... They actually work here in Valera's model with B-wack polynomials. It's a really remarkable proof. They translate everything to whatever the piecewise polynomial functions that level on the permutative heat film, and then they know that this is given by Deletion contraction, so they prove that this is given by Deletion contraction through some Tori morphisms. I wanted to mention that and And I learned about this idea from Chris Uran. I think it's a very beautiful idea. So they have this formula in the paper. It's a special case of this one that has a special importance. And the way that they prove this is very slick. They just say, okay, this formula, Davis Pire already essentially proved it for realized low matrix. And then what they did is they realized this quantity is valuative in the same way that Chris Felipe and Lucia have proven things are valuative. In an old paper with Alice Finke and Tili Pai and Communia proved that this is valuative. And so basically, because it's linear, because both things are valuative, and because linear matrix generate the others valuatively, this is a result of Dirty and Think, you don't really have to work any harder. So you automatically inherit. So, you automatically inherit from linear to all matrix through valuativity. So, I think this is a realistic argument that can sometimes be used. It cannot always be used. We tried to use it in the following paper, and it didn't work, actually. And this is my last example, which is just motivated by likelihood degenerations coming from other brain statistics. And that's an intersection number that Sturnfeld predicted. That storm thought predicted. And again, we did it in two ways: combinatorially. You have to do these intersections, and you get this, again, to me, really fun combinatorics of matrix and set partitions. You get this notion of arboreal pairs, and you get some nice combinatorics. So we can do it that way. Or we could also do it using the formula that I just showed you using Psalms polynomial. So that's another argument that is. So that's another argument that is slick, it's short. Sometimes these arguments are so slick that you don't really understand why the formula is true, but it's grouped and it's so I think with that I just wanted to you know it's it's kind of interesting coming in here and so so these are some words of my professor Ten Carlo Rosa. My late friend Stanley Lamister remarked that his life was sharply divided into two halves. In the first half, Divided into two halves. In the first half, he was always the youngest person in the group. In the second half, he was always the oldest. There was no transitional period. And I'm feeling some kind of way realizing that I think I'm not the oldest, but I'm definitely one of the grandpas here. And I feel like it's my job to do a little bit of storytelling. I just wanted to I was looking for the schedule and I googled algebraic aspects of matrix, and what I got was my thesis. And I thought, oh yeah, my thesis was called. My thesis, and I was like, oh, yeah, my thesis was called. But I just wanted to show you just how far things have gone. This sentence of my thesis, it says, I'm sorry that you cannot read it, but it says, this is the beginning of an attempt to study the top polynomials from an algebraic point of view. You can see just how we were struggling here. And actually, I wanted to tell you, Broda, I don't know if Roda advised you this, but Broda told me. I don't know if Roda advised you this, but Roda told me, Don't work with me because I'm old-fashioned and this made choice stuff. Like, right now, it's considered old-fashioned, you're not going to get a job, go work with Stanley. And so, my thesis was with Stanley, and I had this kind of side project to kind of do this, which he liked, but he said, you know, this is just not fashionable right now. And if you want to get a job, you don't really want to do this, matrix possible. I also wanted to show you a little bit of the prehistory of our paper with cardiac hybrids, where what we were trying to do sounds so different from what. What we were trying to do sounds so different from how what this became. So, Bernster Pelson, he was doing his book in Systems of Polynomial Equations, and he defines the Berbing complex of a matrix. And then he says, the theorem is that it's pure. That's the theorem. That the Bergman definitely is pure. And he says, when M is realizable, this follows from Bayerian growth. And when it's not realizable, you can use. And when it's not realizable, you can probably prove it using Blichen contraction. And actually, this is the question that Bernd gave us: can you prove that this thing is pure-dimensional? And we had no idea how to prove that it was pure-dimensional, and we tried really hard, and then eventually we realized the only way to prove that it's pure-dimensional is to really understand it, and then all of a sudden we realized this was a much more interesting object. And so, I just wanted to show you how lost we were when we were doing all of this, because I know we often feel very lost doing our math, and we feel like we don't know what we're doing. And when I read this, I can tell we really did not know. When I read this, I can tell we really did not know, have any idea of how far you all would take this stuff. So I just wanted to thank you for that.
