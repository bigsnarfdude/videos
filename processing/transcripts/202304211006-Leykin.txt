Be relevant here look like this. So, this is just a summation of all the gravitational forces acting on the i body. Here i is going from one to the other. And on the left-hand side, I'm going to write something like this. I'm going to write like this. I'm going to write mi pi times a constant. And if you ask me what it means, it means that this is Newtonian centrifugal force. So if I want another way to understand the central configurations in the plane, just in the plane, is that you can try to spin this whole configuration around the center of map. Around the center of mass, all the bodies spin with the same angular velocity. And you can manage the angular velocity in such a way that actually it will be the same up to Euclidean loop action. Right? So this is the centrifugal force. Yeah. Okay, so there is a survey on central configuration, it's very notable, and it's pretty. Knockable and it's pretty comprehensive. I was going to show a movie with Fort Buddy, but I don't want to click anything and open any other windows because the technology will break. There are many examples of such things. For example, you can, if the masses are the same, so in this picture the masses are the same, well, maybe different, but if you imagine masses could be the same and placed in the pentagon, in the regular pentagon, that would be another example of a central configuration. Another example of a central configuration. Okay, so, oh, yeah, by the way, you notice something that I could take an eraser and perhaps erase some stuff to get simpler equations. And with this simpler equations, we're going to state the following thing. You know that the guy on the left had 23 problems. Problems. The guy on the right had 18 problems. So the first one had problems for the 20th century. The Smale's problems are problems for the 21st century. A lot of them are unsolved. Well, not to say that some are unsolved on the left as well. One of them is the sixth problem. It's not that Smale invented it. It's a very old problem, over 100 years old. And the question is whether the number of central configurations up to natural symmetries is finite. Sometimes they're called relative equilibrium. So this is settled. A long time ago, Euler, Lagrange did something particularly explicit with hands, with their hands to settle it for n equals 3. It's done more recently. It's done more recently by Hampton and Knuckle in a paper in 2006. They actually give a number, the estimate for the number of complex solutions to the problem. It's in this range from 32 to 8,000 plus. And it's open. It's just open for n larger than 5. If you solve at least 5, if you solve it. Least five. If you solve it for n equals five, that's a big deal. Okay, so if this is so bad, oh yeah, let me make some disclaimer. So what things are essential here? It seems that in the actual problem, not only reality of masses, but positivity is important. So Garrett Roberts is gonna Is going to provide you an example with the negative mass and prove that if you put this negative mass in the middle and the other equal masses sort of in the rhombus, then you can basically choose the rhombus in any shape you like, as long as you stay roughly in these lines. So that provides you a So that provides you a one-dimensional theory with the curve of central configurations, and therefore the statement does not hold for negative, if you assume negative masses. This, by the way, could be rearranged. The masses could be rearranged to be positive. There would be a complex curve of solutions, but the real part is going to be finite. So it still does not disprove. You can judge. Okay. So there are people who do all kinds of things, including partial cases of equal masses for TQR favorite. Many people. And there are numerical results, rigorous numerical results, using interval arithmetic. So here in this paper, I cite by Majlograd and Lysinski, we have, they have established They have established they enumerated all the configurations for n equals five, six, and seven. They isolate them using interval. Real solutions, not complex. There are also some numerical experiments. I think here n is equal to in this picture, this is the end. I don't trust this. So I don't cite. So I don't cite the papers. Yeah, they are kind of like, you know. I'm not an answer. Okay, so relaxation. Let me get to a relaxation of this problem. I mean, if we cannot prove something, we try to formulate maybe something more relaxed, some statement that is similar but has some relative. Similar, but has some relaxation. So, here the relaxation is weaker in the sense that we are assuming that the masses are generical. That's weaker than the original problem. But, and actually, that's our formulation. We want to do it over any field of characteristic zero, not just reals. So we throw away reals. We don't assume reality anymore, not only positivity, but reality. Not only positivity, but reality altogether. Okay, so what can be done in this case? So the conjecture happens to hold. It holds and was in Annals paper by Albu, who is a celestial mechanics specialist, and Colossian, who is an analyst, dynamical systems expert, I guess. They did the way they achieved the result, they did some analysis of another SMP. They did some analysis of an asymptotic behavior of this central configuration if you, in the assumption that you do have an algebraic curve of them, of central configuration. So you analyze the symptomatic behavior. The paper is long, it has about 40 pages of casework, but they do it. They do it in a constructive way. You should take this counter example where one message. Sample where one mass is negative. That's for any plus five, right? Yeah. So, but this is in that center. It may not be true for all masses. So they do have a web work of cases and in each case they well at least they convince that they can convince us that they can provide exceptional divisor on which exceptional set. The exceptional set described by polynomials on which that may not hold. But it's actually in the assumption of reality and positivity, they can prove that this is quadimension two z, not just codimension one. So they prove a little bit more in the assumption of reality. But here we're not going to do that. If we don't do that, we write a five-page paper. Yeah. Yeah. This libid n5 is just because it's complicated or so. We don't know n equals 6. I'll tell you more about n equals 6. Their method, their casework gets very complicated for NICOL 6. Somebody tried. Don't mention it. A priori, I will say that our method also at this point does not work for NICL. At this point, it does not work for any coal. That is the shiny pole. Well, I mean, it's not the original problem, but this is very much in that direction. So, I put question marks. Well, you'll learn something about open miracles in the talk. Hopefully. So, let me reiterate. I have equations. I didn't write down the equation that the center of mass is assumed to be at the origin of this maximum. Have the origin of this and this is an extra equation. So you can work with these equations. But then you can notice the symmetries that if you multiply, if you scale your configuration, that basically you need to change the angular velocity to make sure that it's a central configuration again. So it's again a central configuration. You also, of course, have a rotational symmetry. Of course, have a rotational symmetry, and that's fine. So you have two degrees of freedom. If you model the symmetries, we have to have finite number of degrees. Oh yeah, so I already highlighted it here. So it is possible to rewrite this whole thing in terms of pairwise distances. That way we can eliminate the symmetry of rotational theory in particular. In particular. And we do that. Well, actually, people know how to do that. We didn't have to do it ourselves. So there are so-called Aubuy-Chensin√© equations that could be derived. Here in these equations, there are quantities that are pairwise distances. There is another thing that also is expressed through the distance. Expressed through the distance scenes. There's minus one. The constant one basically breaks the symmetry that has to do with rescaling. So in order behind the scenes with specialized capital C. So that's what's happening. These are some polynomial equations, as you see. Well, rational function equations. Related to polynomials. There are polynomials coming. There are polynomials coming out of Keeling-Mengler determinants describing the Kieli-Mengler variety, the variety of pairwise distances between endpoints. So those equations... The meaning of the G i j, it's a definition of the state. G i j is the function that vanishes. It's an equation. G i j is. You look at the zeros. Okay. So definition of gij when you look at zeros. Yeah, this is one equation. G i j equals zero. Yeah, this is one equation, j equals zero. Uh one type of equations. This is another type. Right. Actually, you know, this is sufficient, I think, uh to define uh the variety, the solution variety we're thinking of after writing. Uh, but well, maybe later on you'll understand that we might want to have more equations. So, in particular, we can sum two. In particular, we can sum two Gi's, symmetrized Gi, to get a new equation. That's the so-called symmetric Albulichians in air equation. And actually, a funny thing, the symmetric Albuquercians in air equations somehow they derived them first, and then the same person, Gareth Roberts, who did the counterexample, observed that you can actually split it up. Okay. So this is some alternative formulation that you can derive. That's all I want to say on this slide. And in the spirit of today, what would Frank do? I mean, if somebody comes to you with a problem, like, you've got five points and you play n is equal to five. N is equal to 5, and you say, now I'm going to take a napkin and solve it. Or, yeah, me, I have more machinery than Boiler and McGrunch definitely can do. So, what can you do at least to show a check for the possibility that they're over here? You can plug in random masses and solve them quotes, whatever it means. Whatever convinces you that the number of the solutions is fine. Of a solution with solutions is finite, at least experimentally. You can do that. You could also attempt solving of a rational function field. Yeah, if you can do it, fine. Then you settle the problem. This works for n equals 3. It doesn't work any further. The first method probably breaks it to n equals 5. Well, I mean, I don't know. Well, I mean, I don't know how what convinces you, what convinces me crazy. So you can potentially see all the slides compiled finally. So potentially you can verify the conjecture by finding some particular values of masses in such a way that. In such a way that you can find all the solutions provably. All the solutions are proven to be regular isolated points, and the masses are probably not taken on some discriminant models. So you should have some picture of a solution variety on top of your base space. Here you have masses, the comma solutions, all these are. Hold on R and the cover is projected as to M. So you need to the picture is sort of perfectionist because that's just a cover of with the map X goes to XQ. It the solution variety is irreducible, it's not irreducible in our case. It may have weird components with holes. We don't know anything about that variety. We don't know anything about that variety. We don't know much. So you have to, I mean, this is sort of a plausible attack, but I don't know how to execute this strategy. Just then you pass to these other equations with the G I J, etc. So do you get many more equations compared to the original correlation? You will see, I will actually have a number. It's going to be something like 25 equations. Be something like 25 equations and 5 children known as for n equals 5. So you have like 3 n equations for the here you have each i, but then when you do this look it expressing stuff in terms of the rij, you get many more. Somehow looks very good. So we're on the plane two. A plane, two n plus that equation for the center of mass. The other was linear. The number of equations, I'm the number of equations. Oh, the number of equations there. It's over. It's more. That's what I wanted to say. Not over determined, but around something. More equations than the number. Many equations. Right, it's not square. There's no special properties. Okay. Okay. All right. So uh yeah tropicalize I say why not extend our field to the field of Pedro series? I don't know. I guess everybody in the room is familiar with Peuzot series, but let me write anyway. So if I have something like that like this in my parameter t third is one-third perhaps I have some constant, perhaps I continue. So suppose I have something like this. Let's see what it buys me. I could take masses in that field of preserved series. Field of preserved series. I have a valuation map and tropicalization map. So valuation here, well, you just get, depending on your convention, we get two-thirds. We get minus that, because we prefer max tropical terms or whatever. Tropicalization map maps your maps your curves that you may have in in your your original maps varieties with which you have in k star n to some polyhedral complexes. Let's consider several examples. I just wanted to illustrate with something. So here's an example of a linear equation and a parabola, right? Parabola. Right? So the way you would produce a linear equation, in the linear equation you can take phenomenals and plot them at 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. That sort of is how people can easily draw pictures. If I took outward normals to this, then I will get a leap. Then I will get a linear. This is a tropical line. This complex in white is a tropical line, and this point is at the origin. I could do the same for the other curve. So I have x squared now, and it's a little bit more slanted, and my curve goes perhaps like this. If I intersect two tropicalized curves, I'm going to get something. Well, in this case, if I intersect these two, I'm going to get this. It has a name. It's a tropical pra variety corresponding to these two polynomials. So here, by the way, I don't see that the intersection of the generic polynomial. That the intersection of the generic linear equation with the generic quadratic equation of that shape gives me finitely many points. But in some sense, I do, because there is no way to fit a tropical curve inside of this pre-tropical variety. So at least I know the number of solutions is finite. I'll come back to it later, but this is what happened. What do you know from that? So could you well you know from that that the solution normal solutions finalization of the solutions I I'll come back to that because there is a slide like trying to explain what the balancing condition is. So yeah, I mean this is completely natural for tropical geometers but I will come back to that. So another equation I could write up is like this. So here you have two circles. Two circles would not intersect and intersect. Not intersect and intersect in four points as usual for quadrics, inter except at two. Well, both simplices here are simplices with 0, 0, 0, 2, and 2, 0 as extremals. So they're identical. The intersection of them is just that. There is no conclusion from that. You could do things. You could do things, though, as following. You could basically shift things around by plugging in, making substitutions that are a toric transformation. So if you do something like this, where alpha and beta are, let's say, are random, then your picture shifts around. So if I do it for one of the equations here, my The equations here, my picture shifts around, and I would actually be able to construct the intersection of so let's say the green one is the one that shifted around. It's just a friend shift. I would be able to construct this. I would be able to construct these two points in the intersection, and I would literally see that I have two solutions. In the other case, note that the indeterminate coefficient repeats before x squared and y squared, so this doesn't buy me the same. This doesn't buy me the same freedom. In fact, you know, they would still be overlapping. They would still be overlapping, and the intersection is going to be this part. But the intersection is going to be the pink part. That's a ray. And again, due to certain balancing conditions that I'm going to mention, this cannot contain a tropical curve. It has to be... At least we don't know it's 2. We know that we don't know that the intersection of. We don't know that the intersection is two points, we know that it's finite. That's all we know. In fact, if you read another short paper, eight pages, I couldn't convince this co-author to go to five pages. I give up. We tried. So that paper actually tells you how to get to point an intersection where you're going to a higher dimension. Anyway, just saying. Short papers should be read. Short papers should be written. So, basic principle of tropical geometry. One principle is that if you compute the tropical variety, which basically is the image of the original variety under this tropicalization map that takes valuations of everything, you're going to get a polyhedral complex with the same dimension. So, the dimension could be read off. So, the area in the girls proved it. And the balancing condition. Goes through it. And the balancing condition basically says that, well, if you look, let's look at the tropical curves only, one-dimensional objects. The one-dimensional objects look roughly like this. And at every point, you have to have some balancing. The vectors here have to sum up to zero with some weights. That's my asterisk. Like, for example, For example, for this parabola, tropical parabola, I will have to put weights 2, 1, and 1 to balance it out. And then the primitive lattice vectors summed up with these weights. I'm going to give you a 0. So anyway, it's some combinatorics that determines what it is, but basically, you now understand that I cannot put anything. I cannot put anything like that inside of one ray, or I could not put anything with the balancing condition inside of this union of two rays. Yeah? Okay. Yeah, I understand that this is not a tropical curve, but what I don't understand is how from the fact that this is not a tropical curve, you conclude that there is this superset that was a very simple. This is right, so this is a pre-variety, pre-variety. This is a pre-variety, pre-variety contains, so I just took two polynomials out of an ideal and took tropicalizations of hypersurfaces corresponding to them, intersected the hypersurfaces. I get a superset of my actual tropical variety. So whatever it is, it has to be inside. So if it is one-dimensional, it will have to satisfy the balance and condition and will be sticking out in the direction. Things that can be containing data are finite number of ones. Yeah, so basically, this is non-constructive, but here I know that it has to be zero-dimensional, right? So now here's a tricky fact. So you think the picture of a tropicalization map could be similar to some kind of a branch covering, but that's the wrong intuition. If you take a pre-image of one If you take a pre-image of one point, one random, let's say, point in the image of the tropicalization map, the pre-image of this point, think of all the valuation, all the tropical, all the result series with valuation two-thirds. They're many. They actually form as a risk-dense set. So it's kind of So it's kind of counterintuitive, but that principle of it actually arose much earlier than Sam Pain wrote a very general paper about it. But this is a very basic principle that says, well, if you can actually pick one point and show that things work for that particular valuation, set of valuations, they work in the open, the risky open set because the fiber is that Because the fiber is dense. So we're using only these principles. There is nothing fancy to them. I think they're being taught in tropical geometry courses that you're available. So here we get a proof for n equals 5. Proof of the conjecture, not the whole thing, but the proof of the conjecture for generic methods. Take some random numbers. On 4 and 9. You see the pattern? Well, so this, actually, it's not 25, it's 35. So 35 equations that appeared before, it's a highly overdetermined system, but nevertheless, it gives us so the number of equations that we use in this particular computation. Computation is 35. We compute the tropical pre-variety. We know that the variety, the tropicalization of the variety is contained in this pre-variety. And well, I mean, the strategy, we actually have many tricks up our sleeves, but the strategy that we honed in to, well, it's very simple. Very simple. You take the polyhedral complex, perhaps you decompose it into connected pieces. If you can show that every piece is a comet, a comet in our definition is something that is contained in a pointed cone, where you can talk in terms of tropical geometry, the recession cone is pointed. Basically, what the condition that I want is that my My polyhedral complex, or piece of polyhedral complex, lies in a pointed column. As long as I can have that, I cannot fit any tropical curve in there. It doesn't need a proof. So, here we go, we computed the complex that has this as an F vector. So, you see a zero-dimensional. Zero-dimensional phases, one-dimensional phases. There are many of them. It's a big complex. But it's a complex we can analyze or can break it into 257 comets and certify for them that all those comets are comets. So you erase it, just join you to it for just a minute. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's QED. I mean, that's the only thing. So that's that's that's our technique. Um let me tell you of uh what kind of animals were hurt in the process. Just to say of what the statement was for any to spice you have called generic masses mechanisms because I'm trying to understand the word the word generic, but now you But now you have this assumption that this tuple of masses is somehow given by everything with evaluation. So actually, the logic, I don't see very clearly the logic. So actually, yeah, I mean, very clearly I did not sort of specify exactly. I'm not specifying masses to be those series necessarily. I specify valuations. So the masses. So the masses that are in the fiber over those particular integer five duplet of integers, the masses are Pezore series that start with that power as a power. What you said before, that if you put that you put it in one topical point, this goes on all this series, then so it's the only thing. I'm not doing anything. Right. I'm not doing anything constructive here. The masses, I cannot derive, let's say, equations a priori, I cannot derive equations on the masses that are acceptable. Okay, but there's a general principle that I think it was on the previous slide somehow that you applied. Maybe yes, maybe aim at it fully step. The principle? Yeah, that's kind of counterintuitive, right? So you actually can pick a random point, that's what we're doing. Point, that's what we do. We do the execute a computation that computes the fiber over that point. If the computation is fine, then it's fine on the Zariski open set upstairs. To understand why it is enough to do that. I mean, one way to think about this, this is something that the pain points out, is that, okay, maybe you don't like the Quizot series, but they're algebraically the same thing as the complex numbers. They're really algebraic complex numbers, and this is a different analysis on it. The inverse image of a point under complexization is a dense set in this algebraic conversion of complex numbers. And so, if you know something that happens in that dense set, it happens everywhere. But it's a different analysis, much more. Right, right, right. So this is isomorphic to complex numbers. You instead you replace the complex numbers by other fields. Other field that is isomorphic. It's the same field, you're just looking at it differently. There's only one field which is a transcendent continuum in algebraically closed over Q. Yeah, well, I mean, this is not. I don't even see this as an essential true here, but that's maybe. That's maybe in this analysis. Our open sets in C start at the end, right? Big things, you put all wrong. But in this analysis, it's these things that have this valuation, which are very, very thin. Okay, but then in this side, this couple of exponents, one, four, nine, six, this is just for. These are variations. This is the same. But you can take any couple of non-profits. Yeah, two colors. Yeah, actually, I will show you what. No, no, no. You do it for one. No, no, no, you do it for one. And then you've done it. The drop evolved on that. Well, imagine me trying to explain it to Celesto mechanics. I have some background. All right. So, yeah, I mean, this is counterintuitive, and I mean, I was not, in some sense, like this technology, so this technology of So, this technology of producing a random shift of something, of some curves, gives us the decay bounds automatically. And you can do it just by doing one random set of liftings or shifts, as I said. I think now I understand. It's like when we talk about mixed volume and you do these liftings. Yeah, the lifting. The random one works, right? Yeah, yeah. So as long as it works, it works. As long as it works, it works. Yeah, when it works, it works. This helps a lot of money. Yeah. Okay. So, alright, so I think we are cool with it. So, what did you use? We used the GFEN, so we modified GFEN a bit to make the computations, optimize it. That that was a big part of work that of course did not enter the paper, but the computations themselves are standard. Computations themselves are standard. We just compute for varieties. So the computation is a proof I hope I convince Peter. And as long as I can convince movie stars, we're on board. So we actually do it rigorously. So we can ensure that there is no integer overflow in the computation. We can do it in five minutes on the laptop. The laptop, or we can do arbitrary precision integers and do it slightly longer time. Additional experiments. You can take some other random numbers that don't work. So here, not all of the components are going to be comets. Not all of the components are going to be comets for this choice of the volume. Well, not to say that if you choose 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, you're going to get volume. Zero, you cannot get all that still nothing useful. But there are some other choices. Yeah, so in particular, we got lucky with this one to obtain a provariety that is just the whole thing is contained in a point-pointed column. You don't even need to break it up. Yeah, so in fact, we didn't need to write a piece of code that breaks up alhythe. Of code that breaks up or hedral complexes into connected components. So let me just make a summary and end the talk. Maybe I can talk a little bit more. So what did I say? I said that, well, I already said all of this, right? I just didn't say what the computation was. Now you understand it's tropical. But if you kind of go back and reverse engineer what they did in the other papers. In the other papers. Of course. Well, Hampton and Merkel used BKK type of stuff, and that could be phrased in tropical language. So that's also tropical. In fact, the other paper is also tropical. It's kind of a little bit arcane for a tropical geometer because they do mention, they basically operate in the language of infinite sequences that go somewhere. And analyze the asymptotics of sequences. But you can phrase it in the language of tropical geometry. It's basically tropical computation where the valuations are all zero. So they do rewrite equations as the goal. They do this casework analysis and they produce more equations in every case to convince ourselves that there are some relations and masses that if they are not satisfied, then we are fine. If they are not satisfied, then we are fine. So, yeah, so at the end of the day, I think this line of attack that we chose has a chance to crack the next instance of a conjecture. And you arrive at the same conclusion, both papers? Well, they do a little bit more. So if they assume reality and positivity, they can do quote dimension two. They can do for dimension two. For the exceptional. I mean, for the exceptional locus, we can only say it's for dimension one. We don't even analyze it. We have no tools to analyze it. But you have to read only five pages. So let me thank the audience. I have one more slide which comes up, but in the gas public recording reference. Go ahead and stop the recording.
