Oh, is that just the question? Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Okay, awesome. Okay. All right, back up two seconds. Oh, but now this is not shown. So participants on the screen said they could not see you before the floor. Because I'm choosing presenter mode, is that one? There is a participant video that is on and that should that's the key. Yeah, but now the video is on  So I don't think you need to do anything, so okay, right, okay. Share your screen, and you will have here to share the screen. So they can only see your slides. The staff says if about that teacher, okay, okay. Okay, okay. Thank you. So just keep talking. Just keep talking. Okay. Okay. All right. So backing up. So this is how clinicians actually classify their glioma patients based on mostly their genetic profile at the molecular level or at the pathological level. But you can see that gliomas have a ton of different known common genetic mutations, and patients are classified into a huge number. And patients are classified into a huge number of genotypes. But then, on the other hand, recently people have profiled glioma tumors at the transmatomic level and found that there is diversity of cell types within the glioma there too. So like four different cell types at least. And so this tumor is highly heterogeneous, both at the genome level and at the transfer tone level. And many people believe this is the reason why. Well, many people believe this is the reason why the survival rate is so low because the common treatment for glioma will really only address the predominant tumor type there, and then there's a high chance of relapse and death from the tumor. So the patient sample that we looked at as a case study, this patient had a primary tumor, had surgery reception, and then had a relapse and then surgery and treatment again and another relapse. So this person had two relapse tumors and then eventually passed away. So we got the second recurrent tumor. We got the second recurrent tumor for our multi-omic single-cell method, and then we did bulk measurements on all three tumors. So, I'm not going to talk about the detail of how we actually do the molecular biology because that's probably important for you guys, but this is the method that we invented, and we used that to profile about 1,200 nuclei from this frozen tumor and got both the clonal profile as well as the RNA-C profile. These are all coming from the matched same cells. Match same cells. So on the copy number variation side, you can see again this heat map that shows the amplifications and deletions. And by the way, this tumor has a whole genome amplification. It has, you know, there's like the average, I think, is like four copies per cell. So in general here, what we're seeing is that there's a major clone, which is colored in yellow, and it has sort of these types of mutations. And then there's a secondary clone, the green one right here, which has very similar copy number changes to the major clone. Copy number changes to the major clone. But then, this third clone right here, the red one, we are calling it clone one, it has slightly different mutations to the other two major clones in the tumor. So when we plot out sort of the lineage of the clones or the clonal structure, what we get is that the normal cells are up here. And then the clone one that we get from the second relapse tumor is actually closer in distance to the primary tumor rather than the major clones of this. Than the major clones of this particular tumor that we profiled. So that was interesting. So that's the copy number side. And then on the RNA side, we can see that using our standards or cell clustering based on RNA-seq, we can get the typical cells that you find in the brain, like these neurons, the oligodendrocytes, tumor-associated macrophages, or microglia, and then astrocytes over here. And these in the center are the tumor cells that have a very strong tumor signature. So that's very obvious. But then what gets interesting is when we But then, what gets interesting is when we overlay this UMAP with the clonal identity we previously identified, then what we find is that the major clone is over here in the obvious tumor cluster, but actually the clone one is actually clustered with the astrocytes. In other words, these are cells that have a distinct copy number variation or mutations in its genome, but is displaying a transcriptional profile that is almost identical to other astrocytes found in this person. Astrocytes found in this person's brain. So that would suggest that these cells are unique in some way. And we have other evidence from studies from other groups to show that it's possible that this is a cell type which facilitates invasion of loma into the normal brain regions because of the types of genes or proteins being expressed by this astrophyte cell. So if you're interested in more details, I can give you more later. Obviously, this is only one case. Obviously, this is only one case, so it's sort of a case study and it's not really translatable yet. So we developed this microfluidic device to scale up the reaction. So, this is the chip that we made. And inside the chip, it looks like this. Just because it makes it more interesting to play the video, you can see the blue dots merging into the red dots. That's basically we're adding in reagents into the single cell reaction. And we can do this multiple times, which 10x cannot. So, that's what allows us to do a more complex multi-omic reaction than 10x. Multi-omic reaction system. So we're trying to scale this up right now. And if we're successful, we'll have 18,000 sites per chip. We can do multiple chips at once to really increase the number of cells that we pull from. So that's on the wet lab side. If anyone's interested in looking at this multi-omec data, I'd be happy to share it. It's already published. But we have, I guess, we have more raw data, which might not be all fully uploaded. Okay, so the title of my talk was Cross-Species Analyses and, you know, Analyses and challenges. And so, this is motivated by this Mouse Lemur single-cell atlas consortium that we're a part of. These are the different consortium members. And then in the Hong Kong team, we have these six people. So, Jia and Gofei, you already heard about their work from Chen. And it actually was partially sort of motivated by our interacting with the consortium, Tim Si and Cho Yu. Cho Yu is my student. And then, of course, in collaboration with Haiti Michael Ti. So, the mouse lemur atlas is because the motivation for doing this is because we were interested in whether this little animal here could be in the future serve as a better model organism than the standard mouse that we use now for preclinical studies. The reason is because this little guy here is actually a primate. It's a non-human primate. Even though it's very tiny, it's only a piece of banana, if you can get an idea for its size. But evolutionarily speaking, this animal life. This animal lies smack right in between mouse and human. And so it is a primate, but it still has much many resemblances to mouse as well, including a very small size and a much faster reproductive cycle than a larger primate, such as a mad cat or a chicken. So Mark Krasnow at Stanford said, okay, like there are already these animals being raised in the lab. Can we in the future sort of use them as a genetic model that is closer to human and mouth and therefore in the future? To human and mouth, and therefore, in the future, get better clinical predictions of, let's say, drugs or so on and so forth in these animals rather than mouse. So, that's the motivation. And so, they started embarking on this journey of analoging all the different tissues and cell pipes in this non-human primate. So, again, here's an image to give you an idea of the size of this animal. And so, in this project, four different individuals were profiled. There were males and females, and actually. There were males and females, and actually, it is of note that these are actually quite old animals. They were sacrificed sort of opportunistically rather than taking young animals and just eating them. These are not genetically identical animals. They're just, they're wild animals that have been raised in the lab. And from these animals, we got blood. We had clinician history and physical exams, pathological histology images from all of them, including 26 different organs. And then on these samples, we did single-cell RNA. Samples, we did single-cell RNA-seq. There were some cell culture done, and so on, so forth. So, there was a lot of metadata associated with this atlas. And then, this is the more detailed list of all the tissue types that were profiled. So, just to jump straight to the sort of, this is not the final figure that's going to go into the published version. But in this figure that I'm showing you here, we have about 226,000 single cells. And in this In this effort, we profiled both using 10X and SmartC2. And then in the end, we had 27 tissue/slash organs and 256 cell names. So we were very careful not to call them cell pipes because they were cell names that we defined for the clusters that we thought to be significant based on their marker genes. But we don't know if they're actual functional cell pipes. So in this particular version of the atlas, all the data was integrated using the algorithms that Integrated using this new algorithm that Ten and I developed together called FIRM. And the reason we had to develop a new integration tool rather than using the existing one was because members from the consortium were trying to merge all of this data together from different individuals, different technology platforms, different tissues, and they were finding it unsatisfactory. They were either getting over correction of the merging or not getting correct merging of the same cell text at all, especially for the 10x versus VARC2 interpretation. Versus Vart C2 integration because of the depth of the data types. So, Jing Si did an exploration of the data and found that cell type proportions in the two different data sets mattered a lot when we were doing the merging. And so, she came up with a method to, after initial scaling of the data, to then take a sub-sampling of the combined version to check whether the proportions were maintained. And if they weren't, then she would go back and do a rescaling of the data. Back and do a rescaling of the data, then integrate the scaled version depending on the proportion of cell types in the two separate data sets that were being merged. So that gave us a much better integration of all of these different tissue types and individuals and so on and gave us this nice map that our biologist friends were also happy with. They've now added four additional data sets to this, and so the map will be much larger by the time it's published. In particular, in my group, Published. In particular, in my group, we studied three tissues: the testes, which illustrates the process of spermatogenesis. We also looked at macrophage and monocyte diversity and also the fat cells. So just to very quickly tell you about some of the challenges, we wanted to compare spermatogenesis across different species because spermatogenesis is a very important evolutionary process that is both divergent and conserved in the place. And people had been manually sort of annotating the similarities and different. The similarities and differences between human and mouse, but obviously, we can't do that manually for our data set. I'm going to skip over these time. So, then again, I worked with Ten to come up with this new tool to help with cross-species integration. I have not enough math to explain this and how it works. All I know is that it uses an adversarial networks model to bring two sets of data from two different domains into a shared latent space to allow the integration. And apparently, this works much. Allow the integration, and apparently, this works much better for cross-species integration where the overlaps are set that intersect between the two orthologous genes, meaning that like genes that have comparable function between two species. But then because there are all these other genes that don't have orthologs, somehow this works much better. So, just to show you the results we have here, this is a multi-species integration between human, a cat, mouse, and mouse emerger of some. Mouse and mouse lemur of spermatogenesis. And the structure of the data is actually kind of nicely preserved. We have the sperm stem cells over here and the more differentiated cells over here. So it kind of naturally follows this structure in the data. And then this is if we only highlight the lemur cells. And this is if we highlight the mouth cells. And then we mark the annotations from the original data sets, either our annotations or the other published data sets. And you can see that the sort of staging of the spermatic. The sort of staging of the spermatocytes actually matches quite well across the species, generally speaking. But we do still find fine differences between the staging of the different process between species. And so to really compare that, we use a very simple way to compare them just by looking at the correlation. Because what we care about is the similarity of different animals to human. So here we're just looking at either the rank correlation or the Pearson correlation of genes being expressed at different Genes being expressed at different stages, or in other words, like the Louvain cluster that we define on this merged data set. In each cluster, we do the rank correlation of that animal to human to see how similar that animal is to human in that particular stage of spermatogenesis. So, again, very simple kind of intuitive analysis. And what you're seeing here from both, using both kind of metrics, is that while the macaque is going to still be far more similar. Is going to still be far more similar to human than the other animals. The mouse lemur is more similar to human than mouse. So, this is essentially what we did anticipate as well, because the macaque is a larger and more evolved primate and similar to human. So, we're still looking for more ways to interpret and analyze this cross-species data sets. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love to talk with you. And then, how many minutes do I ask? I also want to mention that we are doing also cross-species analysis of deep sea animals. Just to quickly tell you about what we're doing, we have a very okay. Well, I'll just tell you the three animals that I have and then we'll end. So we have single-celled data from deep-sea clam to worm and mussel, and we're interested in doing cross-species comparisons with these animals as well, which are even more divergent than the previous. Which are even more diverged than the previous one I showed you. Currently, we only have Sam Map as a tool to do that. So, if anyone is interested in working on this, I can talk more about it. My acknowledgements: these are my students, my group, my funding. Collaborators, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any very quick question. I think, Shokung, are you online? I see your name here. Anyway, any quick question for you, while Shirkun is setting up? Yes, I'm all on the SC1 cost per sample in terms of region cost and labor costs. Oh, labor cost is not counted in there, but.
