And thank you everyone for being here with this talk. I would like you to consider the following types of groups. So first, one related groups, or more generally, if you know what this means, staggered groups, small consolidation groups. Thankfully I don't have to define what this means because two people have already done done this for me. And fruit chambers. Okay, and I would like to ask you a question. What do this have in common? I accept suggestions. Rational code was called dimension two. We can write that down. Do you like all of them? Yeah, all of them in there. Yeah, exactly. My friend likes them all. Yeah, I like them all. That's property. That's a property. Are our sloping mission is coherent? No. No. Okay, well, I'll tell you some things that they have in common. This is important. The first thing that they have in common is that they all have very nice presentations. So, I mean, one reator groups are defined by their presentations, which have one single reator, and that's arguably a very nice property. Small cancellation groups are defined by their presentations, and again, it's about a nice property of a presentation. And pushing groups, okay, they're not defined in terms of a presentation in general, but they are known to have very nice presentations. Okay? So that they all have in common that they have very nice presentations. Presentation. So you also have in common that if none of the relators in the presentation is a proper power, then the group given by this presentation, let me call it this, is torsion free. So torsion can only come So, torsion can only come from the obvious space, which is that in these nice presentations, you see this is an equanimity. What else do they have in common? If no relator is a proper power, then their relation module, you know what that is, is the sum of cyclic modules. And again, if none of the relators is a proper power, their presentation complex is a spherical. And what I would like to tell you today is that this is not a coincidence. It is not a coincidence that all of these groups have all of these properties. But what do they have in common? The definition. Let's take a group presentation. And I would like to think of it this way, but simultaneously I want to think of it as a quotient of a free group by the normal closure of the collection of relators. So the presentation or the quotient has a coinable property. If there exists a basis of maximizing many conjugates of derivatives for the normal function. So, these kinds of expressions where the R's vary over the set of relations and the G's vary over left transversals for the thermal curve. So, the way that you should think about this property is the following. When you're looking at the quotient of three groups, so when you're looking at a group presentation, you want to understand what group you're presenting. And often this is very hard because a normal closure of a set of relations can be anything. And this is telling you that it is the most naive thing that you could want it to be. Okay? So it's a maximal collation of conjugates of the radius. And that gives you a basis. Okay? And this seems like a very algebraic property, but it actually gives you a lot of information that is also geometric. So let me tell you a bit about that. So the coordinate property implies all these things. It implies that you're torsion-free, if and only if no relators of the colour. Under this hypothesis, it implies that the relation model is a sum of cyclic models. So this implies, in particular, that there's no relation gap in these presentations, in these groups. And it also implies, so you can do this directly automatically: that the topological dimension of the group is. Tomological dimension of the group is less or equal to, or the rational one, equivalent, and the presentation complex is a square. So, what kind of groups satisfy the conditions property? Well, these groups. So, what relator groups and standard groups satisfy the conditions property by calling those. Property by calling it was original paper. Is the purple something you can see? Yeah. Pushen groups satisfy the coordinate property relative to the nice presentations by a result decision. C prime one of the n groups satisfy the coordinate property. Again, this will coordinate. The coin of property. Again, this is coincidental Linden. And already in 1966, Linden was observing that the coin of property is vital of these things. And that if he could prove it for the C6 case, he would be able to prove all of these things. He wasn't able to do this, so he proved the directed. But one thing that I did right here is it easy to explain this property transfer science in one way. Uh well the surface build for one reenter is uh one reenter ripples, right? But just not referring to this privilege, just rather the definition on it. Uh no, I mean the proof is not so easy. But that it has a coordinate property is not so easy. Um okay. So I proved that this also holds in the nonmetric case. So C6 groups, C6 groups have coordinated presentations. Mainly these are the small conservation presentations. So this is a topic. And so this is a property that we define for the presentation of the group. But the question is really whether it's a property of the presentation or a property of the group. And in many ways, it feels more like a property of the group. There are examples of groups, examples of presentations that are spherical, but not coherent, but don't have the cohenum property. But as far as I know, there are no examples of groups that have spherical presentations, but non-cohenland properties. Okay, so that's one thing. And now, what I want you to think about is the problem. So, the reason why I define this in this way is because I want to think about the generalization. So, forget about the group presentation and think about the quotient. So, you can define the coordinate property in a more general setting, where you just take any group. You just take any group and you take a collection of subgroups. So H is just a collection of subgroups of G. And we say that this quotient has a coordinate property. Now it doesn't make sense to talk about parasites, but we can ask that there exist left-turned verticals. And I my advice is don't think about this. Think about what I'm going to write next. So there exists left transversals for a normal culture G, such that the normal culture of G, again, this is something that we probably do not understand, the structure of the normal cursor combined. The structure of the normal cluster of the annotate. So, if this is a free product of the conjugates of these things. Okay? So this is saying that the normal cursure is the most nice thing that you could hope it to be, namely a free product. Don't think about the thing about the left transversus, just about the fact that we want the normal cursure to be a free product. That we want the normal cursor to be a frequency. Okay? Um so this is a property for groups and what do we know about it. The first people to look at this in a more general context than just group presentations were Carlos and Solitar and also Moldovanski Shulda. Shunuova and Shubietova who prove combination theorems for this property. So things in the lines of like if you have an H and extension where the groups in the action and extension have an amalgamated repellent where the groups in the amalgamated free palette have its property, then you can put conditions so that the whole group has its property. Then there are results of Edgebet and Howey, and also Bung and Howey for one-related quotations. I won't be very specific about what they say, but they're results of this type. And the most general thing that has been proven is probably a result of these. Has been proven is probably a result of pinson, about 10 kilometers. And I have proven that theorem in this direction, I have proven the following way. So the theorem is that C9 here is. 39 cubical quotients have the coordinate property. And I haven't defined this, and I won't define this. And that's fine. I will just talk to you about an example. So, one thing that people have been talking about a lot here is RT groups. So, let's discuss it groups. So, as we have seen several times in this conference, an I think group is given by a presentation where the generators are the vertices, and the relators are words of the form K B A equals L, where this is some label, which depends on the edge. So we have an edge and we have some number here. Number here. Right? And now we can define another presentation associated to a graph where we only consider the labels that are equal to two. So we have the same set of generators, but we only consider computation. So this is the same graph, the same simulation graph, by initiative. And this defines a right-angled RT group. And I can define yet another thing. So a dihedral RT group, you know what this is, is given by, we just take two generators and we put the relation corresponding to that edge. The relation corresponding to that edge. To that age. Is that clear? So, a corollary of this theorem is that if the Ardwin group has no three, four labels, then this quotient. So this rise of gun and a bow. So what are we doing? We are dividing the group into like two parts. One part is the right angularity group and then we're just adding all the extra relations to that. We are thinking of the group as this closure rather as the group we The group as this closure, rather, as the group be appeared by this presentation. So, in the classical case, the coining of property implies a felicity. That is also true in this case. So, another corollary of the result is that, let's say in this right, there exists a finite 8 by 1s of For RM groups that satisfy this condition. Now sadly for me, this is not, I'm not like extending the cape, I want conjecturing anyway. But I put it to you that my classifying spaces are better. Why are they better? Because I can use them to compute things. So, for R groups, we know nothing about their homology or cohomology. Even if you assume the Kπ1 conjecture, the only computations that are known are L2 homology. With rational coefficients or integer coefficients, we know absolutely nothing. Okay? But you can use the coordinate property for this three. The coordinate of property for these things to compute all of the comology groups of these attributes. So for every A gamma model M and for all A greater model 3, we have formulas for the cohomology. So the cohomology of this group is going to be Going to be the cohomology of the underlying right-angled atomic group, possibly plus some cohomologies of second groups, which you can say exactly what they are. But I don't want to tell you specifically. Let's say n of m i j, so it's a function of m i j. That is the formula, and we have a That is the formula, and we have a similar formula for the hormonal groups. Yeah, so why is this true? This follows from the coinliner property, which is a result of approximate sum, where they get a bunch of formulas for the cohomology of these kinds of groups. In a way, this was known before, so Howie already was computing cohomology of groups. Was computing homology of groups using the coordinate property. And this you know myself. But the most general theorem in this direction is the Petrosian sub theorem. And we can apply it in our second to get this. Yeah, that's the end of my Are there questions? Many was the key family of the Trendon, for instance? Well, I emailed Rod Chardy, and she said that it's not. So I believe her. They're locally reduced. It's not about the plane competency. One thing that I would like to say about these basics that you get here is that it's nice that you get the proof. It's like nice that you get the proof of astronicity but doesn't use catrionas. So this is not geometric, it's topological. Are there more questions? Where is this A-gamer module M on here? Sorry? Oh yeah, maybe I should have put it here. It's separate. Okay. It's always a completion with the right model. So in particular, you get Russian bar on integer. Particularly that rational integer coefficients. More questions? Then let's think in a okay, so we started.
