If you look if you look at the torsion of G2 structures with the same metric, as you change the torsion, it kind of bears similarities to the transformations of connections in gauge theory. But now the transformations being octonian multiplication. So essentially, the point here. So essentially the point is that the family of G2 structures that correspond to the same metric are parametrized essentially by Octonian sections, right? And if you want to go from one to another, you can multiply by another Octonian section. So you have this kind of choice of a section. So you can think of it as a choice of gauge in some sense. All right. All right, but here we generalize this to the setting of loops. And so here, loops doesn't mean like a loop, but it's a non-associative analog of a group. And again, don't blame me for the terminology, it comes from algebra. And I'll say a few more. I'll save a few more I'll define them. All right, so this is based on a number of papers, so you can look them up. All right, so let's get going. So first let's start with an algebraic structure known as a quasi-group. So essentially it's just a set with a product and a left and right quotient, right, which uh satisfy um uh reasonable properties. Reasonable properties. So basically, you can divide on the right, you can divide on the left, and that's pretty much it. So no additional assumptions. It doesn't need to have associativity. So that's just, that's what's known as a quasi-group. All right, but now a loop is a quasi-group with an identity element. Okay, so that's that's why it's confusing. So That's why it's confusing. So, a proper name for it would probably be like a unit of voice like group or something like that, but that's too long. And the story goes that back in the 1940s, this was defined by a group of algebraists working in Chicago, and they wanted a word which rhymes with group. So they came up with loop. And because they were in Chicago, they thought of the Chicago loop, which is the Chicago loop, which is the downtown area of Chicago. So it would have made more sense. Yes. So, okay, again. The first of those. Is there a typo or am I misreading? So does the slash tell me where the denominator is? Yeah, yeah, sorry, sorry. The first one, yeah, the slash should go the other way around. Yes, thank you. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. And what about the second one? The second one is correct. So here we are dividing by Q on the left, so then we are multiplying by Q on the left, so that kind of cancels the division. So in the definition, there should be a right screen. No, okay. Yeah, something went wrong with my slashes here. Okay. Anyway. Okay, anyway, up to putting stashes one way or another, it should work. Yeah, okay, yeah, actually, yeah, so for some reason all my stashes are going the same way. I wonder why. All right, anyway. That's fine. It's to make sure that everyone is awake. Okay. It looks like you are. Okay, anyway, so this loop is a term that we're stuck with, so, well, I can't do anything about it. Anything about it. Okay, so what I am interested in is a smooth loop. So that's a loop that's also a smooth manifold. And so we want the left-right product maps for each element of L to be a diffeomorphism. So essentially, that's kind of, we can think of it as a non-associative analog of a elite group. So basically, just think of a smooth loop as a Lie group, but without associativity, without necessarily inverses. Well, you have division, but it's slightly different from having inverses. You can define inverses, but they have slightly different properties. All right, so just a couple of examples. So, obviously, any group. So obviously any group is a loop and any associated loop is actually a group. That's pretty obvious. And now something that we all love is the Octonians. So for example, if we look at the unit octonians, so the seventh sphere. So this is a non-associative loop. And in fact, it's a nice loop. So yesterday we've heard that octonions are alternative, but in fact they are they satisfy a whole They satisfy a whole bunch of identities known as Mofang identities. And so the kind of loop that the unit of totalens form is known as a Mofang loop. So it's a bunch of additional properties which make it very nice in some sets. I'm not going to write them down. But in particular, these properties also imply alternatives. Now, another slightly more A more non-trivial example, for example, if you look at positive definite symmetric real matrices, or if you prefer Hermitian matrices, same thing, then we can define the product of two such matrices by this formula. So notice that here, this is just AB times AB transpose. So again, it's positive definite. Again, it's positive definite, and you can define this like a positive square root. So in fact, one can show that this defines a loop structure. So it's just to show that there are other things except october gates in this category of loops, so to speak. Okay. Okay. Well, yeah, obviously it's not a social difference if n is greater than one. Yeah, question. Could you remind me of the square root of a matrix is? Square root? So there's a one-half? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, well, if you have a positive definite symmetric matrix, so you can diagonalize it, right? You have positive eigenvalue. You have eigenvalues, so you just take it as square roots of those uh eigenvalues, right? So is this one Wolfhang or no? No uh so now we have these objects, loops, so now we need to define a notion of pseudo-automorphism. So this is a generalization of automorphisms. Generalization of automorphisms that we see in the standard associative world. So, here I've stated it just in terms of smooth loops, so I immediately think of these as differomorphisms. And they define in this maybe slightly, it looks like slightly strange way. So, these are different morphisms such that, well, actually, you can think of these as pairs of different. You can think of these as pairs of diffeomorphisms such that if you apply H to your product P cubed, then it's equal to some other map H prime of P times H of Q. So you see here the left and right factors have non-symmetrical roles. So they so if you So, if you think of your loop L as a set that admits action of the group, it admits different group actions. So, that's one way of thinking about this. And the way one can relate these is in the following way. So, if you take Q to be 1, then you see HP would be H prime of P times H of 1. So basically H is H prime composed with right multiplication by H of one. Now if we were associative then this would if you if you applied it into this formula if we were in an associative setting then this right multiplication would just cancel on both sides and we would have an automorphism. But here this is the generalization This is the generalization of an automorphism which we can have due to this non-associativity. All right. And also with respect to quotients, there is a nice property. So H prime dots quotient is the quotient of H of P and H of Q. And so I define these These cyclopia set of pseudo automorphisms by psi. Well, that's because psi has ps and pseudo-automorphism starts with p and s. So that's why I call it psi. And these partial pseudo-automorphisms, which are the h primes, looks like that's better design, something, I call it psi prime. Psi prime. And actually, okay, these are both Lie groups. And at least if L is compact, they're finite dimensional. Maybe they are finite dimensional. I don't know. Yeah. I guess I was confused. I was thinking that, you know, if you put the prime on the other side on the Q instead, or if you interchange the roles of H and H prime, I assumed. Well, you know, you can do it. So technically speaking, these are rights to the automorphisms. So, but you can define a. So, but you can define a different notion of left pseudo-utromorphisms. But it would be a different group. I guess my question is because you're saying there's a group of pseudo-pseudo-morphisms. Yes, there's a group of partial pseudo-romorphisms. They're different groups. Yes, they're different groups, right? Yes. And you would have a notion of left companion. Yes, exactly. One would reverse the picture, but it's just a matter of conventional which one you. But it's just a matter of conventionally which one you pick, right? So you can use both, but generally it's enough to use just to pick just one. Yeah. Yeah, there is nothing magical about that, and right, you can always slope them. It's a matter of choice. All right. And now we can also define the actual automorphism group. So notice that if H of one is If H of one is equal to one, then we would just have H prime of PQ is equal to H prime P times H prime Q. So the orthomorphism group of the loop is just the stabilizer of the of the identity. And that's that's really um uh what we think of and of homomorphism. Think of automorphism. Can I think of the pseudo-automorphisms as like automorphisms of the underlying quasi-group? Is that like freaking? Well, yes, I guess one can think about this this way. So, you know, really if we look at the category of loops, the morphism is really the pseudo-automorphisms. But because we want to call what we think of automorphisms automorphisms. What we think of automorphisms, automorphisms, we need to come up with a new name, pseudo-automorphisms. It's confusing. So, really, the pseudo-automorphisms are the automorphisms, if you think of it in category theory terms. Okay, so in fact, in the Amufang loop, and if you recall, these are alternatives. So, when you have expressions with just Have expressions with just two different elements they associate. So, in fact, it's not difficult to show that using Mopang identities that this conjugation map in the Mupplin loop is actually a pseudo-orthomorphism with companion q cubed. So if you map p to q p q inverse, then it's companion. So that's the h of one would be a q cubed. Q cubed. So it's actually prime always take one to one? Yes, yes, exactly. Yes. Okay, so because there is bound to be some confusion, if we need to distinguish our sets L as G sets, so as sets with an action of psi, we will use the the letter L. Use the letter L to denote L with the full action of psi, that's with the action of h, and we'll use L prime to denote it, as you said, with the action of psi prime. So because L actually refers to lots of different things. It refers to the underlying set, it refers to the manifold, it refers to the HL loop, and as the G sets, there are different versions of it. All right. Okay, so this group psi can also be thought of as a group of these pairs where we have an element of psi prime and the companion H1. And there is a group law on how to actually compose these. So is it some kind of non-associated semi-direct project? Yes, exactly. Yes, yes. So in fact, if So, in fact, if your loop is a group, then this psi will be a semi-direct product of the automorphism group with the group itself. So it will be this kind of thing. Okay, now again back to our favorite example. If we take L to be S7, then in in fact it's It's not difficult to see that the pseudo-automorphism, the full pseudo-automorphism group is actually spin 7, and the partial automorphism group is SO7. And so if we take such a pair in psi, then this projection to the element and psi primes, actually, this corresponds to the double cover skin 7 to SO7. And that's because these companions are unique up to Are unique up to plus one and negative one in S7, which associate with everything. So you can always cancel them. Okay, and the oromotism group is actually the G2, as we know, right? All right. Now, again, I just want to point out that from so one So one, that's the definition of the pseudo-romorphisms. So the left and right faculty have different roles, right? So the left one, you can think of it as being in L prime, the right one in L. So it's kind of interesting that, although we have this product, but in terms of group actions, the factors are non-symmetrical. And so it does matter. And it doesn't matter whether you pick left or right because pseudoformorphisms, in any case, left and right factors in your product will play different roles. All right, but what we can do is if we pick an element in L, then we can define a modified product on L primed using this expression. So we do P times QR and then divide by R on. And then divide by R on the right. Notice that the R won't cancel because it's not. Sorry, L primed is just L, but equipped with the partial action of the pseudo-romotor, so the actual partial pseudo-forms, like the H primes. And the reason why I'm saying that this product on L primes is because let me just go back. Let me just go back. So, naturally, we have H prime acting on this product, and the product itself is modified when we apply H to it, but still here in this modified product, the P and the Q both packets, they play symmetric roles. So they they're both acted on by H prime. H prime. So can you say what do you divide by r? The quotient by r means what? Well, it's just the quotient in the loop. So the loop has left and right division, so this is just the right division by r. And this dot that's just you're associating? Yeah, well, it's just multiplying it just to make notation a bit simpler to avoid lots of parenthesis. But it's something like P, yeah. Yeah, so it's basically you have P parenthesis Q times R. Fp parenthesis Q times R. Yeah, yeah, just to make sure that it's clear what is the order. All right. So I don't know, okay. Yeah, yeah. So you have this A belonging to L prime means that A is equal to H prime of one or H no no, so it's just again, we're just thinking of A. Again, we're just thinking of A as being the G set L prime, so it has the action of H double minus, or will it be H? No, no, no. So here the distinction is just it's still the same set, but it just admits different actions of psi. It's just for definiteness, because when we apply psi to this expression, This expression A will be transformed by H prime. I think maybe if you don't confuse me on the previous page, you had capital A for an element psi prime. Yeah, like you wrote psi of the pair H comma here where A was the H pr. Oh, right. Sorry, yeah, that's a different thing. A was a companion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, here's, yeah, sorry. It's a d here's just some arbitrary thing. Yeah. Okay. So now. So now, is it good to think of companions as being an Elpron? No, companions. Well, companions should be thought of as being an L. R prime is an L. Well, they are the same thing, but they just have different access. Yes. All right. Well, the reason why this. Well, the reason why this distinction will become somewhat important or important is because when we define bundles, we need to know what kind of action of upside these objects admit. So that's why it's important to keep track. All right, although it does cause a bit of confusion. All right, so now let's look at the tangent algebra. So again, Uh a again, uh uh uh here I'm uh taking uh S to be an L because then I'm uh taking right product by S. So when I'm multiplying on the right I think of these guys as being an L and things which are on the left as being an L prime. So this right product we can think of it as a map from L prime to L. So it's taking something in L prime, you're multiplying on the right and you get something which is an L. And you get something which is an L. Okay, and these are the firm of any S. All right. And so now, similarly as in the leap group story, if we take a tangent vector identity, we can define a vector field just by translating this vector to every point. So we call this vector field rho psi. Rho of psi, and I'll call this a fundamental vector field. It's not a right invariant in the sense of Lily groups, again, because of the non-sociality, so I just call it right fundamental. Okay. And moreover, what we can then do is if we pick a point P on our loop L, then Loop L, then we can work out the bracket of our vector fields, rho sine, rho, gamma, for example, and work out the value of that bracket at the point P, and then send it back to the identity. So this will then define the bracket, the P bracket, of two elements of the tangent. Of two elements of the tangent algebra, sine gamma. Notice that this depends on p. So if you do the same thing with on a Lie group, your bracket of, for example, write-in variant vector fields will be right-invariant. So this quantity wouldn't depend on P. But here it does. So we call Uh so we call um you know this uh this tangent space T1L together with this bracket P to be the we call tangent algebra for little L P. Okay, and so notice that these brackets depend on P, so we can define a function which we call b from L, which basically takes every point in L and maps it to the corresponding To the corresponding bracket. And so again, on a Lie group, this B is constant. So the derivative of it is zero. However, here, it's not necessarily so. So in general, the derivative of B will be non-trivial. And so we can define this triple form A, which A, which is just the differential of B again in the direction of some other fundamental vector field. And you'll see in a minute how this comes in story. So certain? Yeah. So this bracket is skewed but it doesn't have a Jacobian identity. That's right, yeah, and I'm just coming up to this. Yeah. All right. And also we can define an analog. Also, we can define an analog of the Marookartan form here. It does basically the same thing as you would expect it to. So, essentially, it's sufficient to define it on these fundamental vector fields because they define a global frame for our loop. It just takes your vector and sends it back to the identity. All right, and that's what the Moroccan transform does on the lead group, and that's what it does here. It does here. And the nice thing here is that it satisfies again an analog of the Moroccartan equation. But again, this bracket here, it's not constant, right? It depends on the point P. So if we take d theta at point P, then we relate it to the bracket of to the P bracket of To the p bracket of the Adels. And here we also assume a wedge product, right? But is the right is the image of one by some right multiplication? Right, yeah. So can you write p bracket in terms of bracket entity up to Be an entity up to some sort of um well, not that's so you see how it was originally defined. So it's it's defined well, yeah. So you see, well, it would just be so it's defined using the lead bracket of the vector fields at the point P. So and this bracket is not necessarily right and varying. Right invariant in the sense this would be on the leak hoop. So there is no such direct relation. I'm not saying they should coincide, but yeah, I mean if you can map one together, like you have precise. So that's the definition. Well yeah, but it's pretty much equivalent because you don't know what the Librac at that point is. All right. Now if we differentiate or apply the exterior derivative to this structural equation, then what we get is a modified Jacobi identity. So normally here on a Lie group of the Jacobi identity would follow from the Morrow-Cartan equation, because here your bracket is constant. Your bracket is constant, would vanish, and then you just iterate and you get the Jacobite entity. Now here, the derivative of your bracket gives rise to these objects A. So these are kind of associated and so uh so you have this non trivial right hand side of the Jacobi identity. And actually this uh identity is um quite well known in s Well, known in some regions of algebra. It's known as the Akibis identity, according to some sources. What's good? Achibis, Akibis. Right. And now you see, if A is zero, so if your bracket is constant, then your algebra is automatically a algebra because it satisfies the Junkov identity. So if you so basically. So basically this non-constant nature of the bracket is precisely what causes your algebra to be not a Lie algebra. And so in other words, also relate to the fact that your loop is not a group. So it's quite a key point here that is it equivalent? So if this true So if this triple combination of uh A's vanishes, that's your loop is necessarily group with a general algebra. Well, at least locally. I don't know what would happen what would happen globally, but of course, at least locally, your algebra would determine the behavior of your loop. This A sub P is skewed in the first two, and is that what? Yeah, so A sub P is skewed in the first two indices. Now, if you have some additional assumptions, you can show, like for example, if you have an alternative loop, then your A will be fully skew symmetric. And in, so for example, for Tonians, it would be a total skew symmetric. You would add all of them out. Be a total symmetric, you would add all of them up, and it would be related to the star of phi essentially. So, maybe is this in which this what you were asking is if the right-hand side of seven vanishes, that means A is completely skewed. And does it mean that A has to be zero then? That's what you asked. Well, actually, yeah, that is a good question. Is actually a true problem, which is not made because they are equivalent to A is zero. That's what I mean. Yeah, yeah. So, let's imagine a loop. Yeah, so let's imagine a loop having it on the other. Yeah, that's a good point that theoretically one can imagine a situation where all of these cyclic permutation lemma is zero, but each one is not, right? Yeah, but so in that case, you do have LE algebra, even though your bracket is... So, your bracket is non-constant, but the point here is that what may happen is that maybe for some particular values of P, you may have like a for some particular values of P, you have a Lie algebra, right? And maybe star maths. I don't know. Right, if it's alternating for all P. Yeah. Yeah. You could still. Oh, yeah. Well, I don't know. Good question. I don't know. I'm sorry, we lost the definition of the AP once again. It's basically the derivative of B. Yeah. It's the derivative of the brackets of AP. So this is. I'll get into Q ding. Yeah, it's not good. Yeah, but I put points in breaking, yeah. Good point in the entrance, yeah. Okay, now we can also define the naloog of the exponential map here via integral curves of fundamental vector fields. So again, similar to what we have in the Libert story. So for a moment, suppose our vector field, our fundamental vector field of psi is complete, so that we don't have to worry. Complete so that we don't have to worry about the domain of definition of the integral curve. So we can define the exponential map, and notice it has a little subscript S because it will depend on your initial point, just to be the integral curve at 1 divided by S. So now of course. Now, of course, if L is compact, we don't have to worry about these being non-complete. But if it's non-compact, then in fact, we need an additional assumption on the properties of L. So we would need a property known as power associativity so that powers of elements actually associate. So then one can extend the integral curve arbitrarily. Arbitrarily, and this again similar to the League group story, but we need this power associativity assumption. So, this was done by Kuzmin in 1971. Alternative implies power associative alternative, yeah, yeah, that would take all right, and uh but assuming I either one of these properties holds, Either one of these properties holds, then we have a look. This exponential map is a local diffeomorphism as in the Lie group case. And again, notice that we have actually a whole family of exponential maps. All right. But if we have yet an additional assumption, which is left power associative, it's a bit stronger than Bit more it's a bit stronger than just power associative. So that means if we if you have two different elements, but on the left you have powers of the same element, then they associate. Then actually this exponential map would be independent. It is independent of S, right? And not dependent on S. And in fact, that's true for Optonians. Okay, and something that we'll need to use in a bit is we can consider this evolution equation for some quantity which takes values in the tangent algebra. So, this may be familiar from Lie algebra Lie groups and And so this is a homogeneous first-order ODE, so we can have some evolution operator. Now, on Lie algebras, we know what this is, right? So this is, because on a Lie algebra, this bracket is constant, then this operator U will be essentially the exponent of the little add map. Exponent of the little add map, which is equal to the adjoint map. But in general, this U doesn't have to coincide with the add map. And in fact, it's quite fascinating that the difference between U and big add is related to how the exponential map depends on the subscript S. So if the exponential map is independent of S, then actually. Of as their nature of the two coincides. By the way, but this is just for later. Okay. Am I doing for time? Okay, well, I think it should be okay. All right, so now let's look at two loop bundles. All right, so recall we have the following. So we have a loop, we have a pseudo-automorphism group psi. And so suppose now we have a smooth manifold with a psi principal bundle. Principal bundle. And also recall that whenever we have some set with an action of psi on it, then we can define an associated bundle. And in particular, the sections of an associated bundle are then in a one-to-one correspondence with equivariant maps from the total space of the principal bundle to the set S. Okay, and so using this general construction, we'll need to define. This general construction will need to define several bundles. Obviously, we have the principal bundle P. Then we also define the bundle Q primed where the sections are elements of L primed. And remember, I made a big deal out of this difference between L and L primed. And here, the reason is because we have different actions of psi on L, we need to distinguish them. On L, we need to distinguish them, and so we get different bundles, different associated bundles, depending on which one we use. And so we have this bundle Q', and we have the bundle Q, where the sections are, well, so the equivalent maps are maps from P to L without the prime. And also, we'll define a bundle A. So here these corresponding. These correspond to tandem algebra valued maps. Okay, and basically the action of psi here is via the push-forward map at identity. All right, okay, so we have these various bundles. And note that we have two ways of defining covariant products. So we can either take something in L' and multiply it by L on the right, or if we take some section S, then we can do this modified product of A times B, but now we can take both A and B as being L prime valued. As L being L prime valued. Okay. Okay, so what we'll need is some key defining equivariant map S, which is L valued, or equivalently, this will be a section of the bundle Q. Okay, so once we have that, then the For the other maps like BS, the bracket, the AS, that's associated map, they will also be equivariant. And so, in particular, when we go back to sections, they will give sections of corresponding associated bundles. All right. So, now, moving forward. So, now recall we have this principal bundle P, so let's define a principal connection in it. And let's call this little p to be the Lie algebra of psi. So the connection one form little omega, so that will be a little p valued, right? Okay, and now also generally recall that if we have an equivariant map from the space of the principal bundle to some set S, then we can define a generally We can define generally covariant derivative by just taking the differential of f and just composing it with the horizontal projection. So normally we think of f as being of taking value some vector space, but you don't need to, it will just take this covariant derivative will take values. Covariant derivative will take values in the tangent, in the tangent bundle. All right, and equivalently, something which is also well known is that we can write this covariant derivative of d omega of f as df plus little omega acting on f. So little omega is p-valued. So if we have an action of psi on the set s, then action of psi on the set s, then it induces an infinitesimal action of the Lie algebra on s. So this dot denotes this infinitesimal action. All right. Okay, so now suppose we have an equivariant section S, which is L-valued, and we have a connection omega. Then we can combine these two objects and define what Combine these two objects and define what's known as the torture. So, what is this? So, we're taking theta, so that's the Morris-Kartan form on L, and we pull it back using S, and then we take the horizontal projection. So, or more concretely, one can write this equivalent. Can write this just taking the exterior derivative of s and then kind of sending them back to the identity. Yes. Maybe I'm missing something, but this section is still a map from L to P. So this section S is a map from P to L. It's an equivariant map from the total space. Map from the total space to L. What is the section of? Okay, well, it's then equivalent to a section of the corresponding bundle. So any equivariant map is equivalent to a section, to an associated section of a bundle. So I'm just treating the two in the not making too much distinction. Not making too much distinction. So, if we go back here, yeah, so basically, an equivariant map from P to L, it corresponds to a section of the associated quantum. Oh, so it's a section of the quantum. Yeah, so one can think of it either way. So, you know what you had it on your paper as well. That's right. I learned it from your paper actually. All right. All right, cool. All right. So going back to the definition of torsion, so you see, roughly speaking, one can say that it's the covariant derivative of S divided by S, roughly speaking, right? Or dS times S inverse if you think about it in Lee group terms. Okay. Okay, and again, and this is actually the point that Again, this is actually the point that I was making that equivariant horizontal forms on P give rise to sections of corresponding associated bundles over the base manifold. So what we'll do now is just switch perspectives and just work in terms of sections of bundles, just because it's easier, we don't have to. So this S will be referred to as the defining section. We can also consider sections of the bundle Q'. Of the bundle q prime, right? So the which admits the partial action of psi. So we then have a product of sections of q prime and sections of q and this connection then induces connections on the associated bundles and covariant derivatives on sections of those bundles. And now this torsion that we originally defined, so it was a horizontal and a covariant. Is a horizontal and a covariant one form. So basic, what's known as a basic one form on p with values and little l. So little l is the tangent algebra of our loop. Okay, so it uniquely corresponds to a one-form m with values in the module A. Right? So I don't want the introduced additional notation, so I'll use the same notation for t as omega as one form with the values in A. One for only the values and A. So it's an omega 1 A. So omega is the connection. And so to define the torsion, you just don't need the connection. You need this choice of S. Yes, exactly. Right. Yes. Okay. So now what we can call non-associative gauge theories is the following. So we have a smooth loop L, right, with all the things that go with it. So we have the pseudo-homorphism group psi and tangent algebra. Then we have Then we have some smooth manifold with a principal psi bundle and associated bundles that we defined earlier. And now the configuration here will be a pair S omega. So S is this defining section of Q, so it's like a loop-valued map. And little omega is a connection. And each configuration carries torsion TS omega. Distortion at TS omega, as defined earlier. All right. And now here, a loop gauge transformation is actually a transformation of the defining section by right multiplication. Sorry, I should say left. Left multiplication. Well, kind of right and left, same thing. Okay, left multiplication by section A so that S goes to A times S, so that the torsion goes to T of A S omega. So you see this configuration as omega, it obviously still admits the standard gauge transformations of the connection, but this additional piece S here now admits this non-associative transformation. Okay, so how does this This T depends on deformations of S? Okay, so suppose we have a family AT of sections of Q prime given by the exponential map, and here S is fixed. Then actually, the time derivative of T is given by Given by same equation we had earlier, but with a non-homogeneous bit. So we can rewrite explicitly the solution using the operator U that we had. So this gives us a somewhat explicit way of writing down the solution. So we can at least understand the deformations of the torque. Of the torment. Okay, and what we can do next is: okay, assuming that M is compact, we can then, and assuming we have a metric on the manifold and an inner product on sections of this bundle A, we can define the energy functional. And here we would need some additional assumptions on what's the actual inner product. On what the actual inner product is in order to get a reasonable critical point. Yeah. Do we understand parallel transport and harmonics with respect to connection, I guess, to configuration as W? Well, the connection here is just like an it's just a standard connection. Just a standard connection, but the connection just comes from it's just a connection with principle one, though. There is nothing funny going on with it. So the thing which is non-associative is just S. So what's going on about the loops? The connection is just a connection. Yeah, just whatever, so whatever the hologram of the connection is, it's. The connection is. So it's not like normal source to support. No, no. So the holonomy itself is just the standard holonomy group of the connection. Yeah, yeah, we do understand. It's just a standard thing. Now, note that if our torsion is zero, then S is actually preserved by our connection. So then we can say that actually the holonomy of the connection is in the automorphism group of the In the automorphism group of the loop. So, here, as in the G2 case, the torsion, the properties of the torsion, actually they determine the holonomy of the connection. So, that's... That's what I was trying to say. Yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah, that's... Can you remind us where the torsion takes values? Yes. So the torsion, it's a one-form, but it takes values in the bundle where the fibers are the tangent algebra. Are the tangent algebras. So it's basically like a Lie algebra value one form, but it's not a Lie algebra. Right, in some sense. In some sense. So if capital L was an honest group, then you could just take S to be constant. Is that and then the torsion is zero if you do that? Uh yeah, I th pr prob probably. Yeah. Probably, yeah. All right. Okay, now going to these going to the function. Now, now if we assume that the inner product on A satisfies some nice properties, and we can get those if we assume that if that L is a Mufang loop and the inner product, well actually sim semi-simple a Mufang loop, a Mufang loop, same definition as for Lie groups. As for Lie groups. And we suppose that the inner product on the timelined algebra is given by the Killing form, again defined exactly given in the same way as on Lie algebras. It satisfies nice properties. Then in fact, the critical points of this functional will be configurations for well. Will be configurations for well section. Here we are actually here by keeping omega constant, right? So omega is fixed. So the critical points will correspond to divergence-free torsion. And you've seen that in other situations as well. Okay, now what we can also do, and actually we don't, without assuming any of these additional assumptions, Any of these additional assumptions. What we can do is actually, and I'm not going to spend too much time on this since I'm running out of time. What we can also do is adapting ideas for proving existence of the Coulomb gauge in standard gauge theory, what we can show is that if we have a torsion which is sufficiently small in a particular sopholip norm, In a particular sofa-lift norm, then there will be a transformation A which takes us to a divergence-free torture. And for this, we apply the implicit function theorem for Banach spaces, and it actually works out quite nicely because we have an explicit formula for deformations of the torsion. And so, I'm not gonna go through this, but Go through this, but it's just a nice application of the implicit function theorem. But let me just skip this. And of course, elliptical irregularity always comes in. Okay. But now, just in the remaining couple of minutes, I just want to say how all of this relates to the G2 story. So, in particular, now, if we take L to be S7, then we just have the following correspondence. Okay, so as I mentioned before, the full pseudo-homorphism group is still 7. full pseudo automorphism group is spin 7. The partial pseudo-automorphism group psi prime is SO7. The automorphism group was G2. Now we know that the Lie algebra of Psi, so that's where our connection is taking values and is the Lie algebra is of 7. Now the loop with the full action of psi so that's the unit of Tonians, but we think of them as But we think of them as sitting in the eight-dimensional spinner representation of spin 7. So spin 7 acts on. So it's confusing. S with the downstairs 7 is not the same as S with an upstairs 7. But anyway, so basically these are the unit spinners, right? But the partial action, so that corresponds to the unit vector. Unit vectors, so to speak, right? So this is the seven sphere which sits in V1 plus V7, so which are the one-dimensional, seven-dimensional representations of spin seven. And so that's how you get this H and H primed. So these correspond to different representations of spin seven. So equivalently, the vector representation of spin seven, it's like it's basically a NESO7 representation. Okay, so then going to the bundles, we carry across this whole picture. So now this loop bundle P, it's a spin 7 bundle. So if M is a seven-dimensional manifold, we can think of this as like a spin structure. So it's a principle spin 7 bundle over M. Now, Q primed is what I defined in the moment. What I defined in my earlier paper is the unit Haptonian bundle. So that's basically the unit sphere bundle in the tangent bundle with an additional one-dimensional piece attached. Now, the bundle Q is then just the unit spinner bundle. And the A with a bundle of imaginary, that's just Tm. So the So, the tangent spaces correspond to imaginary oftonians. And the tangent algebra to Hoctonians, well, it's isomorphic to imaginary octonions. Okay, now as we know, a G2 structure may be defined by unit spinner. So that's a section S of our bundle Q. Now, the torsion in spinorial language. In Spinori language, it can be defined in this way. So it's the spinner-covariant derivative is equal to the torsion. Now remember, torsion takes values in the tangent bundle, so you have rooted multiplication on the side. All right. And now, if we have a unit Octonian section, as I defined earlier. Insection, as I defined earlier, A with Clifford's multiplication on psi is again a unit spinner, which defines a new GT structure. So, again, considering both A and Xi as Hoctonians, this is just Hoctonian multiplication. So, this is basically the same thing as we had in the general setting, and we can rewrite this theorem for divergence-free torsion in the G2 case. Case. Your functional had a background metric here. I met this for right, but the functional you were using was the antonomical metric. Right, yeah, okay. But here we'll keep the metric constant because we are not changing the metric. So the entry two structures here are deformed within the same metric class. Okay, so I'll stop here, and I guess I'm, well, no, I'm on time. So Thank you very much. Tervile theory. Well, actually, there is a notion of curvature which I haven't defined in this talk, but so that would actually be similar to a projection of the full curvature of the connection. Of the connection to your particular piece. But you see, the issue here is that this whole theory is not topological, right? It's because it all depends on these sections. So while they may be some analogs, but probably it won't give any topological information. Could you go back to your previous slide? Back to your previous slide. This one? Yeah. So this needs to be Sobolov norm? Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. So this is the KP Sobolov norm. So if you want to work with Hilbert spaces, then here, so this would need to be a W42 norm here. So in this condition. So you've got to forward the derivatives. Go up to four derivatives. The covariant divergence, is that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, is that the question? Yeah, that's a question. Yes, you understand. So, the problem you are studying in the case of G2 is you fix a mentor and you as well there exist a G2 structure and has finalized the structure. Right, yes, exactly. So, that's uh so here is the When you just modify the unit spinner, which defines the GT structure, the metric stays unchanged in this case. We're trying to find the best GT structure within a given metric class. Yes, yes. Do you think that there will be other situations where this framework concept will be useful instead? Well, yeah, that's a good question. I would hope so. So, but of course, this is the nicest example, but one of the examples of loops that I had earlier was the symmetric matrices that would be more difficult, but maybe that example could be. Could be taken further, and one could see what happens if you consider bundles in that. Journal algebra will be a good context to a journal algebra. Possibly. Yes, I haven't looked at that, but maybe. I think we'll take one last question because we haven't talked to John. So uh yeah, I I have lots of conceptual questions, but one but a more like concrete question I have is can you tell us what the P bracket is on the imaginary? The p-bracket is on the imaginary Octonians. Oh, yes. So, yeah, that's okay. So, the bracket would be basically the bracket on the matching of Tonians is defined by the three-form phi. So, you take your phi, you put in two vectors, and you raise the index, you get another vector. But to get a bit different version, But to get to be different versions of it, basically you would need to modify your phi and just take different phi with respect to different defining sections, so to speak, right? And then work out the corresponding cross product. So it's basically the cross product, but with respect to different three forms. Okay, yeah, thanks. Okay, yeah, thanks. All right. Let's save any further questions for quite a break. Thank you. So let's have a short break before we go next. No, no, but I think lots of people need to go somewhere. Sega, I was wondering based on Yilke's question. So the setup where this is useful here is for S7, which is G2. And usually when you have a G structure, it's parametrized by an homogeneous space with isotropy that fixes that on that G structure. And I was wondering if homogeneous spaces are examples of loops. Annually by the way. Now one because that would be a natural setting we have to generalize. Exactly, exactly. So in fact, as you may have noticed today, here I didn't use left loop decision anyway. I really only used right, right? So I don't even need the full loop structure. I only need a right loop structure. And in fact, if you have face.      Thank you very much for the introduction, Jesse, and thank you very much for everyone to put here. Everyone to come here. It's very nice to see all of these familiar faces. Okay, so I'm going to start talking about D2Stant also, but Daniel has already had a nice background on DHVSTOS, so I'm going to be able to go a bit more quickly through this part. So as he already said, I did to structure Pi is a free form which is pointwise linearly identified. With some standard associated form over R7 denoted by Phi Zero. Once we have a digital structure, fine. have a digital structure, phi, then we can define a metric depending on phi as well as a volume form. And with both of them we can define a hot star operator. Then we denote by psi which is known as the cross-sociative form to be the hot star operator of phi. And this would depend on phi on a very non-linear way. Now we have different types of choices. Now we have different types of situation structures depending on which of the associated form phi and psi are closed or not. So we say that a situation structure is closed if d of phi is equal to zero. And we will say that it's co-closed if the of psi is equal to zero. Now as you already know if both of them are true then the tissue structure is torsion free. Tossian-free. And if we have a manifold with a torsion-free tissue structure, then this would be what's known as a titu manifold. Hence, the holonomy would be contained in the exceptional degroup tissue. And I also want to mention the nearly Kaler dicho structures, as Jesse also mentioned them yesterday, which have neophony. Neofra. Near the parallel, near the parallel equal to lambda psi. However, during this talk I'm going to be focusing on cochlear tissue structures. I will be explaining a little bit about why later. So, from now on, I is going to be a co-close detroit. Going to be a co-close detro structure, and we will consider P, which is a principal G-bandal over M, which is a seven-dimensional manifold. Then we define digital instantons as connections. On B such that the curvature with the cosmosity form is equal to zero. Or equivalently, if F A, which with psi, is equal to minus the hot star of F A. Daniel already told us a couple of reasons to be interested in digital instantons. D2 instantons, but I want to make a few more remarks. So, the first remark is that we do need to ask for the digital structure to be co-closed. However, we do not need it to be closed. And the reason why it has to be co-close is because if not, the D-Trinston Ton equation would be over-determined. Other remark that I wanted to make is that on a compact G2 manifold Due to instant terms are absolute minimizers of the young male's energy functional on the space of clinic energy connections on people. On P. So, this is very similar to the picture that happens in four dimensions. So, as Daniel already said, one reason to be interested in detail instantons is the Donaldson-Thomas program. So, as Donaldson was able to construct invariants to G of four manifolds using LPSF-dual connections, then there is a hope of using G2 instatons to find some deformation invariant over. Some deformation invariant over compact D2 magopoles. However, my main motivation to be interested in D2 instantones is actually something different, which is related to the talk that Meghan gave yesterday, which is the heterotic D2 system. I'm not going to give the definition again because Mario already said it much better than I could have. But the important thing is that in But the important thing is that in this system, a G2 instant naturally appears, and this is over a manifold with a G2 structure that, after a conformal transformation, we can assume it to be co-closed. However, in the case that this is apart from co-closed, also total free, then the main equation of the system, which is the heterotic bayank identity, is not as interesting. So this is why I'm going to be focusing indigenous structures that are only conclusion. Um now let me introduce some examples of teaching instances that are relevant for the rest of the talk. So, first of all, over Brian-Salomon metric on the manifold R4 times the street, this is from 89. Clark 2014 found a one-parameter family of G2 instantons. Now, this family was later generalized by Lottegal Oliveida in 2018, where they studied both SU2 cube invariant and SU2 squared times U1 invariant these two instantas. G2 instant acts, and these were over both this manifold with the variance of one object, but also over some other G2 metrics, like the B G G1, standing for Vancouver, Gomez, Gux and Pukov, which is a particular example of a bigger family of G2 metrics, which is known as the B7FAS. So, over these metrics, and also over other metrics on manifolds that are not necessarily this one. Are not necessarily this one, they were able to find existence, non-existence, and classification results. Their work was later complemented by Stella and Turner very recently. And this was also over the Bryant-Salam metric. And they were able to find one more one-parameter family of instantrons. Just filling a case that was left over in the Tean Olive study. Now, there is other recent, very important family of digitometries, which is the one by Foscolo, Haskins and Nostrom in 2021. And in this paper, they were able to construct actually not one but infinitely many new one-parameter families of complete digital metrics, which are. metrics which are asymptotically conically local. Asymptotic yet and these were all SU2 squared times C1 empire. Now over the asymptotically conical limit of one of these families known as the C7 family Matthias Nostroman Turner Found another one-parameter family of G2 instant logs, this family being non-explicit. Now, there is something that all of these examples have in common, which are that the manifold have a commodity-bought structure. Hence, it is natural to Structure. Hence, it is natural to continue exploring homogeneity and symmetries to find new examples of G2 instantons. However, all of these also have G2 metrics, so the G2 structures are torsion-free, not only co-closed. Hence, what I was trying to do is try to use homogeneity one techniques, but now relax the condition of the G2 structure being torsion-free to only being co-closed. And other thing from these examples is that all of the From these examples, is that all of the manifolds are non-compact. By relaxing the condition from torsion free to close, then we are going to be able to look for G2 instantons in manifolds that are compact as well and find some new examples. Yes, you have this nice table here. Just a question. The gauge group is the same and also? Yes, it's SD2. And you will stick with that group? Yes. Are there results known for other gauge groups? Sorry? Are there big results known for other gauge groups, like larger gauge groups? So in this manifold, no, in other cases. We don't have a bad example with the manifolds. I have two one-parameter channels with SU3 and I have some examples with SC2 bus. I suppose I'm twister connected so that you could oh no, I don't know. I'll start. With our stories. But they're not co-homogeneous. I mean, they're not complex. As I mentioned, homogeneity and manifolds, I'm going to have a short progression to define homogeneity one manifold syndrome for anyone that's not familiar with them. You remember it's 180, the true? Yes, this is Brown Coober, Domis, Kooser, and Bookoff. So definition, a manifold S is of commodity one. If there is an action, If there is an action by symmetries of a compact signal with a generic orbit of codimension one. Then, if we have a manifold which is homogeneity one, and if we further assume that the fundamental group is finite, then if we consider the projection onto the orbit space M1G, this is going to be isomorphic to some closed interval in case the manifold is compact or if the manifold is non-compact. Or, if the manifold is non-compact, but it's also not just a product space, then this is going to be an interval of this form. Then, we denote by principal orbits to be the inverse images of the interval points of these intervals, while the singular orbits would be the inverse images of the boundary points of these intervals. Hence, for a non-compact homogeneity one manifold, then we would have one singular orbit, while for a compact one we would have two different. Compact one would have two different singular orbits. If we denote by m prince to be the union of all principal orbits, then this is actually isomorphic to the interior of this interval times a generic principal orbit that we can write it down as G mod K, where K is the principal isotropic group. And this is actually going to be a denser group of the manifold M. Hence, when we're working with components, Hence, when we're working with commogenity one manifolds, it is natural to first work out what are the structures on the principal part of the manifold, and then we can extend them to the whole manifold, to the similar orbits. However, for this extension to be done in a smooth way, there is some extra conditions that we need to check that follow from our work by Estimur and Wang that tells us in general how to extend attention smoothly to the singular outputs. What category is that isomorphism? What category is that isomorphism in? Sure? Isomorphism. In what sense? Uh, we can write the an isomorphism. I don't know what isomorphism means. Do you mean scale? Okay, is the principle. Okay, so. Okay, so when we have a homogeneity to one manifold, we can also describe it in terms of the group acting together with the isotopy groups. That for a compact case, there will be three of them, two singular and one principal, and for the non-compact one, one singular and one principle. The manifolds that we're going to be considering through the rest of the talk are the Brand-Salomon manifold, R4 times S3, which has a group diagram given by the acting group of SU2 squared. Group of SU2 squared. It has a single isotropic group which is SU2 and is diagonally embedded into the acting group. And then trivial principal isotropic group. I'm also going to be considering a compact homogeneity 1 manifold, which is S4 times S3. And this one has a very similar homogeneity 1 structure, but now with two similar sotopic groups instead of one. Now the reason why I'm interested in these two manifolds in particular is because last year I was able to construct a big family of cochlos tissue structure over both of them. So the natural question was to ask either any examples of tissue instatons on these manifolds with these structures, which is what we're going to talk about next.  So, what the theorem says is the following on these two manifolds with these previous model structures there is funny. There is a funny of SC2 square invariant to close the two structures which is given by three smooth functions Also, positive that we denote a1, a2, and a3, and they go from our interval, which can be either 0 infinity for our quotaxis 3, or 0, 1, together with certain boundary conditions. Around a similar orbit or orbits and an oscilloparameter BCK and moreover any such structure Structure which is constructed from a hand-flight SO2 structure. It seems like So as you can see, there is a lot of these extra structures and they would be given by the beta of these functions to be zero. And as I mentioned, there are some boundary conditions which say that if we have a singular orbit at t equals zero, then the af functions need to have a full radio expansion on this way. So they look like t halves plus some higher order some t and also Orders on t, and also it has to be odd. And similarly, if there is another singular orbit that t equals one, then we will need to have the equivalent conditions around this other singular orbit. One of the things that the proof of this theorem uses is a fact that was initially quoted by Schulte Hedenberg in his PhD thesis and also later by Maxim and Salaman. It says that a generic square inverted. A C2 square in button. Al flat SU3 structure. All the principal orbits of this manifold, that they all look like S3 times S3, is given by six smooth functions. Six smooth functions Ai, A1, A2 and A3, and B1, B2, and B3, also with this integrals of definition. The A ones that appear here are the ones that are going to appear ultimately in the theorem. And then there is these other three functions appearing, B1, B2, and B3. That what this theorem shows is that they are actually depending on the data of the AI function. Depending on the data of the AI functions. And also to check the extension of the singular orbit, there would be some boundary conditions on A's and B's. The A's are already imposed on the conditions of the theorem and the ones of the B's are automatically satisfied. This is other of the things that are shown in the proof of this theorem. So what's half flat? Half flat is that if we have an SU3 structure given by the two-form omega, then some free form that we can write it down as the sum. That we can write it down as the sum of the imaginary and the real part, then d omega squared is zero and also d omega one. So the thing is that we can write down all of our structure in terms of these six small functions. And then for example, the metric on the principal part of the manifold times So we can write down the metric as Q squared plus Where ethers are just some dual basis on the principal bundle. Hence, we can interpret the functions ABs as deformations of the conical metric. So these are all co-closed and the only conditions on the A's are that the boundary conditions, there's no. Also smooth positive. Yeah, but there's no differential equation you have to satisfy. So then if you can, for this family, if you put the rest of the torsion, then you presumably get differential equations on the A's for the other two torsion components. Is there any, we need to check? Is there any way to get solutions there? Yes. So, for example, Yes, so for example, some of the examples that I mentioned before happen when you introduce these conditions and also what would be the co-close equations. So what I'm trying to say is that a particular case of this family of co-chlosed feature structures are the known examples of S3. Yes. And probably on S4 times S3, you can't make it. In this case, no, there is no example of that. Can you kill one of the other two torsions, maybe? Yes. Yes, actually, tau zero is equal to zero. So, these are the structures that we're going to work with. Now, let's move on to the problem of finding the d2 instantons. So, the setup of the problem is the following: as I said before, the gate work is whenever we exit two. Just because it's the simplest non-ABN case. And we will work in a temporal gauge, which means that we're going to look for connections that are equal to a one-parameter family of connections on the principal orbits. Now we have to say what are the bundles that we're going to be using. And if we have a homogeneous orbit, which is a situation where some group k, then Some group K, then the principal bundles over this homogeneous orbit are in correspondence with isotropy homomorphisms for the goal from K into the gauge group, etc. Hence, over the principal orbits, as K is trivial, there is only the trivial principal value. And for a singular orbit, then we have two different choices of isotropy momorphism, because there is two ways of writing an isomorphism from AC two to SC two. From SE2 to SE2, being the trivial isomorphism and the identity isomorphism. Hence, over a singular orbit, we have two choices of bundles. Sorry, can you say that again? Yes, so there is a correspondence between precipitate bundles over an orbit, an homogeneous orbit, with isotope amomorphisms that go for the group K. In the case of the singular orbits, this is equal to SC2. So because there is two choices of isomorphism from SC2 to SC2, there is two choices of basic isomorphism. Homomorphism, yes. Homomorphism. That's what Q2 is. So all two choices of bundle are P1 given by the trivial number. By the trivial homomorphism and the identity. So, if you wanted to generalize this to other SUN gauge groups, for instance, you would basically have to do some more combinatorics into all the possible languages. I think so, yeah. And then you would be able to provide it. So, there is this second order. So there is this second order principal bundle using the identical membranes. As for the case of R4 times S3, we only have one similar orbit, there will be a total of two choices of bundle coming from the choice of bundle over the similar orbit. So this is S4. R4 times S3. Now on S4 times S3, we have to make a choice in each of the two singular orbits. So at the end, we will have three. orbit so at the end we will have three possible choices of bundle coming from taking two trivial bundles one trivial and one identity and two identity these bundles are defined with a single order? Yes. Yes. Well, yeah, this is the definition of the singular orbit, and then this is just the construction by taking the relevant bundle over each of the singular orbits and then the trivial one over the singular orbits. And finally, we're going to introduce an extra condition. We're going to introduce an extra condition, which is that we will focus on the case where there is an extra symmetry, an extra AC2 symmetry. And what this means is that in our data of the A functions, we're going to pick all of them to be equal. Gonna pick all of them to be equal. Now, if we make this assumption, then we can also find that the b functions will have to be the same. And this is actually an explicit expression. And this is one. And this is something that in the general situation where the A's are different, we don't have. So our previous theorem says that they exist, some B's satisfying all the relevant conditions, but they're not necessarily explicit. However, in this case where there is this extra ST2 symmetry, then they are. Okay, I start. So you mean that in the choice of the three functions AI, which basically AI, which basically defines your metric. You have the freedom to choose them equal. And what are these now? So, this is an explicit expression. It depends on A. It's a particular solution. It's the only solution for these A functions, and then the parameter is 0. It depends on A1, and there's an explicit formula. Although I'm not copying it here because it's actually kind of complicated. But it's good to have an explicit. Yeah, it's good to have an explicit expression because then we will also have explicit expressions in some cases for the async ones. Not only the A states of BC. You can write every structure in terms of the A dental B functions. Is that the sizes of the two SEGs? Is that the sizes of the two SE2s and SE2 square? You also answered my question. I wanted to make it differently on A. More questions? Okay. Okay, so then we clarify the first proposition, which says that if we have theta the answer should be Quantum connection with the HBO. Then, up to an equivariant gauge transformation we can write we can write it as the following. The I's are the standard basis of the VR developed SV2, and then X and Y, oh, and the etas are the same basis that we had before, and X Y. And xy are smooth functions satisfying the following system of audience Maybe you can exaggerate the dots. So this is the system that we filed. Yes, also. However, this system turns out to be very difficult to solve, first of all because it's non-autonomous, and second because there are some singularities in the singular points. So from the expressions that we have from A and B, we do know that these terms are of the order. Terms are of the order 1 over t. Sorry? How does SU cubed act on SU2? Can you comment us what that action is? Is it SU cubed or SU? No, they're SUQ invariant because apart from the action of SU2 squared, then we have this X by SU2 symmetry. So we can write it down for our manifolds, a different common unit, one structure if we want where the group acting is SU2 cube. So we have this singular initial value problem, but we do know a theorem that tells us a way of finding solutions of singular initial value problems in a neighborhood around the singular points. This theorem was originally due to Mal Grant, but there is also a nice reformulation by Foss Colar Haskins in 2017. However, this theorem only gives us short-time existence of solutions. Then there is an additional problem of trying There is an additional problem of trying to extend these solutions to the rest of the principal part of the manifold and also to the second singular orbit in case we are with a compact example. However, before applying this theorem, we do need to specify which is the boundary that we're working on around this singular point. So let's first consider the case of P1. I'm confused. The proposition I'm confused that the proposition this is not to have it uh instant i mean it's just what it what it is okay it is basically and data is what sort of object it's a it's a can you explain to me what sort of object data is and where does data live data what kind of object is data data is the collection is the or detached so it's a one form on a bundle or it's or it's where is data Where is theta? In terms of what you've written, like TI, tensor, eta i, where are the eta? This is the tensor basis of any alibi. There's one more question from the chat. Which is that Derek Harland in the chat asks, should the proposition say instant time rather than connection? Yes. That's fine. Yeah, these are the equations that make it to be a teacher. Make it to be a d choice. Little SO2 valued where? So these are the SO2 values. This is the basis of the one space, and this is just the small function. So these are one things on SU2. So the idea is being pulled back to SU2. So we're not really working on the bundle, we're pulling back to SU2. So those things are defined on the whole manifold. Oh, eta I. Find on the whole manifold are eta i plus eta i minus. There's very different SU2s in the picture. SO2 there's the Lie, the Ts and the Lie algebra of the gauge group, and then the eta i is like i is the Lie group. So, coming from Simple 1 equals, there would be a conditions for the extension of our functions x and y up to the singular orbit of the bundle P1. We can introduce this in the We can introduce this in the conditions of this theorem by Melgrange of Foscolar-Haskins to see when we have existence and also uniqueness of solutions around a singular point. But as this is an existence and unique solute, the uniqueness is key because we can observe that if we take y equal to zero, then we can find a solution for the equation for x. This being some function f. So f being So f being this minus x squared and because of this have an explicit solution, we would get the following connection. So we can be e to the what? E to the integral from some parameter one and a half to t and this is the function f and then in the denominator we have the same but also an extra integer. So we find out that these are solutions of this proposition. And as we have an explicit expression, we can check that this is well defined over the whole manifold r4 times the street. So in this case, we are able to find that extension outside of this neighborhood of the singular orbit when x1 is possible. Positive positive positive. So we can write down a first theorem that says that on there is an explicit. And this is explicit because, as I mentioned, the B's and the A's are explicit, essentially. which is given by this expression and in particular if we take x1 equals to 0 this is just a trivial flat instance. The trivial flat instance. Our remark is that if we particularize this for the total free PG2 metrics, the Brian-Salmon one, which corresponds to taking values of L1 equal to make sure that I get that correct. Or T is, or R is implicitly defined, is going to be 0, 1 over square root of 3. And then we get our cognitive digital structures will be the variance aluminum. Interesture and clock system types. Is that a classification? Is it a classification? Yes, in this case, that's all of them. And the same as happens with the situation instantons. It's that they would bubble up. Instantons is that they would bubble off an anti-second connection over the singular object, which is an associated submanifold. So, more technically, what this means is that if we have a parameter lambda, then we can construct a succession of deltas which are positive and go to zero when x1 goes to infinity, such that if for a point such that if for a point in the singular orbit S3, we define a rescaling on the unit bone in R42. We model for you standard space with any following. Then, if we take the pullback by this of our connections, then this converges uniformly to the basic anti-self-dual instanton with parameter lambda, which is the following thing. This is what we know as the boundary behavior. Let me try to draw a picture of the situation. So we have on manifold here, and then we have a singular orbit, which all of the singular orbits are isomorphic to S3, and this is an associative. Then, if we pick a point and consider the tangent space to S3. And we pull back the instantons from the seven-dimensional manifold to the four-dimensional one, and also do this rescaling. Then, when we take the limit from x1 goes to infinity, this will end up giving us the anti-self dual instant time. And this is the same that happens in the In the card, the JSONs. What is the four-dimensional space? Like a normal panel to expand. So this is what happens for R4 times S3 now on S4 times S3. Things get more complicated because then we would need to check what happens around the second singular orbit. We can start by doing the same thing around the singular orbit at t equals zero and for the bundle p1 you would also have the same explicit expression. Have the same explicit expression. We can also denote it to theta of x1. And then we can extend it to the principal part. However, when we are looking to see if this extends to the other singular orbit, we found out that there are some regularity issues. So what we get is that on the bundle E11, there is only one instance. One instant one, the trivial one, which corresponds to x1 equal to zero. And on a bundle that is trivial around one singular orbit and the identity around the other, there is a one parameter. Two is the terms beta x1, where now x1 goes from 0 non-included to infinity, which is smooth around the one single. Around the one single object, but not exactly smooth about the other one. And at t equals one, this has C one regularity. So although we were not able to prove smoothness, then we have some certain regularity conditions, and in particular, the curvature happens to be bounded, so things do not get too crazy. And yes, we were able to look what's happening because we've got this explicit expression, which is the same. This expression, which is the same that we got in the other case. Now let's move on to the other situation. Now let's move on to the other situation where we have the identity bundle. So first of all, if we start with the case of R4 times S3, then we can once again use this theorem by Malgrange to find out one parameter value of the two instant poles. Did you enter the public? Inner neighborhood of t equals zero. We can denote this y theta y zero and y zero is in R. Is in R. And we notice that of this family there are two flat instantons, which in this notation are theta of one over minus one over V zero and theta one over V zero and also a non-flat. Excuses which corresponds to y0 equals zero and is given by the following expression. This expression is very similar to the one that we had before because it's basically obtained with taking the parameter x1, what you've been thinking. However, to find out if we can extend the rest of the elements of this function. The elements of this family outside of the neighborhood of the singular orbit, we cannot do as we did before, which was using the fact that we have an explicit expression to extend this. So we have to use other different kind of arguments. One thing that we can do for the case of R4 times the strict is use forward invariance of sets. And we do find that for some parameters of this family, then we can extend the instantons.  We have y zero and y zero only in the sub interval, which is not all of the possibilities that we have in a neighborhood of the singular orbit. So, a first remark about this is that if we once again particularize for the case of the Bryan-Salamon metric, Our instantone eta y0 is the one of the instantons found out by Los Dela Oliveira. They denote indeed a limit, because it's the limit when taking x1 to infinity, and the instant terms theta of y0 with y0 in this integral from different from 0. This corresponds to one parameter family. Of stain alternative. Another observation that I wanted to make is that before it was a classification result, right now it is not, or at least not for the moment. This is still a work in progress. So for the other parameters of y0 that are not in this interval, I still do. Are not in this interval. I still don't know if it is possible to extend these instruments. This should be a question for the future. So, this is the picture on R4 times S3, but then once again, things will get increasingly more complicated when we move on to S4 times S3. In this case, we do not even know how the instant tons look like, so we do need to check the conditions around the singular orbit, but we do not know what are our instant tons. So, this ended up to be the most difficult part of the problem. One thing that I was able to check was even though we don't know the expression, I was able to bound any other instaton where y0 is integral by using two of the non-solutions. So I just erased it, but we. So I just erased it, but we know that there is these explicit instant terms, it has zero and each plug ones. And we find that any other in this interval has to be bounded by these two. So one thing that I was able to show is that there is a continuous extension of these instantons up to the other singular orbit. This is really bound for With the bundle identity around two similar orbits. I'm not writing this down, but this is obviously SE2 cube invariant. I'm going to go SC2 if advice to WCDO with device to dot now in CDOT which is not outside the simular orbit at G one And has a continuous stage. This is other thing with there's still some questions that arises, which is we know that there is C0 regularity, but we don't know if there might be higher regularity, for example C1, or maybe if we can identify. Example C1, or maybe we can even find that under some circumstances they are actually going to be smooth. But knowing that at least we can continue to extend them is a really good news. And let me finish with a picture of what are the families that we have constructed. So first of all, we have this explicit one-parameter family, theta of x1, that when x1 goes to 0, this is the trivial one. And then if we take the limit x. And then, if we take the limit x1 goes to infinity, then this is theta of 0. And this is a member of the other one-parameter family, theta of y0, that finishes in these two flat instantons, 1 over V0 and minus 1 over V0. And there is actually a correspondence between these two sides of the picture just by showing. The picture just by swapping the two numbers of SC2 squared. And on R4 times S3, these are over the bundle P1 and this jumps to the bundle PID. While for S4xS3, this one is in the bundle P11. These are in P1ID and this one is And these one just the idea. So these are the examples of the two instantons in these two manifolds. Questions? So if I remember correctly, you said that in the compliant case, if it's cold closed, then the system stands are absolute minimizers of the angle of energy. This is when the manifold is a teacher. Can you actually calculate the angle of energy for these examples here? Can you explicitly compute? I haven't tried. Because it could be the case. It's just not automatic. It's just not automatic. So if the G2 structure is not closed, instantons could still be getting milled. Or they're getting milled, but they may have been minimized. They need not be minimized if there are counter-examples. Precisely. So it is an interesting question. But the answer is not automatically either yes or no. It needs to be checked. So it would be great. Great. The thing is that, so especially in the identity bundle, the things are non-explicit, so it's very complicated to actually compute things or know what's happening. In this other case, where the things in the trivial bundle, when we have explicit expressions, then we can do computations like, for example, the curvature. But in this part of the picture, right now, I find it very difficult to compute things like, for example, the jungle scratch. A good format check if you're in some tongue news at least. Mention tongue Zayn knows at least. Are they hearing that? No, not necessary. Not necessary. Jason's saying no. Well, I say not necessarily. Not necessarily. Are there more questions? Yeah, good questions. Yeah, a question. Sorry? Reference. So this is still not an archive. Hopefully it will be soon. But well, the theorem that I mentioned before about the existence of conclusive structure structure, this is already an archive. If you look for my name, then If you look for my name, then you will find it. This next part is not yet. If you are interested, I can send you an email when it's ready. We'll be happy to get that. Oh, yeah. A question online from Derek Farland. He asks, could these methods also be applied to the round seven sphere? I think so. Did you try to check whether this sort of geo systemic recovery? I haven't yet, but it's on the list of G20s. Okay, that was quick. Another question? Yeah, yeah. Well, I was just wondering, maybe this is a little unrelated, but what people use these half-flat SC3 structures for or why they're important. I mean, in this case, they were. I mean in this case they were key because they were able to using them we were able to write down everything in terms of these smooth functions but I don't know if in any other situation are important in other samples. Thank you. Because if you have an upper surface in a Google manifold you get the necessary structure that it's all plotted as well. So it always exists in any upper surface in a chip manifold. Yeah. And there's this thing called the titching flow if you start from the half fractus. Follow? If you start from the half-factory structure, it's real analytic. You're always thinking about the intuition. I think that's what I'm studying. I don't know if I'm sure that's a good idea. All right, let's have the coffee break and thank you for silent.                                      Yeah, I think something else.  Okay, so um let's continue with the final talk in this morning's session. Very pleased to have um Protocol Powder. Have Gudar Powder from Unicamp, who is going to tell us about the harmonic flow of SP2-SP1 structures on 8-vanes. Thanks, Jason, for the introduction. I'd like to thank the organizers for presentation to do this talk in Panama. Okay, can everyone hear me at the back? Am I loud enough? Cool. Okay. Great. So I want to talk about the harmonic flow of SP2S1 structures on. On structures on eight manifolds. So, I mean, this is the conference about sort of G2 and spin 7. So, you might be wondering why is there SP2 SP1 here and not G2 and Spin 7? So, I'll try to make the case that if you do replace it by one of these groups, the same thing is more or I'll explain what the words in the title mean as I go on. But for the time being, let me tell you sort of what is You, sort of, what is this talk really about? So, oh, the thing is a bit off. There we go. So, first thing, what should you think of when you see the word SP2S1 structure? So, you should think of a cousin of spin salon structure. So, well, you know, like a spin silent structure in 8 manifold is given by the data of a four form, an abstract special four form that will in turn give you a metric and an orientation. So, you should think of a spin. So, you should think of a speaker as one structure as makes something very similar. And the second sort of keyword keeps getting off, I don't know why. That should work. You're hired. You're fired. You'll fire. Thanks, Bio. So the second sort of keyword in the title is harmonic. So we've heard all sort of notions of harmonic. But in this talk, what a harmonic structure is, is something very similar, very sort of closely related to the notion of harmonic maps. So classically, what is a harmonic map? A harmonic map is Harmonic map. The harmonic map is a sort of map between two Riemannian manifolds, and it is called harmonic if it is a critical point of some energy-type functional. So, in this talk, these harmonic SP2S1 structures are going to be likewise some critical points of some energy-type functional. So, this is what this talk is about. And there's a word flow in the title of this flow, and so it is the title of this talk. So, I'm going to be giving you a way of how to flow these structures to find. These structures define harmonic ones. I'm going to be more precise later on. But the plan for this talk is first to give you some background on general what does it mean to be a harmonic H structure. Then I'll discuss the case when H is SP2, SP1 in more detail. I'll discuss some results about the flow. And at the end, I'm going to discuss some very sort of concrete examples. So to make you kind of see that it's not just an abstract computation, like you can actually use it to compute stuff. It do the compute stuff, okay? So, where does SP2SP1 come from? Well, it comes from Vegas classification of Holmani Grove. So, you guys are probably all familiar with Vegas classification. So, you have KLA manifold, Clabria, HyperKeller, Quaternary Keller, G2N Spin7, our favorite ones. So, the SP2 SP1 bit really comes from this Quaternary Keller case here, which occurs in every sort of dimension multiple of 4, where, well, we start from 8, let's not look at the case. Let's not look at the case n is equal to 1. And so, what is the relation between sort of G2 and spin 7? Well, G2 and spin 7 manifolds are sort of Riemannian manifolds where your tangent space is modeled to look like the Octonians. So in the G2 case, it's the imaginary Octonians, whereas in the spin-7 case, the full Octonians. By contrast, Coton-Kiloman force are modeled on the Cotonians instead. Okay, this card is done. Cool. Cool. So, what you need to know is that aside from the first case, with manifold scalar, all the manifolds arising in this list are in fact anxiety manifold, so which is proportional to the metric. And all of them are rich, but aside from the cotton killer case, the cotton killer one is a bit odd in this list in the sense that they could be positive scalar curvature or negative one. And in the problem, sort of the classical problem in sort of special homomy is sort of to find uh manifolds with homomy group contained in one of these lists. Contained in one of these lists. This is what the business is about. And the problem is that it is generally very hard to find. Gopher. Can you think of this SP2, SP1 case as being like choosing a reduction from like a reduction of structure where I choose a way to take O and write it as H2? Is that like, is there any like way to going from O to H2? Spin 7 to SP2. Maybe I say something a bit like. May maybe I say something a bit later about that? Sure. I mean, the differential of algebra, but maybe I'll say maybe not. Okay, cool. Okay, so in all of this setup, you would like to find a correctly constant tensor, usually a differential form. But the problem is that it's an over-determined system, it's very hard, and you even have sort of topological abstraction. For instance, if you don't have some vanishing cohort class, you know that you might cannot admit a torsion-free guide. So this eventually sort of leads you to look for weaker notions. For instance, in the GT case, you look for closed. Weaker notion, for instance, the GT case, you look for close, co-close, you might sort of constrain the intrinsic torsion in various ways. And in this talk, it is one of these sort of weaker notions. And the notion I'm going to be interested in is that of harmonic H structures. Sometimes these are also called isometric guys. So what is it? What is the harmonic edge structure? So here's a setup. Go for it. The harmonic structures are the best among the certain isomorphic. Among a certain isometric class. They're not isometric. It's a claim by Henry Kayla. No. They are a way to choose someone within an isometric class. But I'm going to say harmonic and isometric. Yeah, he's objecting to your last sentence on the previous slide that you're saying there are also coloursometric structures. Well, I mean, you say isometric, you say harmonic, so you guys sort of... No, no, both of you guys had papers with one with title isometric flows, one with harmonic flows, so. Flows, one with harmonic flows, so it's not up to me. I just want to say that if you look for papers and you see harmonic structures or isometric structures, they're both the same. No, they're not. No, harmonic is the special case of isometric. It's just the best one. Oh, okay. If you go back one slide, just real quick. The very last thing you said, the AKA, should probably not be there. Or if it is, it should say the best among isometrics. Okay, okay, fair enough. Okay, okay, fair enough. Okay. Okay, fair enough. It's fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Okay. Yeah, no, no, it's not asymmetric structure yet. Yeah, I get your point. Yeah, sure. Asymmetric structure is probably okay. Okay, yeah, it's fine. Anyway, so what's our setup? So the setup is as follows. Suppose I give you a reminder in my fall, ng. The metric is going to be fixed. And let's suppose that your mindfall admit an H structure, which is compatible with. An H structure which is compatible with a metric. So that means, so concretely speaking, suppose you had a metric on a sort of seven manifold and you had a G2 structures that induced that metric, you could find sort of this is the sort of statement I'm saying here. Now, let's suppose you had one of these guys, you had one sort of tensor psi, which is compatible with your metric, there's a sort of gauge group acting on that guy, which gives you different tensor psi, which again induces the same metric. So a very sort of simple and concrete example. So, a very sort of simple and concrete example to keep in mind is: suppose I gave you a manifold with an almost Hermitian structure. So, you have a UN structure, you have a metric, you have an almost complex structure. And let's suppose that this guy has matching first-gen clause. And you say, well, can I find an n-zero form that is compatible with this data? Well, you can pick one. But the problem is that you can pick other ones. You can multiply by e to the iF for any function f, you're going to get a different n-zero form, which is also compatible with your metric. So you have different sort of UN strength. So you have different sort of UN SUN structures, which is compatible with the same sort of UN structure. Now, the problem is: well, how do you pick the best guide? So a natural answer to that question is, well, let's try to minimize this functional here. So you take the covariant derivative of your tensor, take its L2 norms, the energy functional, and you say, well, let's try to minimize this guy, and the guy that minimizes, the size that minimizes this energy functional should be the best representative. Should be the best presentative. This is a goal. Fixed size and the gauge group of the fixed. Yes, yeah. Everything's sort of compatible. That's right. And one sort of remark here is if instead of psi of being a denser, it was a map between Riemann and manifold, this will be precisely the energy functional that you use to define harmony maps. So by analogy to this, you call a critical point of this functional here a harmonic H structure. A harmonic page structure. This is what harmony, this is where the name harmony comes from. It comes from the algebra of the theory of harmonic maps. And indeed, a lot of the theorems I'm going to tell you come from sort of analogues of harmonic maps being translated to these harmonic H structures. But I should beware you that harmonic doesn't mean that the tensor here is harmonic. It's a sort of very different sort of notion of harmonicity. What is harmonic tensor mean, the Grassful class here? Yeah, I g I guess if it was a differential differential form, then you have a obvious notion, but yeah, that You have an obvious notion, but yeah, that's what I want. Because I mean, in all the cases, you have a differential form. So I want to emphasize that it does not mean that the differential form is harmonic. It's a very different notion. You are fixing the SON structure. I am fixing the SON structure. Yeah, that's right. Another thing you could do is let the xi determine the SON structure. Sure, that's what Python bit. Cool. Python bit do that, right? I mean, they do the exact same thing. Yeah, but then the problem is that working out the critical point of the structure would be a night would be much worse because the metric will also have to vary. But I mean, we're going to hear probably talks about that later on. So tomorrow. Tomorrow. There you go. Okay. So the natural question is sort of what is the critical point of this functional here? Well, aside from the trivial one, of course, there's always currently constant guys. So to tell you what these are, let me remind you of the notion of an Let me remind you of the notion of an intrinsic torsion. Whenever you have an H structure, where H is a subgroup of SON, and you take the covariant derivative of your tensor psi, which is customized as precise as this H, then its covariant deriv gives you a one-form that values in H perp, where H perp here is a complement of the holnomy algebra viewed as a sort of sub-algebra inside SOL. And this guy here, this two-form valued one-form, is known as the intrinsic torsion. So, this is always the case. And what Eric Lubo and Enrique Sai proved was that this tensor psi from before defines a harmonic H structure precisely when this intrinsic torsion T here is divergence tree. So the T of T here is zero. And so this is the number of P D's depends on the dimension of H perp here. So the weaker notions are currently constant. Now, Now, the problem with this definition here is that it's an implicitly defined guard because intrinsic notions are one form that values in the space of two forms, and I haven't told you how to compute that. So, how does one compute T in practice if you want to work out something? Well, the way you do it is you think of the intrinsic torsion as a one form that values in the space of endomorphism. I mean, it's a one form that values in the space of H per, which is a two-fold. So, this is Q-symmetric endomorphism. And you can act by this diamond operation. By this diamond operator here, which is just the standard sort of GLN action, and this is precisely what nabla psi here is. And to get the intrinsic total, you just have to invert this operator here. And then you get T, and then from this, you can compute what d here is. This is how the recipe goes. But the problem is that this inversion operator does depend on the H structure. So in principle, there's not like a general way of just defining this diamond inverse sort of operator. So you have to work it out for different H structure. Okay? Its structure. Okay, so far so good. So let me sort of give you sort of a more sort of concrete definition. I mean, like, when, for instance, I say I give you a closed due to structure of co-close one, you know precisely what that means in terms of intrinsic torsion. But if I say div t0, I mean, what in calls name does that mean concretely? So let me sort of motivate that. That's right. Let's go. Sorry. Okay. So let me sort of motivate what this means in a very sort of elementary case, the simplest case. Elementary case, the simplest case. Consider harmonic SU2 structures. Very simple. This is simplest non-trivial special harmony. So in this case, what is an SU2 structure? It's a triple of almost complex structures that behave like say mattering Paternians. Or advice you have this triple of two forms. And if you work out what the covariant derivative of this guy is, well, it has to be one form that values in hperf. And in this case, the hperb is just omega 2 and omega 3. The hmm is just omega 2 and omega 3 for omega 1, and then you get cyclic permutation of these indices. And if you do the recipe that I told you before, you find out that the intrinsic torsion, well, it's a one-form the valence orphanal complement of the Liadra, but the orphanal complement of the Liadra is, well, it happens to be another Liadra, which is the SO3 Liadra, which is a space of cell draw two form, which is precisely my Gauvana category. So what does D mean? Well, df t means that each of these one forms are co-closed. So you can just work that out. But if you just stare at what I've written down for you, you're going to realize that what is t? Well, t is just the induced Levi-Shift connection on the space of self-joint two form. Because it's precisely what, how you define that guy. So the condition that d here is zero is simply the statement that the induced left-shift deconnection on the space of self-joint two form is in fact in Coulomb gauge reversed. Is in fact in Coulomb gauge with respect to the trivialization given by Omega 1 and Omega 3. So it is saying, let's pick the best trivialization of that space so that your connection is in coulom gauge. So that's a statement. This is what Sergei has been telling us. Exactly. Exactly. So he was talking about this higher dimensionalization question. So here's a non-trivial example of a harmonic SV2 structure, which is not torsion. Harmonic SV2 structure, which is not torsion-free. So you could pick, you could think of the half-surface, it's S3 cross S1. You can pick the standard sort of left-in variant structure on this guy, which was the hyper-complex one. And you can check that indeed it will satisfy this condition that df d here is zero. But it is obviously, it's not hypercaler, right? All the hypercaler compact guys are flat torus or K-free, you know, that Daniel. So go for it. If you take D of omega high, is it just AI wage omega high? Is that these the leaf forms of this of these? At least the leaf forms of these selective forms? If you take D of this guy? D of one of the omegas. Yes. Like D of omega 1, is it just A1 wedge of omega 1? No, it's going to be... Oh, in this case. Change the tensor products by wedge. Yeah, in this case, yeah, you just replace the tensor by a wedge, and that's how you get it. It's not the same thing, okay. Yeah. Another question. Go for it. So in terms of rehabilitation in this dimension, this is what? In this dimension, this is what I wanted corresponds to what it does. This guy here? No, no, this is an example. Yeah, like second order, second order condition, not a threshold. It's not a special definition. It's not a special torsion. I'm not restricting the torsion to like in a special sort of space. It's not like that. It's a very sort of trap. I'm just sort of minimizing the energy of the intrinsic torsion. Yeah, so it's not necessarily killing part of the intrinsic torsion in principle. Yeah. In principle. Yeah. What is this harmonic basic infrastructure on extra as well? On this guy? Yeah. It's just a hyper complex one, the standard left-in variant guy. Okay, cool. And of course, Sergei has been telling us about the sort of that the same thing should be true in the G2 case. You can think of the intrinsic torsion. Well, the one form that values, well, not in the Lie algebra, but in this loop, whatever. Loops, whatever that is. But the moral of the story somehow is that whenever you should pick up harmonic structure, you should pick up something as being in column gate. It's somehow in the best representative. That's sort of the moral of the story, concretely what you should pick up. Okay, so we are interested today in SP2 SP1 structure, so let me define that because I mean people here are probably familiar with V2 Spincer, but not this guy. So a convenient way to to do that is to start with an S S P to structure. is to start with an sp2 structure. So an sp2 structure is just like an sp1 structure, but in four dimensions higher up. So you have the metric and you have your again a triple of almost complex structure, J1, J2, J3, which satisfies the imaginary quaternions multiplication rule. And okay, some eight manifold now. And one very convenient way of defining the spin seven structure group is to define a four form, which is defined by the sum of the square of two of this guy, but you take minus of one of the. Of this guy, but you take minus of one of the other guy. And the stablata of this four form is precisely spin seven. Okay, this is a very convenient way of seeing how to kill the minus as big, special cases of spin seven. And to get to the sp2 case, sp2s one case, what you do is instead of putting a minus here, you put a plus here. You just take the average. Oh, there should be a block. It's the average of this guy here. So, in this way, you could see, like, I mean, advertly speaking. I mean, advocate speaking, they might look very similar, but this guy here gives you octonions, this guy here will give you give you sort of quaternions. So maybe that answers your sort of question of philosophical question. You can explain something that almost confuses me. So J's only exist locally. Yes, Omega exists everywhere. Yeah, that's right. Big Omega exists everywhere. The little umbrellas do not. Yep, that's right. Why is that? Yeah, why is that? Oh, why is that? Why is that? Why did they not even? Why is this thing just globally? Because if you change frames, it's independent of. Yeah, it's kind of saying you have a bundle, the trivialization of the bundles, the bundle is not trivial, basically. So this guy is precisely saying that, you know, unchart stuff. But there is actually a concrete way of defining this J1, J2, J3 using omega. Okay. Uh so somehow somehow's a moral use of you. You could but use guys around and so he's this doesn't change this guy that that's why. So it's a free yeah, but I don't have a better reasons for that. Okay. So sort of some basic fact about SP2S1 structure. So if your manifold admits an SP2S1 structure, then it also always admits a spin center structure. Not necessarily related to that guy, but topologically it satisfies the same condition. It satisfies the condition to admit a spin signal structure. But the converse is not in general true. Structure, but the converse is not in general true. So, you know, like being S having an SP2S constructor is something more restrictive. And also, another contrast with the spin 7 case is that in the spin 7 case, asking that your fourth form is covariantly constant is equivalent to asking that it's closed. But this is not true in the particular case. Asking that this guy here is currently constant means that your form has to be closed, and also that the R direct ideal, this ideal differential, like determined by omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, has to be differential ideal. Omega 2, omega 3 has to be a differential ideal. So if you take d of omega 1, this has to be combinations of omega 2, omega 1, omega, and omega 3 again. Okay? So it's a different condition. And it's a non-trivial condition. There are examples where this indeed doesn't hold. You have closed guys, but the add-back ideal, not the differential ideal. It's a theorem by Swan. That's right. Yeah, that's Swan's PSG thesis. But just to be clear, SP2, SP1, and Spin Set, neither of those are subgroups of each other. Each other. No, so yeah. So I'm confused by this fact then because how do you see from the should be obvious? Are you saying that if there's an SP2SP1 structure topologically, you've satisfied the criteria needed to admit spin-up. So you would automatically say, well, you have low P these omegas and you just change the sign, because then it would be kind of a it's not no it's not it's not obvious at all. It's not obvious at all. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. This is not a natural sort of candidate to pay. Yeah. Sorry. And since we've been hearing a bit about spinners, so I should tell you, for instance, in the Kotanic case, the cell draw part of the sort of spinner bundle, the positive spinner bundle splits as a three-dimensional component and a five-dimensional component, whereas the negative bit can just be identified with the tangent bundle or the manifold, which is sort of again different from the spin-7 case. Okay, so just to sort of highlight that they're very different, but even though we're going to. That they are very different, but even though we're going to see that the harmonic theory is just going to be very, very similar. Any questions, comments? R5 and R3 are. I'm going to see what this is in a minute, maybe more precisely. It's a lot of decomposition. So it's not an irreducible bundle. The bundle splits. That's what I want to say. Okay, so let's do some simple representation theory. So in the spin 7 case, you know that spin 7 is a subgroup of SO8, so the Lya SO8, so the Lyard rub splits, so you have the space of cell dot two forms, the space of two forms, sorry, splits as a spin 7 bit and it's four form complement. And the spin 74 forms sits inside the space of four forms. And you see that H perp here, again, sits inside lambda four as well. And again, the same thing is true in the sp2 sp1 case. Again, this guy here is a subgroup of SO8. So again, you see the holomy out of sitting in here and the off-non-complex. Prostrum in here and the off-known component is over there. And again, you see this guy embeds inside the space of lambda 4, where the tensor capital omega here lives. This minus here is, and earlier I said, just a sort of comment, this lambda 4 5 minus the sort of subscript is the dimension of the space. The minus here is just to say it's an sub-dual guy. And this is precisely in the spinner representation. In the spinner representation, this is exactly this five-dimensional block here. And the R3 here can just be identified with this. Okay, so there's natural sort of isomorphism you can compute. So you can identify spinners, the point because you can identify spinners using sort of differential forms. Pretty key. Okay, so the key point of this is that H perp is always irreducible. This is what you need to make the theory work. And secondly, this also was true in the G. And secondly, this also was true in the GPN and UN case. And hparp can always be embedded in the space wherever a tensor lives. This is the sort of key criterion you need to make to theory work. Okay? Hberp is always under 215 here. Yes, under 215. Sorry. Just maybe say if it's not irreducible, one has to work harder. Yes, if H perp is not irreducible, yeah. It's not the other problem. It's not the end of the for instance. If you think of something like an sp2 structure, then each buck will split. Because you have omega 1 and gat omega 3, and then you're going to have more components as well splitting. So then you have to be more careful with the representations. But in this case, it's going to be fine. Okay, so here's a recipe for cooking up the intrinsic torsion in our case. So, well, I told you earlier how to get the intrinsic torsion. You have to inverse this time operator. You have to inverse this time operator, and this is where the inverse is in this case. In this case, you take the covariant derivative of your four-form, so you get a one-form that values against the space of sort of four-form, and then you convert three of the entries into vector fill, and then you shove that back inside the four-form. So, this gives you one form that values in each birth, which is this 15-dimensional space. And surprisingly enough, the same formula works for the spin-seven case. So, you know, the exact same formula works, but should be aware that these are. Works, but should be aware that this is also very different equation. One is like seven PDs, and this is also one section. Can you explain again to contract? Yeah, so you take NATO, you take nabla omega, you get one form, the values in space of four form, and take three of these forms, you convert them to vector forms, and then you shove that back in there. So you get a one-form, the values in sort of two forms now. This is one form, the value in space of two forms. The value space of two forms. Well, I mean, it's not obvious that it has to be appear, but it does because it's the same triple. Cool. Okay, so what's good now is now we have an expression for t, so you can compute what div t is. But the problem is that, well, how in Gaussian do you actually find a foreform whose div t is actually zero? Well, the proposal is to mimic what happens in the What happens in the case of harmonic flow of maps, and you introduce this heat-type equation to find a harmonic guide. So you decide to evolve your full form by the div key itself. And the critical point is precisely going to be the harmonic guys. Okay, so I've written down a flow. So far so good. Cool. Well, not really, because well I've just written down a flow. I don't know if it has a solution. So first thing I have to justify this. So, first thing I have to justify this, and this was justified by the work of Eric and Enrique. So, they prove that the harmonic flow of any structures in general, where H is some stable subgroup of SON, does have short-time existence and it is unique. And moreover, they show that if the flow has a maximal sort of time of existence and it cannot be extended beyond that, then it must be the case that the intrinsic torsion is blowing up at some point over the manifold here. This is the intrinsic torsion that has to blow up. This is the intrinsic torsion has to flow. Okay, and the problem of interest at this point is: I mean, we know that the flow exists now, and we want to understand what happens as time goes to the maximal time of existence. So, we have this finite time singularity. So, how do we try to understand what is going on with the flow? So, to do that, we do a parabolic rescaling, which means you rescale the distance on your manifold by a factor c. Minefold by a factor C. So in a four-form it scales by C4, and then you change time by a factor of C square here, and then you get a new solutions of flow. So regardless here, not flow. So the point being that if you start with one flow, you get a new flow, but now this guy here is defined over a different interval of time. What you can do, you can translate S, so you can shove this guy here with a minus, and then you can have a flow well defined up till time zero. And if you take C. And if you take C in this expression to be this guy here, the intrinsic torsion, the super of this guy, then you know that this guy is blowing up. So if you take the limit of this guy, then you should get a flow that is well-defined from minus infinity to d squared to zero. You should get an anti-en solution. And you would expect that this guy or solid. These are solutions which evolve by symmetries. I'm going to give a more precise definition later on. But the first problem here, only the type 1 case we can. So yeah, only the type one case we'd expect them to be solitons. Yeah, expect it to be. I don't think it's always true. More or less philosophically. Yes, for each for a lot of good flows it is, but I think you have to prove it each time. Yeah, that's why I say expected. Expected by comparison with other flows, yeah. Yeah, but it's not a pure and it's not like not obvious reason. Why is can in red in inverted commas? Inverted commas? Well, because I haven't justified that we can't take a limit. A priori, we don't know that, right? So we need to sort of justify that. So first I need to justify why can we take a limit, and then I'll have shared what solutions are. So let's do that. So first thing first, you do have a compactness theorem. To take a limit, you need the manifold, the sequence of solutions here to be in a compact space, meaning that. Here to be in a compact space, meaning that if you have a sequence of solutions, which is well-defined over some interval of time, and you need some extra condition, so first you need bounds on the curvature and the intrinsic portion, and you need a lower bound on the injectivity radius. Then, if you have this condition, then you can actually take a limit of your guy. Let me sort of say why you need what. So, the reason why you need a curvature bound is because you don't want in the limit your mindful to develop a singularity. So, you could get point like To develop a single RT, so you could get point like constant, like curvature could concentrate that point, and then you can, in the limit, you might get something which is not a manifold. And you need. I thought the metric was fixed. Are you varying the metric as well? I thought the metric was fixed. I think the London coverture you get for free. Yeah, the Lambda cover is for free. And the activity radius. Yes, and you need to lower bounds. Oh, yeah, I guess we'll say true. Sorry, can you say the answer to that question again? The answer to what question? Why didn't you take the metric to be fixed? Why do you worry about curvature? He's okay with curvature. Yeah, but we're yeah, I probably should not have said that. The key point is engineering dictionary. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, maybe it's a maybe the way you state the statement like this is so that we can apply the more sort of general theorem, sort of like the Theorem, sort of like, because the reason the way you prove this theorem is really to just rely on Chigogramov compactness theorem for E-May manifolds. So this works in this setup where the metric is allowed to vary. I guess in this case, I don't have to do that because the metric is always fixed. But in principle, if the metric was allowed to vary, then you would need these conditions to make it work. Okay? And secondly, so I mean, so from G-O-Gromo of compactness, you only get a Riemannian manifold in the sort of limit, but you can't justify explicitly that it had to be contained. Explicitly that it had to be a cotencilla, it had to have a cotenciller structure. But the point is that there is an expression that gives you the metric out of the differential form. And almost the same expression works in the spin 7 case as well. So Spiro found this sort of expression here for the spin 7 case. But if you stare at what he does, it always works for any sort of non-degenerate full form. And then you just kind of realize that. I wouldn't say I found it. I asked Robert how to do it. He told me something which I didn't know. Robert, how to do it, and he told me something which I didn't understand, and then guided by his guidance in my confusion, I stumbled onto it. But he surely has it in his file encounter. Fair enough. Okay, but no, surprisingly not, it's about not surprisingly, I guess. Almost the same form that works once you adjust things the right way. So now we can take limit, so we're happy with that. And next thing is what solitons? So what is a soliton for this? So, what is a soliton for this flow? So, a harmonic soliton is given by the flowing data. You have your four-fold, you have X, the vector field, C is some constant, and you want this vector field to be homophetic vector field. And you need the divergence to satisfy this condition here. So, df D, we know what D F D is, contracting a vector field with intrinsic torsion makes sense. This guy here is the D of the dual one form. Of the dual one form to the vector field, which is the two form, and then you just put that into the h bar. And then the same sort of expression works in other cases, like in the G2 case or in the spin-7 case. And if the constant is negative or zero or positive, then you call them shrinking, steady, or expanding solitons. Which is kind of confusing, right? Because the metric doesn't change, but it's just because of analogy with R2 flow. Yeah, so just because of the sign of the constant, you just call it soliton, although it's not. Just call the third and also it's not necessary, but it's never sort of changing. So the accuracy is always zero. No, it's not. No, no, because you're because the vector field, the diffeomorphism part coming from X is going to scale the metric, but you also have the scaling, which cancel each other out. So finally, so the final solution of this form, where this row here depends on the C, you know, from the perspective. Enough thinking, I guess, from the perspective of an observer. That's moving along the QS. I guess. So the flow will, you can find, you can cook up some scaling from this C and you can find some diffeomorphism for antibiotic in this vector field here. And then so you get a symmetry solution. It's just called a solid concept. Okay, so one sort of simple observation just from this definition or proposition. This definition or proposition, if you want, is that expanders and shrinkers necessarily have to be on a given space. Because if C here is non-zero, then the existence of such a vector field essentially just has to be the order vector field of some translation stuff. So it has to be on our rate if you want to cut. C have to be zero. Well, I mean, we're exposed to you have to see positive or negative your own Euclidean space, so C0 is the only interesting case. So C0 is the only interesting case. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it's Dorsion Free. No, no, no, I wasn't saying that. I was just saying that you only want to take C equals zero, is what I was saying. I think what it says already says that if you're auto-completing your shaker, the manifold must be playing our own. I'm going to give you an example of a step dissolved on. Example of a steady soliton later on, but I don't know about expanders and shrinkers. And when I say steady soliton, not trivial ones, so I don't want torsion-free guards. Okay, so I want this. I can solve this guy on some examples, but not necessarily the torsion-free guards. There is the only interesting case, I think. Okay, so you think that you're never going to be able to cycle it. Oh, okay. Well, thanks then, Nair. Okay. Okay, so a bit sort of more technical version now. So in order to prove, I mean, you have a flow, in order, if you want to get epsilon regularity, so if you want to get regularity of the flow based on sort of controlling certain quantities, you want to get long-time existence of the flow. So maybe you control certain quantities, then you can justify that the flow will exist for a longer period of time. If you want to study singularity set of the flow, you need to control the. Of the flow, you need to control some return quantity along the flow. And the obvious guide to use is: well, you might just say, well, let's pick the energy because the energy is obviously decreasing. But however, you will need to do parabolic rescaling to get something meaningful out of it. And you can't use the energy because it is not invariant. So, in order to tackle this problem, you have to introduce a new functional and system sort of localized energy-type functional where what you do is, instead of looking at the energy, you show Do you instead of looking at the energy, you're showing over here a solution to the backward heat equation, and then you scale this integral here by some by this by this time factor here. Okay? And if you do that, then you can, well, you can think of this as somehow telling you how much the energy is controlling as t goes to zero around that point, p and t no. And if you do that, you hit it with the sort of standard theory, you can get this polling almost maximiformula. Polling almost monotonous formula. But it's almost monotone because while it's not quite going down, it's going down up to a factor and up to this star here. So it's not quite as good as you want it to be. However, if you are on flat space, then you know precisely what the backward heat equation, what the solution of the heat kernel is, and is this guy here. And in this case, you actually get it to be monitored. You can actually kill off this whole guy here, and you can just set this guy here to be one. Now, while this Now, while this formula here works and does give you a certain regularity and long-time existence, you have to control some very strong quantity in order to get that. So that's the problem. And the same thing is true in the heat harmonic heat flow for mass. But the idea, originally due to Chinese true base, is to use the fact that you know explicitly what the Euclidean backwards heat kernel is, and you can use that in the and modify. That in the and modify this functional in the right way to actually get an improved estimate. And this is somehow what is sort of different in what was previously known in the G2Spin7 case. So let me sort of emphasize how this is done. I mean, this was originally done by He and Li in the case of UN structures, but if you scare the proof for long enough, you're going to realize that the proof can be extended very easily if you just interpret things in the right way. So, how do you do that? I mean, first of all, how do you prove this formula? Well, the way you prove the formula is, well, you just take The way to prove the formula is: well, you just take ddt of this guy here. Once you take ddt, well, once you hit this guy here with ddt, you can just replace it with La Partian. Once you hit this guy here with ddt, well, you know precisely how this guy here is evolving, so you can hit everything here, then you integrate by false because you're not, and then you extract all the term that you that you need, and so you get the bound. And then you use a key-type equation kind of from the diffimorism variance. I'm going to come back to that later on. Because it's a curious idea again, sure. But somehow, here the point is that the best you can do if you do that is you can just get this confidence C here. And the problem really is that you don't know at all what U is going to be on an object URL manifold. It's an absence and sort of sort of an existence theorem, but you don't know what U is. But whereas you know what it is in the flat case. So what you do is you modify your functional, your localized energy type functional by introducing it, by introducing in the standard heat. In the standard heat kernel of flat space. And then you multiply by some test function, which is sort of loadedly supported in a little ball. And you can just scale your metric in such a way that your injectivity radius is one everywhere. So you can just work on this sort of little touch. And so you identify the point where you have the origin. And what you do is you're again do the same thing, you just hit it by ddt, and then you see how this guy is evolving, and you get sort of some differential inequality, and then you integrate that to get your quantity. Monitor quantity. And this turns out to give you a better Muller formula in the sense that before you have this fixed constant here, now you have a better estimate of what's going on. I'm not going to write down what the function f here is, but no, it's some sort of function that it's a bit like log type function, but it gives you the better estimate that you need. But somehow, what is somehow the key point here in this proof? Well, the key point here in this proof is that when you work on this little ball, the When you work on this little ball, the metric in sort of geodesic normal coordinate is approximately the flat one up to some curvature term. And this curvature term is fixed because the metric is never changing. So the point being that the intrinsic torsion is varying, but the curvature is not. So you can sort of trade off in that way. And then you can just replace partial covariant derivative with partial derivative, and then you just do the integration by balls in the obvious way. And this leads you to this improved estimate here. Estimate here. And one sort of key ingredient that makes this proof work is the so-called Yankee-type identity. I'm going to go into. Okay. So, so far, so good? This is a better, more concentrated formula because of the exponential term of giving. Yeah. Exactly. It's just enough to give you like sort of if you control the energy, you'll be able to get long-term existence instead. Energy, you'll be able to get long-time existence instead of this get entropy time. Yeah, go for it. Can I just ask quickly, how about your regularity of this T norm squared? Why do you need these kernels? Is it to regularize it or like what do you how should I think of this kernel? What is it doing? What is a C kernel? It's concentrating at the at the point T. What what do you sorry? It's reg it's smooth, but but it's it's not too bright. It's just to kernel to concentrate with it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. It's just yeah, it's converting to the delta. Yeah, right. Okay, so the key point in this proof is like, you know, like the key thing that would change depending on your age structure is precisely the anti-tag identity. I'm gonna so yeah, so this the reason it's almost is because of Hamilton's estimate on this heat kernel. When you try to take the d by dt of u, there is a term and Of U, there is a term, and that's why you have to use this C1 and C2. But that term vanishes if you take it, the Euclidean heat curve. I don't understand why you are still getting some exponential term if you on the next slide. Why I get this guy here. No, that will be there, but because this G is the Euclidean heat kernel, right? Yeah, but the metric is not Euclidean. Yeah, it's correct. The metric is approximately Euclidean, right? So in that term. So investor has exactly cool. Okay, so what is this Bianca-type identity? Well, when you're doing this integration by path, at some point you have to take the inner product of the current derivative of t with t itself, and then you're gonna have to. And then you're going to have to sort of integrate by false. In doing so, you're going to have to see how the current derivative commutes. So, when you swap x and y around, how the intrinsic torsion will vary under this guy here. Well, so the way I wanted to read this term here is to say that when you take current derivative of t and you sort of q symmetrize this guy, you get some quadratic term involving the intrinsic torsion and you get some curvature term. Point is that curvature term is not changing at all. Whereas this guy. At all. Whereas this gather could potentially be changing. Moreover, in this case, if you project in the h-per direction, this gather goes away. But in the proof, you're going to see that at the point you have to take in a product with key, which belongs precisely in this space. So you can kill out this guy here straight away. And this same proof works precisely. How do you sort of prove this guy? Well, you use the fact that you know precisely what the intrinsic torsion is given by. So you take nabla of this guy, you get nabla square here. Of this guy, you get navel square here, which is some curvature terms, a curvature operate acting, and then you get some quadratic terms involving some intrinsic torsion here. If you screw symmetries, you get precisely the result. And for the last bit, to prove that, what you have to do is just realize that here is some quadratic pairing of the intrinsic torsion, so it's belonging in H perf. But if you look at the representation here of this guy, you see if there's any H perf component, there's no guarantees. This is how you extract this term here. This is how you extract this term here. And the same proof here works in the spin 7 case as well. But the advantage of doing it this way is that you don't have to chase indices whatsoever. In the G2 case, it's a bit more tricky because if you take R7 tenses of R7, you're going to get another R7 component. But in this case, you're just going to have to be a bit careful and you're actually going to have to understand this operator here in the corresponding case. But it's point-wise. I mean, it's an AB-write computation. You can just do that on R7. Once it's fine, you're good. Or seven, once it's fine, you're good to go. Okay, that's a point. Yep, I just saved that, and I just saved that as well. And it's called blank type additive because spiracle it's that because arises by different moves invariant of the interesting torsion. But I think you can actually show that it is a BIT identity for some other connection torsion. For some other connection towards another connection. I see. So I accidentally gave it the right name. Oh, okay. So when you split the connection into the H-bit, that's precisely connection. I see. Thanks. And an immediate consequence of this is that if T here is zero, you see that, well, if T is zero, well, everything vanishes, and you have that the projection of the curvature in the 215-bit is zero. This is plus the state. 15 bit is zero. This implies the statement of the holomic group producer. Yeah, go for it. Sorry, could you say why did you just refer a bit more clearly? Because in the g case, if this guy would be L7, if you take L7 tens or R7, you're going to get another R7 component sitting in there. So it's not obviously clear that once you project, you're not going to get any other contribution from this quadratic term here. So you have to work a bit harder to see that the operation indeed is going to kill up that term. That's what. So just another. That's what? So, just another quick question. So, that's quite quadratic term. Can you rewrite it in terms of T? This guy here? This one. Well, yeah, this is morally T, this is morally T, but I mean, having an index, because like T was this guy, right? He was Nabla, omega. So more sequences sort of T contracted with T in a very strange way. Yeah. To be clear, tomorrow I'll share in the general type of. So, yes. So it's just a sneeze, it doesn't have index. It's my assumption. Okay. Yeah, so this is just a measure of the failure of the reduction of the harmony group. And this also works for the other cases as well. And you need precisely this argument here inside the integration bypass that you do in the previous statement here, in the previous VR. So I'm not going to discuss the epsilon regularity. Discuss the epsilon regularity, no long-time existence, because Enrique is going to talk about that tomorrow. But this relies crucially on the fact that you can get this improved estimate on this new function here. But in essence, the point would be that if you have small enough energy, you can get long-term existence. It's going to be smooth, and it's going to converge to if the you're going to get a precise statement about that to more wrong. Okay, but then let's move on to something a bit. Let's move on to something a bit more concrete. Note that if you're on a homogeneous space and you are working with something which is completely invariant, you don't need all these guys because the point being that the energy is going to go down. If the energy is going down, you know precisely that, you know that globally the integral is going down. But because if it's invariant, then that means that every single point has to go down as well. Because at one point, it's going to determine the intrinsic torsion everywhere, basically. So in this case, on a homogeneous space, So, in this case, on a homogeneous space, you always have long-term existence in time. And we're going to see an example of that later on. Just one comment is that in this case, if you do have a finite time singularity, then you can only show using this method of this paper is that the singular set has half-door dimension six. So you only get sort of two-dimension down. You can't get more than that. And that's because we don't have a better theory. And that's because we don't have a better theory than the original theory due to Grayson and Hamilton. Because, in principle, what you would expect is if you're working in some sort of special holomic case, you would expect that the singular set would be some sort somehow related to the special geometry that you're working with. So, in your working age case, you might expect astrative, quasi- in this case, you might expect it to be some sort of calibrated guy, which is maybe S4 or something like that, but we we don't have that, just from this theory. In this case, it's probably just this guy, or eight. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. In Koten Keller case, carabid is a mindfulness are much, much more restrictive than the sins of spin seven case. Yeah. Cool. So give us a basic example of harmonic structure, which is not trivial. If you have a Ring Man manifold which is locally conformally parallel, then it is automatically harmonic. This was known. This was known in some cases, but this is twice. Okay. So, how does the proof work? Roughly speaking, if you know that it's conformally parallel, what does that mean? That means there exists some function where you multiply by this function. This guy here is going to be currently constant. F here is some locally defined function. But then the projection map into H buff, this is conformally invariant operator. And the point is that once you do that, And the point is that once you do that, the new LetShift connection that you get from the torsion free guy is going to commute with this guy here. Because this guy here presents homes, this special homic type. So it's going to commute with this guy, whereas the original connection would not. Using this sort of comparison, you can actually extract off the diagonal div D. This is sort of a bit tricky computation to do if you just did it with the original connection. That's why you need to conformally parallel here. A similar proof was done by Sergey in the G2Ks. This proof also. Sergio intenser G2 case, this proof also applies just intenser in case. In fact, for any intensor you want, this is the same exact proof works, doesn't depend on anything. So there are lots of examples. So, in a way, I'm sort of justifying why harmonic is good, because if you're conformally parallel, you're harmonic. Okay, so let me now give you an explicit solution to the flow. So, I'm going to start with the hyperbolic containing plane. So, this is topology to just R8. You can think of it as a solvable Lie group, and here we're Solvable Lie group, and here is your structure equation. Okay, so this is a solvable Lie group. This space here is an Einstein manifold, has negative scalar curvature. This is in fact a non-compact dual of HP2. So it has four holomy, this portion free guy, holomy sp2sp1. You can define an sp2 structure using this formula here, and you can define the quadrature. And you can define the quote-unquote full-form precise by its expression here, anti-cobrasic constant, because it has special harmony. Okay, so it is trivially harmonic. So, what you can do in this very sort of elementary case is, well, the nilma is a sort of Lie group, right? So, what you can do, you can just take two of the coframes and just rotate them around minus one factor. Okay? You sit down now, you start computing. This guy is not going to be total-free in general. So, you sit down, you start computing, and you get that df d is given by this expression here, which in here. Given by this expression here, which in here are constants, A and B or any functions. Any functions, yeah, as valuing S1. And clearly you see there's only one guy, which is atomic in this case. Okay, so supposed to be so expected. And you can work out what the flow equation here is explicitly. And it turns out to be this flow D here. And you can sit down and you can solve it. And you see that indeed the flow converges to the guy that you knew because there was one torsion-free guy. Because there was one torsion-free guy, so it's indeed converges in infinite time. So you get convergence in infinite time. In fact, the solution is in fact eternal, so it's well-defined for all backwards time as well. Well, this was naturally to be expected because there was a torsion figure to begin with. And also, you should note that the energy is always infinite in this case because the manifold is not compact. But the flow still does what it's meant to do. Still finds the torsion free guy, although the volume is always not sort of the gradient flow in a way. Gradient flow in a way. Have elasts quotient. I don't know. Would it be a bit compact quotient? Yeah, could you? I don't know. I guess not because it could disprove the conjecture of Watson that the compact no no the well sorry. Yeah, that's a good question. Can you provide one moment to the how do you say no? Because all I did, I rotated. Yeah, but whether you were preserving the metric by noise. Exactly. That's precisely. I'm very restrictive in what I can do because I can't make very general answers. Because my answer always has to preserve the metric, which is why I get like this weird type of answers where I can only. This weird type of random stuff, where you know, I can only. I mean, you could pick more general guy, like maybe you rotate F in SO3, something like that, and I think it will still work, but it's just not your computation. Okay, nearly done. Okay, so let me give you a non-conformally parallel example now. Start with SQ3. This is more corrupt than form. Note that the Note that the fourth commodity group of that guy is zero, so it cannot admit a torsion-free guy. In fact, I should have said that any compact, all contained Keller manifolds in dimension A are either the containing plane HP2, G2 of SO4, or the Graph Manion of two planes in C4. There's only three examples in the compact setup. So this clearly could not have been a contact. They're the only ones that can exist. Yeah. Can exist, they're only ones that can exist, yeah. Positive, positive case, positive case, yeah, negative case is y. Okay, so you can define a metric using this guy, define the obvious metric. This is not the binary one, the binary one is something else, just sort of a comment. You can again make a similar answer as before, and you can in fact check that this guy here is hyper-complex. The actuated, almost complex structure is in fact interval. Fucking terrible. The same was true for the example I gave you earlier in the SU2 case. And you can check that this guy here, the full form that I define, indeed satisfies it is indeed a harmonic guy. And there was no chance of getting a covariantly constant guy, but still there's harmonic in this case as well. Indeed, it's not close. You can play similar trick as before, and then you can run down the flow, and then you're going to see that people again converge to this guy, just like in the other case when I rotated the card. Rotated the card, rotated to framing. But the natural sort of question in this case is that: Can you prove that this guy here is a global minimum? Like, you know, can you, like, no, is this like the best harmonic structure that you can get in this guy for this guy here? In general, I don't know if there's a second variation formula. If you could check whether this guy is stable or unstable under the flow, something like that, I don't know that as well. Just some open question, like maybe it's applicable to the different other cases as well. The different other cases as well. Here's a non-trivial example of a steady slotton. Take the flat guys on all eight, make the following answer. Take two of these one forms, multiply them by some cos and some sign. Metrics again on chain. Again, I have to do cos and sine because I can't fiddle around with the metric. Work out what the intrinsic portion is. Well, everything else will vanish except for this guy here. And then you can see that dF T here is precisely the portion contracted with the. Is the torsion contracted with this vector field here? This is precisely a soliton, the steady soliton. So, in fact, the gradient soligon here. This is namba of x1. And in fact, you can do the same computation in the spin-semin case, and you can also get a steady salt in the spin-semin case as well. So, they are non-trivial solutions, and you can actually use them to do computation in general. Okay, I think that's all I wanted to say.
