Okay, then we continue. Now we are going to see the case of even N, but first, well, Monica gives the introduction and the case of N. Now I'm giving the given N, as I told you, and then As I told you, and then Michelangel will explain about a new method that we found. Okay, but first I want to tell you a story. I'm coming back to the case of Ivenen, but this story is that these people, Rufa Vila, Darique Lores, Clemens Wemen, Paran Rutado. Weemen, Ranurtado, Porfo Rucci, and David Wood did this paper, and they conjectured that the reconnectivity of a graph and its K-token graph coincide for all the gas, for the case. We thought that it was an interesting conjecture, and then we wanted to prove this conjecture for cycle graphs, and there's two token graphs. We wanted to begin. Wanted to begin only for the two token and then to generalize to the K token. And also, we went to obtain the whole spectrum of the two token. But a few weeks ago, Rui Fabila from Mexico told us something shocking. I know it's usual, it's not unusual. These things happen, but what's shocking? And the shocking is that. And the shocking is that the conjecture was proved. Okay, it was not terrible because as we didn't want only the algebraic connectivity, we wanted the whole spectrum. Okay, it was proof in a complete different subject. In fact, it's the name of the paper that It's the name of the paper that the proof of Aldous Spectral conjecture has relation with quantum mechanics. The problem was not the same. It's not that the problem was given under a different name. No, it was a completely different problem. They don't have token, they have vertices, and each vertex has a different colour. But finally, you can translate their problem to the token. Their problem to the token. It was a strange proof with that they did some random work and also switching of vertices. But would you flee enough? Sorry. There is also another. There is also an algebraic proof. Of course, the name doesn't say anything for us. A few remarks of the octopus inequality and the Andos spectral gap conjecture. We didn't know anything about that, but well, the question is that Filipo Chesse, a physicist, give an algebraic proof that algebraic conjecture remains always the same. Conjecture remains always the same for all the token. Well, we say, okay, this is done, but we are for the whole spectrum. Okay, and then we assume that the spectrum of a two-to-member of a cycle will be something very easy to find. We were optimist. It was not so easy. In fact, to solve it for all cases, For all cases, we need to construct a new method. And I think that this method can be applied here for the token, but also for other cases. We were speaking with Nacho Lopez and other people. Well, we obtained the spectrum of a two-token graph of a cycle. Of a two-token graph of a cycle when n is on, is what Monica explained, and we did it with a lithograph. When n is even and n half is odd, it can be also done through a lithograph. Let's see this case. Of course, it remains a case, but for this case. But for this case, now we have that n is 4 times r plus 2 and in this case we consider this path, the path on four r plus 1 vertices numbered in this way with some additional arcs and these additional arcs. And these additional arcs have a voltage assignment. The voltage assignment is plus R or minus R, depending on the arc. And in the cyclic group, Z2R plus 1. Well, given this voltage assignment, we could prove that the That the two token of the cycle for R plus two is isomorphic to this path to beta, which is the lithograph or the Poltana. Well, then, as Monica also explained, we construct a polynomial matrix. This polynomial matrix. matrix. This polynomial matrix for each entry U and V in a question for each entry U and V you put the voltage assignment. But in this polynomial matrix what we do is we write each entry U and B is the sum of zeta to the voltage assignment. If is the sum if we have more than one arc. If we have more than one arc between u and b in the case that we don't have loops, as this is the polynomial matrix of the Laplacian base, then here we don't have a sum of zeta of z, but minus because it's a Laplacian. It's the real It's the degree minus the minus the adjacency. Well, in this case, for each z that is a root of the unity, we obtain this matrix. Okay, it's not so easy, but it's a three-diagonal matrix, a three-diagonal matrix for the principal, for the main. Principal for the main diagonal and the secondary diagonal. And with this matrix, we obtain, in fact, we used sorry. Now here I have the example. Okay. And with this matrix, we could obtain the whole spectrum. Here I have an example. Here I have an example. This is the two token of the cycle on 10 vertices. Here we have a regular partition which gives a part of the spectrum, but we don't want it only a part, we want all of the spectrum. And this is the base graph with the corresponding With the corresponding arcs and the corresponding voltages. Here I have another example. In the case that we have the two token of the cycle on six vertices, we obtain this polynomial matrix for the base graph and And giving the values of z, which are the roots of unity, we obtain the complete spectrum. And here we write the eigenvalues in both phase and the eigenvalues that are also eigenvalues of the cycle. Because, as Monica told, for each top. For each token, we re obtain the eigenvalues of the previous token. In the case of previous step, the previous token is the graph. Then we obtain the eigenvalues of C6. Well, but this is okay. This is okay, we were happy enough, but it remains one case. What happens when we have even n and even n halves? And then we tried to do the same, but it didn't work. What can be done now? If we cannot find Cannot find we cannot apply the advantage assignment, the page wrap. And then we say, okay, well, we need a new method. And as the previous method is called the leaf or voltage graph, this new method we call over leaf. And here, And here I have an example. What happened with these cases? The problem is that we don't have so much symmetry as in the previous cases. Here you see that for the vertices that are in this orbit, there is symmetry, also for these ones, but what happens in these four vertices? Happens in these four vertices, we don't have symmetry. The adjacencies have not symmetry. And then here I would like to say that we modified the graph in order to obtain more purity that this is not the truth. What we did is we modified the matrix and then look what happened to the What happened to the graphs, and what's happening to the graph is that they were symmetric, but the process was not modifying the graph, it was modifying the matrix. Okay, this is the two tokens of the cycle for a purtices, another view, some regular partitions that. Regular partitions that give part of the spectrum, but we wanted, as before, we wanted the whole spectrum. And well, then we use a new polynomial matrix that does not correspond to the base graph of a lift. In fact, this new matrix is bigger, is larger than the. And then what happens? And then what what happens is that we obtain more eigenvalues than that of the of our graph but we we know which eigenvalues are spurious or extra extra eigenvalues in fact Monica did a wonderful program that computes the the complete spectrum Complete spectrum and identify the spurious eigenvalues, and then give only the eigenvalues corresponding to the graph, to the base graph, not the spurious. Well, then we have this polynomial matrix which is larger than it should be if it was only the matrix corresponding to the graph. The matrix corresponding to the graph. Okay, and in this case we call capital gamma to a multi-set of eigenvalues 4, and there are no of them. And the spectrum can be obtained with this matrix with the same idea as before, but But here there are two arcs. One is zeta 2, 0 and here is zeta 2 minus 1 according to the voltage assignment. And here for all the values of Z, which are the n groups of unity, we obtain the complete space. The complete spectrum. But in fact, we use a similar matrix given with cosinus. And then the spectrum of this matrix, or the spectrum of this similar matrix, is the spectrum of the L, the two token graph. But now we have also this. We have also this set of eigenvalues 4 that doesn't belong to our graph. And here there is an example for the case of C5, the cycle on eight vertices. As before, we write in boot phase the The eigenvalues that are also eigenvalues of the cycle. Here are all of them are the eigenvalues of the two token graph. Well, I think that really this other leaf method can be applied when we don't have, when we cannot apply the voltage graph or the leaf graphs. And it can be done. and it can be done done for uh other other cases and and other graphs okay now um michael and jer is going to speak are we only allowed questions at the end or can we ask questions now as you want uh okay so the overlift is also a graph or just a matrix it's a graph it's a graph the question is The question is that is a map. The idea is we constructed a larger matrix, but then we asked to ourselves, well, and this larger matrix, to what graph correspond. And we looked at the graph and is the same graph with some additional edges that made that the rack is a That the graph is has symmetry. So, what's the relation between the two graphs? Is the new graph a cover of the original graph or not? No, no, it's not a cover. It's like if you add the necessary edges to make the graph completely symmetric. Vertext transitive or Vertex transitive or art transitive? Vertex transitive or transitive? I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but the question is that we obtain this cyclic symmetry in order to obtain the same size of all the other bits. All right, thank you. Okay, then you can. Okay, then Michelangelo is going to explain about the overlift method.
