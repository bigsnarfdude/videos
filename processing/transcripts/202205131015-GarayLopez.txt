I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak here. And I think that before everything else, we should thank the organizers for having made this possible. So, my purpose here is My purpose here is like advocating for combinatorics in geometric and algebraic settings. So the subtitle of my talk is An Invitation to the Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra of Semi-rings. My general goal is to present the construction of a space. I will be clear about this later. But this space But this space is going to be endowed with a true sheaf of idempotin semi-rings, having local stocks in the sense of semi-rings. And this is inspired by some geometric constructions going on mainly in tropical F1 and on Archimedean geometry. And one of our main goals is to give an algebraic interpretation of a true algebraic. Of a true algebraic interpretation of tropical algebraic geometry, like using ideals and algebraic objects, morphisms between algebraic objects to make this truly an algebraic process. Since these tropical things happens and non-Archimedean things happen in idempotent settings, it makes sense to endow geometric structures with such these kinds of shapes. And I just want Ships. And I just want to say that this is going on, this is work in progress with Sebastian Falkensteiner, Mercedes Hayek, Marpaul Nortman, and Lara Bossinger, which is here based in Atunnam. Here is some agenda that I have for today. First, I will talk about some algebraic. Uh, talk about some algebraic aspects of valuations and semi-rings and the important things. Then, I will speak about the development of the concept of valuation. I will introduce a general concept of valuation, which is not very difficult from a technical point of view and generalizes almost everything, every notion of valuation existing. So, up to my knowledge. Then, I will translate. Translate several parts of the literature which have been written using ordered structures into commutative algebra. And this has been hard work since this literature goes back 150 years and it's difficult to keep tracking of all the people that have been working in these subjects. It is really difficult. But also, some combinatorial problems like cryptomorphism. Problems like cryptomorphisms enter the discussion. And cryptomorphism is like something which happens in combinatorics, in which you can define an object like with 40 or 50 different ways. So it is different to compare all the definitions and see if all of them agree. Okay, and later at the end of the talk, I will give you the actual construction and discuss some of the things that we are working now. Are working now. I have some general conventions. All my binary operations will be commutative, associative, and they will have identity. If I have a ring, UR is going to be the invertible elements of the multiplicative monoid. And as I said before, valuation is not a homogenized concept. One can find it under the name of non-Archimedean valuation. Non-Archimedean valuation or non-Archimedean semi-norm or generalized valuation. So from now on, each time I use valuation or semi-norm or non-Archimedean or etc., it is the same concept, just with slightly different system of actions. So, what is evaluation? As I said, this is a concept which happens in many areas of algebra, order theory, non-Artemian geometry. Archimedean geometry, analysis, historic degenerations, etc., and can be formulated in many slightly different forms. My purpose in this first slide is to show you that this is actually a very simple notion of sub-homomorphism between some particular class of semi-rings. So, my definition of valuation is something, yeah, here, it's a map. Here is a map from a ring to an idempotent semi-ring. I will define that term later, which satisfies four actions. The first one is some deformation of multiplicativity. The second one is some deformation of additivity. And you should ask that zero goes to zero, one goes to one, and minus one goes to one. So these conditions one and two. These conditions one and two is a perturbation of the definition of ring homomorphism. And conditions three and four, you should impose them, really impose them because they are not deduced from the order two, as for the case of rings, right? So let me define the basic object that I will speak about this morning. A semi-ring. What is a semi-ring? Semi-ring is just a ring. Ring is just a ring in which you are not allowed always to perform subtractions. So if you take the possibility of taking subtractions out of your mind, you are in the world of semi-rings. So I have some examples here. What the semi-rang, the semi-ring is a ring if every element is additively invertible. It is a semi-ring. It is a semi-field. If it is invertible, every non-zero element is invertible with respect to product. Now we have more definitions. Amorphism is the same definition as you have for rings, but you have to specify that zero goes to zero or one goes to one, as before. Algebra over semi-ring is the same definition as you have for rings. So we have a category. This category of semi-rings is natural. This category of semi-rings is naturally identified with the category of n-algebras and with the structure from always usual addition and usual product. And this is a proper enlargement of the category of rings, which is I will regard as algebras. Now we have a very important concept, which is semi-commutative algebra. Semi-commutative algebra is the quest to extend the concepts that you have in commutative algebra to this new. Concepts that you have in commutative algebra to this new world. And this is not expressed, this is not, sorry, this is not easy because sometimes if you define the same object for the category of semi-ring as you do for rings, you find yourself that the concept may have several incarnations. Or saying in another way, several concepts defined for semi-rings coincide when you go to rings. For example, I have here a For example, I have here a concrete example. If you have a semi-ring, you call it integral or cancellative, which is a common term also in the literature, if it can be embedded into a semi-field. This semi-field is naturally the field of fractions of the guy, and it is constructed as you do as likely modification as you would do in commutative algebra. But you have also the concept of free of service divisors. Serial divisors is when your semi-ring has not zero divisors, and these two concepts are not the same. I will, um, okay, integral implies free of serial divisors, but the converse is not true, and I will give you an example in a couple of slides. Yes? Just to make sure I understand, would the fraction field of like the natural numbers be the positive rationals? The fraction fields of the naturals gives you, um, I believe. Yeah, um I believe it keeps you the integers. Oh, so you're inverting policy another important definition is what is identpotent. Idempotent is when the addition does nothing, if you perform it with same element. And the main example is B, the Boolean semi-field. Is B the Boolean semi-field? You just take the set of two elements zero and one ordered in the usual way, and the sum is the maximum with respect to this order. Also, totally ordered monoids, you take a monoid. For me, monoids will be multiplicative. I add another point which is not in the monoid. I call it zero. And since I have a total order, take the max with respect to this order makes sense. With respect to this order, it makes sense. So this SM is a semi-ring, which is constructed out of a totally ordered mono. Another family of example is lattice order groups. You take a group, an abelian group. I take also the operation to be the product. And this is an order. Lattice order is that given two elements, you always have a supremum and an infimum. And an infimum. Again, in the literature, you may find these three notations. You may have B, you may have sub, or you may have plus. And all of these are the same. The infimum, on the other hand, is always denoted by wedge. And if your order always have, you always, in your order set, you always has this polygon, then you call it a lattice. Then you call it a lattice order. And if you have a lattice order group, you take this the plus the addition as the supremum and you get yourself an idempotent semi-ring. Conversely, if you have an idempotent semi-ring, you can define a canonical order in which one element is less than the other if the sum reaches the left, the rightmost element. And this is a category also, the category of impotent semi-rings. You can see it as the B algebras, where B is the Boolean semi-field. And you can see B as a ringification of F1. F1 is just a monoid with a marked point. And if you, instead of writing F1, you write B, then you find in a more, in a richer context in which you can do actually algebraic geometry, which resembles to classical algebraic geometry. Which resembles the classical algebraic geometry. So, this is a category, and this has strong links with F1 geometry. Now, let me go back to now that I know that semi-rings carry a canonical order, which every time they are idempotent, then this is truly a superhomomorphism. A valuation is a superhomomomorphism. So, you have that the product, the valuation of the product is less or equal than the product of the evaluations, the valuation of the addition is less or equal. Valuation of the addition is less or equal than the evaluation of the additions of the valuations. 0 goes to 0, 1 goes to 1, and minus 1 goes to minus 1. Here I have a couple examples. For example, if you pick the positive real numbers with the product and you put the canonical order of this set, then if you choose this S as your landing object, you call this anarchemia. Object, you call this a non-Archimedeal seminar. On the other hand, if you pick a totally order group and this valuation you ask not for multiplicativity but for multiplicativity, then you know this as gruel valuation. There is a slight generalization by Romp and Chuan Yang in 2007, and they took for a landing object a lattice order group and they called Disorder group. And they call these objects L-valuations. And here, let me present another example with respect to this definition, which is not, which is something new. This is a very simple example. You take a ring of characteristic zero. You take the ring of formal power series with coefficients in this ring. And as a landing object, you take the power set of the naturals. Of the naturals as a way to parametrize the support of the series. So, sending a power series with coefficients in a ring to the support is a valuation in this sense. Why? Because the power set of the naturals is not totally ordered if m is at least two. So, this is not lattice ordered, but you can show that this semi-ring cannot be embedded into a group. Cannot be embedded into a group. So what I'm really showing you here is an example of a semi-ring which is free of zero divisors, but it's not integral. And this is a phenomenon happening exclusively for semi-rings. So why is it not multiplicative? This is also something which happens in analysis. In convex analysis, you ask for inequalities rather for. For inequalities rather than equalities. Because if you take these two series, for example, t plus u, or rather polynomials and t minus u, you perform the product and then the support of the product is to zero and zero two. On the other hand, if you take first evaluation and take the product of the valuations, which is the Minkowski sum, you end up with a set which is strictly larger. Set which is strictly larger than this. So, this evaluation is not multiplicative. And as I said before, this guy cannot be embedded into a group. So, it is lattice ordered, but it is a monoid. It is not a group. So, this kind of valuations are new, and these examples told us that these kind of functions were worth studying. So, some historical remarks here. Remarks here. Arguably, the first realization, the generalization of cruel valuation was the definition of L valuation by Romp and Chuang Yang in 2007. In the paper, they said that this was done to study categorical aspects of the celebrated Kruhl-Kaplansky-Jaffar-Ohm correspondence theorem, which I will state in the next page. And during the last 10 years, I come from And during the last 10 years, I come from tropical geometry, non-Archimedean geometry, people started realizing that there was needed an extension of the concept of valuation. And pretty much this definition came, was cooked 10 years ago by several people at the same time. But it has been used by some geometers to prove actual mathematical things. For example, Mathematical things. For example, Noah and Jeff Chan Sirakusa in 2013 they used for some non-Archimedean Verkovich related geometry. They showed that there was an universal valuation. And then using this valuation, you can represent some functor, which is the analytication functor in the Roberkovich sense. In tropical geometry, there is this big thing that you want to make sense of the concept of tropical ideal because variety. Because varieties and closed-subschemes are associated to ideas. So, the quest, one of the big quests in tropical geometry is to actually make sense of the concept of tropical scheme using ideas. So, Oliver Lorshed during these years showed an analog result from this Yancira Cosa brothers, but for some other slightly different valuations, which Slightly different valuations, which are called integral and are very, very important because they relate to integral structures of schemes, like descent of an integral domain such that the generic fiber is what you are working on, actually. Later in 2019, Kabi and Manon used an actual semi-field to classify. To classify torus equivariant families of toric bundles over toric varieties. And this is strength on results from Cliasko and other people. And finally, as I told you before, we came to this kind of technology because we were studying algebraic differential equations, power series solutions for algebraic differential equations. And the valuation that I just showed you here appeared in the form. Appeared in the formalization of topicalization of algebraic differential equations. And this was like the starting point of this program. Now, so this is pretty much the preliminaries. Now I will show you that this makes sense. I mean, you can do geometry with these objects if you do it correctly. So now, but there is some work that has to be done. Most of Has to be done. Most of the literature is found in order theoretical terms. And other peoples use lattice theory. And other people use algebra. And there is a big gap between the translations of these three different words. So basically, what we did is start researching about these terms, which goes back to idea, the birth of ideal theory, like understanding. Ideal theory, like understanding the ring through the lattice of ideals. And well, the advantage is that when you forget about the ordered part, you pretty much land into commutative algebra, which is very natural to do geometry. So the purpose of this part is to tell you that several classical results in lattice order groups and these kind of guys are. These kinds of guys are actually statements in semi-commutative algebra. So, the first big thing, I'm sorry, I apologize here, I have to apologize because it is really hard to get who did what. Because, as I told you, it is kind of 150 years of literature, and people use And people use different terms. So, this is an active work like putting names on the statements and reinterpreting them so to identify that this is also this is actually the same statement as this. So, I apologize in advance if I miss some references. So, the assignment: so you take what I said, what is a lattice order group? You take an abelian group and you take an a partial. group and you take a partial order and this partial order if you take two elements they must have a supremum and they must have a minimum an infimum actually this category and the morphisms of lattice order groups are morphisms of abelian groups which respect both structures they respect the order and they respect product so if you forget the first result is that if you mark your group with a point with a special point which is With a point, with a special point which is zero, and you forget about the infimum, then you get a semi-field. And this is an equivalence of categories. And once you go to semi-fields, several statements in lattice order groups become really geometric. For example, let me start with the definition of a besides domain. Have a sudomain is an integral domain. A integral domain in which every non-zero finitely generated ideal is principal. As an example, valuation domains are besu if the converse is not true. And there is this big construction that is reappearing in F1 geometry and arithmetical geometry. For example, Alan Con has some construction related to the divisibility group of a besu domain of a ring. So you take a besu and you take the fraction field. And you take the fraction field, and U of R is the group of multiplicative units, and you take the quotient of the field divided by the units of the ring acting on it multiplicatively. But you don't forget about zero, you keep zero. So it turns out that this is an idempotent semi-field because you can show that this guy is actually a lattice order group. And by this remark, above, Remark above, you treat it rather as a semi-field and not as an abelian order group. And this quotient projection, sending an element of the field to its class, is a multiplicative valuation, as in the sense as I introduce here. So, here you have several examples of valuations in the sense that I am discussing. And in fact, if you do this effort, And in fact, if you do this effort of translation, this gamma of R, this is the divisibility group, can be found as the fraction ring of the action of the units in the ring. And the sum in the so this is an integral structure. I'm saying what I'm saying is that if you perform this operation on R rather than on the field, then you can localize at the zero ideal and Localize at the zero ideal and recover the construction that is classical. It is everywhere in all the books speaking about this, talking about this, that this is the standard construction, but it is not shown as a fraction field of something integral, rather as a construction on the field. The emphasis is done on the field, not on the integral structure. So, what I'm saying is that if you perform this operation on the ring rather than on the field, then the Rather than on the field, then the sum is very easy to see. The sum of two classes of elements is just the greatest common device, or the ideal, the principal ideal generated by GCD of A and B. And one of the properties of Besu domains is that GCD of A and B and L C M of A and B always exists. So again, if you go to Besu domains, there are several characterizations of them, and it sometimes is hard. And sometimes it's hard to see the equivalences between them, but this is one of them, which is different from the definition that I am giving here. As an example, let me take the integers. So if you perform this operation on the integers, you just identify an integer with its negative. And the sum that you get. And the sum that you get, the product that you get is the usual product, but the sum is different. The sum is not m plus n as usual, but this is the GCD of m and n. And this is a new semi-ring, which is called n GCD. And if you take the quotient field of this guy, these are the rationals with the usual sum of fractions, but with respect to this sum, not the usual. Not the usual sum of fraction rationals as we do, but with this sum, with respect to this sum. And this quotient projection, you can see that this is just sending a rational to its absolute value, but it lands in a non-Archimedean structure rather than on cube non-negative with the traditional structure. So this is a way of making a usual Archimedean valuation non-Archimedean. Media add two fractions, yes, add them the usual way and just take the GCD and the negative exactly. You perform them as you would do, but instead of using this plus, you put GCT. And this is a reformulation of the Kruel-Kaplansky-Jafarom correspondence theorem in these terms. You take an adempotent semi-field, then there exists a Besu such that this guy. That this guy is the fraction field of this construction. But again, you will not find this theorem stated as this. You will find it stated in terms of lattice order group, which is something you have to work a little bit to see the difference. Okay. Now, let me give more. Give more background on semi-commutative algebra, and I will talk about ideals and localizations. So, ideals for semi-rings are a good idea, as they are for rings. But the problem is that in semi-rings, the quotients are not controlled by ideas, they are controlled by congruences, and there is a way to go back and forth between congruences and ideas, but this But these ways are not bijective. But if you go to rings, they are. So here you need to keep track of the idea that ideals and quotients are different things. Nevertheless, let me introduce what is an ideal for a semi-ring. I will pick a semi-ring R. And an ideal is a subset which satisfies the same properties as for rings. For rings. But in rings, you have a negative sign somewhere. You turn that negative sign into plus because here you don't have a subtraction. What is a prime ideal? The same definition as for prime ideals of rings. And here is a very important definition, which is cancellative. Cancellative is really what captures. What captures the things, the combinatorial things in the semi-ring world, which comes from algebraic things, from ring theory. So the ideal is cancellative, also called K-ideal. If each time that you have A and A plus B in I, then you can deduce that B is in I. And if you develop this. If you develop this condition, it says that you can, in some sense, perform subtractions. That this idea is closed by subtraction because B would be A minus A plus B. Or B would be A plus B minus A. So, localizations also you can do localizations if you have a multiplicative set. You take the You take the product and then you take the equivalence class generated by comparing couples. But here, just keep in mind that since you cannot perform subtractions, you need the help of an additional element T. But this is also like very natural to perform this localization. And you can define operations on the You can define operations on the set of equivalence classes as you do for rings. And what you find is another semi-ring, which is called the localization. And you can do this for prime ideals. And you recover pretty much several statements of the usual theory of a localization of ideas of rings, like, for example, the correspondence principle, etc. Field of fractions also works similar if your ring is free of several... If your ring is free of several divisors, then the complement of the C0 is multiplicatively closed. So you can perform this operation. If you perform this, you get a semi-field. But the thing is that this map, the natural map that sets A to A divided by one, is injective only when R is integral. So this construction makes sense for three of zero device or three semi-rings, but you may have some. You may have some crushing or some loss of information. And we also have residue fields for prime k ideal. So here, let me emphasize that they should be k, they should be cancellative. If the ideal is not cancellative, then we have problems at a geometric level. So you take a prime k ideal, you take the complement of this guy inside the semi-ring, and you can define in a very natural way the A very natural way, the residue field. Here, as I said before, these quotients mean a quotient by an equivalence relation, which is not an ideal. So, this strange C is some equivalence generated, some semi-ring congruence generated by this set. But the definition, if we forget about this difference between ideals and congruences, the definition is pretty much the same. The definition is pretty much the same. And an important result is that this semi-ring or this semi-field is not zero for any cancellative prime ideal. Yes, and prime too. Yes. So actually, if you run this process for a non-cancellative prime ideal, you get zero as a residue field. So that's another way. Residue field. So that's another way to spot which guys are combinatorial and which guys are not, are algebraic. Very well. Now let me use this semi-commutative algebra to strengthen the fact that it is useful for valuations, classical valuations. So let me take a valuation in the sense that I defined. It is a subhomomorphism between a ring and a semi-ring. Between a ring and a semi-ring, which is idempotent. And the unit ball is just the elements having norm less or equal than one. And again, if you come from the additive world, then this is just the guys having positive valuation. Everything has to be reversed if we work with addition instead of multiplication. But multiplication is more suitable for non-Archimedean geometry. So, this is a concept from Romp and G. Multiplicative valuation is besu. If for any two elements of K, you can find elements living in the unit ball such that the valuation is additive when you multiply by them by these guys. And now, this is the theorem that you also find stated in order theoretic terms. Stated in order theoretic terms, you take a Besu valuation, which is among a field and a semi-field. Then the unit ball is a Besu ring, the unit ball as I defined it there. And you can recover the valuation that you started with as a generic fiber. That's to say, you localize at zero, at the prime zero, at the left and on the right, and you recover the original valuation. So this is an integral information. This is an integral information. This gives you an integral ring, which such that the genetic fiber is the valuation that you started with. And what is more important, geometry is starting to come up, is that this valuation set up subjective order-preserving correspondence between the ideals, the actual ideals of the unit wall and the K-ideals of the image of the. The image of the unit ball under this vesubal range. And this correspondence preserves prime k ideals. So one observation is that prime k ideals of a ring are just prime ideals. They are all calculative. So you can speak about k spectrum without altering the meaning of spectrum every time you have a ring. So here is the actual correspondence. You take an ideal, you take the image of the ideal under the evaluation, and you take the intersection of all the prime k I of all the k ideals that contain the image. And this is a k ideal. And conversely, if you take an ideal on the image of the unit ball under the valuation, you take the pre-image. So the correspondence is very clear. And well, I have been using tropicalization and empotization as kind of synonyms because we still don't know how to call this operation because it is not really a tropicalization. Tropicalization has a very specific meaning when you have a valuation of rank one. But here we are going to the idempotent world. So maybe idempotent sensation is a better. Maybe idempotessension is a better, a better name, who knows? So, this is telling you that you can copy the spectrum of the affine spectrum of the unit ball just by taking the K ideal generated by the image of the prime. And you land specifically in the k spectrum of the image of the evaluation. And this is a correspondence. It's a correspondence between I would like to say closed subschemes, but I need a shift in order to talk about closed sub-schemes in the sense of algebraic geometry. But this sends ideals of X, of a spec of the unit ball into ideals of K ideals, sorry, of Of the space, which is the idempotization. And what is interesting is that you don't get anything more. I mean, every K-ideal on the left side, right-hand side is realized by something which is non-artificial. And this is frequently the problem with combinatorics. When you do combinatorics and you start working just using combinatorics, forgetting about the algebraic part, you sometimes get more than you than. Sometimes get more than you want. And the work is filtering out the new objects, like to take them away just to work with the objects that you want to keep, which in this case are the algebraic things. So, here this is a homeomorphism if I equip both of them with the Sariski topology. Now, let me get back to some. Back to some particular case of this correspondence theorem is by Rompangy. And this is a generalization of the classical setting that we have for valuation rings. Valuation rings, we know that they are local and the primes are chained. It is a chain of length R, the height of the ring. And this, if you go from valuation domains to Besu domains, then Besu domains are no longer local. So the spectrum of a Besu domain has more geometry. And it is not so far away from valuation domains. So the classical case of cruel valuations is like the local setting. But again, if you go to a classical book of evaluation theory, you find the correspondence that I express here in terms of prime ideals and ideals of some integral structures. You find it reformulated in terms of segments and isolated groups, which have a complicated set of actions. And if you look at the actions and the object, you don't see them being ideas in some ring. On green. So let me go towards the generalization that I want to introduce. I take a ring and I take the set of finitely generated ideals. This is a semi-ring, which is important if I equip it with the sum of ideals and the usual product of ideals. What is the order? But the order is. What is the order? But the order is that an element is less than or equal than the other if the sum coincides with the rightmost hand object with this J. So this in general, if you take a ring and you take this lattice of idea, of finitely generated ideas, this is not going to be totally ordered. Another concept which I need is proofer, proofer domain. And this will be interesting. I will say why in a couple minutes. I will say why in a couple minutes. A proof is a guy in which non-zero finitely generated ideal is invertible. And see that before I speak about this group or this construction, which is taking R and divided by units. So this is a generalization of this construction, because actually the finitely generated ideals are just formal sums of elements. Formal sums of elements of this quotient. And the ring can be characterized to be Besu if and only if these two constructions agree. So people stopped here, like, okay, I have an object in which I don't have to take formal sums. Sums remain in the set. But if you go a step further, you may find a natural object which is a generalization. Natural object, which is a generalization of this divisible construction. And a useful characterization of profer is that precisely the fraction field of this quotient is integral if and only if R is profer. So this is a more geometric way to say that how far can you go in the chain of the visibility conditions of ring such that the fraction field of this construction actually the ring, the semi-ring can be. The ring, the semi-ring can be injected in the field. So it turns out that profer case, several people have been discussing about these ideas. This is nothing new, but they stop at profer because they have this natural condition that the divisibility ring or the FGID of R embeds into a field. So this is naturally the setting of integral geometry. When you have integral geometry, Integral geometry, when you have integral schemes. And the actual network is that you can perform these constructions for these types of domains, and you get pretty much something which is controlled by a semi field. And here I have some examples which may be new for you, maybe not. But for example, proofer domains do appear in geometry. Domains do appear in geometry. For example, an example is the ring of rational polynomials such that sends the integers to the integers. This guy is proofer, but it is not Besu. In algebraic geometry, the ring of regular functions of a smooth algebraic affine curve is dead-kind. And in analytic geometry, a striking example has to be with holomorphic functions of non-compact Riemann surfaces. So these guys appear in geometry and they. Appear in geometry, and the initial idea was to apply this kind of technology to try to understand what's going on combinatorially. But then we realized that this was an artificial restriction because you can do these kind of ideas for any ring. So I will just produce the definition of semi-ring, which is lattice order. Ring which is lattice order, you have a semi-ring and you have a lattice structure. This is equivalent to have a supremum and infimum. And you need that the supremum to be the sum and some compatibility condition between the product and the infimum. And morphisms of these structures are morphisms of semi-rings, are morphisms of rings that send zero to zero and one to one. So examples of So, examples of these constructions are the semi-ring FGID that I introduced, and also the lattice of ideals of a ring and the lattice of K I DLs of a lattice order semi-ring. So the last statement is non-trivial. You have to do something to show that this operation transfers to the lattice of ideals of k ideals, I'm sorry. So you can turn this operation into a function. Turn this operation into a functor. As I said, you take a ring and you associate this semi-ring of finitely generated ideas. And then if you have a map between rings, you take generators for your ideal and you take the idea generated by the generators. And this is independent from the generators chosen. So this is the starting point to shiftify this and globalize this. I just need. I just need a couple more technical remarks before presenting you the final construction. If you have a ring, then sending an element to the principal ideal generated by that element is a multiplicative valuation. Again, in the sense that I described before. Moreover, there is a nice commutative. There is a nice commutative diagram that happens when you take a morphism of rings using these valuations with the corresponding morphisms between idempotent seminal rings. And here is the first theorem, which is an affine version. This is a generalization of romp and g for the case of besu domains. Here you don't have a field, you just you keep the You keep the integral structure, so to say, you keep the ring, and you don't have a field or a semi-field in which you can work. But this is not difficult to show. If you take a ring and you take the lattice of ideals, as I said before, K ideals for a ring, K is vacuous. I mean, every ideal is K ideal in a ring. On the other hand, On the other hand, you take the cancellative ideals of your semi-ring and the same map sending an ideal to the K-ideal generated by each image and sending a K-ideal to the pre-image under this projection is a correspondence of lattice order semi-rings. Now, Now, there is an article by Laszlo Fuchs and Raquel Reyes of 2003, which you can use to show properties of this correspondence. For example, you can show that the spectrum of R or R being a ring is homeomorphic to the K spectrum of this guy. I mean, the K prime ID. I mean the k prime ideals of F G I D R also this correspondence commutes with taking the radical of an ideal so there is a concept of rush of radical of a k ideal and this construction sends a radical ideal to its radical and also preserves minimal primes. There is a concept of minimal prime for cancellative ideals of a semi-ring. Of a semi-ring. And this correspondence preserves primes, in particular, minimal primes in particular respects primary ideals. And there may be other properties preserved under this correspondence, but this is so far what we have. And now the shifification, the shifification is really easy to do. What you do is to take the presheave that you would take. I mean, you have a ring with a sheaf, you take sections of your sheaf over an open set. Your sheaf over an open set, and then you take the finitely generated ideals of the sections. And the option is that if you take the associated sheaf of the civification of this pre-sheaf, it gives you what you want. It gives you a sheaf of idempotent semi-rings on the mirror, which is something like the perfectoid correspondence that Gabriel told us about. But this is the affine case, right? This is just for a ring. For a ring. And what is important is that the stock of this sheaf is naturally somorphic to the FGID of the stock. And since we have this correspondence and this correspondence respects primes and the lattice, we get immediately that this is a local, a k-local idempotent semi-ring. And so when you have k-locality or locality stocks which are local, you can do vanishing order. You can do vanishing, order of vanishing of regular sections, and you can do pretty much algebraic geometry. I'm near the end of the talk, so I will spend the last minutes talking about the globalization of this statement. So, the next question is: if this isomorphism of Isomorphism of semi-rings can be shifified to get to now that I have a shift, I can theoretically at least speak about coherent shifts and quasi-coherent shift of ideals, etc. So the next question is, can you do, can you extend the definition of the correspondence, shifify the correspondence between ideals? And this brings us to discussion of modules over semi-rings. Modules over semi-ring. So again, to take a semi-ring and what is another module, and pretty much you just forget that you have addition. I mean, everything goes down as you are already used to. I just forget that my monoid is a group. I have the action of the semi-ring on the monoid. Of the semi-ring on the monoid, and I just impose this artificial condition that zero has to annihilate any element because this is not automatic. And now I can perform a similar construction for modules as I did for ring for ideas. I take a ring and a module, and I consider the set of finitely generated modules endowed with the sum. Endowed with the sum, which is the sum of submodules. And the action of a finitely generated ideal is just a natural action. So this gives me an action of FGIDR on the FGSM of M. And this is just the technology that one would use to try to do this kind of stuff. Unfortunately, we haven't had the time to do it, but this is in... But this is in a radar. Finally, there is this way to translate the shift that you have in your affine scheme to push it towards the tropical or the idempotent shift. And you just take a section over an open set and then take the principal ideal generated by the stock. And you take all the stocks. All the all the stocks defined in this way, and you can show that this is this lands in the tropical or the idempotent shift defined over the same open set. So, this is tropical vanishing. And this gives you a way to put that notion into a firm algebraic setting. So, just to end, To end the discussion before going to the global thing, what I did or what we did is I give you an affine scheme and I construct a pair, a mirror pair, which is made out of combinatorial objects and a sheaf over that set. This is a topological space, topological space naturally isomorphic to the Isomorphic to the space in which the scheme is supported, and it has a sheaf of identpotent semi-rings with local stocks. And I have a pair of morphisms that sends a prime ideal to the prime ideal generated to the prime k idea or the to the ideal generated by k ideal generated by this image and sends sections to the principal ideal generated. The principal idea generated by the stocks. And this is naturally, this could be called a tropicalization because you are going from the algebraic setting to the idempotent setting in a schematic way. Now, to end my talk, we haven't been able to extend this globally in an organic way. I mean, we don't know how to, if I take a scheme, which is I take a scheme which is non-affine, I don't know, we don't know how to construct this X dagger space, as in the affine case. In the affine case, you just take prime K ideals of H F G I D of R and you are good to go. But here, when the scheme is non-affine, we don't know how to do it. So we opted rather than construct the space, just put and supplementary structure on the scheme. And what I'm saying is that this. And what I'm saying is that this shifification that I introduced here, the tropical shift, I mean, you take the thing that you would take global sections over an open set, take FGID of the stocks, and then shiftify this. The tally space associated to take the FGID of the stocks. This construction works for the non-affine case. So if you have a non-affine scheme. So, if you have a non-affined scheme, you can perform this shiftification of this shift, and you find yourself in another structure, which is this OX drop. We are not calling OXDAC because we don't have XDAC in this non-affine case. And then you end up with the scheme endowed with a sheaf of idempotent semi-rings with local stocks and a way to go from your sheaf to this new object. To this new object, and this is the definition that we have: the tropical or idempotent or idempotization structure of a scheme. You take a scheme, it is what I said, it is the shift, the shiftification of the tile space of FGID of the stocks of the review shift. And the map is defined over there. And this works for any scheme. Any scheme. There is no restriction whatsoever. Where there could be some special stuff is for trying to glue closed-up schemes for non-Netarian schemes using this technology, but this is something that remains unexplored for the time. And just to finish, so the next question is to see if you can do first. If you can do first for quasi-coherent shifts of ideas and then for coherent modules, quasi-coherent modules, and just as far as you can go. Thank you very much. Any questions for the speaker? I'm curious about this. Is this? Is this K construction an equivalence between sort of classes of semi-rings and affine tropical schemes or some sort? Yes. And that's the content of the work of Rompangi. So it looks like for Besu rings, this is close to an equivalence modular localization. Yes. Yes. And then it's another question. Do you ever have the situation where this dagger construction brings two different things together? So far, we don't know because we haven't done much work for non-affine schemes. But for affine schemes, that's not the case because if the schemes are different, Different, the sheaf is different. Yes, exactly. That's the strong point of this construction is that you not get only topology for combinatorics, you get algebraic information. More questions? If there are no more questions, let's thank the speaker again. There are no more questions. Let's thank the speaker again.
