Home, we have found plastic in lots of food and in beer specifically, and then along those lines, plastic has also been found in humans. So, basically everywhere we look, we find plastic. And one area that gets a lot of attention, we know, is plastic pollution in the ocean. And that's largely due to the scale of the problem. So, there's been a lot of work trying to understand: well, we know there's a lot of Understand well, we know there's a lot of plastic going into the ocean every year. What, how much plastic goes into the ocean each year? So, there's been a couple different estimates, and one of the more recent ones puts this number at about 20 million metric tons of plastic leak into the ocean each year. Is this from mismanaged waste or from direct input, say, from the fishing industry? So this is how much plastic is going into the ocean each year. Plastic is going into the ocean each year. And the question is: how much plastic is currently in the ocean? Because we know it doesn't readily degrade. So, one of the estimates puts this at about 300,000 metric tons of plastic floating at the surface of the ocean. And this estimate was made from plots of surface observations and then using those to and ocean, different ocean circulation models to extract. Different ocean circulation models to extrapolate out. And what you notice is that there is a large difference between this input and this, the amount of plastic we think is floating in the ocean. So this has led to kind of this now infamous question of where is the question of the missing plastic or where does all the plastic go? And so this is a question I'm sure lots of people here are working on. And so we know not all of the plastic that makes sense to the ocean is floating at the That makes sense, the ocean is floating at the surface of the ocean. So, the question is: where is it ending up? And so, we have, we know what some of the other sinks are, but we still don't necessarily have exact estimates of their fractions and their rates. But we know plastic is ending up on our coasts and on our beaches. We know it, so one reason it might be leaving the surface of the ocean is because it's being ingested by marine life. It can also be biofouled, which causes it to lose points. Fouled, which causes it to lose buoyancy and settle out. Plastic can also degrade, albeit slowly. So, plastic can photodegrade in the ocean from it can oxidize from sunlight. So, it might be that that's why some of the we're not measuring some of the plastic. Along those lines, we might not be measuring the smallest pieces of plastic very accurately. So, plastic does fragment. So, it might be that we're just missing. So, it might be that we're just missing some of the smaller pieces, which are harder to measure. Along those lines, plastic is also being mixed below the surface of the ocean, which makes it harder to measure as when it's mixed deeper in the water column. And then it's also sinking to the bottom of the ocean, whether because it enters the ocean directly as negatively buoyant plastic or because it biofouls and loses buoyancy and sinks. Fouls and loses buoyancy in six. And so, a lot of these are questions of transport. I mean, this is a very interdisciplinary question. There's chemistry and biology and physical oceanography. And what I've been interested in is the more small-scale physics and how the properties of the plastic themselves affect their transport and when we need to consider that. So, in particular, the plastics that I think about are mainly microplastics. So, much of the plastic. So, much of the plastic in the ocean exists as these small particles or microplastics that can either enter, plastic can either enter directly as microplastics or they can break down from larger plastic debris. And one of the kind of accepted definitions is plastic that is less than five millimeters in size is a microplastic. And you can see they're very non-spherical, and their density also varies depending on their source material. So, because of these. Material. So, because of these properties, it means there are forces on the particle like drag and lift and buoyancy, and that can cause these particles to deviate from the path of a flow tracer. So, here's our little idealized microplastic particle. And if you assume, your simplest assumption might be that the particle follows the flow exactly. So, in that case, you might get one trajectory. But there are forces on this particle which On this particle, which even if they're very small, it can cause the particle to deviate from the flow tracer just a little bit instantaneously. And even if that is small instantaneously, if you're interested in transport, then those deviations can add up. And so it can be important sometimes to consider these forces on the particle, especially if you're interested in transport. And so this has kind of been the theme of. This has kind of been the theme of my work. And microplastics are one type of particle you find in the ocean, but there are a lot of other particulates in the ocean that have been long studied. So for example, phytoplankton are you can also imagine as small non-spherical particles in the ocean, sediment as well. And we have developed a lot of techniques for modeling and studying these different particles. And the question is, how can we apply these techniques? Is how can we apply these techniques to microplastics? So, first, let's see how microplastics compare to other particles that have historically been studied in the ocean. So, I put this schematic together, and so let me walk you through it. What we have is particle diameter versus specific gravity. So, we have dimensional versus dimensionless, which isn't great, I know, but we've got We've got. Um, I've tried to approximate where different particles fall in the space. So we've got sediment over here all the way to the right. It's negative, it's really heavy, it's negatively buoyant, and it can be, you know, as small as silt and clay particles all the way up to sands. And on the other side, we have it very positively buoyant. We've got bubbles and they're extremely positively buoyant. And here is like a typical size range you might see, say, under. Size range you might see, say, under a breaking wave. Oil droplets are slightly more dense than bubbles, but still positively buoyant, and they depend on that depends on the type of oil, say if you're looking at oil spill. Phytoplankton are very close to, are typically very close to neutrally buoyant, but can also cover a range of scales. And then I put marine snow on here, which can form large sediment, organic material, can form. Or sediment, organic material can form these large aggregates that are very porous, so they have low density, but they could be very large. And then here in pink, I put microplastics. And what we can see is that what's challenging about microplastics is that they can cover this large range of scales. They can be both positively and negatively buoyant, and they're not necessarily, they don't necessarily overlap with so many particles we've historically studied. So that makes them different. So that makes them different. And another thing that I didn't plot here is particle shape. So we know that bubbles and oil droplets, you can kind of assume are spherical. Byoplankton can be diverse in their shapes, as well as marine snow. You get these big funky aggregates. But so microplastics also, their shape can vary from fibers to pellets and kind of in fragments. Of in fragments, so it's more than just the density and diameter, and that makes microplastics this unique particle that we need to kind of develop methods to model and study. Okay, so this is these are the particles. Now, it's predicting microplastic transport in the ocean. You need to understand both something about the particles and also the hydrodynamics and the way the The way the fluid is transporting these particles. So, this is this great figure from this review paper that I think many people here are co-authors on, which shows the many different processes, physical processes that these microplastics can be subjected to. And so, there's really large-scale mesoscale circulation and smaller, some mesoscale. And smaller sub-mesoscale processes down to smaller wave and turbulent mixing. So there are many scales of these processes that affect microplastic transport. And as we zoom in on the smaller and smaller scale processes, the forces on the particles and their properties will become more important. So the question is: what controls, how do we think about the four About the forces on the particle, and how do we decide when these are important and when they need to be considered? So, the question is, are microplastics tracer particles? And the way that we normally estimate this is with a non-dimensional parameter called the Stokes number. So, the Stokes number here is probably familiar to many of you, but to review, it's a But to review, it's a ratio of time scales. So you can think of it as the ratio of the particle's relaxation or reaction time scale to the relevant time scale of the flow. And so if the Stokes number is very small, then the particles react almost instantaneously to the flow and they can be approximated as tracers. When the Stokes number is non-zero, when it approaches one or is greater than one, then those Greater than one, then those the particle inertia becomes more important, and the particle doesn't react instantaneously to the flow, and there's some lag to change its dynamics. And so this is a function not only of the particles, but also of the flow. And there was this, another Rudy paper, which tried to estimate the Stokes number of microplastics under different scenarios. So I'll just show a little bit from that. From that. But what they estimate is that in the ocean mixed layer down away from the free surface, the Stokes number of your microplastics particles might be about 10 to the minus 3 or 10 to the minus 2. But as you approach the surface where there's, if say you're in a breaking wave region or high wind shear, when you have strong turbulence, then the Stokes number can go up and the particle inertia can be more important. So this kind of gives us a frame. So, this kind of gives us a framework of when the particle inertia and these the tracer assumption might break down and when the particle inertia is important. So actually, I've done a lot of work considering when these particles have finite Stokes numbers, but for this talk, we're mostly going to consider small Stokes number particles where we can start with the tracer assumption. Start with the tracer assumption. Okay, so this gives us how we can a framework for thinking about particle inertia. But the title of my talk was, excuse me, talking about particle shape. So how do we think about particle shape and is that important? So we know our microplastic particles are typically non-spherical. And now Spherical. And now, when our particles are non-spherical, not only do we have forces on the particle, so here is, you know, we have drag force, gravity, buoyancy, and then different acceleration forces from the differential acceleration of the fluid in the particle, but there's also torques on the particle. And their drag coefficient and different resistance coefficients are now a function both of the particle shape and the A function both of the particle shape and the orientation. So, this can now further complicate everything. But what we can do is we can at least start by idealizing our problem a little bit by making some idealized non-spherical particles, which are spheroidal. So, in this case, we can think of our non-spherical particles as a sphere that's either kind of elongated like a long rod or squashed down like a disc. Broad or squashed down like a disc. And we can then characterize the shape with an aspect ratio or this normalized eccentricity. And so for my PhD work, I focused a lot on studying how these non-spherical sphero, these like ellipsoidal microplastic particles behave in surface gravity waves. Because surface gravity waves are important to say plastic transport. Important to say plastic transport on the toes and at the surface. And so, what you what I'm just going to touch on one major finding from that work as an example of when particle shape is important. So, what you can, what I did in this work was I considered the orientation of particles in surface waves. And this is a video that maybe a lot of you have seen. That maybe a lot of you have seen, where we're going to look at how a particle reorients under surface waves. So, this blue line here is the free surface, and then you can see the orientation with the shadows. What you can see is that as this particle moves with this wave, it's being reoriented, and its orientation is slowly changing to kind of align with the waves. And what it's doing is it's actually settling onto some stable orientation. Stable orientation. And the major finding from this work was that waves cause particles to preferentially orient. And if you're interested in learning more about why this happens or I would be happy to discuss it throughout the week at Gathertown, but for now we're just going to skip to the conclusion is that waves cause these particles to have some preference. Waves cause these particles to have some preferential orientation. So, we're seeing this interaction between the flow and the particle shape. And so, now the question is: how does this affect transport? And one important transport property of a particle in the ocean, say, is its settling velocity. You're considering some negatively buoyant particle that's being transported with the flow event, and you want to know where it'll eventually settle out. You need some. Settle out, you need some estimate of its settling velocity. So, what we can, the question is: how does the orientation and the shape affect the particle settling velocity? So, what I've done here is we're going to step through this plot here where we were looking at particle shape and settling velocity. And settling velocity. And the on so the shape is the eccentricity, which is just a normalized aspect ratio. But so zero here is a spherical particle. One is a very long rod. And minus one is a more disk, a very flat disk particle. And what we're going to look at is the settling velocity and the settling velocity of a particle normalized by that of an equation. Normalized by that of an equivalently sized sphere. So, say you have some microplastic particles and you want to predict their settling velocity. You can start with just the easiest assumption is that they're all spherical particles. And in that case, then you'll all of these particles, if they all have the same volume, same mass, they'll all have the same settling velocity, this one line. So see here, I'm normalizing it by this equivalently sized sphere model. sized sphere model. And next what we can do is we consider the fact that these particles are not spheres, but make no assumptions about their orientation. So that's what I applied here. So this is a map of all possible settling velocities under all possible orientations of particles. And this is assuming a laminar Stokes flow around the particle. And so what we see is that the closer you are. That the closer you are, the more spherical you are, the less variation there is in settling velocity with regards to orientation. That makes sense, it's very spherical, there's not that much change in the drag coefficient to orientation. As you get more non-spherical, there's a lot more change in settling velocity is much more sensitive to orientation. And in some orientations, you can actually settle faster than the sphere, and that's because, say, you're like in a more aerodynamic orientation. But then at some point, But then, at some limit, you're so non-spherical, you have so much surface area that you have so much resistance, and you always settle slower than the equivalently sized sphere. Okay, so this is all possible combinations, but then what we can do is we can also say, well, what value should I use my model? And you can make a simple assumption, which is that the particles are randomly oriented. And so maybe there's some turbulence mixing these particles, and you predict they might. Predict they might have some random orientation distribution. And so, in that case, we get this dashed line here. And what we see is that as the particles are more non-spherical, of course, the selling velocity goes down. And also, it's always less, this orientation is always, this selling velocity is always less than that of the equivalently sized sphere. So it's always less than one. And then finally, I told you that in Finally, I told you that we found that surface waves induce this preferential orientation of particles. So we can, in the randomly orienting case, maybe that's the high turbulence stochastic orientation scenario. And then we can also imagine the scenario with strong waves where the waves might be forcing these particles into their preferential orientation. And in that case, we can also predict what the settling velocity would be. Settling velocity would be. And what we see is that in this case, it's always less than that of the random orientation. And so, what that means is that the wave-induced preferential orientation tends to minimize this particle satellite velocity. It tends to kind of elongate the particles and put them in a horizontal position. Okay, so what we see is that the shape and the orientation of the particle can Of the particle can, and the assumptions we make about its orientation can affect, say, our settling velocity prediction. And if this is, hopefully this piqued your interest a little bit, but if you're looking, I've been working on studying these shape and inertial effects with different collaborators who will be talking about that work this week. So look out for that. They didn't leave me much to talk about. Me much to talk about, but so uh, so hopefully that helps um kind of give you a framework for particle shape and inertial effects. Okay, so, and look forward to those talks. Okay, switching gears, let's go back to this slide. So, lots of processes that are important and relevant, and what we're going to do. And what we're going to do is we're going to focus on just one, and we're going to think about this vertical mixing. So, this vertical mixing of microplastics at the ocean surface. And so, you can imagine we've got some buoyant particles now. We're thinking about buoyant particles, which are being, they have some buoyancy, so they rise to the surface, but there's some mixing mechanism moving, also redistributing them. And so, we're going to think about kind of general turbulent mixing due to, say, wind forcing, but there's break. Due to say wind forcing, but there's breaking wave, breaking waves can cause turbulence and vertical mixing, and there's language circulation, language turbulence, large convective cells. But we're going to neglect a lot of those things and just think about kind of some idealized mixing. And so one reason you might want to study the vertical mixing of microplastics is, so remember I said particles can photodegrade from sunlight? Can photodegrade from sunlight. And so the light decays with depth. So the vertical position of a particle will control how much sunlight it feels. And therefore, vertical mixing is then linked to degradation. And vertical mixing is also linked to horizontal transport because the ocean surface is sheared. And I really like this study where they were able to measure the shear over centimeters to meters. Centimeters to meters at the ocean surface and showed how incredibly sheered the horizontal currents can be. So, if you were to move up and down just a couple centimeters of microplastic, you would feel you would have strong differential transport. So, in this way, these small changes in particle vertical distribution can affect larger scale. Can affect larger-scale processes like degradation and horizontal transport. Okay, so another reason to study this vertical distribution is when thinking about measurements. So most microplastics measurements are taken by nets or historically have been taken by net toes at the free surface. And these observations are only representative of the free surface, but we know that. Free surface, but we know that the microplastics can be vertically mixed. So, to kind of interpret and extrapolate out these observations, there's been different modeling efforts done to kind of understand and model this vertical distribution. And one very successful model that's used often to extrapolate these observations is the swind mixing model from Cocolca et al. in 2012. At all in 2012. And so, what this model assumes is that you have buoyant particles under some turbulent mixing. And you assume that the rides velocity of these particles is constant and that the turbulent mixing is constant, which is parameterized here with some eddy viscosity or like an eddy diffusivity. It's really an eddy diffusivity. And you can Adhesivity. And you can solve for what this concentration profile would look like at equilibrium. And what you get is that this concentration profile decays exponentially at the depth. So in this exponential decay, this profile decays exponentially with the length scale Ln here, so a mixing length scale, which is the eddy viscosity divided by the rise velocity. Divided by the rise velocity. So the higher the rise velocity of the particles, the more concentrated they are at the free surface, whereas the higher the turbulence, the eddy viscosity parameter is, the more they're mixed down. Makes sense. So how is this used in practice? So say you're taking a net toe of microplastics and you're measuring only the free surface, but you want to extrapolate out to get the toe. Out to get the total amount of microplastics. So you can construct a correction factor where you multiply how much you measure by this correction factor to get the total microplastics in the water column, or at least near the free surface. So we're going to consider a very construed example where, say, we've got some moderate conditions and using And using, you know, extrapolating from our wing conditions, we get some use, some friction velocity, and then we can infer any viscosity. And so some moderate conditions. And then we look at our microplastic particles and we find that they're about one millimeter in size on average. So the question is, what's the correction factor? What's the correction factor for our observations? So, we can start by assuming that these particles are spherical particles. In that case, we'll get some rise velocity measurement and we can get a correction factor. So, in this case, that means we multiply our observation, our measured plastics by 2.5 to get the total amount of plastic in the water ball. But we might look at our microplastic particles and say, well, maybe they're And say, well, maybe they're actually, these are more mainly measuring fragments, so they're more disk-like. So they're non-spherical. In that case, we can start by just assuming we'll make no assumptions about their orientation. So if we use the rise velocity for disks in a random orientation, we get a lower rise velocity and then a higher fraction factor. We can also assume, well, maybe these particles were not so randomly oriented. Maybe they were closer to their wave. Maybe they were closer to their wave-induced orientation. And in that case, you get, we can get the rise velocity goes down and then this correction factor goes up. So with this, again, I want to illustrate how the assumptions you make about the particle size and or the particle shape and orientation can affect even the way we interpret our observations. So not only do So, not only do we need to know the hydrodynamics very well, which is challenging, right? This, I just, this eddy viscosity will have a lot of uncertainty, but also have some measure of the, we need to understand how the particles act in these flips. Okay, so a handful of studies have now measured this vertical distribution in the ocean, and we're going to just talk about one data set. So, these were, this data was collected by SVS. This data was collected by SDA in 2012 in the North Pacific subtropical gyre. And so, in this study, they measured collected microplastics by trawling a net at the surface, and then also using a mockness, which let them get observations at discrete depths. And so they ultimately had a one surface toe and then four depth toes. Toe and then four depth toes. And then all of these microplastics were sorted by students and crew on the ship. And what was really great and what's really interesting about this data set is then they went back and analyzed each individual particle in from those five net toes. So here are some pictures of those microplastic particles and using Raman spectroscopy. And using Raman spectroscopy, they analyzed the polymer type and used imaging to get 2D shape and particle properties and measure the mass. But then they didn't stop there. Then Jess Donahue, who's, I think also in here, went and individually observed the rise velocity of each particle multiple times to get a measurement. Times to get a measurement of its terminal rise velocity in this rise velocity chamber that they had some students build. So lots of man hours went into this data set. And then I just came along just during the analysis part of it because I'm interested in non-spherical particles and microplastics. So this seems like really an interesting and exciting data set. So. So let's look at a little bit of some of the data. So here's a distribution of all of the rise velocities that were measured, that Jess measured. And you see that the lowest, the particles have rise velocities from millimeters per second to centimeters per second. And they're rather log-normally distributed. And so this is all of the data. And we can also plot this. And we can also plot this as rise velocity versus depth. And what we see is that the particles with the highest rise velocity are at the surface, and then the rise velocity of the particles decays with depth. So this makes sense. We expect the most buoyant particles to be at the free surface. But what's interesting too is that the largest change in rise velocity really comes between the surface and the first depth measurement. The rise velocity characteristics of all of the subsurface. Characteristics of all of the subsurface toes don't change as drastically with depth, besides this going from the surface to the first below surface measurement. So we see that there's maybe some sorting going on where there's some surface trapping of these highest rise velocity microplastics. Okay, so this makes sense with our understanding. Let's look a little closer at the particles. And so most common types of these particles were fragments. Types of these particles were fragments and lines. So we've got maybe, you know, our moat are some nice rods and some disk-like particles or fragments. So not only are they different shapes, but they have other different properties as well. So it's not only the shape that is different between these particles. But what we can do is we can separate them and look at the rise velocity by the type of particle. So what we see here is that, so the lines are So, the lines or these fibrous particles have much lower, a much smaller and lower rise velocity distribution than the fragments, which have a much wider distribution and also much higher rise velocities. So this makes sense. These fibers are very non-spherical and also somewhat a lot smaller, so they have less buoyancy, so they have smaller rise velocity. We can further look at this data. So, here I have the rise velocity versus the maximum length scale of the particle for the fragments and the lines. And so sometimes this might be all you measure. You might just have some length scale of the particle. And what we see is that for the fragments, this length scale tracks really well with the rise velocity. The larger the fragment, the more. Fragment, the more buoyancy it has, so the higher its rise velocity. But we see that for the lines, this is relatively, the rise velocity is pretty independent of their size. But that's not all the data that was collected. And we do have some intuition and we do know what physically should control rise velocity. So we can here apply rise velocity versus a ratio of mass to surface area. Mass to surface area. And so we see that the rise velocity that we measured scales with the mass divided by the surface area here. It's a pretty good collapse, but of course, that's not everything that's going on. And there are rise velocity models that exist for microplastics that, and there are also models that exist for very idealized particles, but we don't have all. But we don't have all of the information of the particle, we don't have its 3D volume, we only have 2D 2D properties, so we can't necessarily use like an exact measurement, an exact model for particle rise velocity. But what I wanted to illustrate here with this example is that this mass divided by surface area ratio is not only a measure of how of the size of A measure of how of the size of the particle, but it's also some measure of its shape, right? So if you have large surface area relative to your mass, then you're typically more non-spherical for a particle of the same size. So this, what we see is that it's not only the size of the particles that's important, but there's also some shape information as well. And which Which makes sense with our current understanding of how size and shape should affect rise velocity. Okay, so what else can we measure with this data? So what I've plotted here is kind of shape versus length of the particles. So shape versus size, where shape now is a measure of circularity, where one is very is. One is very circular particle. Remember, these shape properties come from 2D images, and then zero is very non-spherical. And this is just for the fragment pieces, but we see that as they become smaller, they become more circular. And so, this so as the particles become smaller, they lose buoyancy, but they become more, so that will reduce. They become more so that will reduce the rise velocity, but they come more spherical, which can also increase the rise velocity. So, this kind of agrees with different fragmentation models of how plastics might change in size and shape as well. This was really interesting to measure. And then finally, what are we really interested in is this vertical concentration. So, what I've put here is vertical concentration. What I applied here is vertical concentration. So, here is number per volume over depth of all of the microplastics. So, this was the total from the total observations. And you can estimate some eddy viscosity based on assuming from the wind speed and assuming a well-developed sea state, you can get some kind of breath estimate. And what we can do is we can plot now that model and see how well it does. And it does okay, but this. And it does okay, but this distribution is not exponential. So it could be that there's more mixing because there could be that there's some language circulation or language turbulence causing this enhanced mixing of these particles down below. It doesn't agree with this model. But what we can do is we have more information about the microplastics. Here I've lumped them all together, but we expect them, we had assumed a constant rise velocity, and we know that. Assumed a constant rise velocity, and we know that's not accurate. So, here what we can do is look at the concentration of just the high rise velocity particles, and we can plot a model for that. And we see that it's really well approximated by this exponential, this model. Now, we can also plot the low rise velocity microplastics. So, here I've just aggregated them basically by the median between high and low. Between high and low. And we can also try to plot this model as well. And what we see is that this exponential decay well represents the high rise velocity microplastics, but kind of doesn't do as well for the low rise velocity microplastics. And that's because they're a lot closer to a well-mixed distribution. Right, this mixing length now is 10 meters, which is Maybe it's much, it's a larger length scale to assume that you have constant turbulence and constant mixing over. So it could be that the model is starting to break down for these lower rise velocity microplastics. But this was really exciting that we could measure and compare this and how not just having more information about the particle rise velocity. So, what we find is that. So, what we find is that, well, what I'm arguing is that shape is one component affecting rise velocity. We know that, but then shape is also linked to microplastic size and type, and so it can indicate the type and also may be linked to its age. And the high rise velocity microplastics show good agreement with the exponential decay model, while the low rise velocity microplastics are more well mixed. Next. Okay, I've done, I presented a lot, but I've got one more, like, I've got like five more minutes. How's that? Yeah. Okay, so in this scenario, we considered microplastics in the middle of the ocean that have been there for probably a long time and kind of were we were thinking about an equilibrium state. But there's also kind of shorter time scale events where you can. Kind of shorter time scale events where you can get a spill of microplastics and like this point source. And so that is something that unfortunately happens. And one incident was that one recent incident was when this container ship, the Express Pearl, caught on fire and wrecked off the coast of Sri Lanka last year, last May. And this And this, it was carrying, it was a container ship, it was carrying a lot of hazardous materials and industrial products, and also a lot of microplastics, the pre-production pellets or nurdles. A nurdle is like the pre-production pellet. And this, it caught on fire and started spilling lots of things, including the plastic. And these nurses. And these nurdles started washing up on shore in Sri Lanka. Here's a closer picture. And this was actually, it was estimated to be perhaps the largest spill of plastic record. Okay, so there's this team of, there was this response. Was this response? And there was a lot of chemists and oceanographers who were helping advise the response because they were concerned about all of these hazardous chemicals, materials, and also the fact that a lot of this plastic was burnt. So all of this black is that there were these, this burnt plastic. So here's another schematic. So what you can see here is where the ship wrecked, and you started getting plastic. And you started getting plastic washing up on shore. And so there was a response effort to clean it up. And they were collecting data and showing that they were finding nurdles all around the coast of Sri Lanka, but they were only finding these burnt plastic particles right around the ship, the shipwreck. They didn't disperse as much. And so, okay, so looking at these particles, you can see that there's kind of these unbroken. That there's kind of these unburnt, pristine, spherical nurdles, and these more burnt nurdles they get change in their shape, is one of the main, one of the obvious characteristics. They get darker. And these, this team was wondering how they noticed that these particles changed in shape and that there was this differential transport. And so they Transport and so they were wondering if the shape of the particles was what was controlling that differential transport. So that's how I got involved because I study these non-spherical microplastic particles. And so what we can think about kind of as an idealized model. So say we've got our unburnt nurdle, and then if we consider that this nurdle is burning and it's changing in shape and assume nothing And it's changing in shape, and assume nothing else changes. So we might say then that this spherical particle will have a higher eyes velocity, the burnt nurdle will have a lower eyes velocity, and that means we'd expect the burnt nurdles to be more easily vertically mixed. And therefore, we'd expect more dispersal of the burnt nurdles rather than the unburnt nurdles. But that's not really what we saw. We saw the opposite. We saw the burnt nurdles weren't dispersed as much. And so this could be due to a lot. And so this could be due to a lot of things. It could be due maybe to the, you know, there were different sources of where the particles were coming from. It could, there could, but we were also wondering how important it was that these particles properties change and how that could affect their transport. Okay, so most of the burnt neurals that were being picked up on the ocean surf on the beach were very small. On the beach were very small, but then there were these large agglomerations that were also observed. And these large agglomerations would have very large increased buoyancy. So what our final hypothesis was for this differential transport was that if we have some kind of sheared onshore current and we have particles, we'll have these large burnt agglomerations near the free surface. Agglomerations near the free surface. They'll be transported onshore quicker, so less time to disperse. But then, once onshore, because they are now more brittle, they've been burned, they're much easy. They're a lot more brittle. They would break up in people's hands when they were picking them up. They broke down to smaller pieces, which is why they were mostly observed as much smaller particles. So this is. So, this is the cleanup for this is still ongoing. They're trying to, and not just from the plastics, but all of these hazardous materials that have been spilled, we'll probably be dealing with it for a while. And those small burnt plastic particles were even harder to pick up because they kind of just disintegrated into smaller and smaller pieces. So, but what we see is that. were what we see is that in this case, maybe it probably wasn't the shape, but rather the size of the particles that was causing this differential transport. Okay, that's it. That's my final slide. So question, is shape important to plastic transport? I would say yes, and other, so are all the other properties of the plastic. And that microplastics have. That microplastics have diverse characteristics, which can result in differential transport. This is a video. Thanks. Happy to take questions. Wonderful. Thank you so much, Michelle. So in terms of asking questions, just so we don't have a ton of people interrupting each other, can I ask you either to raise your hand using the reactions in Zoom or just type a question in chat? Or just type a question in chat. And while people are composing their thoughts, I'll have a question for you, Michelle. In a lot of what you talked about, you didn't address directly the density of the particles. And in particular, what I'm thinking of is the particle Reynolds number and how that also influences things. Can you just talk about that a bit? Yeah, so that's definitely important. And what's interesting is that, so in a lot of the analysis, I assume the particles have very small renal. Assume the particles have very small Reynolds number, so you can use linear drag. But for those, we can calculate the particle Reynolds number directly from the rise velocity measurements and the size. And actually, all of those particles have Reynolds number from like one to 300. So they're very much intermediate and non-linear drag particles. So it's definitely. So it's definitely important. We have a question from Baylor. Hi, Michelle. That was really interesting. I have questions about the sorting in the water column between the fast rise velocities and the slow. What were the conditions under which they were sorted? Like, were there waves? Were there high winds, low winds? You know, that, you know, those centimeter per second velocities can occur. Per second velocities can occur, but depending on conditions, right? Yeah, so it was, I think, the winds were 17 knots. It was a Beaufort five scale condition. And does that answer your question? I wasn't there. Yeah, it does. I mean, it does actually, because that's you would expect if you had that much wind that you would. Expect if you had that much wind that you would get pretty substantial vertical mixing, even at a centimeter per second scale. So it's surprising that it was still so well sorted, even though there was so much mixing going on. So that is really interesting. Yeah, I agree. So Francois has a question, but before going to him, I just, there's a comment by Jeff Kosef in the chat, which just points out that the burnt noodles might have a different density. So they. So they didn't, well, they tested that. So I never got any samples. They all went to Woods Hole, but they tested to see if their density changed and it did not really substantially. Okay. Francois, how about your question? I just wanted to make sure I understood. So when you say that the burn particles form bigger aggregates or something like that, this is formed during burning, right? And then presumably once they're at sea, they Presumably, once they're at sea, they will slowly break down, but even more so when they reach the beach. Is that right? Yeah, because these, I mean, the plastic, the pre-production pellets are made to be melted together when they're processed. So they do, you know, melt together very readily. But it was just because, I guess they were being observed as smaller pieces on the beach. So it was hard to know that what was happening beforehand. And so we still don't entirely. So we still don't entirely know, but yeah, okay. Just out of curiosity, is there any chance that color matters? In particular, if the dark ones are heated by the sun, they might act as a source of heat and rise because of that, and the white ones might not? So I don't know if the thermal expansion of the plastic would, oh, or I guess not just the expansion, but just if it would heat the water around it. I'm not, I don't know if that would be strong enough. know if that would be strong enough at those uh at those time scales but i guess i could do you could do a back of the envelope calculation and see if it support it yeah okay thanks you have a question yes thank you for the talk michelle it was a very nice talk i have a question about the repartition of microplastic uh with the data you said that the writing velocity is depends on the shape but is the diffusivity so But the diffusivity should also depend. No, you consider diffusivity that is constant. Yes, yes, exactly. The diffusivity probably definitely depends on the shape. I agree that could definitely be something. So there's only so much data. There's only so many ways to partition it before you kind of lose enough. So it's kind of hard to bolt. Blues enough, so it's kind of hard to both separate by rise velocity and shape and still get out something meaningful. But do you know any work that focuses on the diffusivity as function of the shape or something like that? Well, there is a lot in boundary layers flow, right? Maybe there's been some work also. This is maybe what Lucy will talk about too this week. Will talk about too this week, I think. If I but yes, that's likely definitely something that's important. Okay. Thank you. But hard to test in this data. Kai also put a question in the chat. Is the work done in the Gulf of Maine published? Oh, so it's not in the Gulf of Maine. That was just a mock nest picture I like stole from. picture I like stole from the Gulf of Maine because I liked it. It was in the, it has not been published, it's in prep. It's this, it will be published. Where's Kira? I can't see all the faces. Actually though, Michelle, the vertical distribution profiles I think were published in Brunner et al, which is a follow-on to the Kukalka paper. So the certain So, certainly, the full analysis you presented is not yet published. But if you're just looking for the vertical profiles, you can look in Brenner et al. I'll put the link in the chat. I want every note that I've been taking copious notes during these talks, and the plan is to take these notes and they will be put onto these documents that you'll see in Gather Town, which will initiate our theme discussion later on. So, again, when Kara puts that. So, again, when Kara puts that citation up on chat, I'll add that to the notes I've taken. Thank you. We have another question in the chat from Akenschka. I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly. The question is, does the orientation of the particle in surface waves affect the Stokes drift? I guess that's the feedback side of it. And also, what is the sample size of micro particles that you've used to calculate the rise velocity? So, does the do the uh so does the do the so do the particles affect the wave stokes drift or the stokes drift of the particles it's phrased that it's a feedback so do the particles affect the stokes drift of the waves as opposed to what you certainly expect the stokes drift to affect the particles but is the converse true i think that's the question uh so not i wouldn't think likely and under normal conditions the particles aren't in high enough densities but uh yeah Yeah, during that nurdle spill, though, the plastic particles were found like two meters deep on the beach. There was a lot of high densities of plastic there. So, maybe in that regime, you might affect the waves. And then, was the sample size and microplastic used for calculating the rise velocities? So, is that in? I'm not sure what that's in reference to. I can't, can you turn on your mic and maybe ask the question in person? Mike, can maybe ask the question in person? Yes, hi. Actually, the first question I wanted to ask you: let's suppose we have a particle on the surface, and let's suppose the particle will move X meter in T time. So if you have a, in place of, you have a different orientation or different shape of a particle, thus it will take the same time for covering a X distance. If it's on a free surface, If it's on the free surface, that's a really good question that I know people here have studied. You can get enhanced transport, that's Ton and Ross, enhanced transport from particles floating at the surface. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I have read the paper. Yeah. So because of buoyancy, there's Stokes rat will change. Yeah. Yeah. And also if it's the particle is buoyant and submerged, which maybe Nimish will talk about, you can also get. Mandy Nimish will talk about, you can also get enhanced stove strip too. But if it's negatively buoyant, you would get reduced stokes drift. We believe. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. That was a really lovely overview, Michelle. Perfect way to start off the workshop, especially addressing the fundamentals for an audience that may not be well versed in these things. I think you did a great job. So thanks again. What we're going to do at this point, we're actually going to break a bit early. At this point, we're actually going to break a bit early, and that's so that those of you who have not yet tried out to log into Gather Town can do so now, and that's really just to get through that opening phase when you enter Gathertown. It puts you through a training session that takes a few minutes. And so, if you haven't done that yet, can you just go through that training session before the break? And that way, when we actually leave to our theme discussions, we'll all be there without. All be there without too much of a pause. So, we're going to take a break right now and we'll come back at 10 past 10 mountain time, so probably 15 minutes from now. And look forward to seeing you back for our next talk by Terry Omke.
