All right. Well, welcome everybody to this online kickoff of our workshop, Women in Mathematical Physics 2. Just to remind everybody, I put in the chat the links to our website, also to the BIRS website. So that contains, this chew contains all the information concerning our workshop, schedule, everything. Everything. And I mean, if you have any questions, please do let us know. I am Angard. I mean, for the online side, and Katrina, Gail and Neshla they are on duty and the in-person side. So, I don't know, let's just start. It is my absolute pleasure to have today Silvi Paisha from the University of Potsdam, who is telling us a little bit, well, she's talking. A little bit. Well, she's talking today about two different things. Let's start with the first one: Women in Mathematics from Around the World: A Gallery of Portraits. Sylvie, off to you. Thank you, Anna Ros, and thank you to Nejler, of course, whom I'm not seeing now. I hope she's sleeping because if she's in Canada, it better be the case. And thank you to you all for being there. So I'm going to present an exhibition. Some of you might have. Exhibition: some of you might have seen, or I hope will see soon if this is not the case. And it started in Europe and it's now expanded with some portraits of women from countries outside Europe. So that's why it's called Women in Maths from Around the World, a gallery of portraits. So it's a short story of an adventure which started in 2014. Started in 2014, and it started with 13 portraits. Now we've reached 23, and there will be more very soon. And Noel, whose name you see down here, you'll see her again, is the photographer responsible for these beautiful photographs. Both of us together have been curating with some help at the starting points, a starting point of. Starting points, a starting point of the exhibition in 2016. So it all started for me personally in 2013. You might have heard of or met Sharou Goel. I didn't know her at the time. She got in touch with me by email saying, could you give a talk in Konstanz, in the south of Germany, on women in On women in mathematics. And I was, I didn't feel I was really competent for that. I'm a woman and I work in maths, but I'm not specially educated to talk about women in mathematics. I'm not a sociologist, etc. So I was about to say no, and then I thought, well, what I can do is talk subjectively on a subjective level about my experience. My experience since I'm a woman practicing mathematics. So I got in touch with women who had left a strong impression on me as I met them in different countries of the world. And the list is here on the right, coming from different countries. And so I just got in touch with them, a simple email saying, I'm giving a talk. Email saying, I'm giving a talk soon in Constance, and I wondered whether you would mind answering a few questions, sending me a photograph, and I would talk about you at this meeting in Konstanz. And so I thought, you know, they will be too busy, they won't spare the time, but they did. They all answered, and so I could do it. So I could do it, and it became a little booklet, which I think I still have in a PDF form somewhere. And then this was the starting point for a more ambitious program. So wait a minute, I'm trying to turn the page. Ah, what's happening now? Why can't I turn the ah, yes, now? So the first steps. Well, after that project, which was really, you know, very kind of an unprofessional, I talked to a friend, a filmmaker, asking her if she thought it would be a good idea to film some of these women. I find these women and most women I meet in maths quite exceptional. Exceptional due to the fact that they've often had to fight quite a bit to get to where they've reached to in their career. And so I thought it was worth, you know, the effort and making a portrait, but maybe a more lengthy one on some of them. But this friend, a filmmaker, said, no, no, no, I don't think it's a good idea. But there's an EC. But there's an ECM, European Arts Conquest, coming up. And I think you could take this opportunity to set up an exhibition with photographs. So do you have a friend, photographer? I said, well, yes, I know someone, but I'm sure she'll say no, she has nothing to do with math. And so I asked Noel, this friend, and she said yes. And so then that. Yes, and so then that started this long adventure. So Agnes Handberg is this filmmaker, and Noel is the photographer. And these are the people who helped me initially. Sarah is part of this warm up project, maybe indirectly, but so she's based in Bali right now, Magdalena Georgescu. Agdalina Jorgescu. I'm not sure where she is now. She was in Israel at some point. Alexander Antoniuk, who is in Ukraine, who has been through a tough time recently because of the war in Ukraine. And these are the 13 mathematicians on the left, some of whom were in this original project, like Jushanka Perisic from Serbia and Serbia, and there's one or two more, Karin Bauer from Switzerland, Austria. The first country is where they come from. The second country is where they work if there are two countries. What's happening? Ah, yes, so I have to do this. So this is the opening in 2016 at the Technical University in Berlin. Technical University in Berlin, and most of us are there, not all. And there's this Martina Matov, who is Noel Matov's sister, who has nothing to do with maths either. But we interviewed her because she is a midwife from by professional. From by profession. And Noel, as she accompanied me for the first interviews, was struck by the enthusiasm and the commitment of all these women mathematicians. And it reminded her of her sister's enthusiasm and commitment in her profession. And so I said, why not interview her? And that's what we did. And her interview is in the catacogue. Is in the categoric, together with an interview with a composer, female composer, who is working at the Art Academy in Berlin. There are not many women composers, and that's why we asked her to take part in these interviews. So these are the foundations that funded. That funded the project, foundations or universities, organizations, it was very difficult. Finding money was very difficult. We didn't get any support or hardly any from the mass community. And the reason, my explanation, which I think is an obvious reason when you analyze the history, is that we didn't only select didn't only select women we would portray according to excellence criteria. There were many excellent and outstanding mathematicians and there were female mathematicians with a super life behind them, but who maybe were not as visible as some others, but whose life But whose life paths, career paths, we thought were most worthy of being told about. But that stopped the funding. I was supposed to get funding from one. And when they saw the list, they just didn't reply anymore. And we also had found it very difficult at TU Berlin, Technical University in Berlin, to find a place to show the Show to show the exhibition because they were wanting to rent a place for a price we couldn't afford. Finally, it's the librarian of the maths department who opened his doors to us and it was a super place. We're forever grateful to him. So we started with 13 participants. Here they are. So you'll see these names. You'll see these names. And just to give an example of someone who is not as visible, for example, as Nalini and Ananta Raman, who is a very well-known mathematician, or Francis Kirwan. Zhushanka Pericik is based in Serbia, and I've known her for a long time. And she had to stay in Serbia, couldn't benefit from a grant. Benefit from a grant, she'd got to go to the States to do her PhD. It was a Fulbright grant, and it was declined as she had got it. Then she got a letter saying it was cancelled because of the war and because of sanctions against Serbia. So her whole career was impacted by this war. Impacted by this war, not only on a personal basis, she had to raise two children, small children during the war, but also from a career point of view, she didn't have this opportunity that she was originally given and stayed in Serbia in very difficult circumstances. People, when I asked her if she would like to take part, she said, oh no, I'm not good enough. I said, of course you are. I'm not good enough. I said, of course you are. And you have a lot to tell us about. And so she accepted. So there they are. There's Dhyusanka here. And some of them you might know. And we've been working a lot together with Kasha. I was with her last week in Colombia and we still have projects. So all these women are All these women are extremely active, and I've kept in touch with quite a few. So I would now estimate, and you can check it for yourself, on our website and the venue. Our website is womeninmath.net, that's right. And a venue, I think, you will. And a venue, I think you will count about 150 venues around the world. I'll give you a glimpse of where they have been, and these are just very few among many. Barcelona, for example, in a super hall of the very impressive University of Barcelona, and in Bogotá in Colombia, 2017. 2017, which was kind of improvised. We had to collect money to print the posters, but they were very nicely presented. Then in Beirut, that was 2018, I had a portable version of the exhibition, which I have with me right now, and I've been traveling with it. In different sizes. This is quite a big size. It used to weigh eight kilos at the time. And I had taken it with me to a conference I was co-organizing in Beirut, in Lebanon. And at the end of the conference, Italian colleague Paolo Aschieri timidly, shyly came up to me and said, I'm going to ask you a strange question. Can I take the exhibition? Question: Can I take the exhibition with me? I said, Of course, you can. He wanted to show it in Albania, I think it was at the time. Oh, no, Bulgaria, it was Bulgaria. And then he wanted to take it back to Italy, where he has shown it in several places, even recently, including high schools. So it shows you how it can travel. This was in Sweden. This was in Sweden, in Götterbel. This was in Havana, the University of Havana, Cuba. Again, I had, this was the exhibition that I was carrying with me. And you see, we just hung it up on a rope. The rope was not easy to find in Havana, where material goods were scarce and still are, but we managed. In Turkey, I was never. In Turkey, I was never there. And in fact, we learned about this exhibition after it had happened, which sometimes is the case for because this exhibition can be sent in the form of a PDF file, so we don't really know where it is. It's in many, many places in the world. This is in Bur, in Senegal. I was there giving a series of lectures in a summer school. Series of lectures in a summer school together with other colleagues, and I had it sent at that time. Although you see, it's the portable version, but because we see the little holes here to hang it up, and again, we'd hang it up, but it arrived after I had left. I had to leave early. And so, before I left, I organized a discussion around. Discussion around women in masks to prepare for the exhibition, because this exhibition is like a tool to trigger other things, to trigger discussions, debates, whatever. And so there were very few women in this summer school, summer, it's always summer in Senegal, but there were very few women. And I had asked them in advance, do you mind saying a few words? Do you mind saying a few words? And they were very shy and said, No, no, no, I can't talk. I can't, no, no, no. I said, Well, try and don't feel you have to, but it would be super if you could. And so came the day when we organized this meeting with mostly men and very few women, maybe three and very young. And the one man from I think it was the Ivory Coast said, Oh, well, I think my wives in plural should not be as educated as I am. That goes without saying. And I would live in a little hut in the middle. They would live in huts around me. And they're there to serve me and not to go to university. Go to university. And that made these young shy women spring up from their chairs and they started protesting in a very vivid manner. And we couldn't stop them. And quite rightly so, they were defending their rights. So it was a very interesting discussion. This was in Quito, Ecuador, on the way back from Bogota, the one. Way back from Bogota, the one before. This was the same exhibition I was at a conference there, Latin America Algebra Conference, and this exhibition I showed in the hall before on the way into the conference hall. This is what you see in this list of venues. You see Alphabetically ordered places where it was shown. And here I'm showing this because I don't see it, but I hope you see it. Saint-Denis, Paris, north of Paris. This was October 2019, so just before the pandemic. And I'm just pointing this out because this was a project organized by a theater company. Theater company which does outreach activities for school children. And the director of this company is the son of a very famous mathematician. And so he's inclined towards maths. And somehow he got to us and asked us whether we would answer or the portrait women would answer some questions. Answer some questions set by these 14-year-old pupils, I think they were. And you have to know, it's a very deprived part of the suburbs of Paris, where there were big protests recently. It's also where they're building all the Olympic facilities, which is like a slap in the face of these deprived children. And so, in this school, And so, in this school, a group of children gave their point of view, and they would ask things like, do you dream about maths every time, every day, every night? Do you have time to eat? Or things like that, very cute questions. I filtered them a bit and kind of adapted the English formulation, which was not always the best. Which was not always the best. And you see, some women answered. So, for example, Catherine Venland, I'll translate. It was translated to French for the pupils. I realized that mathematics were easier for me than for many other of my classmates. And so it would have even nearly could one could say. Nearly, could one could say it would have been unfair not to use this skill that was kind of natural to me. Nalini and Tanaraman, creativity in maths, that means to know how to ask good questions and not only find answers. So it was a very nice interaction between these pupils and These pupils and some of the portrait women. So again, now it's blocked. Wait a minute. Why is it blocked? Ah, yes. So then we added a few women. And so we were 13 and we added seven. Ragni from Norway, this was a request from Norway, official request. Norway claimed it. Norway claimed it hadn't been represented in the exhibition, and they had a very good female mathematician, Ragni, and why wasn't she in the exhibition? And I've known Ragni for many years, and of course we were happy. Of course, we can't have all the countries and all the women active in maths, so there are choices, and some are left out. Some are left out. What we wanted to do here was to add countries, southern and eastern European countries. So, Marta Sansoli, that some of you might know, from Spain, Biliana Stamatovic from Kosovo, Agni Piane from Norway. This is Betul. Sorry, how do I go back? Yes, Betul Tambe from Turkey. Turtambe from Turkey, Neja Ramokosta from Slovenia, Blazenja Divjak, who at some point was a minister in her country, Croatia, Sofia Lamproporulu from Greece. So you see, we take these pictures in different circumstances. So we is Noel takes the picture, I talk and I listen and And I listen. And so we adapt to the circumstances. This was in Switzerland, we did that in Geneva. And we had a board we put outside. The weather enabled that. And that's why it was done outside. We need a blackboard. And how it goes is that the mathematician, I asked her to explain to me her maths. Her maths and maybe half an hour or so. And I ask her questions because I usually am foreign to her topic, so I need to understand. And they get all involved, so do I. And then Noel steps in and takes photographs because the function of this maths interaction is to have them Have them relax because when talking about maths, mathematicians forget about the rest, and so they forget about the camera, they relax, and that's the aim of this first half an hour. Then the board should be, it's always with a blackboard, the blackboard should be then filled with formulae, and we ask the protagonist to stand in front of her board, of which she should be proud. Of which she should be proud. She can rage it if not. And Noel takes photographs with an old-fashioned camera, which takes very nice photographs. And then I carry out an interview, which can be about an hour face to face. Sometimes Noel is there, sometimes not. And the interviews are in a book, in a company in Catalan. Book and a company in catalogue, which is a very nice object with lots of photographs of these discussion sessions. So that's the catalogue. And now the last version has 20 portraits. And we are expanding it, but it'll probably be a PDF catalogue. This exists in real. In real. This is recent. It's last week or the week before. I was in Colombia. I just arrived yesterday, the day, the day before, arrived from Colombia. And I was organizing a summer school. Again, summer doesn't mean much there. In Villa de Leiba. It's the 11th of a series of summer school I started in 1999. 1999 in Villa de Leiba, every two years, except for the pandemic. And I decided there, I thought, why not print out the exhibition? So this is to show you that one can really improvise. And so with the local means, it's in a small touristic village, colonial village in Colombia, I had it printed out. It's an A3 format, so it's A3 format, so it's smaller than what you saw before, and this we loved a lot because we had to figure out how to hang it up best so that it wouldn't get wet, it wouldn't sway in the wind and all that. So there was lots of laughing because we couldn't figure that out, all of us mathematicians and physicists. So here it is, and Kasha is one of the protagonists. Is one of the protagonists, Kasha Reisner, also a member of this roadmap project. And she was there giving a series of lectures and she was hanging her own portrait up. So all this was discussing whether we had to put the string this side, that side, etc. So it was very funny. Further expansions around the world. Around the world. So we're now, we've already started expanding beyond Europe. All the countries I named were in Europe, if you count the western part of Russia. So there's Marielle Siles, who from her own initiative decided to have a kind of sister exhibition. Exhibition in South America involving South American female mathematicians, and she got in touch with us. And so it was the photographs were taken, I'm not sure by whom now, by someone she had contacted. She had a catalogue made, which we have in PDF form in Spanish. And here are, I think it's 11. I think it's 11, probably 11 mathematicians. And you see, again, there's a mix of well-known names and not so well-known, which is very nice. And I find a characteristic of this exhibition and the one I'm going to mention soon is their beautiful smiles. Again, I have a problem. Wait a minute. I don't know why it doesn't work. Ah, stuck now. So, this is Australia. I was at the university, the ANU, Australian National University, and talking to Pierre Portel, who's French like me, whom I didn't know before, came arose the idea of doing a sister exhibition in Australia. So this time I So this time I interviewed 16 female mathematicians, some of whom are here, a mix of generations, that's also the aim, generations, topics and cities in Australia. And it was very moving because some of the young ones coming from other countries, of course, Australia is a country of immigration. Country of immigration, listening to what they had been through, some of them had some tears, was very moving and made me think that one could expect to meet two very soon in mathematics. I was rather shocked by all I heard. And I think it was due maybe to their young age and their relative wellness. And their relative vulnerability coming from other countries without their families and having to confront many new things in Australia. Some of the things happened in Europe during a postdoc, but so different stories, some of which were left in the interviews, most of which were left in the interviews, which is very noble of them. Noble of them. I insisted that it shouldn't, you know, hide everything because young women then know what's happening and the world should know what's happening. But yes, very moving. So wait a minute again, it's stuck. I don't know why it gets stuck like that. Ah, so ah, so this is the next Congress eighth East. The eighth ECM, so the one after the opening exhibition that took place at the seventh Congress in Berlin. This was the eighth. We were supposed to go there, but of course, because of the pandemic, we couldn't, so it was online. And so Nejla, Neja, sorry, not Nejla, Neja, who's here, is part of the exhibition, but Marjeta. The exhibition that Marjeta and Jasna did a lot for this to take place. And also it was during a conference they organized in Slovenia that we could interview some of the people like Neja. Wait a minute again. Let me see. Aha. So now worldwide. So the first step was to nation. So the first step was to nigga. It so happened that I was invited to a Math Society meeting organized by Ali Bakluti at the time, president of this society. And so I took the opportunity to first to bring a portable version of the exhibition, which had grown and it was very heavy at that time. And then secondly, to And then, secondly, to have three interviews: two with Tunisian women and one with a French one who was there. Some of you might know her, Claire Voisin. And you see, that's when she's telling me about her results, outstanding results in algebraic geometry. These are the two other women from Tunisia that you can see if you look at the venue corresponding. Corresponding to this event. And so it's often like that that we enjoy these moments when the protagonist explains her maths to me. And then the interview with Claire Voisin is a beautiful interview where she says a lot about how maths helped her through life. So this is recent, relatively March. Relatively March 2023. So, this again was a meeting, combined oysters on the island of Okinawa. And this is the IAPMU in Tokyo. Yukari Ito and Reiko Toryumi are two wonderful Japanese physicists for Reiko, mathematicians for Yukari, who have done a lot to support. Have done a lot to support the Japanese version of this project. And I interviewed, how many did I interview? 10, I think, 10 women in Japan, not only Japanese, eight of which are Japanese, and one from Congo, one from Costa Rica, as you might see soon. And this was, you see, was supposed to take place in 222, didn't, it was postponed, etc. Postponed, etc. And eventually the meeting took place, which was very nice. Kasha was also there, which we might see in a minute, just a minute. Yeah, here is Kasha again in front of her portrait. She was there. And this is one of the local organizers. And you see, we had the exhibition that I'm not sure now. We had it printed out. Yes, I didn't bring that one. It was printed out. That one. It was printed out on the spot. They have lots of money at OIST, so we could print it out there in advance. And these are two women I interviewed. So you see Corneli, I met in Wagadougou, if I'm not mistaken. And we've kept in touch since then. She tells me how what accomplishments she's had. And she was. And she was doing a postdoc in Japan, which I find for an African woman is quite brave because it's not easy, I think, for a woman and an African to be in the world of maths in Japan, which is still very conservative. And she's the youngest PhD of her country, very brilliant and very positive, extraordinary. Very positive, extraordinary young woman. And Motoko Kotani is a very well-known mathematician in Japan. And she has lots of responsibilities in all kinds of committees, head of very important institutes. And after we interview. After the interview went very well with her, we met in Tokyo. And then I sent her the interview, as we always do, for her to check. And she asked me, there's one question, which is, what obstacles did you meet along your path? And her answer, which was maybe half a page or a little more, where she commented about how, you know, she About how she was not always easy in these committees where she had to impose herself, but it was very mild comments. And she said she would like me to take her replies out so that this question was banned from censored from the interview. I insisted a bit, saying, I understand that you might feel it could. Feel, you know, it could offend people, although it was really very mild. But you understand, I have tried to convince her that it's important for young people, young women, to see what you've been confronted with so that they know what to expect and how to fight or to resist better. And she said she understood that, but that it would be too risky in a very traditional country like Traditional country like hers, where a woman is not allowed to criticize anything that could offend a man. So we took out a whole paragraph, which is the first time I've had to do that. And that's the end of the slideshow. And thank you very much for your attention. Thanks very much for the nice presentation. Any questions? Just unmute yourselves or go for it, something. So this was such a, you know, I remember when this was presented and it was such an inspiration for so many people. And I just wanted to show you this. This is the new version of the mathematics in Latin. Women in mathematics in Latin America. So Sylvie showed one version, the red book, and actually, this one was this is the improved version. And actually, I don't know if you the improved, well, the more complete. I don't know if I can. Ah, okay. I was going to say, like, there is the word. So this actually discovered, I love this. Discover this appeared in the AMS notices. Really? Notices. They made an article about it, and as Sylvie mentioned, there is a first part, it was extended. So the 20 women in Europe were extended with Latin American mathematicians. So for example, Carolina Barrajo is here. And yes, because they have a project. Because they have a project of a big funding. They had, it's over now, that allowed them to, well, the purpose was to mix sociology and mathematics to study the situation of women in mathematics in Chile from a sociological point of view, from a gender point of view. And then with this project, they had the funding to make this really nice book. So I will, I hope. Nice book, so I will. I hope this keeps grooming as you show, Sylvie. And congratulations for this nice initiative. I didn't see in this book. Um, may I order a copy or? Yes, I can. I have one of the people that made this with Marielle. So Marielle was in charge of the project. And someone else is coming, and I'm going to see them soon. Coming and I'm gonna see them soon, so I can ask them to bring so I will send it to you. Look at it, yeah, thank you. Um, this is the this ring ranilla matemático de genero, yeah, right? I mean, it's like, okay, I know this project, I have been following them, it's really great. I'm really curious, like, because usually what you see from these, all these initiatives is that it kind of stays in between mathematicians and the thing is that. Between mathematicians. And the thing is that I mean, I think there's so many things to learn from like sociologists and I mean, some, you know, some of the soft, not soft, but soft sciences. I mean, I think they have a lot to say. And we're not discovering the world here. It's just like we're just a particular piece of the population. And I think there's plenty to learn there. So great. I may also have a copy. Okay. Yes. I'm going to. Okay. Who else needs to copy? I'm going to write that. Complicated. I'm gonna write that one. I mean, I got one because I work with them for the illustrations, and I learned so much working on that project, doing like science communication for them. I learned so much. And although the funding period is over, now they have so much data they need to analyze with interviews. So I think there are still things that are going to be coming out. And it's really interesting. Out, and it's really interesting. This sociological point of view, so I think it explains a lot of things that you know one lives without giving a name for them. So, yes, I definitely think that we still have to keep up with what they're going to be showing. Definitely. Any other comments or questions for Sylvie? I wanted to ask a quick question. I wanted to ask a quick question. It was great. Yeah, hi. Yeah, thanks a lot for the talk. I did not know about this. It was great. I was wondering if for some outreach even to high school or towards bachelor students, if we wanted to have exhibition like this with posters, what should we do? It's very easy. You just write. It's very easy. You just write to us. There's an address, either to me or to Noel, but there's an address on the website somewhere. I think maybe contact. There must be somewhere. Contact. You just write to this and we get, Noel and I get the message and we usually answer one of those answers. We send you a link to a PDF file and you can just print out from that PDF file without costs. I mean, just a I mean, just the printing costs. And we ask, as a counterpart, if you could buy a few catalogues to accompany the exhibition, to put them on display, because otherwise you see on the panel, there's excerpts of the interviews, but not the whole interview. So it makes sense to put the interviews on display for people to read, and they're usually very interested. Usually very interested. So that means buying, we ask for five catalogues for your library to order a few or colleagues or whatever. Where are you based? Where is it you're based? I'm right now in Bonn. Oh, in Bonn. So that's easy. That's easy because sometimes sending catalogues is a problem. Yeah. Well, it's been shown in Bonn, you will see on the web page. Alphabetically, you'll see that was the beginning. Are you at the end? Was the beginning? Are you at the MPI? I was at the university, but next year we are organizing this graduate research opportunities for women conference for bachelor's students. That's being organized by MPI next year. Very good. Okay. So you can order it without problem, yes. Okay. Thank you. There he has. Any quick question? Nice. Any quick question before we go on to the second talk? I just wanted to give you a link to something different, but I think it might interest you, which is another project that we set up. Let me see if I can. So this is it. About women in maths in the time of Corona. Some of you might have seen that film and That film. And it's testimonies of women, the answer question: how did Corona impact your personal and your professional life? It's a kind of answer to this very nice initiative some years ago, maybe five years ago, six years ago, Faces of Women in Mass, where women would be asked, and maybe some of you took part. Maybe some of you took part to introduce themselves by name and where they are based in the world, and saying something, I'm happy to be a mathematician or something like that. And it was a very joyful film or a set of videos. And as during Corona, I was thinking, how would these women react if we asked them the same thing now? And that's what we did. We did so. There's also a catalogue, a company catalogue. Did I check that baby there? I'm not sure I checked it out. I remember. I remember the initiative, but I was just actually so overwhelmed by being under the pandemic with a baby. Then I remember, like, oh, I just don't have time, sorry. But it was exactly that type of situation that was exactly. Yeah, I know, I know. But I and then when I saw like the final product, it was like, wow, fantastic, great. I mean, like, damn it. But okay, no, but great. Another thing I really need to check out. All right. Well, if nothing pressing, let's go on to the second talk. Okay. If you want to start. Okay, if you want to start showing the slides, so well, let me see. This is more of a mathematical talk this time. Just a minute, I have to share first and then share so I can do it like that. So you're seeing it, I suppose. Yeah. Good. I can see. Oh, why has it disappeared? End of slideshow. That was not the aim. Wait a minute, something clicked. Click to exit. Click to exit. Oh, dear. Okay. I think we were seeing some. Okay, now I think I'm back. And this bar is a bind. It's always there. Let me put it upstairs. Is that full screen? I think so. So no, I can see the rest. Like. Can you see? I can see this light. I can see this slide, but I can't see like the menu bar and all the options. So it's not full screen. It's not full screen. So, wait a minute. Why isn't it full screen? What should I do? Auswen? Arbeiten? No, that I don't want. It's a strange. It's a strange form. It's not as usual. I don't know what to do. That's how it comes. I mean, we can just keep it like that. Okay. Okay. All right. Ah, it's a bit better, but it's still, I don't know why I have these bars on the side. Okay. So maybe it's not better, is it? Because then we can... No, because we cannot see it fully. No, because we're going to see it fully. So now it's better. So it's about locality. Some of you, so like Maria Sela and Roberta, I think, have heard me talk about this. And this is the title of a contribution to the Deutsch. So wait a minute. So yeah, the uh yeah the um mathematical notices in germany that we were asked i was asked to contribute with some um some mathematical or non-mathematical texts and we decided to contribute with a survey on what we have worked on in the past six years maybe about locality. This is with two colleagues I'm going to see tomorrow in China. Going to see tomorrow in China. Li Guo, who in fact is based at Rutgers University, New York, but is often in China, Being Zhang based at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. And some of this is also triggered by joint work with Pierre Clavier, a former postdoc now at Moulouse in France. So all the Um, so although it won't appear explicitly here, maybe. So, um, I want to talk about different things with the aim of, so my general aim in my mathematical life is to evaluate infinities or singularities. And this is typical in mathematical physics, in quantum field theory, particularly. Quantum field theory, particularly, you're confronted with divergences, which you want to make sense of with some numbers that can be then fed into whatever accelerator or whatever device you're using to analyze a physical phenomenon. And for this, we used This, we used an algebraic version of the concept of locality in quantum field theory that we revisit. In a sense, it's out of fashion because now in quantum gravity, one speaks more of non-locality than locality. But in fact, this idea of locality proved to be rather fruitful as a, let's say, guiding. Let's say guiding principles, mathematical principle. And essentially, it's summarized here: locality is a symmetric binary relation, not much more than that. So, as you'll see. So, and our aim is to use this locality to guide us in how to evaluate infinities or divergences. So, the concept of locality revisited. Most of you being from a mathematical physics world will have heard of the principle of locality, which states that an object is influenced directly only by its immediate surroundings, which means that for separate events located in different regions of space-time, one should be able to measure them independently. And our aim is to propose a mathematical Our aim is to propose a mathematical framework which reflects these ideas of separation, of independence when things are separated, which will go under the general formulation locality principle. Ah, oh dear. So, what happened now? So what happened now? Okay. So for that, we start with causality in Minkowski and space-time, where time is distinguished from space with a sign, with a signed, with a signature minus one d minus one, assuming we're in dimension d. So a Lorentzian scalar product, and this is Product, and this is the cone, light cone, which tells you where the past light cone, future light cone is. And it's inside this light cone that we're allowed to move. Outside is somehow out of reach. And we say that too, we say it has throughout the decades in the 20th century this notion of causes. This notion of causally separated was identified as one event is causally separated from the other if it does not lie in the future of the other and the other does not lie in the future of the former. If you have questions, just stop me. Do you have questions up to now? No, I can't see any face, so I'm just seeing my screen. I'm fine so far. Anyone wants to ask anything? I think it was pretty clear so far. Don't hesitate, please. Just don't hesitate. So locality in axiomatic quantum field theory, you might know that there are quite a lot of axiomatic approaches throughout the 20th century. Let's take just the Whitman one and very The Whiteman one, and very superficially, this is extremely superficial. So let's just take phi, which goes from test functions to operators on a Hilbert space, S of R D being Schwartz function. And what's important is that this causally separatedness of the supports of the test functions should imply commutativity of the corresponding operators. Of the corresponding operators, phi going from f to phi of f being an operator. This means that they're commuting. Ah, sorry. So just a minute. Okay. And so there's another way of formulating this using scattering matrices. So I won't say what it is. It's a relative one relative to F, F being a short. F, f being a Schwarz function. This is due to distributions. You combine a distribution with a chest function. What's important is this morphism property, but it's kind of not a real morphism because it's a partial morphism in the sense that this only works when the supports are causally separated. Let's see if I manage this time. Let's see if I manage this time. I seem to have problems. Okay. And in particular, if you check this due to the commutity of plus, this implies something like that, commutativity. So we're going to do something very easy. We're going to introduce a binary relation saying, ah, when they commute, let's say that they're independent. Let's say that they're independent. So these are observables, O for observables, which were the phi of F in the previous slide. Okay. And so on test functions, we will say that their independent, we call this independent for t prime, interpreted for t if their supports are causally separated, let's say. And then this form, this And this form, this previous, let me see if you see this one will reinterpret, and this one will reinterpret. Here we'll say F1 T F2 implies phi of F1, T prime phi of F2, F1 T of F T and T F 2 implies this relation. So that's what we're going to do if I manage to get there. Here it is. That's the first one, and that's the second one. So it's just. And that's the second one. So it's just replacing this by that and this by that. So, and always saying that this is a binary, defines a binary symmetric, because if they commute in one sense, they commute in the other relation. So that's what we're going to do. So it's a very simple idea: symmetric binary relation. And that's what And that's what a locality set. So we're kind of enhancing the set category, the vector space category, the algebra category, etc., to a locality set category, locality, vector space category, locality algebra category. So it's a couple X, T, where T is just a relation, binary symmetric. So it's a subset of the Cartesian products X cross X. Product x cross x. We call it a locality or sometimes independence relation. So that's how we're going to write it, x1 t x2, which means that the couple is in the graph of the relation. This is the graph. And so, for example, you know many of these. Void intersection, we already had that in a more specific causality setup. Specific causality setup. This is just that the intersection of the supports is void. And if we're vector spaces in a Euclidean space, we could think of orthogonality as an independence. So it's something like they should not interact. That's the idea. So separation of supports. We could say that two functions are Could say that two functions are independent, and we could write it like this. And here I'm introducing a parameter epsilon if the distance of their supports is larger than epsilon. If you look at this more closely, you realize that it's not really locality, it's pseudo-locality. So our way of handling locality. Way of handling locality includes pseudo-locality. It leaves a little space. You see, they can, the supports don't have to be disjoint. I mean, they are disjoint, but we are leaving a space between them. And for epsilon equals zero, this means that they're disjoint. Okay, disjoint Nefsis reports. There are other examples one knows. For example, independence of events in a probability. Of events in a probability setup. P intersection AB is PAPB. And transversality of manifolds to sub-manifolds of a manifold M, a transversal if their sum, the sum of their tangent spaces at a given point is the whole tangent space. Coprime numbers is another example that one can think of, but One can think of. But there is a trivial example that I have named, which seems not to separate very much: is equality. In a set, for example, elements could be called independent if they're equal. But somehow this is a binary symmetric relation, and you would say this doesn't separate very much. But it will be ruled out by the fact that we want. By the fact that we want morphisms as well as objects, not just objects, morphisms in this category. And the morphisms should preserve locality. So if we have a separating locality on one side, the morphism will take it to a separating locality and will rule out equality. The idea of locality is to separate divergences, to keep them apart. Keep them apart. That's the idea. Do you have questions at this point? Actually, I mean, not the, I think I just need an extra cup of coffee. No, I'm just trying to understand like locality in terms of a category. I mean, as you said, it just pairs like a set, and then the locality applied to like a vector space. I'm kind of thinking like, I'm kind of thinking, like, what's how is this category like is it pointed? Is it braided? Is it like the usual adjectives that you will put into a category? So we're going. I haven't looked at braidedness, but we're going to see whether it's a monoidal category. For example, if you take vector spaces, 10 products, and we'll see that that's not easy. I won't go into that too much. I won't go into that too much because it gets very intricate, but it's a priori. It looks easy. You just add locality everywhere. But when you start taking tensor products, it gets rather involved. You know, a bit like topological tensor products are not straightforward. Apart from that, it's rather harmless, I would say. But locality algebras have different types. Algebras are of a different type from algebras. Let me also point out: we can, the usual category of sets, for example, is a subcategory of the locality category of sets, because if you take a trivial locality, so remember t was a subspace of x cross x, so you can always take t equals x cross x, and then you've done nothing. And then you've done nothing because everyone is in relation with everybody. So you've touched nothing. So you always get the usual category as a subcategory. Yeah, so I'll go to tensor products in a moment and then maybe you can ask more. So here I'm saying from a set, we go to a locality set. The polar set is all those that are independent of. That are independent of elements in that set. So it's like, think of orthogonality. Yes, the orthogonal. And what you want of the orthogonal set to a subset, you want it to be a vector space usually. And that's what you so the idea is if you're in the category of vector spaces, you want this to be a vector space independently of Space independently of whether u was a vector space or not. You want that to be a vector space? That's difficult. That's a difficult thing to get. So, for example, there's a difficulty. Semi-group, same thing. When U is a subset of a group. So, semi-group is, yeah, locality semi-group. It means that you're only allowed to multiply or combine things objects which are pairs. Thing objects which are pairwise independent. So, this comes in the way every time because it tells you you can't multiply anything with anything, only things that are independent. Think of distributions. You can't multiply any pair of distributions. They have to be in a special relative position to be able to multiply them. This is the theory of Hermander. That's the idea behind this. And once you've put this Once you've put this as a barrier somehow, then you also want to check that for every subset of the group, the semi-group, the polar set defined like this is also a semi-group. So all this put, I mean, put some obstacles which are not easy to circumvent. So again, this thing is not easy to deal with. Not easy to deal with. Algebra, everything then, you know, it kind of looks automatic and it is, in a sense, up to a certain limit. So locality algebra is that the addition, the summation is defined for any pair, but the multiplication is only defined for, sorry, MA. I seem to have two here. I don't know what I've done. This would be enough. MA, I think. This would be enough, MA. I think the dot is one too many. The product is on independent pairs. And then, once you have this set up, you want your maps to be morphisms in this category. So you want them to preserve locality. If two objects are independent, their images should be independent. But if you have more than just a set category and you have structures, And you have structure, linear structure, algebra structure, then you want also your locality maps to be locality morphisms. And so this is being a locality map, which has this multiplicativity property whenever you have independent elements. So there's always this condition whenever you have independent pairs. Independent pairs. Is there any question at this stage? So locality relations are ubiquitous. I told you, I gave you some examples. Let me give you more. So, you know, there's another notion of locality, which is much used for Lagrangians to detect whether Lagrangians are actually. Whether Lagrangians are actually really local to build them along this principle. And also in index theory, the index is an integral of some local object. And what does that mean? Here it's the jet. So this means this thing only depends on a certain number of derivatives at a point x. So this is this locality. It's all at a point x, maybe involving derivatives, but not. Derivatives, but not more. It doesn't spread out. And so, to a functional, which might not be linear, you can see that if it's linear, you wouldn't write it like this. So, this is more general. So, this is a little perturbation of phi, of f of phi. This little perturbation should only involve local objects. There's a very interesting reform. There's a very interesting reformulation of this, which dates back to Stuckelberg in the 50s, who was then a bit forgotten, although he really did a lot of very good work. Then it was taken again by Bogolyubov and Shirkov. This is much better known, Epstein-Glase in 73. And it's saying that if the supports are disjoint, this is this locality relation. This is this locality relation, disjointness of supports, then there should be an add kind of morphism property. If you forget, if you imagine phi f to be linear, many things simplify, in particular the f of phi. And you find yourself with f of phi one plus phi two equals f of phi one plus f of phi two. And so this is kind of linear morphism property of. Morphism property of big F. But this is the generalized non-linear version of that. And it's called Hammerstein property, which you can call partial additivity. And interestingly, these two things are equivalent. So this locality, which for us is F, is a locality morphism expressed in a maybe more sophisticated manner. Let's think of the, I'm thinking. Of the, I'm thinking of the linear case. In the linear case, this would be f is a linear locality morphism in our language. This is equivalent to f being really locality in the sense of one knows of a Lagrangian or index theory. So let me see. This is in a very nice article I recommend by Brudadang Laurent. By Bruda Dang Laurent Reisner. There's the word locality in it. If you look for these four authors, you'll find it. Very beautiful article. Wait a minute. Let me see. That's another instance of locality which I mentioned, which in fact is one of our motivations to introduce that. It's separation of wavefront sets. Separation of wavefront sets. So you might be familiar with, I won't go into it, there's a refined notion of support, which is singular support. It's the first level to measure the support of the singularities of a distribution. And one can want maybe the singular supports to be disjoint. Or one can go to the micro-local level and go one step further and look at One step further and look at the directions, vector directions in which the singularities are located. This is the wavefront set, which I'm not going to define. It's giving the singular support a point, a point in the singular support plus a direction. And here, we don't want just disjointness. This is just due to Fourier transform explanations, which are easy. Which are easy. We want that the wavefront set of one be disjoint of a transformed, slightly transformed version of the wavefront set of the other with a minus sign. This is all to do with Fourier transform. It's easy to check. So, okay, let me leave out this because this is a bit technical. It's comparing the two, saying that this is more refined than that. Than that. Okay. Wait a minute. I've got a problem now. Okay. No, I can see it. Okay. Hermanda tells us that shows us that if they have disjoint waveframe sets in the sense I gave with the W prime, Wf prime on one side with a minus sign, then the product is well defined. Product is well defined. So this is telling us that we have a partial algebra, a locality algebra if we look at it in terms of semi-group if we look at it in terms of locality algebraic structures. Another place, if you're familiar with pseudo-differential operators, maybe not. In case you are, then you might know that there's a canonical trace introduced. There's a canonical trace introduced by Konsevic Chan Vischik, which enables to extend the ordinary trace beyond the domain of trace class operators, which is operators of order smaller minus the dimension of the underlying manifold. If you don't know, it doesn't matter, but they're defined exactly where we don't need them, namely, where for operators we have not. For operators, we have not non-integer order, polyhomogeneous. This is PGH. And if the sum of their orders is a non-integer, then you have this commutation relation, which you can interpret as a locality relation. This is very important for dimensional regularization in physics. And if you look at the underlying locality relation, it's very simple. It's very simple. It's on C that the sum of complex numbers be not integer. And you easily, it's a nice exercise to check that this is not a locality semigroup because you can have that both, that the couple is indeed independent. So all these are conditions, they're independent. They're independent and independent of one-third. Is that true? Yes, they're independent of one-third and independent amongst themselves because all are one-third. But the sum of the two is two-thirds, and this is not independent of one-third, because if you add one-third with two-thirds, you end up with an integer. So, this shows you on a very simple example that it can go wrong. Example that it can go wrong easily. Okay, so here open questions, which I won't dwell on because it gets very technical. But I was mentioning when Anna Ross asked about category that to have a monoidal category is not straightforward. We were led to this kind of question because we wanted to classify locality hop algebras because hop algebra. Hop algebras, because hop algebras come into renormalization issues. And so that's what we wanted to do: classified, graded, connected, co-commutative Hop algebras. Doesn't matter if you are not familiar with Hopf algebras. It's a co-multiplication together with a multiplication and inverse, co-inverse. All that forms a Hopf algebra if things go well. And we needed very Um, we needed various things, we needed quotients, and quotients go wrong. It's not easy to put a nice quotient locality relation, which make things like this be this projection map, be locality projection map. Think of the topological quotient and we define the locality relation on the quotient. Carlity relation on the quotient, inspired by what you do for topological quotients. And another related problem, because if you think of the tensor product, you might recall that it's defined in terms of a quotient. And so is the locality tensor product of locality vector spaces still the locality vector space? And does it have a universality property? So locality tensor product means that you only allow vector tensor products of locality pairs, those that are independent. And then related is the locality tensor algebra of a locality vector space. Is that a locality algebra, etc. And these are very difficult questions related. We haven't solved them. They're conjectures. We haven't got good counterexamples. We haven't got good counterexamples either, and they're related to other known conjectures in group theory, which I won't mention. Let me, in the 10 remaining minutes, show you how this can be used to evaluate meromorphic germs at poles. I was telling you that we were introducing locality to deal with divergences, so we want to evaluate divergences, and those lie at the poles. And those lie at the poles of some meromorphic functions. So, for that, I have to go back to Speer 1967, or at least that was our source of inspiration. He's still alive, and I asked him quite a few questions, but for him, this is old stuff he's not very much interested in anymore. But we are still. So, it's a perturbative series expansion of these scattering metrics. These scattering metrics for Lagrangian field theory with non-zero mass. So there are no infrared problems, only ultraviolet problems. And that's what he writes. In this paper, we apply a method of defining divergent quantities, which was originated by Reeds. I just want to mention this as a mathematician and has been used in various contexts by many authors. We find it necessary to consider functions of several complex variables. Functions of several complex variables. If you're familiar with dimensional regularization, you'll know that you perturb the dimension. So it's one object you perturb for everybody. So it's one complex variable. Here, if you're familiar with Feynman graphs, we're going to put a perturbation parameter on each edge of the diagram. It's kind of redundant, but it's important. So that's what I'm saying. So that's what I'm saying, each line of the Feynman graph. The main difficulty is the extension of the above, so REIT treatments of poles to the more complicated singularities which occur in several complex variables. And when I talked by email to Speer, I asked him why people seem to have dropped what, you know, I didn't quite say it like that, like that, but I wanted to know why people hadn't picked up on his proposal to. His proposal to introduce what is now called analytic renormalization. And one of the reasons he was giving was that it's complicated because complex analysis in several variables is complicated. And indeed, we had to develop quite a few tools. And so let me put a brain teaser for you. And for that, let me first introduce what kind of objects we're dealing with. Objects we're dealing with. Meromorphic germs, we're only interested in what happens around zero. For another divergence, we can just use translation. And what we're doing is looking at quotients h of z1, zk. So zi's are complex variables. Li, L1, Lm, these are linear forms in. forms in Z1ZK. Okay, so it doesn't appear here, but they're in the variable Z1ZK and power S1, power Sm. So the difficulty is that we have K complex variables, K can vary, and that's why we're looking at the filtered algebra of consisting of unions of all these. Of unions of all these. So in the end, we're working in C infinity. Question: How to, what do we want? So these have poles. You see, they're linear in Z1, ZK. So of course, if the Z i's are zero, these are zero. So we have poles. How do we evaluate at poles for which these cancel? What freedom of choice do we have to evaluate? Let me ask you. Let me ask you a question. So, blue means holomorphic. Red means the source of difficulties, polar. So, Z1 minus Z2, that's in the numerator, it's harmless. Z1 plus Z2 a priori is harmless, but not in the denominator. And so now I'm asking you: let's say we take, we want to evaluate this at Z1 equals Z2. This is at z1 equals z2 equals zero. So let's take z2 equals zero. Then we have z1 over z1. And then this is one. So we could have one. But let's say we now start with z1 equals zero. Then this gives us minus z2 over z2. So minus one. So we would have minus one. Or for some strange reason, we could decide this is zero with another way of computing. zero with another way of computing or 10,000. And I'm asking you, what do you think you would assign to this expression? And we will soon be choosing zero for reasons I'm going to tell you now. The locality comes to the rescue to tell us how to proceed. So these are the objects again that we're looking at. LIs are linear. LI's are linear. Here I call them Ln before it was Lm. So all, yes. So the numerator I can write in terms of linear forms if I want to. And I'm going to focus on such objects in which the top part will be independent of the part below of the denominator in the sense that. In the sense that the LIs will be independent, the small allies will be independent of the big allies. Think of reducing a fraction into irreducible components. That's the idea. And for that, I need the notion of dependent space. So, dependent space is the vector space span by all these linear forms, a vector space in C infinity. These linear forms Infinity. These linear forms all depend, or CK, let's say, if we're in Ck depend on Z1, ZK. So this is a subspace of ZK. It's built of this and of that dependence. So now I'm going to say, oh, this is wrong. This should be the other way. I'm going to say that F1 TQ, Q should be above the T. Q should be above the T TQF2 if their dependent spaces are orthogonal for some scalar product, which I haven't given you, which is Q. So I'm saying that they're independent if the spaces spanned by their dependence, relative dependence in the Z i's are orthogonal. So, I'll give you an example. So, and first of all, let me call And first of all, let me call those for which are built of quotients h over l h over g with g of this form up here and h of that form up there. I will call them independent, polar, sorry, not independent. If the numerator is independent of the denominator, think of irreducible fractions. This is just telling you that the variables upstairs Variables upstairs stand perpendicularly to the variables involved in the expression in the denominator. That's what it's saying. For some scalar product, if you change the scalar product, you change the polar germs. So for example, let's take the canonical inner product. Then you have to think Z1 is carried by E1. Is carried by E1. Let's take E1 Ek as an orthogonal basis for Rk with the canonical inner product. Then E1 is orthogonal to E2. And so Z1 over Z2 is polar because it's of that form. And the same thing for the one we were looking at before. This is orthogonal to that because E1 minus E2 is orthogonal to E1 plus E2. I see I have one minute. I see I have one minute, so I think I will go much faster. Here is the, so I was telling you, now we have to evaluate. How are we going to evaluate? We're going to use evaluators, which are linear locality forms. So, locality, we only evaluate functions in pairs which are independent. We don't. Independent. We don't evaluate them if they're not independent. And if they're independent, we want this multiplicativity. This is reflecting this Hammerstein property at the beginning, where we were saying that this Hammerstein property was equivalent to a locality property. And so that's our way to keep track of locality in quantum field theory. Theory. And so Speer had, we took the vocabulary from Speer, generalized evaluators or evaluators. I won't go into the details, but this evaluator has to extend the ordinary evaluation at zero when things go well. And this is this partial multiplicativity that he had, Spear, not talking about locality, but it was subintended. Here was a symmetry partial. Intended here was a symmetry property, and here was a continuity property, which I'm not going to dwell on today. We dedicated a whole paper to making sense of that. So this is more technical. But Spear's approach uses coordinates, and our approach is supposed to be geometric insofar that it uses, doesn't specify. Uses, doesn't specify coordinates, it uses an inner product. So that's where we stand. We have a subspace of holomorphic germs in a given big space of meromorphic germs, the ones I showed you with linear poles. And we're going to evaluate and see how many ways there are evaluating, classifying them using what we call a Classifying them using what we call a Galois group. But now time is too short. Let me see what I can say. Very important is that this locality criteria enables us to split meromorphic germs into the holomorphic ones, the harmless ones, and the polar ones, the ones which are dangerous because they have singularities. But we now keep track of these singularities using. Singularities using this locality device. And so let me tell you the theorem. Oops. Wait a minute. I want to go back. Aha. How do I go back? Ah, here. So this is the theorem. A locality evaluator, which is just a linear locality character. It's a locality character. So this is. Character. So, this is, there shouldn't be a comma here. It's a partial morphism. And it should extend the usual evaluation at zero. Otherwise, it's not very useful. It shouldn't do something new on harmless objects. And we classify it, saying that it's essentially a minimal substruct, meaning that we Meaning that we project using this I had before, sorry, so I had before, I had this orthogonal splitting into M plus and polar germs. We project onto M plus thanks to this orthogonal locality splitting, then we evaluate. They're all more or less like that, like this combination, up to an element of this gap. Up to an element of this Galois, what we call a Galois group. And we studied this quite huge group, but I'm not going to tell you it uses Linden words, it uses quite a lot of tools, which I'm not going to give you. And I just want to thank you at this point for your attention. I'll put back the theorem so you have it here. And what I have skipped is how we prove this theorem. And I can Theorem, and I can also give you some references, maybe. So, the references, for example, here and more are here. So, it's a result of lots of different works that we did together. This is the topological one. Thank you very much for your attention. Sorry to have gone over time for a little. Don't worry, we started a couple of minutes later. But, anyways, thank you very much. But, anyways, thank you very much. Any quick comments and questions for Sylvie? Just please unmute yourselves and feel free to go in. Hello. I see you, little baby. Hey. No questions means I'm sure she has a question. I'm pretty sure. Sure, she has a question. I'm pretty sure. No questions means you got lost. I mean, I've got a bit. I mean, I confess I got a little bit lost in the detail, but yeah, definitely. I mean, it's a product is not an easy thing. And usually the braiding is like a tricky structure to describe. So, like, after that, I'm not completely sure how. But I was wondering, like, probably I'm not completely sure, like, if. I'm not completely sure, like, if instead of having the whole category, you're specifying to some very concrete subcategory, which simplifies somehow the whole process of constructing all these locality evaluators and all the tensor product and everything. I was wondering if you, I mean, if that's like, what will be your candidate and how far, I mean, can you go in that? But I guess you already thought about that. Well, do you mean? The category world, you mean, the world of categories? Yes, yeah, we're doing that, we're working on that with Estanislao Erskovic, based in Gronov. So we're making progress. And so there is a natural category which encompasses a tensor product. So we can do it, but it's a different one from what we did in practice. We did in practice. Yes. So it's quite interesting to compare, and we're still, this is still work in progress. So I'll let you know when we've still progressed. But indeed, it's like the way we did it by hand, it's like forcing in tensor products, but you can do it naturally. But you can do it naturally, but you get another category. So it's different, two different worlds. But then it becomes a monoidal, and very naturally a monoidal category. So it solves some problems. And you cannot relate these two. I mean, like they can relate to the. We can, we can, but yes, we can relate them, but as kind of subcategories which Kind of subcategories which match in certain circumstances, yes. Yes, I mean, okay, so from the categorical point of view, there's a natural way to build things, but when you build them by hand, that's not what you come across. It's interesting. I know, I know, I know. But it's, I mean, that's that's what I usually biased, I guess. Anyways, um, any guess anyways um any any other questions uh for sylvie or phrases that those works because if not i will just call it for the morning and thanks again thank you thank you to you
