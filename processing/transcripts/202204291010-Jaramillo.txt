And things diverge as you go as this right. And similarly, if you start from the ring down, and you go back in time, and things exponentially diverge as you go to the region. So, all of these features point to a different asymptotic expansion regimes, and they point to a real transition happening at the region. And I'll end by saying that we discussed linearity in the previous talk. So, this is going to be important for us as well. So, I'll just mention here all the caveats that we discussed. Here, the all the caveats that we discussed is that there's the studies for the ring bounds, there's a closed-limit approximations, and moreover, we have the observed correlation between what happens at the black hole horizon and what happens at infinity, which deep down requires some level of linearity. So, I would say that it is probably seems to be the case that the ring, the linear models have a larger validity than you might have expected. So, I'm not going to say. So, I'm not going to say that all of the waveform, all of the process will be linear, but at least it's plausible at this point to say that the linear bodies have a larger range of validity than you expect. So, with this, keep these features in mind. And with this, let me hand over to Jose. He will talk about entirely different things. Thank you, Vader. So, I cannot say that, Radri, he said that he. Rodriguez. He said that it's the first most heuristic talk he has given, so I cannot say this, as many of you know. So, this part of the talk is an interlude between this introduction to the gravitational wave physics, and then we'll come back to the gravitational group again. So, this part is an interlude in which we'd like to unveil a physical mechanism behind this universality. Behind this universality and simplicity in a system. So I have my own subtitle. Okay. Okay, so this is, so I'm going to address two different points. So the first one, I will try to motivate. The first point is a motivation. I try to take this simplicity and universal. To take this simplicity and universality and this effective linearity that is unexpectedly successful in the system. And I join in Luis when I say that, well, in principle, the system is not linear. It might be linear if you know sufficiently much about the system in order to define an appropriate linearization. I think this is the, in an effective way, this is what we are doing. Way, this is what we are doing. We are accepting that system is non-linear, but there are aspects in which effectively it behaves linearly. So, these three points are going to lead us to the ED function, as Vader was commenting in the title. So, the first part is just a motivation, how to get to the ED. And the second part, I will dwell in getting some details of a proposal. Getting some details of a proposal for this underlying effective mechanism to suffer this transitional regime modeled by A. And this is essentially going to be based on geometric optics at first stage and then a regularization of the causes appearing in geometric optics through diffraction. Okay, so this is the scheme of this part. So let me start by looking at Looking if there are other systems, other physical systems, in which you have this kind of universality associated to waveforms. And actually, this is the case. If you go to nonlinear dispersive hydrodynamics, so can you see my, can you see the yeah, so in non-linear dispersive hydrodynamics, there are universal wave patterns. Are universal wave patterns that are associated to some critical behavior in the PVE. That is reminiscent, if you want, of the universality that you find in critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. So let me give you an example. So an example is the formation of shocks. So in a sense that can be made precise, all viscous shocks look the same. So this is a universality of how shocks behave. And for having a glimpse into that, consider this equation. Into that, consider this equation. This is Uruguay's equation, it's a non-linear equation that models the creation of shocks. But if you introduce some viscosity term here and analyze what happens with the shock, the thing is that if you make a zoom into the shock, you find something remarkable, which is that the asymptotic solution Solution in the shock part, it could be like the in a precise sense is a shows a critical behavior. You can comment, it's actually related to the characteristics, characteristic lines of the equation. So the remarkable fact is that the equation can be written, it's controlled completely by a special function, that in this case is the hyperbolic target. And this is independent of the initial data. The system forgets how it came there. Forgets how it came there. The form, the functional form, is modeled by this special function. And the initial data only happen in the argument. So in that sense, all visual shocks look the same and are described in a universal special function. So this is like the archetype that we have in mind. But let me give you some more pedestrian motivations. Just if you look to the waveform that button shows, and then you can. Form that Baddish shows. And then you compare with this second figure, which is AD function. So there are aspects that are not captured by the AD function. For instance, you can forget about the oscillations in the ring now, but you can also see that the phase is not captured. You see that in the waveform, the phase frequency is increasing and the A is actually decreasing. So this is not captured by A function. But if you look to the envelope with But if you look to the enveloping of the sinal, then this behavior here, and this behavior here, actually, and then the peak then going up, actually is very well captured. This is also quantitative. The growth in the spiral goes like one over T to the one-fourth. And this is exactly the asymptotics of A. So the idea here was, okay, just in a very naive way, could A help us to model some aspects? To model some aspects. So, in order to make this a little more precise, so you consider the most generic linear, and this is the place in which linearity plays a role, equations on effective linearity. So, the most generic equation modeling the transition between oscillatory behavior and attempt one is a d function, something that you use in dominant functions. This equation here, with time running from minus infinity to infinity, somehow interpolates between the harmonic oscillator that would be. The harmonic oscillator that would be when the time is negative, so have something positive here, and some damped regime. So, this oscillation, this transition between oscillatory to damped regime is generically captured at the first order by AB always. And this can be, in our case, this upgrades to the PVE level in something similar to what I was coming about the shocks behavior. So, in particular, if we focus on linear dispersive wave equations, there is a universal. There is a universal behavior in this transition between the regime in which the waveform is oscillating to a regime in which there is a modulation, a dumping in the solution. And this is controlled by AD function. And this is controlled again by caustics. Sorry, by characteristics lines. These are not the characteristics line of the equation itself, this first equation, but of an associated system. But of an associated system. In order to be more precise, if you make a semi-classical analysis of the solution to a linear dispersive wave equation, you can write an expansion with this form. And then if you want to make a stationary point expansion of the phase here, when you extremalize this quantity here, this I, then the set of points, the critical points, actually defines the characteristic line screen. So these characteristics. So these characteristic lines actually are the characteristic line of the Burgess equation. These are the relevant one here. You see that what this means is that if you have, these are the contributions to the oscillation. So if you're outside, you see that there is an envelope in here, a sataustic of this set, of this family of curves. If you're outside this caustic, there is only one ray, if you want, that is contributing. So you don't have oscillation. If you have on the other side, If you have on the other side, you have oscillation. But if you are inside, at any point is traversed by three rays, characteristics nice, and it's going to give an oscillatory behavior. So the result is that the interior of the transition between the oscillatory regime inside the caustic to the damped one outside is controlled by A. So in that sense, all caustics look the same. Okay? One can object, well, but What kind of object? Well, but GR is not exactly not a dispersive equation. Okay, fair enough. This is a PVE in which we make contact with Ari, and perhaps at the end, we could comment something that actually could have a more fundamental meaning. This would be the motivation for A. But before getting to the actual mechanism behind the universality, let me just make a remark on something that we found truly remarkable. That is in the context. Remarkable that is in the context of, this is not on the wave, but it's in the context of the dynamics of orbital motion. So it's something that is reminiscent of Enrique's, but in the charged particle phase. So the fact is that one can solve exactly the Launda Leafshift equation. So radiation reaction for a charged particle in a non-relativistic limit can be moving in a coulomb potential, can be solved exactly in terms of what is called the Palevet-Tour equation. Is called the Panevet 2 equation. This is an equation that controls here the angular momentum. The fact is that this Panletu equation is a non-linear modification of A. So this is not, now we are not hang waiting. This is something that appears in this kind of orbital motion. So the question is, if it is kind of Palebé equations, particular Palebé class sentence, generalizing irreplaceable. Okay, so let me go directly to the discussion of the physical mechanism. Discussion of the physical mechanism that is going to take us to talk about previous. So the idea, so we focus that we need, we want to enforce this idea of simplicity and universality. For the simplicity part, we dwell on what some people call an asymptotic reasoning, which just try to address the qualitative mechanism, underlying the dynamics, just filtering the overload of details that actually are encumbering the structural. The structural features, okay, when you solve everything. You look at synthetics in order to identify the universal structurally stable patterns. And this comes to the second point, universality is implemented by notions, the advocate notion of structural stability that change from model to model. So essentially, we want to account for universality features that are stable under genetic situations. So these are going to lead us to Equations. So, this is going to lead us to a bottom-up approach. We are not going to start from Einstein equations and go down, but actually, we are going to start by a bottom-up in which we construct a layer of different approximations, increasing the amount of actual information. So, we are going to start by the most simple model that we can imagine that is approximating the waveforms that are The waveforms that are, I mean, the relative process, which Lightweight is going to detect by light rays. It's a geometrical optics approximation. It's going to take us to caustics. This makes contact with all caustics looks the same. And then we are going, this is the verge. We are going to upgrade this to a model including aspects of waves. And this is going to, but not the full theory, and this is going to give us to diffraction. us to diffraction and this is the place in which any function is going to appear. Ad function is going to be a universal diffraction pattern over a caustic and this caustic is going to be universal in a very precise sense controlled by the Arnold theorem in Catalinian similarity. So let me start by talking, well let me comment to bring the idea of caustics in a very intuitive way. So this is this represents an axisymmetric lens, okay, this part here. Part here, and what you have here: you have incident parallel rays that impact with some parameter A. This A is the distance along the lens. And this is what we're going to call a state variable. Here we are adopting the language of capacity. And when the light goes to the lens, they get refracted. And what happens is that there are points in this plane. So points in XZ, this XZ are going to. Points in XZ, this XZ are going to be the control variables. Okay, so this is where we can look if there is light or not. So there is one line here, this line Z, which is acoustic, such that if you are outside, there is only one ray going through, exactly as the model I was saying before for PDs. But now this is not PDs, just light rays going through a lens. And if you are in the interior part of the caustic, then you have three rays. And the caustic is the point in which all of these prayers collapse. So this is a model that is. So, this is a model that is the kind of chaustic that we are used to look at in optics, but the chaustic that is more going to be conceptually more relevant in our context is actually the one associated with the rainbow. So, this is a model of a spherical model of a drop of water. And then there is some incident light here that impacts this impact parameter V. This is going to be the analog of the height of the lens before. This is the state pattern. Is the state parallel okay, and then this is going to be refracted and reflected and then refracted, and then you have some deviation. This is the way, uh, and the light mechanism behind the ray. So, what happens, why we see rain? Because if we consider this ray, this light ray A here, it's going to be refracted, reflected, and refracted again, we are going to go up with some up. Then, if you increase the parameter, the parameter P, this light rate B. of P this light ray B then you follow the same the same refraction reflection process and then the the the the opening of the angular speaker but there is a critical gray this C here such that it is refracted reflected and refracted and in such a way that if you continue going up with this blue and this green grays then the diffraction the the opening of the angle The opening of the angle after reaching this maximum in the critical value starts to decrease again. So, this is a kind of full structure. So, if you are beyond the critical ray, there are no rays that come from the drop of water. And if you are inside, for each angle, there are two. Okay, so this is why we see a rainbow because there is an accumulation of intensity around, there are more light rays close. Around, there are more light rays close to this critical angle. Well, the actual rainbow with the colors is because of the refraction index, but this is not the point that we want to emphasize. So, what should retain about these two examples of caustics? So, what should retain is that, well, here the only observable is the intensity of light. And in the caustic interior here, or here, the intensity of light is higher because you have more light rays coming to you. Actually, in the case of the rainbow, it's dramatic. Of this, of the rainbow is dramatic. Beyond the rainbow line, the rainbow, you don't have light at all. Then the intensity goes to the chaustic and they diverge. And then there is a catastrophic, so this is the catastrophe theory context, a catastrophic change. So how you model a causic, don't worry, I don't want to go to the details. All I want to keep to want to retain here is that you have this state of parameters, the state space, which are the state variables of control. States, the state variables that control what is happening in the system, and then the control space, which is what you look at. And then there is a generating function phi, which is an application from the product of these two spaces in the real numbers. And this is strongly connected with generating functions in Hamptonian dynamics. So the thing is that if you consider, if you want to know which are the rays that are active, so this file contains all the dynamics. If you want to know which are the lights which are If you want to know which are the lights which are actually realized, for instance, going through a given point xt, you have to externalize the generating function on these state parameters. And this is going to define a manifold inside the space constructed by the product of the state and the control spaces. So, this is a manifold of the same dimension of the control space, and it's going to be And it's going to be the singularities of the projection of this manifold on the controller space that define the characteristics. So, let me come back to the example before. So, in the example of the lens, so the phi here is quartic in this parameter A, which is the state variable. So, when you extremalize around A, it becomes a cubic surface. And then the caustic is just the place on the solution manifold. Solution manifold such that the projection is simpler in the sense that if you want that the kernel of the differential is zero, or just that the tangent to the manifold is vertical. And this is here to recover this time that we saw before. It's just the image of the points in which the projection is. If we go to the rainbow, then in the rainbow case, the generic function is a, well, this is, I changed the variable, but the Well, this is, I change the variable, but the delta is n db is cubic. So, if you take the if you externalize, you have a quadratic manifold, a quadratic function. Well, you have a manifold, it's parabolic here. And then what this is telling you is that for each angle, you have two rays. So for each angle below the critical one, you have two rays that reach you. This is the picture that we had before. And if you go beyond that ray, you don't have any ray reaching you. And there is a point here, stochastic, that projects. point here is the casting that projects critically so it's the place in which the projection um singular which is defined in the capstone okay it's just the the image of the point in which if you want the derivatives is uh is the spherical so this is the image that we have and actually what but it is going to comment before builds on this picture instead of an angle here this is going to be time so the control parameter is going to be time the time you place your ligo detectors at some point in the space in the space Vectors at some point in the space, you don't move it. And then the only thing that you can control is that time is going by. As time goes by, you receive two, in this approximation, two light rays of gravity that actually get to you. The intensity grows up as you approach this point, and then you diverge, then you have nothing. So this is the most simple model you can have of light. Something that detects something, grows, and then doesn't detect anything. Detect anything. Why is this important to write the context in this sense? Because we can, once we have this generating functions, there is this remarkable result that the available stable caustics are finite and classified. All of them, all the rest of caustics are topologically equivalent to a finite number of caustics. And this is the classification. And this is the classification. So it's classified in terms of the number, this is the mention, the number of control parameters you have. I want to call your attention: if you have only one control parameter, there is only one cup. And this is the phone. This is just this. This is the only thing that you can have. Every other thing is equivalent topologically to that. And the generating function, a canonical choice, that is not the only ones, a canonical choice, is this one. This is the important thing here. Important thing here, the way in which universality enters at this level, at this layer, in this asymptotic reasoning, is the universality of constants. And I want to call the attention to that. If you have only one control variable, there is only one constant. But the problem is that this diverge, as I said before. If you go to the castic, this diverge. How can you regularize this? Well, a way of regularizing that is that, well, it's not, it's a node race. It's an artifact of the approximation. Actually, I should consider the interference of the different race. The interference of the different waves, but I don't need to do have the full wave in order to do that. I can do what Fresnel from Hoffer did, particularly Fresnel gives you a prescription to calculate. It gives you a prescription to calculate the wave field by making some, perhaps in our days we would call a phi-man integral, but this is this continuous superposition of different contribution of rays. And here, phi is really the generating function. So in a first stage, you can So, in a first stage, you can calculate this integral, this integral. If you are considering a place which are out of the causing, so stationary points, solution points which are not degenerate, you can make a stationary point evaluation of that. And what you get is this result. Well, this is perhaps the sective is simple, but this is enough for the chaos. When you put the determinant of this quantity, this is just the Hessia of the directing function. When you place, you plug the value here. When you place, you plug the value here, you really recovers with this derivative function here. You recover the one over t to the one-fourth. Only doing that. Okay, but there is clearly a problem at the cowstick. And the causal is exactly the point that we want to address, the transitional problem. So what is the actual key point in all the discussion? The key point is what is called the uniform approximation. And the uniform approximation is a way of dealing all the points in a Democrat, all the stationary points in a Democratic. A democratic all the stationary points in a democratic way, either if they are non-degenerate or degenerate. And the trick goes through the Arnold theorem: is that you define some elementary caustic diffraction functions, which are just essentially the French formula for the canonical generating function in the Anotor theorem. So, this gives you a set. Theorem. So, this gives you a set of basic diffraction patterns. And then, the remarkable result is that if you give me now an arbitrary generating function file, so the one that your system is giving to you, if this generating function contains implicitly some singularity, and this is generally, it will contain genetic similarities. They will be topologically equivalent. Be topologically equivalent to one or a set or a combination of these canonical ones. So there is that transformation that allows you to rewrite the actual generating function you are dealing with to reduce it to one of these in this classification of the theorem. And then the fantastic thing is that you can, you can plug this into formula, you work a bit, and then you have this final expression. Typical, well, the result is that the wave, the diffraction thought, the wave field is some modulation. Is some modulation of the basic diffraction pattern and it's delivered. So if I there is some there is some self-similar behavior associated to that that's reminiscent of this critical behavior that we are trying to focus. But let me just apply all we have said to the ADKs to the fold. So if you are in the phone, so if I have only one. So, if I have only one control parameter, then necessarily, if the waveform radiative process, if the value block form radiative process contains acoustic in any sense, then it has to be a fault if I just dwell in a setting in which I have only the time going by as the control parameter. And this is what we have in these waveforms. So, if I have that, the waveform, the pattern. The waveform, the button is directly A. So the function that controls, that's associated with the phone, is A. And the result that I said before is that the waveform is going to be generically, if you want, a combination, a modulation between the AD and the Deliband. Just before giving the hand to Badry, so this is a case in which I'm dwelling. In which I'm dwelling in a diffraction over a cowstein. So, I mean, you can say that the wave field, the wavefill is actually providing some flesh or some clothes to the skeleton that the caustics of the caustic of the geometric diffraction provides the flesh to the skeleton of geometric objects. So can we go beyond geometric objects? Can we, because this is something that only works for high frequency. only works for high frequency. And then we invoke again this asymptotic freezing. So in this asymptotic high frequency limit, we identify a pattern with this aiming. Can we extend that before beyond that regime, that asymptotic regime? And then we come back to this transition between oscillation one and that, starting points. So the archetype of linear turning point is A B, but we can generalize this expression like that. I mean, we can consider special like that i mean can consider an effective uh in an effective way a more general turning point problem which the fire site would contain the information of our physical system and then the the markable fact again is that if you use asymptotic theory of all these then there's a control by wasso that allows you to to write the expression to this in terms of ad and ad dot with modulation and now there is no high frequency this is just a fact of codings um that's Um that's so I had the okay thank you Jose. So let me then take on from here. So as Jose said, we have to make some hypothesis of what we want for the binary black hole model. So this is the analog of, let's say, the assumption made in your me that you can map the system to one body system. In this case, In this case, the hypothesis we want to make is the following: that the waveform each of the detectors sees for the inspirable budget transition is analogous to a cost. So, you have to accept this, otherwise the rest of it, you know, will not make sense. But let's accept this for the moment and let's put it in once. So, what it means is that the effect in the control parameter space, on the space in which we are actually making the observations, is just the time. And this is one-dimensional. So, this means already from what Jose said, this, then we are forced to then imply that this has to be done for the costume. So, let us then assume that there is a single, and this talk will be an abstract variable, but we can make it more concrete. But just for the moment here, it will be an abstract state variable. Let's call it R. And it means from the analysis of the Joseph presented, that in fact, the very form that we Fact, the waveform that we are seeing, the light wave that we are seeing for the binary black hole, must be of the form we have here, which is an integral over the state parameter r, and in the phase, in the exponent, you have the qubit function. So and we are allowed to do any diffimorphisms to this. So the thing in the phase is fully equivalent to the qubit function in this canonical form for diffimorphism. This canonical form for difficultism. So you allow them to make any parameterization you want of this parameter tau appearing in the exponent. So then the solution is that, well, you do this A function at the D code, and then you reparametrize it in a suitable way. And the claim is that that should reproduce for the parameter configuration. So, again, as Jose again pointed us out, that the heavy function is boring. So, it has elegant, fine, I think it's boring, but whatever. Then you have the growth of the attitude, which follows the very simpler logic like an approximation. And then you have the link with the point problem, which transition from the oscillatory to a dynamic. So, it's all circumstantial evidence, but if you assume Circumstantial evidence, but if you assume the beginning that the waveform that you expect is analogous to a cosmetic, then you're forced to do this. Okay, so but there are some initial problems, right? The E-function by itself cannot be the answer. The amplitude grows, but the frequency is decreasing as you go closer to the merger. You can see that here. So initially, these waves are much closer together, and as you reach towards the merger, you go further apart. The merger goes further apart. So, which means that the frequencies, in fact, if you can assign a distinguishing gap and phase for this signal, then the frequency is decreasing as you go towards the merger. And this is the opposite of what happens for a brand new narcotic. You see, the chirp signal, and the frequency increases as you go to the merger. But we can reparametrize. So, then, at least to this really important first approximation, then the waveform must be a reparametrized theory function. Form must be a reparametrized theory function, and this reparametrization is the thing that should then account for this change of frequency. You have to choose a reparametrization depending upon the system parameters in such a way that it reproduces the frequency evolution that you can. I just want to mention here the asymptotic expansion of the area function at very early times, and this you see. And this you see again the amplitude, which is one upon one-fourth, and then you have the thing inside the sign, which is the phase. And the claim is that this can be reparametrized to get you the post-Newtonian waveform. And in all of this, you're allowed to include a slowly varying amplitude, so that doesn't change the essential nature of this approximation. And with the combination of the radio amplitude with the amplitude, you can exactly recover a PMA form a periodic termination. EMP formats. And then the question is: well, how far can we go? How far can we push this technology? Well, let's do a very simple exercise. So let's take a numerical waveform. So this I took a very long waveform from the SSD's catalog with a mass ratio of seven. And you can calculate empirically then what this mapping should be of the sweet patternization in the following way. So you start off with the assumption that you have the Uh, assumption that we have the AD function that this peak here should be corresponding to the peak of the numerical wave. So that is the first alignment that you do. And then you make sure then that the successive oscillations are in phase the numerical oscillations. In other words, you map the first minimum to the first minimum of the numerical waveform before peak, next maxima to the maximum after that, and so on. And this provides for you the repair. And this provides way the reparametrization going for the numerical waveform time and vice versa. Of course, this procedure itself doesn't work beyond this, so we cannot sort of extend the analysis to go beyond this here. I'll come to that in a minute. But if you just do this process, then you see that mapping function parametrization. And this will. And this is for this particular waveform. And if you have different configuration, then this change. So, this is the way that the binary parameters enter into this problem. It is to the reparameterization. The amplitude is given to you by the A function, but the phase has to be adjusted to the A. And as I said, the mapping, this procedure is not well-defined via T consumer. It's valid just a little bit before that. Valid just a little bit before that, which is a peak. Also, it's interesting here that the Hayden function, the transition happens at t equal to zero from the oscillation to the band behavior, while the precursor wave happens a little bit before that. So this is, I think, an interesting takeaway from this, right? If you believe this model, then the transition of what you believe the bunch should be is a little bit after the peak of the. Okay, so let me just say a few words about the ring time. So, after the merger, the A function has an expansion, an isomorphic expansion, very similar to what I showed you for the very early times. And once again, it is an exponential with an amplitude. So, this tells you that there's no oscillation in this, right? So, you cannot do any reparametrization to recall a ringdown model. So, the ring down itself is not part of this model. Itself is not part of this model. So it must be added separately. And in this talk, I will discuss it in detail. And the important, the physical point is that what happens in the ring down is determined by the object, parametric object that is there. So for example, you could make the argument that even for a neutral star binary, you should have a similar argument that takes you from these file to the merger, but for the post-merger signal, it's very different from the neutral star binary than for a From what the neutral star binary than for a binary black hole. For a neutral star binary, you form a hydrogen acid neutron star which might collapse to a black hole. While for the binary black hole case, you just have a fibromyalgo that drinks down and you just collapse to a black hole. So very, very different situations for post-merger. So you could never have expected a genetic model like this to account for what happens in this post-merger model. So that is not part of this model here. So that has to be an second. So that is avoid the error. And then finally, this is again a little bit more speculation. So there's a question about, you know, is the whole thing really fully linear? So if you really believe that the whole thing is a refunction, that is entirely linear in the sense that here. But there is scope here to introduce non-linearity in a very specific way. So for this, we need a new ingredient, Neo T equals zero, which is a transition point. Near t equals zero, which is a transition point in the equation. And this new ingredient is what I will call what is known as a binary property. Let me just spend like a minute discussing that. So if you have a second order ODE, so of the formula, then these coefficients A, B, and C could have singularities. The solution is guaranteed to have the same singularity structure as these coefficients, regardless of the integration constants. The integration constants. The integration constants do not change the singular structure of the solution. This is a very remarkable fact, which is not true for non-linear equations. So now, the eyeliner property means the following thing. It means that you cannot change the critical points where the function can be multi-value, like a branch curve. So that cannot change depending on the initial conditions. So, for example, you cannot have a general solution of the function. For example, you cannot have a general solution of the form of the square root of z minus c with c being an integration constant. Because if you did, then this is exactly the function multi-value here, and you're changing it if you change c here. So this can not happen. And this happens to be a remarkably strong condition. And you could a very broad sense, you can think of this as a manifestation of effacement and socialization, which is no strong dependence on the initiative. No, no strong dependence on the initial conditions. So, if you apply this condition, then it turns out for second-order equations that there are six primary equations out of 15 total which cannot be solved in terms of the non-special functions. So, then one of these six is our candidate here. And in fact, you just look at these six and you come up with the second one, which in fact is the unique odd generalization of A in this unique in this particular sense. Sense and if you look at this equation, this uh CT, that is second, that is a second Python equation. If you set alpha to zero and you ignore the one in the term, sorry, so if you set t equal to zero, so that is what happens at the merger, and if you ignore alpha for the moment, and in fact, the solution is of this particular form, which is finite if you have beta non-zero, with a different behavior than the area function. But away from this small region, the But away from this small region near t equals zero, essentially this function is indistinguishable from here. So even by this logic, even if you want to include any nonlinearities, it is quite likely that it will be of this very special kind. And then beyond this non-linear part, you can't get the end function. So at the end, so we have a proposal for what the wave function should look like. And it's listed here for the two polarizations, H plus and H cross. Two polarizations H plus and H cross. You have a slowly varying amplitude, you have a usual dependence on the inclination angle for the H plus and H cross, and then you have the reparametrized A function. And for the plus and the cross, you want a phase shift from R by two. And you can include higher nodes as well if you change the function of your intonation angle of your radio flow. And this is not the exact solution, but you'll have corrections to this. But the important point is that exactly So the important point is that exactly in the sense of the structural stability problem, that these changes, these perturbations will not diverge at the and the dependence on the binary parameters is through these functions tau plus and tau tau cross at the amplitude. So this is the proposal and again you have to accept the starting point which was that this is a volcostic and then the rest follows more or less. And then the rest follows, more or less. And then the proof is in the bulletin. Does this work? And that is the next step that has to be done. So, does this work? Does this agree with the numerical waveforms? Is there some reasonable dependence you can extract for these tau cross? Then let me just stop here, and this is the conclusion. So, this analysis is at the moment not meant to be a fully accurate reform model. So, it's meant to be the leading model. meant to be the leading model so a first approximation for the merger which captures the essential transition that we believe the system has there's a very close connection to the turning point problems or the WQP analysis that Josie mentioned and GR will lead to connections to this model if we are exactly but unlike PM or the ring down the deviations to this to this anxas of Hay should be formed so it should not be climate So, it should not be diverging. And finally, we didn't use GR in any strong way this argument. In fact, if you the underlying assumption here is that these we have the stability and the small perturbation, but this is the underlying principle for this catastrophe theory analysis. So, therefore, if you have any small deviations of GR, so you want to go to any neighboring theory, suitable phase space. Theory space, then you should again have a similar behavior to the solution of this waveform. So it should again be simple, should again be a transition problem from oscillation to band. And again, if you have non-linearities, so that a leading candidate for that should be this second pine-level equation. And in fact, the occurrence of this fine-level equation suggests deeper integral features, even in side-deinside equations, but that is a sort of perspective. But can I ask a question? Yes, Lisa, go ahead. It'd be interesting to, I mean, have you guys taken a look at the discussions of that Sean McWilliams has been putting forward as to he has a similar He has a similar goal, of course, in mind. And there, I mean, there is a potential connection, or maybe it has nothing to do with what you guys are thinking. But so, there, he's looking at the behavior of geodesics at the Lie ring, how they diverge. And from there, he gets an argument to look for a hyperbolic secant function or something like that, which again goes up and down. And if you then adjust a few parameters. Then adjust a few parameters again that come really naturally because it's as he's getting the live ring, you naturally make a connection with positive modes. So he seems to have a relatively natural control on the parameters of the interpolating function. So I'm curious to know if you guys have looked at that or not, or maybe there is a connection because at the end, it's still. It's still going after the behavior of now trajectories, um, maybe with not the same uh tools and language, but there might be a connection. I'm just curious. It's possible. Could you repeat the name of the author? Sean McWilliams. Oh, okay, good. So, no, yeah. Um, yeah, I remember looking at that, so I don't think, well, let me take it back. I think there might be connections, we haven't looked at that a little bit. Can I add something? So, I don't know anything about that, about what works. So, it sounds very interesting because it sounds like complementary to the kind of focus here. So, here we explicitly focus on the spiral and the merger, and by the very nature of the mechanism, of the underlying mechanism, this caustic thing. Mechanism, this caustic thing, the caustic doesn't know anything about the post-merger, so cannot know anything about the ring down. This is by construction. So that's why the AD simply does not work. So if you're suggesting that the work of Maguillians is actually something providing a special function particularly adapted to a polynomial mode problem, you said it's related to the light ring. That is related to the light ring. This could actually be very, very useful to match exactly when this caustic model cannot go farther. So I would say that they could actually be complementary. Look into different regimes of the problem. Any other questions? Um any any other questions or comments? I thought this was quite provocative and speculative, so there have to go. Yes, so you have left everybody's time. Well, I guess it's up. I can follow up. I guess at some point you need to say I'm colliding these objects or make a connection with the physical content of the system you prefer to. The system you prepare to then go through inspiral and merger. Where does that go? And as usual, the obvious question is: what happened in the extreme mass ratio limit? Can you make contact with just a particle that is moving around and maybe it takes forever to merge? Yes to everything. Yes, yes to everything. Yes. So, I mean, the beauty is that this has to be, if this is true, it has to be generic. It has to be true for all configurations. It has to be true for all mass ratios, all spins. Again, all of those need to come. Again, all of those lead to complications, of course, and big complications in the inspiral part. But by the time you get to the merger, the transition to the merger, in the claim following this line of thought, that should be universal. Actually, this is providing a very specific time scale where, I mean, connecting with your job, we would expect that beyond the That beyond the caustic point, so actually the merger with this language, before that, you don't have ring doubt whatsoever. So you have this effective linearity that must be treated in a different way. But from the caustic, bring down should take over. And if it is linear, we have a time scale precisely given by A ring between the peak in which the peak of a signal. In which the peak of a sign up and the moment in which you should turn on the linear regime of the ring down. This is what Madri pointed out, this peculiarity that the peak happens a little bit on the left of the caustic point. So in that sense, for us, the model reaches up to the caustic, and this is correct up there. And then you have to, at that point, and not before, not later, to connect. So if you want, it gives you. To connect, so this, if you want, it gives you a prediction where linearity starts in the post-merger regime. That's a prediction. It's falsified. I would be very happy if it's wrong. This means that the model is falsifiable, but that's good. But then, what can you say about the various claims that Luis was talking about or criticizing about linear regime? About linear regime. So he was looking for a criterion. So, what is your criterion? I mean, this whole idea about seven overtones and so on being good approximation at the peak of the waveform, is that falsified by you or is it confirmed by you? So, we haven't done that yet, so we don't know. So, for us, if you again, of course, the area function is an assumption, but if you again assume that the non-linearities, at least at That the non-linearities, at least to a first approximation, should be from this special pine-level form, then any deviations between these two functions is when we have non-linearities. Away from that, no. It should be fair to be linear. But no, we haven't done that conjugate in the market. But is your non-linearity notion the same as that of in the overtones? I mean, it doesn't seem to be the case because you're using all kinds of post-Newtonian things and so on, which are not exactly linear, high-order post-Newtonian things to get your tau to tau is a function of t. Yeah, so it's only linear in the sense that the equation is linear. Yeah, but that's not the sense I was asking. So the question is whether you can talk about, I think the word linear is used in too many senses here, right? Used in too many senses here, right? I mean, what Lewis Lehner was talking about was really the linear regime, which has to do with quasi-normal modes and so on and so forth. The question is: can you say anything about that? Because I think that is what.
