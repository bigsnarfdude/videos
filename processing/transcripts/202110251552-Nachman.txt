So, this is of course a huge area. I can't pretend to cover it all in 30 minutes. I'll just give you a few highlights and hope you'll find it useful. So for the purpose of this workshop, think of this as some bulk reconstruction theorems from either PDE boundary. Either PDE boundary data or geometric boundary data. I'll have examples of both. Whoops. Here we go. So let me start right away with one of the most famous problems in the field, the so-called inverse problem of Calderon. So here, omega is a conducting body with conductivity. Body with conductivity sigma. For the moment, it's going to be a scalar. That's how Calderon had stated it. And if we place a voltage F, imagine having electrodes on the boundary, we place a voltage F on the boundary, then the voltage U inside Satisfies this classical equation. So, here, if you think of gravity voltage drop, by Ohm's law, this is the current. So, this just says divergence of the current is zero. There's no chargers or sinks inside the body. All right, so with this F in hand and the corresponding solution U, we define an operator. We define an operator on the boundary called the Dirichlet-Tonner map, which takes this U and takes the normal component of the current. And so one can imagine this in practice. One can apply currents and measure voltages or the other way around. And Calderon published a short paper in 1918. Short paper in 1918, where she asked: Is this map which takes the we would call it here of the bulk conductivity to this Dishleton-Neumann map, which is a non-local operator on the boundary, one-to-one. In other words, if two conductivities give you the same boundary operator, do they have to be the same inside? They have to be the same inside. That's known as the uniqueness question. He also said: if that is so, find a method to reconstruct the conductivity from knowledge of these measurements, this operator. And Calderon, by putting in writing the fact that he couldn't solve this problem, so he had some simple calculations for the linearized. Simple calculations for the linearized problem. So it made it somehow interesting. He was one of the top analysts of the previous century. It made it interesting for pure mathematicians to get into it. So Halderon was motivated by geophysical prospection. Nowadays, this is quite popular in medical imaging. In medical imaging, where we'd like to image tissue properties by making boundary measurements. So, for instance, cancerous tissues are much more conductive because of the blood flow than non-cancerous tissues. But for the purpose of this workshop, think of it as a toy model for reconstruction in the bulk. And in particular, you might find it more palatable if you write. If you write the inner product of F with the Disch Leton Leyman map applied to it, then by the divergence theorem, that's equal to sigma times grad U of the corresponding solution squared inside. So you can think of this as an action corresponding to this F on the boundary. So So, this problem essentially started a field. There's lots and lots of work about it. There is uniqueness. The first nonlinear uniqueness result was in 1987 by Sylvester Ullmann. And here, maybe not so important for physicists, you see the progress and how long it took, for instance, to get from sigma to having two derivatives. To having two derivatives, to sigma having one derivative, and finally Lipschitz in 2014. Part of the interest in having fewer and fewer restrictions on sigma is that if you hit the borderline, you might, and in fact, that's one of that's how cloaking and invisibility was discovered. Discovered where conductivities were one, in fact, could not penetrate in certain regions. But I'm not going to cover that. When n equals two, the inverse problem is harder because you have less data. So imagine this operator here having a kernel. It depends on x. X and Y, think of inputting an X and collecting at Y, that's two times n minus one dimensional object. So as you move around the boundary, you have much more data in higher dimensions. In n equals 2, the problem is formally determined. So I was able to prove the uniqueness when n equals 2. If you have two derivatives in a If you have two derivatives in Lp, and a very important breakthrough was by Astala and Paivarinta, who showed uniqueness for L infinity sigma in 2006. More recently, I have a paper which is mostly about something else, but in particular proves this for Gradlock Sigma and L2, and that allows a little bit of degeneracy. Bit of degeneracy or blow-up logarithmically of the conductivity. So if you're curious about how one proves such uniqueness theorems, you start from this. So you essentially know this. And so if you can find a large family of, you can You can change this to a bilinear form. And if you can find a large family of solutions of which you know asymptotics, you can hope to recover sigma from this knowledge. So this goes from the boundary to the inside. And Calderon himself started by noticing that if you have complex exponentials, Exponentials, these can create harmonic functions. And so the game is to try to find solutions that look like these complex exponentials in certain asymptotic regimes. So in quantum optics, these are sometimes called inhomogeneous plane waves because the amplitude changes. In fact, it grows exponentially in certain regions, decays exponentially in others. And I'm saying here distorted. And I'm saying here distorted because, of course, this is just for the Euclidean Laplacian. We want solutions like this for our equation. And I should also say this makes sense because this problem is terribly ill-posed. And so somehow the information decays exponentially as you move away from the boundary. And so it makes sense to probe. To probe with solutions that somehow grow exponentially so that you have a chance of capturing what's inside. Regarding Calderon's reconstruction methods, I was able to give a reconstruction method and prove that it, in principle, gives you the conductivity exactly. And just schematically, the way it goes is is to define a certain non-linear Fourier transform of sigma. Think of it as some sort of a complex domain scattering amplitude. So it's a non-physical object which behaves beautifully like a Fourier transform. It depends non-linearly on sigma. And then show that it's possible to get Possible to get from this Dirichlet to Neumann map to the nonlinear Fourier transform via linear integral equations on the boundary. And in turn, once you have this, there are linear integral equations in the complex frequency space that give you the conductivity. One thing I'd like to quickly mention is there's a standard change of dependent variable, which changes this. Variable, we changes this to a Schrodinger operator with potential equal plus square root sigma over square root sigma. And so when you have two derivatives, that's why having two derivatives makes the problem easier in sigma, that gives you a nice Q. And then you have a corresponding Diriche-to-Neumann map for the Schroedinger operator. And perhaps surprisingly, this might trigger, I thought it might trigger somebody's, maybe an idea in this workshop. So I'd like to connect it to something you learned in kindergarten, which is the classical problem of solving inverse, the potential inverse scattering at fixed energy. Energy. You'll see where I'm getting with this in a moment. So, just quickly recall: here's a stationary Schr√∂dinger problem. The energy is k squared. Here you have physical plane waves of direction alpha that are sent in. The corresponding solutions far away behave like this, plus outgoing spherical waves here. Spherical waves. Here R is the length of X and theta is the angle of X times this, which is the scattering amplitude, and then lower order terms. And here I give you the scattering amplitude in particular to show you that it itself is some sort of a non-linear transform of the potential Q. The potential Q, right? If this were a plane wave, then this would look like a Fourier transform. And so, a problem even older than that of Calderon was, does the scattering amplitude at fixed energy determine the potential? In general, the answer is no. For radial potentials, already people had, maybe in the 50s or 60s, had whole families of the radial potential. Whole families of short-range potentials with the same scattering amplitude. However, if the potential has compact support, we have a theorem that I proved and Roman Novikov also showed it independently, that if Q has bounded support, the answer is yes. And the way we got to this is to prove, this is the part I thought might trigger some ideas. Part, I thought, might trigger some ideas. Here we have this non-local operator on the boundary, and we're talking about holography and about reconstruction. And it turns out mathematically, if you have this operator and you know what's happening out here, in particular q is zero, then you can collect the information at infinity and it's a way that one can go. And it's a way that one can go. We now know, understand quite well, how to go from the scattering amplitude to the Dirichlet-Ton-Neiman map or back. And so the two problems are in some sense equivalent. Okay, setting that aside, let's move on to the anisotropic Haderon problem. Suppose the conductivity now is a positive definite matrix rather than scalar-valued. Does the issue to normal map determine it? Here we have to realize there's some non-uniqueness just by changing variables with fixing the boundary will not change the Dirichlet-Tu-Neyman map, but it might give you a new conductivity. So, whenever we say determine, we mean up to diffeomorphisms with the boundary. In two-dimensional In two-dimension, the answer here is fairly easy because you can use isothermal coordinates to reduce to the isotropic case. In dimensions three and higher, you can quickly recognize that this is equivalent. See, this doesn't work when n equals 2. This is equivalent to Laplace-Beltrami option. To a Laplace-Belshami operator. So we're just now going to, we're going to move to a more general setting. We have a Riemannian metric, we have a Riemannian manifold with boundary. We're looking at the Laplace-Beltrami operator and its Dirichlet-Ton-Leiman map, which again, I remind you, can be thought of as this particular action. Question: Does this determine G? Question: Does this determine G-op to isometries? That's a big open problem, possibly the biggest open problem in the field. There's a lot of work on it. There are special cases that have been proved. In particular, if M is real analytic, this is known. But real analytic is a bit of a cheat here. Analytic is a bit of a cheat here because from the Diegeleton-Neumann map, you can basically compute the metric and all its derivatives at the boundary. And then once, since you know it's real analytic, that tells you what it is inside. So you don't really need a good method to get inside when in the real analytic case. It's also been proved for if the manifold design stein, which I remind you. Which I remind you implies that it's reliant in the interior. This is by Diarmu Sabareto more recently. And super recently, about a week or two ago, Alif Esmohamati, who is at this workshop, if you are willing, approved that if you're willing to work with a non-local fractional Laplacian, say square root of Laplace-Beltrami, then in fact, Then, in fact, he can recover the Riemannian metric uniquely. And this is connected to problem number four, where instead of Laplace-Beltrami, the elliptic problem, we're now going to look at waves. So now we have a function utx, which depends on time and position. And we look at the wave equation. And we look at the wave equation where this is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a Riemannian manifold with boundary. And say the initial conditions are zero, and we impose the Dirichlet conditions on the boundary for all time. There are variants of There are variants of this for finite time. And then correspondingly, I denote it by with a capital H here for hyperbolic. So this is the hyperbolic D is the Neumann map is then the Neumann derivative of the corresponding solution. So in some sense, we have a lot more data now because we have this time domain problem. Time domain problem. And by methods very different than the ones for the elliptic case, it has been shown by Medyshev and Kurilev a method they invented called the boundary control method based on controllability, meaning that you tell me what function you want on the On the manifold at a given time, I can achieve it as a wave with a given by control F on the boundary. So that's based on a deep unique continuation theorem of Tataro. So here we're in much better shape. The problem is solved. The problem is solved in great generality. But in some sense, it's not fair to have the Riemannian metric depend only on position x. If you now are in a Lorentzian setting and you think of g as dependent on time as well, the problem becomes much harder. And for a recent result of Spiros and Ali, I see the top. See the talk that Spiros will give, I believe, tomorrow afternoon. Okay, so now let's move on to a let's see how much time do I have? You have about 10 minutes left. Oh, I might not even use it all. So let's move to a purely geometric question. The so-called boundary rigidity problem. We have a Riemannian manifold with boundary for get PDEs. And for any pair of points on the boundary, suppose we know the geodesic distance. So this also came from geophysics, specifically seismology. So you have an earthquake in Tokyo and you have instruments all around the globe measuring when the waves arrive. And so you can imagine you have the distance from a point to other points on the boundary. Can you recover the structure inside? In particular, in this case, the reminder. In particular, in this case, the Riemannian metric. In general, the answer is no. If you have a region of high positive curvature here, so think of it as a mountain, then to get from X to Y, it's shorter to go around than over the mountain. And so whatever happens to the metric here will not be detected by this boundary data. This boundary data. And so one has to rule out such a counterexample. And one way to do so is to say that the manifold is simple if any geodesic has no conjugate points. So in particular, we're just going to postulate that between any two points, there's a unique length minimizing geodesic, as well as this doesn't look like it. Doesn't look like it as the boundary being strictly convex. And in 1981, so this is now 40 years old, Michel conjectured that for simple manifolds, they are what's called boundary rigid. You can determine the metric from the boundary distance function. For dimensions higher than three, this problem is still open. There's a lot of work on it. Interesting work, which I haven't put here, is when you have not only this data, but the so-called scattering relation, where if you have a point in the direction, If you have a point and a direction, send the geodesic and tell me where it comes out and in what direction. That's the scattering relation. And that you can imagine you could even send over the mountain, right, if you point it just right. So with that, and the distance function, that's called lens data. And there's beautiful, deep, recent work by Stefanov. Deep recent work by Stefanov, Ullmann, and Vaji that under certain conditions of convex foliations of the manifold, that determines the metric. But the Michel conjecture, as written here, is still open. For n equals 2, this conjecture has been solved in full generality. So when n is 2, we know So, when n is 2, we know that these distances determine the Riemannian metric. That's proved by Vestov and Ullmann in 2005. And the reason I singled it out here is because their proof consisted in showing that the boundary distance function determines the Dirich. Determines the Dirichlet-Neumann map for this metric. So this was a quite surprising result. It shows that from the geometric boundary data, you can derive the PVE boundary data. And so it brings us right back to the beginning. And you're going to see Going to see another instance of this in now advertising the talk by Tracy Balihowski tomorrow morning on a different geometric problem, which some of you have heard of. So thanks for your attention. Are there any questions? Maybe I'll start with one actually. In an earlier slide, you mentioned that the n equals two problem was formally determined, which I assume means the n three or greater problem is over determined. Yes. I'm wondering, I mean, this is a very vague way of saying things, but I'm wondering how much more More data you can introduce in these differential operators and still hope to recover it from this Dirichlet-Nolan map. And the reason I ask is that in holography, if we're working classically, for example, a lot of the operators that we might use to reconstruct the bulk are indeed differential operators of this form. When we start turning on quantum corrections, which as you might have heard, a lot of us are interested in, you can start getting non-local contributions appearing. Local contributions appearing. So, for example, what was a simple elliptic operator, a differential operator, might become like an integral differential operator that contains a term that involves smearing against some kernel. And I'm wondering if you can use like a simple counting argument to get some understanding of whether you might be able to recover this sort of additional non-local information from the same kind of boundary data. So, in other words, you're giving me more. You're giving me more unknowns, not more data, right? I'm giving you more unknowns, that's right. So, for example, I assume in two dimensions, you wouldn't be able to get any more because we can already get it. Right, it's tight. Short answers, I don't know. I've seen work on On the quantum inverse scattering, this one with non-local potentials. And I believe there's no uniqueness, but I'm not a specialist in that. On the other hand, As I mentioned, as Ali showed, somehow non-local operators somehow there's more information in them than in the local ones. So, depending on the specifics of the problem, there might be a chance. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions? I don't know if you can hear me, I can hear my question. I can hear, I can't see. Okay, welcome standard review hike. So my question is also not terribly well formed, sorry, and asking about what we can do with quantum spaces. So what if I don't have a smooth If I don't have a smooth classical manipul, but instead I have some more complicated structure, like let's say the space was non-commutative or something. Sorry, the space was not one. I'm trying to make this. Sorry, what if the space was non-commutative? Like local, what if there was some small local non-commutativity? I'm just, I'm trying to think of in general, what if I generalize away from a Ramanian smooth manifold that I understand? Smooth manifold, but I understand. I'm looking for something more quantum. How much can you understand? Yeah. Sounds like great problems that I know nothing about. Certainly would be interesting to study. Is there anything I can say? Say? Well, maybe I can reply with a question. Where do I read about this? Does someone from the audience here have a good resource? The book by Kom. Oh, the book by Com. For whatever it's worth, Belishev, who is the originator of this boundary control method, has a way of reformulating it. Formulating it in C-star algebra language. So if I were to, so that may be a good place to start because that somehow at least gives you the language of the BC method in con language. Conn language. Of course, not in the non-commutative picture, but right, I mean, Kahn's point of view is that we probe a certain space by looking at the space of functions on it. Looking at the space of functions on it. And this is what we're doing here. But I should stop before saying anything sliding into nonsense. Can you say one or two words about the sort of uh techniques that one uses to prove things here? Uses to prove things here. You mentioned something about these complex waveforms. Right. But is there like a standard sort of approach with some standard tools? Or is it like basically every proof is completely different? Or how do you go about proving these things? Can you say something to a non-expert? Let's see. So, first. As I said, the methods for here are very, very different than the ones for the problems I first talked about. But unfortunately, I can't. I'm having trouble connecting the My laptop, so I can't write, but think of polarizing this, okay? So you have sigma grad u dot grad v equals something you, if you with the boundary values of u and v, you know at the boundary. So you know inner products of Of sigma with these waves. So, and that's also, by the way, common to the hyperbolic problem. Somehow, the easy part is to note that the boundary data by some sort of integration by parts gives you inner products inside. And so let's look at the scattering theory, where you have this PDE and you look for solutions that start out behaving like these. Start out behaving like these plane waves. Okay. So what I was saying before is you can mimic plane waves by changing from a real zeta to a complex valued vector zeta with the property. Zeta with the property that all these sum up to zero. These squares sum up to zero. So for instance, in two dimensions, the vector zeta might be, let's say, c and ic, right? Then you're going to get a harmonic function. And so just like you have the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for Equation for which is an integral equation for setting up the sort of distorted plane waves for Schrodinger. You have integral equations that start out like this and whose purpose is to solve equations like that. Can you see my cursor? Oh, your screen isn't shared anymore. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Oh wow. Nobody said anything. You were pointing at things. Okay. All right. So, okay, I was pointing at this, right? So for solutions of the Schrodinger equation, there's an integral equation that you might have. There's an integral equation that you might have seen at the Lippmann-Schringer equations, right? For solving, changing the PDE to an integral equation. And the object is to find solutions that, you know, the Green's function has certain asymptotics. And so, for instance, in this case, when x is large, the solutions look like this. Plus, of course, corrections. Similarly, Similarly, suppose we want to find solutions of that, which is a transformation of our problem. But instead of the physical plane waves, which exist at positive energy, here we are, if you wish, at zero energy. And what I was talking without pointing while you weren't looking, this is a harmonic function. And these are what are called complex geometrical optic solutions. So the machinery is try to construct solutions of your problem with asymptotics that you understand. And that takes a lot of analysis. And in this case, only works when you are conformal to Euclidean. If you are If you are in a Riemannian setting, then of course you need different phases. And this particular trick only works in very special Riemannian situations, which is why the Calderon problem for general Riemannian metrics is wide open. Okay, so suppose you have these solutions in hand. So, suppose you have these solutions in hand, something else I was pointing to is this. You insert them in here, then you go to large complex frequencies, and you hope to get something like a Fourier transform of your unknown. So, I was giving you a bit of nuts and bolts, but the But the overall techniques are to construct solutions, I mean, that sounds obvious once you say it, to construct solutions of the forward problem, which you understand well enough that in an asymptotic regime, they allow you to say something about the medium. Um, so I thought, um, yeah, I'm not sure if that helps. Yeah, sure, thanks. We can do maybe one more quick question if anyone has anything. Okay, if not, let's thank Adrian again for a great talk. Thank you. Now I'll stop sharing. Now I'll stop sharing. Thank you so much.
