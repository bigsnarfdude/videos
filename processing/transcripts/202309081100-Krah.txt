Thanks a lot for giving me the opportunity to talk about the math I especially like. And it's especially light to be in such a wonderful place like this to do. So I will talk as announced about phantoms and exceptional collections on rational surfaces. So first of all in this talk maybe accessories are smooth projective Projective variety over the complex numbers and as usual dB of x is the boundary derived category of coherent sheaves. And maybe let me begin with a short reminder of the objects in the title. So, as maybe most of you know, an ordered collection of objects in db of x is an exceptional. dB of X is an exceptional collection if each object is exceptional, which means that the endomorphisms are somehow as simple as possible. So we only have endomorphisms when the shift is zero and nothing else. And we have no errors from the right to the left. And the adjective, which is very important in this talk, is the adjective full. So, such a collection is full if it generates dB of x as a triangulated category. Category. And I usually use this standard notation with the brackets. Okay, so far so good. As this definition was maybe known to most of us, let me continue with one main conjecture in this talk by Kutznetsov from 2014 in this ICM talk. In this ICM talk, and it's often referred to as the fullness conjecture. And Kutzetsov conjectured that if T is any triangulated category and admits a full exceptional collection of length N, which I so I abbreviate full exceptional collection as F E C always, then Always than any other exceptional collection of length n is full. So something like a, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it should be like a linear independence relation on the basis of a vector space or whatever. Um, maybe a small remark. This um this n, then the length of this exceptional collection can be read of uh from the Godendrick group of the category or in the case where it's db of x, then of course also from the variety. Namely, if t admits a full exceptional collection, then the Groten Lie group of T Group of t is freely generated by the images of the exceptional objects. So, this n, the length, is always the rank of the code in the group if a full exceptional collection exists. Well, and then there are, if we are given exceptional collections, we have a few operations which I just briefly recall, namely. Namely, if E1 to En is an exceptional collection, then we are allowed to somehow permute to neighboring objects, and we have these notions of left and right mutations. And so, if you swap two elements, you have to modify one to maintain this semi-orthogonality condition. So, these left and right notations do not necessarily commute, but they satisfy some relations, and one gets a grade group action on exceptional collections of a given length. So, there are explicit formulas, of course, but they are not so important in this talk, so I will skip them. But this works for any triangulated category, they're just like cones of some economic maps. And then, a little bit older, there was the conjecture by Vondahl and Polishuk. In 1993, they conjectured that for any triangle category, the break group action should be transitive on full exceptional collections. Okay, so that. Okay, so that all full exceptional collections have the same length. This is clear because it's the rank of this group, and the hope was sorry, transitive on full exceptional collections up to shifts. So we are always allowed to shift an object. This will maintain the exceptionality, but the hope was that they are all related by these protections. But okay, it was 1993. Okay, it was 1993. This year is 2023, so 30 years later. Chang, Haydn, and Schroll. So it's a preprint from the beginning of this year. They gave the first example of a triangulated category where this is not true. But but it's a very interesting example. But the example is obtained by considering a two-dimensional smooth real manifold, so the differential geometric sense, and then they consider a Foucault category associated to some topological data on this manifold and relate this. Relate these breakgroup action and these mutations to some topological invariants they already knew, and so they conclude that there are at least two orbits. But what is still open is the case when the triangulated category has this form dB of X, where somehow maybe the motivation of this conjecture came here, because back in that days, I think the first cases where this was known was maybe the projective plane and Maybe the projective plane and quadrics, or something like this. Yeah, so it's a triangulated category. It has some geometric interpretation, but in some non-algebraic sense, I would say. I'm not an expert on Foucault categories. Okay. Okay, and maybe to explain the last words in the title of this talk, I also want to recall what the Phantom missed. So, if we are given an admissible subcategory. Meaning, left and right end joints of the inclusion exists. It is a phantom if it's non-zero, but the Gordon Dee group vanishes. And here there's also a story. So there was a time where people maybe believed that such a category cannot exist, but then in But then in 2013, Goshinsky and Olaf constructed the first phantom. So, maybe to say, so-called quasi-phantoms were known to exist before. These were admissible subcategories where the Gordon group is torsion. So, it vanishes after taking Q coefficients. And then they took two varieties with quasi-phantom of co-prime torsion, then they took the product. So, since the torsion was co-prime, somehow this annihilated. Tortion was co-prime, somehow this annihilated the K0 in the product, and so they constructed the real phantom. And shortly after this, in 2015, BÃ¼ning, Graf von Budmar, Karzakov, and Sozna constructed a phantom which somehow comes not from this construction, namely on a determined Balo surface. They constructed the exceptional collection of maximal length, which does not generate the triangulated category, so there is some rest, and this rest. There is some rest, and this rest was a phantom. And it's a, as far as I know, the up to know the only phantom what was known on surfaces. This were yeah, um Boening Graf from Bootman Um Um Katzakov and Zosna Pun. It's a Barlow surface and they take the terminal Barlow surface and they're a general member of the modelized space. So I think the construction of the exceptional collection works for all, at least the terminal ones, and then, but to compute the And then, but to compute the chromology, they need a general. Um, yeah, but this surface, of course, is of a general type, so uh, it's not expected to have a full exceptional collection, but it's open if it has or not. Um, pardon? I think there is no torsion in the in the fundamental group, maybe right. Right. So, okay, but we keep in mind that this surface was of general type. So, by this fault-law conjecture that the full exceptional collection should only appear on rational varieties, there should be no full exceptional collection. Namely, on the other side, if X is a Del Petzo surface, all the nice properties, I would say, are known. Would say unknown. So the transitivity of the break group action. This was a result by Kuleshov and Olov in 1994. And more recently, it was proven that in that case, DBX has no phantoms. This is a result by Piyoshkov. From 2022, and a bit more technical result is that any numerically exceptional collection of maximum length. So, this means a collection which looks like an exceptional collection on K0, so collection E1 to EN, such that the Such that if we evaluate the Euler pairing, the alternating sum over the X spaces, it looks like it could be an exceptional collection. And maximal lengthy means that this N is the rank of the Grotenby group. And on the Petzo surface, any numerically exceptional collection of maximum. Any numerically exceptional collection of maximum length is a fully exceptional collection. So everything which can be seen in K0 is actually in the derived category. This is a result of Elagin and Lance from 2016. But one has to be aware of the fact that the last point is not true for, for example, the second Hilzeburg surface. So if we lose the Fanonness, then We lose the finalness, then we cannot expect this anymore. It just has to do with the vanishing of certain chief combology groups. Okay. So this was more or less the story. I wanted to tell what was existing before. And was somehow for me the starting point. Because since this is all known for Vel Petso surfaces, you can ask what happens for other. Happens for other surfaces which admits of full exceptional collection. So, somehow the hope is that on surfaces, because the dimension is low, you can say a bit more. And just to recall some notation, so fully exceptional collections are expected only to exist on rational surfaces. So, for me, it was very natural to consider just blow-ups of P2 in a finite set of points. In a finite set of points. And maybe to fix some notation, let me write it like this. So for each blown up point, we get an exceptional divisor EI minus one curve. So the surface should be somehow not too complicated to understand. This was my hope. We have a full exception collection, I mean, by Balenzon. I mean, by balancing on P2, we have this collection consisting of line bundles OHO2H, where H denotes a hyperplane. And then by Orlov's blow-up formula for semi-orthogonal decomposition, you also get the full exceptional collection on this blow-up. So you have to basically have to squeeze in all the line bundles associated to the exceptional devices. Devices and here H also denotes the pullback of the hyperplane class. Okay, so this is the exceptional collection we start. And if we are considering full exceptional collections, and especially those consisting of line bundles, it might be a good idea to, on the surface, to use Riemann Roch and translate everything to lattice theory in the Le Picard lattice. In the Picard lattice. And then a natural thing to maybe classify or search for new exceptional collections was, or is the idea that one can consider like orthogonal transformations of the Picard lettuce because they should, combined with the Riemann-Rock formula, give you new numerically exceptional collections. Collections. But you have to be a bit more careful. You're not interested in the whole orthogonal group, you're only interested in the part which fixes the canonical class. So isometries f of the Picard lattice with intersection form such that f of kx is kx. And I hope everyone can read this board, otherwise I can tell. Everyone can read this world, otherwise, I can turn it a bit. Okay, I cannot turn it a bit. Everything fine? I can continue. I'll comment back. I think I can continue. So, my point to make here is that this orthogonal group can be, or the stabilizer in this orthogonal group can be. Or the stabilizer in this orthogonal group can be determined. And maybe for the Petsu surfaces, this is classical. So in this lattice, there's a root system and a while group, a reflection group associated to it. And this stabilizer will exactly be the whole of this reflection group if this will be finite if the blown up points are less than eight. And it will also be the whole of the reflection group if it's infinite. It's infinite if n is equal to 9. And with this observation, because these reflections are quite geometric, they all come from Cremona transformations of the plane. With a bit more computational work, maybe we were able to prove the following. Namely, if Namely, if X is the blow-up of P2 in 9 points, so the first case, we are not Del Petzer anymore, and the Pi are in very general position, then any numerically exceptional collection of maximal. Of maximal length consisting of line bundles is a full exceptional is a full exceptional collection collection. So, this is the analog, at least on the level of line bundles of the result of elected level dance. And all, let's say, all. All, let's say, all of the above full exceptional collections lie in the same rate group ordered. Okay, so it seems to be the case that in this case nothing new happens and everything is as for the pets of surface. Surface, but if you go one rank higher, if you blow up 10 points, the lattice theory changes a bit. Still, there is this huge reflection group inside this orthogonal group. But due to an older result and lattice theorem reads to Binberg, one can compute that here there is an additional involution, Yota. So Yota is So, Yota is an involution of the Picard lattice which fixes the canonical class. And maybe let me write this here. It's super explicit in the sense that we can compute what it does on the basis of the Picard lettuce. So if we denote by di Yota of Di, this will be minus six times. This will be minus six times the hyperplane class plus two times the sum over j equals one to ten over the exceptional divisors minus ei and the hyperplane class is sent to a class I call f it's so this is just some explicit formula minus 19h plus 6. J six times the exceptional devices and sorry exactly yeah it's somehow orientation reversing and you have a Reversing, and you have a so it's a in this book of conveyance brain, it's called autochronous and anti-autochronous. So we have somehow by construction, this Yota will give you a priori just the numerically exceptional collection of maximum length. And somehow this is special because all the other exceptional collections from these everything which From these, everything which comes from the Weyl group will be will behave like on the on the on the cases before on the pets of surfaces, and they will all lie in some the same orbit of the great breakgroup action, and they will all be full exceptional collections. And this is a bit cheating because if you act by mutations, you don't necessarily stay a line bundle or a sheaf, so it's So it's this I have hidden a bit. You have to work a bit that, but they all should lie in the same orbit because they come from. Yeah, everything which comes from the Y group action should be also can be realized by a sequence of mutations. The breakdown action on exceptional collections. So you No, otherwise, if you act by the Weil group on an exceptional collection, then you lie in the same breakgroup orbit. But in the breakgroup orbit, there are also the full exceptional collections from which do not come from Line bundles or vector bundles. So this is way bigger. Yeah. So we get this collection OX, OX D one to OX D 10. To Ox D10, OXF, and OX2F. Well, and then you can start analyzing this, and this is our second theorem. Namely, if X is the blow up of 10 points in the plane and the PIR in general position, this collection, let me call it. Let me call it star, then star is exceptional, but not full. Okay, so maybe before I say about how to compute this, sorry, exactly. Yeah, so this is. Yeah, so this shows that the Kutzelsov conjecture can't be true. So, this fullness property does not wave. So, in particular, fullness conjecture can't be true. And this, I mean, the fact that it's not full tells you that there is. That it's not full tells you that there is a rest in the triangulated category. I mean, it generates a subcategory, but it's not the whole. And if you take the right or left orthogonal complement, let's call this A. This is phantom there. The reason is simply that K0 is additive among semi-orthogonal decompositions. So, this is exactly the way Boeing graph from Dosna and others. Graph from Dosna and others constructed it on the Barlow surface. Sorry? Yeah, non-existence of phantoms in this way. So actually to prove that there's absolutely no phantom, it's a bit more involved because you could serve something which then it sh yeah, then it's always full. Then it's yeah, then it's always full. Um, but you could have approached, you could have phantoms which arise in a more complicated way. So, and uh because this will be a phantom and the other corollary is that the braid group action is not transitive on. On exceptional collections of maximal length. This is simply because the mutations preserve the generated subcategory, and we have one which generates everything and the other. So this is maybe let me remark, this does not contradict to the conjecture of Bonda Polishuk because they conjectured that it's transitive on full exceptional collections, but at least this goes in the direction. Goes in the direction. And maybe a bit more, let's say, homological. Olaf conjectured that if you are given a phantom so if Olaf conjectured that if R is a finite dimension. That if R is a finite-dimensional smooth DG algebra, then the category of perfect DG modules over R is not a phantom and so. And so, maybe a corollary of our theorem is then this can be true because A will be so. This follows for general reasons, which Olaf explained in that paper, that an admissible subcategory of this form, which is an admissible subcategory in something smooth projective with a full exceptional collection, this will always be the homotopy category of the finite dimensional DG algebra. So, this is for some very general algebraic reasons. For some very general algebraic reasons. So you can find such R, which is maybe not so super explicit, but it exists. Such R. So this is also a phantom which contradicts the Orlof's conjecture. Okay. Well, I think my time is yeah, maybe I can just orally comment how you do the computation. I mean, what do you have to prove to see that it's exceptional but not full? Okay, that it's exceptional, you just compute the chromology. So this was and it will. So, this was, and it can basically translate everything in polynomials at the vanishing at points. So, this is absolutely doable, especially with the computer. But then how to prove that it's not full? There we rely on some theory developed by Kuznetsov. He calls it normal Hochschl cohomology. And he used this to compute the Hochschild cohomology of the known phantoms before. And actually, maybe just finish me. And actually, maybe just finish me. Let me finish with this remark. With the theory he developed there and some pages of computations of sheaf cohomology and some spectral sequence arguments, you can, I mean, this is all contained in his paper, so this is his technology, if you want, but you can actually compute the Hochschild cohomology of this phantom, A, which you are. Which your a priori might not be known to be a phantom, but you compute now the Hussil cohomology, and this will be maybe just let me put the table. If k equals zero, one, two, three, four, five, then bigger S six, the dimensions are one, zero, twelve, four hundred forty-eight, eight hundred fifty-three. 420 and from 6 on it zero. So, in particular, it's non-zero. So, it's non-zero. This is the only important part. And actually, I would be quite interested. Okay, from my standards, 800-something is a big number. But unfortunately, I cannot offer any explanation why this number is so big. So, I would be interested to know. interested to know I mean the involution somehow acts orientation reversing on the lattice maybe this is so I suspect it does not come from geometry and what you can see is okay I erased it but it turned the like effective classes like the exception classes and the hyperplane class into something anti-effective or something. Effective or something. And this plays a huge role in the sheaf chromology computations because your homomorphisms, I mean, you're allowed to have homomorphisms from the left to the right. And they, on the original one, they sit all in degree zero. And now you, I mean, they have to, the alternating sum has to be the same, but you shift them from degree zero to degree two. And so I would, my vague understanding is that this changes the multiplication of the errors because. The multiplication of the errors because of the Yoni era pairing from X2 to X4 is zero. And this was in the original full exceptional prediction, not the case. Okay, this thank you very much for listening.
