Lydia, and this work has been done primarily by my PhD student, Manish Kumar. So, I'll start the talk by talking about the array of poor constrictions and elastic instability induced in those geometries. Then, I'll talk about two cylinders in a confined channel and different regimes that we observe there, and how these can be related to flow through purse media. The reason we are interested in this problem is that fluid repursement media, and especially the use of viscoelastic flows, has applications in groundwater remediation, infiltration. When it comes to biological problems like transport of egg or transport of particles, transport of particles in long airways or transport of egg in female reproductive tract are related to transport in arrays of cilia. To transport in arrays of cilia and that can be simplified as 2D first media. Or also it's related to an enhanced oil recovery problem. When we think about extraction of oil from subsurface reservoirs, the primary extraction or secondary extraction each can lead to only 20% extraction of oil from subsurface reservoirs. And at the end of water flooding, still a significant amount of oil is left. Left and a method called enhanced oil recovery or chemical recovery either uses surfactant to reduce this interfacial tension and extract more oil, or uses polymers to increase the viscosity of the wetting fluid and be able to extract more oil. But that itself can also lead to elastic instability, and we'll see how these play a role. Problem of elastic instability in different geometries have been observed by many. Geometries have been observed by many researchers. For example, for flow through a single constriction, it had been studied by looking at a phase diagram of viscosity ratio as well as Weisenberg number. And as Weisenberg number exceeds the threshold, these eddies form upstream of the constriction. And if you now include inertia into the problem, then the inertial effect can suppress these formation of eddies. Also, for a problem of Also, for a problem of a cylinder in a channel flow, for Weisenberg numbers below a critical Weisenberg number, the flow is symmetric and no wake vorticity is observed. But for Weisenberg number, as Weisenberg number increases, also wake vorticity is observed upstream of the channel. And for even larger Weisenberg number, unsteady flows form. This holds for larger blockage ratio when the size of the cylinder is relatively Is blocking a large space of the channel, but if it's a small blockage ratio, then there is no upstream vorticity, and instead, there is a long stretched area of polymers or a long region where high elastic stress is observed, and this is downstream of the channel. Also, in other geometries like cross-slot channels for extensional flows, asymmetry in the flow field is observed and elastic instability. Flow field is observed and elastic instability. So, if we have Newtonian fluid, we have symmetric flow profile, but we see asymmetry in the flow profile when we have large injection of polymers. And this problem has been widely studied, both experimentally and computationally. For these flows, elongational flow is not uniform, but cross-slot channels can be optimized. So, a uniform or homogeneous elongational flow occurs. And in those cases, another type of instability. Another type of instability occurs where stagnation point is moving and shows time-dependent motion in these geometries. For two cylinders in confined channel, if Weisenberg numbers are small, experiments have shown that flow is symmetric, but for large enough Weisenberg number, eddies have been reported between the cylinders. And for array of constrictions, Flow construct for constrictions. Chris Brown and Suji Data have shown that multi-bias stability can form where there is on a study transient patterns for large Weisenberg numbers where there is no eddies in these pores or there are eddies covering different regions of these pore area. So what I'm going to start this talk with is looking at the same geometry. Looking at the same geometry of array of poor constrictions and looking at it computationally and explore the flow regime as well as the elastic stress that evolves in these flows. So this is made of these cylinder pillars where they're centers on the side of the channel. And so we have pore space and truth. And this is this simulation is done for 10 neighboring pores that. 10 neighboring pores that are connected to each other. So the equations that we solve are continuity equation, momentum equation, and the stress is composed of viscous stress and Polymer stress, where the solent stress is following Newtonian constant equation, and the Polymer stress follows the Phine P constant equation. So here we have on the Polymer stress, stress relaxation, the viscous stress, and the term due to Stress and the term due to a finite extension of the polymer, where here L is the ratio of maximum allowable length of polymer chain to equilibrium chain length. So the dimensionless parameters that are important in this problem are Reynolds number. Here we are looking at a regime where Reynolds number is very small. Weizumber number is another important dimensionless parameter. Here the range that we look into is between 10 and 50. Between 10 and 50. Then there is elasticity number, the ratio of the two, but because Reynolds number is very small, the elasticity number is very large. And advection double number, which here we define in terms of time relaxation time of the polymer over the advection time scale, which is defined based on the length scale between two throats. So if you have a single constriction or throat in the channel, then it's LS, it's infinity, it's an advaxion. Its infinities and advection times and advection Debar number would be zero for two separated troats. We have a relatively small advection Debar number. And as we decrease the separation between these pores, we would have larger Debar number. And at some point, the advection Deborah number exceeds unity. So let's start with single throat geometry. So here we So here we see that we see a region of large polymer stress in the Trojan area, and also we see streaks of larger polymer network or waves that form and advex downstream. In the upstream region, we have formation of these eddies and region of large or streaks of large polymer stress that can separate from the wall, and that's where that corresponds to also formation of these eddies. In the downstream region, they remain attached to the surface. Remain attached to the surface. We define Eddie length by looking at the horizontal component of velocity along the wall and the stagnation point far left of this troat is basically where we use it to define this eddy length. So, if there are multiple eddies forming, they're all included in this region. And if you look at the temporal evolution of this eddy length, Of this eddy length, we see there are large fluctuations in eddy length. And as we increase Weisenberg number, these fluctuations will increase. So if we look at power spectral density for fluctuations of this eddy length, that also increases with Weisenberg number, especially for higher frequencies. We have larger fluctuations when we increase Weisenberg number. Here we're looking at PDF of At PDF of any length as a function of Weisenberg number, the average of PDF increases, but also the spread of this PDF increases. And here we are looking at mean value of eddy size and the standard deviation. And we define a critical Weisenberg number in terms of where we have changed in the slope of the standard deviation for this Eddy size. And if we look at the And if you look at this control plot, it also clearly shows two regions where we have very narrow PDF-4AD size, whereas a region where we have a wider PDF-4AD size. When we have two throats that are further separated from each other, we similarly see upstream eddings that form, upstream of both throats, and polymers get relaxed after they pass through the first throat. And for that reason, Throat and for that reason, we see small slightly smaller eddies that form upstream of the rear throat. We have this fluctuation in the size of these eddies, and these fluctuations increases in amplitude as we increase Weisenberg number. The power spectra shows similar trend and for both troats are very similar, but it increases as we increase Weisenberg number and PDF. Weisenberg number and PDF of this eddy size shows similar behavior as would be observed for single throat. Next, we move to a problem of looking at array of these poor constrictions. When we have Weissen-Bregg number that is relatively smaller, we see quasi-steady flow pattern and we see formation of two eddies in the top corner of the pore space and bottom corner. And it occurs for all the And it occurs for all the pores that we have in the channel. If you look at the stress in the pore space, we have streaks of large polymer stress, and these streaks also show basically region where we don't have any flow crossing, and that's where it corresponds to formation of these eddies. But when we increase Weizen-Breg number above the threshold, we see this formation of, or basically multi-stability pattern of forms. Stability pattern that forms. There are scenarios when a pore is eddy-free or it has eddies in the top region of the channel or bottom corner. And this is very similar to what the experiment from Chris and Sujit has shown. So this snapshot shows it more clear. So we see pores that are eddy-free, some that have single eddy in the top region or in the bottom region or both top and bottom. Or both top and bottom. And if you look at the strips of large polymer stress, they coincide or very well represent the flow pattern. So here we have this strips. For example, here we have strix that are attached to the wall and we don't have any eddy. If one is separated from the wall, we see this eddy formed in the corner in pore seven, for example. And in pore six, we have this strix that is in the bottom region. And that's where we see Eddie forming in the bottom corner of the channel. In the bottom corner of the channel. This is better visualized in this space time plot when we have a size of the eddy normalized or area of the eddy normalized by the pore size. And in a space time plot for trace of polymer stress, we have these two stricts of high polymer stress that are basically where we see separation of these eddies in the corner. On the other hand, when we have Weisenberg number. On the other hand, when we have Weisenberg number that is larger than the critical Weisenberg number, the temporal evolution in this streaks of high polymer stress also resemble the change in flow pattern. Here we have these two streaks separated from the wall. We have two eddies forming. Then later in region two, we have one of these streaks is still attached to the wall, but the second one is separated and we see single eddies on the top corner. In region three, we don't have, we don't see We don't have, we don't see streaks of large polymer stress. There is no eddy, and so on, and so forth. To see how these flow patterns are correlated in neighboring cores, we define this parameter, which is shown here. And the value would be one when we have pores having similar flow pattern, and the value would be minus one when one pore is 83. If you look at the term. Is 83. If you look at the temporal evolution of this parameter, we see that it fluctuates between one and minus one. But if you look at its average temporal average, we have positively correlated flow pattern between these neighboring pores. Here, this plot shows it better because now we are looking at contours of this parameter averaged over time shown for different pore numbers. For different pore numbers, so we see that for autocorrelation would be, of course, a maximum here because we are looking at the flow correlation of the flow pattern for the same pore. But as we increase the separation between neighboring pore, this parameter decreases. But there are some outliers. For example, here we are looking at pore that is separated from its neighbor by eight pores, but still we see a relatively high correlation. And on the other hand, for closely separate, the other hand for closely separated pores sometimes we see smaller correlation between flow pattern so this is nature of this chaotic flow that we see in these pore constrictions and now if we average this parameter over the pores that have the same separation we see that it's smaller for smaller the parameter the parameter is closer to unity for a smaller Weisenberg number that's because we see quite aesthetic We see quasi-aesthetic behavior, but it gets smaller as we increase Weisenberg number, and when we see more chaotic flow and we see less correlation between these flow patterns for neighboring pores. Looking at PDF of any size, normalized by the pore size, we see a region where we have more narrow PDF and a region where we see wider PDF, and these eddies basically. PDF and these eddies basically change from one form to the other. And we observe all four patterns that I discussed earlier. And for these, when we have a change in the standard deviation, we define a critical Weisenberg number, which is about 20 plus minus 2. And this Weisenberg number is, for example, 80 corresponds to a Bakshan-Debr number of close to 1. And that's when we see this transition to instability. This transition to instability occurring in this geometry. We changed the parameter L, finite extensibility length, and it seems to not be not affecting the behavior as much. We see qualitatively similar behavior as you change L parameter. Looking at the pressure drop in the system, we have some transient behavior in the pressure, but if we look at the temporal average of pressure drop, we see that that decreases with. We see that that decreases with Weisenberg number and is also smaller for a single troll channel and double troll channel. It's smaller for those because we have in average wider channels, so that pressure drop would be smaller. But as we increase Weizenberg number, because of this multi-stabilities that we discussed, we have regions where there is no EDD and consequently, effectively, larger cross-section area occurs, and that leads to. Area occurs, and that leads to smaller resistance to flow and a smaller pressure drop. Also, there are regions where we see eddies forming in the pore space or eddies that are connecting to neighboring pores. These have not been experimentally observed, but perhaps more detailed PIV measurements can quantify such a flow state as well. If you think about If you think about the application I talked about earlier, enhanced oil recovery, if you have these flow instability and we have formation of these eddies, that then can lead to a release of this trapped oil in this corner. And this has been tested experimentally in a number of microfluidic devices using these arrays of pore network or using porous media made of pillars where oil saturation goes down as upon. Saturation goes down as polymers are used, for example, HPAM. And that can be related to elastic instability that forms. And we'll be discussing a simplified model of this porous media. And next, I'll talk about problem when we have two cylinders in a confined channel and see how elastic instability can evolve in these channels. So, in experiments, upstream wake vorticity has been observed, and we have single Has been observed when we have a single cylinder when for with larger blockage ratio for a smaller blockage ratio, this upstream wake doesn't appear, but there is a region of high elastic stress downstream of the channel, and that depends on the blockage ratio, basically. So, this is simulations when there are two cylinders in a confined channel, and this Weizen-Merich number is now 1.88, and 88 and very similar to experiments, these eddies form between two cylinders. Now, let's see what is the critical Weissenberg number and what are the different regimes that you observe for these geometries. So, as we change Weizen-Berg number for a very small Weisenberg number, we have symmetric flow profile. No eddies form. As we increase Weisenberg number, we see formation of these eddies connecting the two cylinders. And for Weisenberg, large For larger Weisenberg number, there is no eddies, but we see asymmetric flow profile. So we define two critical Weisenberg numbers that describe the transition from each of these states to the next one. And the bottom control plot here shows the trace of polymeric thrust, where we see similar to before, this streaks of large polymer strust is separating regions where we have eddies forming from the rest of the flow. Rest of the flow. If we look at the onset of instability, we can describe it in terms of Parkdon-McKinley scaling, where it tells us about hoop stress along the curve, the streamlines. Sorry to interrupt you, maybe we want to go in a while to the conclusion so we have some time for the discussion. Maybe just okay, sure. I'll finish this aside and move forward to the conclusion. So, and this. So, and this is basically the square root of Weisenberg number, Deborah number, which had been also studied or showed by Shakwei and co-workers. And if you look at component of these flows, we see regions where we have small values of numerator, we get large values of m. And regions where we have small values of denominator, we have large m. And basically, for cases where we are close to the critical Weisen-Reich number, when When transition to eddies form, we have this maximum M that occurs in between the cylinders, and that's where we see these eddies form. And I'll skip the next couple of slides and jump into conclusion where we discussed unstable eddies appearing upstream of a single throat channel, but downstream of channel is eddy. Of channel is eddy-free. We talked about the array of poor constrictions and multi-distillity that occurs in these channels, and also discussed the case of two cylinders and channel and how streaks of a stress guide flow in course media. And with that, please let me know if there is any question. Beautiful. And Rizu, many thanks for your nice presentation and talk. So we have a number of questions. The first one is
