Carlos. Recording in progress. All right. Pressure's on now. All right. Yeah, thanks everyone for being here. Bernardo gave a great overview. So that'll save me some time that I greatly appreciate. So I guess my main goal for the first half of the talk is to explain the counterexamples I found to his evenness conjecture. I'll try to draw lots of pictures and give you a really hands-on understanding. Pictures and give you a really hands-on understanding of how I found them. And also, kind of how we generalize my construction to deal kind of with all groups. I had some assumptions I had to make, but it was enough to get the counterexamples, but we wound up getting the computation of the torsion and the equivariant border that Bernardo mentioned. And I'll try to say a word about how we got that as well. And so that first chunk of the talk will be based on the paper with Andr√© Songho. With Andres Angel, Carlos, and Bernardo. Andres could not be here, unfortunately. And then the second half of the talk will be stuff with Marco Bogie. And Carlos, this is work in progress. I'll say some things about that work in progress. And Marco, I'm expecting, will say more on Thursday. So hopefully I won't say what he's planning to say. So I've tried to read his mind about what he's going to say and I'll try to avoid that. But I don't know if Marco's here. That. But I don't know if Marco's here. So hopefully, virtually at least. But no? Okay. Well, we'll go from there. I suppose the recordings will be posted at some point. Okay. Well, all right. Maybe we can try to email it. All right, cool. So what's the setup here? So throughout, I'm going to have G as a finite group and T is a surface. And let me say, orient. And let me say, oriented, and usually, but not necessarily always connected. And then also, n will be a three-manifold, n for manifold, of course, whose boundary is t and throughout. T and throughout, we're going to look at actions of this group G on T that because T is oriented, it's an orientation-preserving action. Um, so I do think in some sense, the questions I'm going to pose, the more complete question is to, or the more complete version of the question is to drop the word oriented and to understand what's happening in the non-oriented case. So I will plug on Wednesday, Carlos, Omar, and Gustavo will say some things about the non-orientable case that I'm looking forward to hearing. That I'm looking forward to hear about. So, great. So, what's the story here? These are all the actors. So, I'm going to address two questions in the talk. And the first is basically a question that Bernardo posed in his talk. And I think he spoke about it, I guess, at this point, six years ago at ICM. And I learned about it from Carlos's paper with, well, I guess Dominguez. Uh, Dominguez. Is this Emilio? So the question is: you know, one doesn't have to make this supposition, but it somehow makes the problem more interesting because it gets rid of some of the combinatorics. So I'm going to suppose the action of G on T is free. And if, you know, I view this as just a simplifying assumption for the problem. The problem is still interesting with this assumption, but Bernardo said. But Bernardo said some things about why this is, in fact, an important assumption because it's these actions where you can get torgion classes in the equivariant Bordism. So, and then the question is, when does this action extend to an action on n? And I want to stress here that this action on n is perhaps not free. Not free. Okay. And I'll call such an action extendable. And here, you know, I didn't write it. N itself is oriented. The action on n is supposed to be orientation preserving. And of course, the action on n is supposed to restrict on the boundary of n for the given action on t. So, um, right. So let me go ahead and give an answer. Uh, Now, this action is extendable exactly when it's class, which I'm just going to kind of lazily denote G is acting on T. So we get some class somewhere. Where is that somewhere? Well, in the two-dimensional oriented equivariant Bordism group of G for G. So what we want is this to be zero. But that's kind of a silly answer. That's just like, this is almost a total. That's this is almost a tautology. The point is to get a more concrete understanding of when a given class of such a free action is zero in thisomology group, and that's where the Bogomolov will come up. So that's the first question. I'm going to spend, you know, the first half of the talk you can think of as like solving this problem. But along the way, we also want to understand some things about the qualities of extension when an action does extend. And we need some special cases to plug in to solve. Uh, to plug in to solve question one in general. So, uh, let me pose the second question. And I, you know, I think it's fair to say this work, this question kind of goes back in the literature to work of Rennie and Zimmerman. Bruno Zimmerman has had a long career studying group actions on surfaces and when they extend to three manifolds and like understanding geometric properties of these things. It's very interesting. And some of what I'll discuss at the end kind of. What we'll discuss at the end kind of extends his work with Marco Reni. And so the question here is: if we suppose that the action is extendable, then we can ask: what can we say about N? And maybe not just. And maybe not just n, but what can we say about the nature of the action of g on n? So maybe it's extendable, but maybe we can guarantee, you know, we know it's extendable, but what properties can we guarantee about an extending action? So those are the two questions. And just to And just to very quickly want to give some motivations. Bernardo probably gave us sufficient motivation already, but there's actually a couple of other motivations I want to provide. So I won't say much about it, but the first motivation, because we already heard about it, is Fernardo's evenness conjecture. Maybe you don't like that. I call it your conjecture. So let me, wait. Uh, let me even this conjecture. It was in the air, as you say. So, this thing in the air. Yeah, um, so uh, so that's the first motivation. My motivation, kind of, I had developed some tools that I wasn't trying to answer this question when I was doing my PhD, but I developed some tools that I was applying in kind of a totally different setting. So, this is more of a plug, uh, because this is in some sense, maybe more core to most of my work. More core to most of my work, the kinds of questions here. And this is the computational complexity of not invariance. And more generally, three-manifold invariance. So I'm generally interested in understanding the complexity of computing explicit algorithmic computations of invariance. Rhythmic computations of invariants. And the motivations for this in my world come from quantum computing, because topological invariants can be used to build error correcting codes, quantum error correcting codes. And that's going to be important, I am told, if we are ever going to succeed at actually building a quantum computer. But part of the problem there then is to, if you give me an invariant of a knot, I want to understand what is its computational complexity. And so the theorem we The theorem we proved. This is with my advisor, Greg Cooperberg. A while ago now, I guess, 19, I suppose, is that if G is a non-abelian, it's a finite group. Throughout the talk, it's finite. So let me say it's a non-abelian simple group. And k is a diagram of a knot, like a picture of a knot, right? You know, we want to compute an invariant of k using g, and that's simply counting homomorphisms from pi one of k's complement to g. Then what we showed is that it is n. NP hard, whatever that means. I'm not going to get into computational complexity here, but it is NP hard to decide if pi one of the complement of K has a non-cyclic homomorphism to G. So this is a So, this is a little bit technical the way I stated it. Typically, you would say, well, I have the diagram K, the invariant I will, in the group G, the invariant of K is the number of homomorphisms from pi one to G. Now, there's always kind of trivial homomorphisms. That's kind of a, but what I really mean by that are homomorphisms with cyclic image, because pi one of a not complement, its abelianization is z. So, there's always like these cyclic maps. You want to know when is. these cyclic maps you want to know when is there at least one non-cyclic map and that's a very what we proved is that it's np hard mean it's a computationally difficult problem and uh the way we did it was by understanding herwitz actions of brave groups quite explicitly and we had to develop some obstruction theory uh to do that and it's that obstruction theory that came up here okay so that's all i'll say about that motivation uh About that motivation. And then the third motivation, I don't think I'll say a whole lot about it. Maybe this is more of a plug for Marco's talk on Thursday. Marco, if you're listening or whatever, I don't know. It's in the air now, so we can hope you hear me. Is the Putman-Wyland conjecture? So, this is more of a conjecture in geometric group theory, if you will. It's in the study of mapping class groups and a conjecture. Study of mapping class groups, and the conjecture is the following. It says that if the genus of some surface S is big, let's say at least three, and we have a branched cover from some bigger surface to S. So we have this and Have this, and we have that. We have a branch cover, and we have one more piece of data. Namely, we have a homology class in the cover, a first homology class in the cover with C coefficients. Then the conjecture is that the orbit of this class in the mapping class, in the set of mapping classes of S that lift to a mapping class of T so this is this will act. So, this will act on the homology of T. What the conjecture is that this orbit is infinite. And this is, I don't really come from this field. I don't have a great sense of where this problem came from, to be frank, but it is an interesting question. It's a rather elementary question, and it's stumped these guys for stumped a lot of people for a long time. So, even though it's like kind of an elementary question. Kind of an elementary question. So I'll just leave that on the board for now and maybe I'll say some more things at the end of the talk. So there are some motivations. And yeah, maybe any questions about what problem I'm studying and why you should care? Okay, so let me do some preliminaries now, just kind of give you some definitions. And I think of these as kind of low-dimensional analogs of Analogs of various words Bernardo had in his talks, such as localization and fixed points and things like that. So the first is that, well, we're studying free actions, right? So if we have a free action of G on T, and well, if T's connected, well, maybe I don't, T's not necessarily connected for what I'm about to write down. Well, then the set of Well, then the set of free actions up to equivalence is the same thing as G bundles on the quotient. So the quotient will be denoted by S. And what I do is I put a G bundle on that thing, which is the same thing as a map from pi one of that surface, that quotient surface, to G. And these are the same thing. And well, I need to quotient pi, the conjugation action of g there, but, or maybe the automorphism group of g, depends how you're counting. Morphism group of G depends how you're counting things over here. But so this is the first preliminary. And so now, hopefully this is familiar with everyone. The one thing I want to point out that is actually special in low dimensions and that we're going to exploit all the time is it's kind of lowbrow, I would say, but I think it really goes a long way. So it's the following. So if we have an extendable action, And again, g here is acting freely on t, but it doesn't necessarily act freely on n. Then the quotient of n by g, well, I'm going to call that m. I'm defining that to be m. This is another three-dimensional manifold. The important word here is manifold. It's not actually, this wouldn't be true in general. If you have a group acting on a manifold in general, the quotient is not a manifold. But if it's an orientation-preserving action of a finite group on an oriented three-manifold, then the quotient is another three-manifold. And why? Well, if this weren't a manifold, you know, what's going wrong? Well, that means there'd be a point in M. Well, that means there'd be a point in M whose neighborhood is not a ball, right? And if that's the case, well, you can ask: well, what about the pre-image of that point, one of the pre-images of that point up in N, right? So one of those points has a stabilizer inside of G. And well, in fact, because G was acting on N by orientation-preserving actions, that stabilizer has to be isomorphic to a finite subgroup of SO3. Okay, and so. And so, and the fact is, any action of a finite subgroup of SO3 on a ball, the quotient is another ball topologically. Okay, morally, there's more data there. Morally, it's an orbifold. I'll say some more about that in a second, but at the very least, the underlying space of this orbifold is a ball. So, the why here is that finite subgroups of SO3 are explicitly understood and all their actions. Explicitly understood and all their actions, the quotients of all. And let me remind you, because these will play a role repeatedly throughout the talk. So there's two infinite families. The first are the cyclic subgroups, finite cyclic subgroups of SO3, which is like rotations that fix a pair of points, antipodal points. Then there's the dihedral subgroups. And then there's three more, literally three more, not three more families, three more. They're the platonic symmetries. So there's the tetrahedral symmetry. And notice these are all orientation preserving. So these are just rotational symmetries. So the tetrahedral symmetry group is abstractly A4. There's the There's the octahedral or cubicle, same thing. They're dual. That's S4. And then there's the icosahedral or dodecahedral, same thing. Cosahedral. And that's A5. So if you just think about all of the defining actions of these groups on a ball, you see that the quotient is another ball. So Some more preliminaries. As I said, this quotient, while topologically it's a ball, there's more, we should think of it as having more data. And so let me draw this picture. We have T. We have an extendable action. So T embeds into N. And when we quotient, this is just to update you on the notation. When we quotient T by G, we get S. And then we have this manifold M. And that's what we get by quotient. And that's what we get by quotienting n by g. And here we have this inclusion here. So, but this isn't the whole story. So, m has more data. Right? For example, if the action of G on N was free, then M would come with a G bundle on it. In this case, M won't have an honest G bundle because there could be ramification. So, there can be points with non-trivial stabilizers. Be points with non-trivial stabilizers. So here's some definitions. The first is the ramification locus of an action. So the ramification locus of G acting on N is just a set of all points in N that have a non-trivial stabilizer. So, right. So I'll call this gamma tilde. call this gamma tilde and so this is a set of all p and n such that the stabilizer in g of p is not trivial it's bigger than trivial okay and so this this thing gamma tilde is by definition it's a subspace of n okay uh and now one more definition related to this one Related to this one. So I have gamma tilde there. So gamma is the, if I look at the quotient of gamma tilde by g, that's going to be called gamma, and that will live inside of m. Okay. So the branch locus of the action on n is, well, it's just gamma tilde mod g, and this is the mod g and this is the subspace of m now okay so um i think you know morally uh you can think of this gamma tilde uh you know bernardo talked about blow-ups in the context of equivariant algebraic geometry and i believe this gamma tilde uh should morally it's playing the role of the exceptional divisor and uh So, a remark now that is related to the thing I'm erasing here about the finite subgroups of SO3. I'll give an example of a picture over there in a second is that this is a useful remark, and we're going to use it, is that gamma or gamma tilde, either way, is always in. Is always in a topological graph embedded inside of M. So it's a graph. It's a one, so it has vertices and edges, and that's it. I mean, a CW complex with just. It. I mean, a CW complex with just zero and one cells. Does that answer the question? Yep. Okay. And in fact, so this is true of both gamma and gamma tilde. In fact, gamma is always a three-valent graph. And I'll be a little bit more expensive. Bit maybe strange here for a second. So I'm just going to write some symbols for a second. No, it's no, just it is. Yeah. And I missed one. 233. Let me. Okay. So these are. Okay, so these are this is cyclic, this is dihedral, this is A4, S4, A5. Okay, and let me actually draw what I mean. So these are basically showing you what that, these are labels you can put on each three valent vertex according to the stabilizer type. Okay. And so I promised pictures. So here they come. Now I can use colors. So, well, let's see. So I'll take T to be a ball and G, I will have the D6, the dihedral group of order six. So the symmetries of a triangle thought of as a subgroup of SO3. And right, of course, the symmetries of the triangle, we allow reflections, but when we embed it as a subgroup of SO3, all those reflections are really rotations of three-dimensional space. Rotations of three-dimensional space. So I'm going to have G act on T in the kind of canonical way. So what do I mean by that? Well, here's my ball and some color. So on this ball, you can imagine, you know, you can draw a triangle. Let me go ahead and do that, maybe in blue. Do that, maybe in blue. So, here's a regular triangle sitting inside the equatorial plane of this ball. And think of the symmetries of that triangle thought of as rotations of this ball. Then we can identify explicitly the ramification locus here. So, there's going to be fixed points on the boundary of T. So, throughout the talk, I'm usually thinking of G acting on T with freely, except here, G will act on T with some stabilized. Here, G will act on T with some stabilizers. Okay, and so where are they? Well, they're going to be kind of these lines like this. And then there's one more line that sticks up out of the board. Okay, so this is gamma tilde for this action. It's embedded inside, you know, this is what I mean by it's a topological graph. It's just got edges in that one vertex there. Vertex there. And so now what's the quotient? Well, I get another ball, but morally, it's an orbifold over this ball. And that orbifold has this kind of orbifold locus, what I'm calling the branch locus. And it'll look like this. So you can think of this as I said, 2, 2. Uh, I said 2 to n. So, this is like an n point, this is like a two-point, and that's a two-point, whatever that means. It's just some numerology for you. But this is if you draw the action and you write that and you, you know, the red is, it's all the points in this ball where the stabilizer is non-trivial. And then I just took the quotient. So that's what that is. So this mysterious 2,2n is that. And, but you can play this game with all of these. So you can imagine you have a tetrahedron. You have a tetrahedron, and now you have a tetrahedron inscribed in this ball. And you look at the rotational symmetries of that tetrahedron, you can draw a similar picture. And when you quotient, you're going to get something like this. Instead of being labeled 2, 2, and it'll be labeled 2, 3, 3, whatever that means. What that means is the 2 here means that if I look at a pre-image of this point up here, namely that one, that point stabilizer is a cyclic group of order 2. Whereas one of these points, Whereas one of these points, if I look at its preimage, maybe that one, its stabilizer is a cyclic group. Well, did I say that right? No, I think I screwed that up. I think these are the twos and yeah, I screwed that up. These are the twos and these two are the ends. Sorry. So I kind of, this picture is a little wonky, but the, so these points, you know, the preimage at this point is one of these six, and those each have a Z2 stabilizer. The preimage at this point is one of these two, those each have a Z3 stable. A Z3 state. Yep. Cool. So there's an example. Any questions about the example? Oh, well, it's a 2,2n because it's a dihedral action. It depends on. So you can imagine you had a pentagon there, you get a 225. And yeah, but these are maybe somehow more interesting. Oh, it's a graph is a tree. Oh, sorry. I said three. Yes. Oh, sorry, I said three. Yes, yeah. The graph is, in this case, well, it'll for actions of any of these five types of groups on a ball, the graph will always be exactly that one. It's just labeled differently. Instead of 2, 2, n, it's 2, 3, 4 or something. But more generally, if you're thinking inside of M, well, the gamma inside of M is going to be stitched up out of these types of gammas, out of these. So locally, you know, it's a union of these sitting inside of M somehow. It's a union of these sitting inside of M somehow. So, yes, absolutely. And that will definitely come up shortly. Another question? Yeah, so somehow, like, yeah, if you're thinking in terms of Connor fluid families. Yeah, so I think what's going on is somehow you don't want to look at the family of all subgroups when you're doing the low-dimensional calculation. Doing the low-dimensional calculation. Well, yeah, sorry, you don't even want to look at the family of all finite subgroups. You just want to look at all the finite subgroups that are subgroups of SO3 abstractly. So I think if you use that family, you get a cleaner calculation. And I would guess maybe that's kind of what we did some ways, but we can talk with Bernardo. Yeah. Other questions? Okay. So these are preliminaries. So, these are preliminaries. Now, I'm going to do some warm-ups, meaning I'm going to solve these questions, question one and two, for a number of examples. And these are enlightening examples insofar that we use them repeatedly. And the general calculation is basically putting these together in various ways. So, warm-ups. So, warm-up zero is that if I have the action of If I have the action of g on t, that's free. And if I knew that that was zero in the homology of g, so what do I mean by this? Well, there's different ways of looking at it. You can think of the homology of G as the oriented borders group of BG. So we get a class in there. And if this is zero, then well, the action extends, but moreover, it extends freely. So this is if and only if. So this is if and only if the action extends freely. Now I'm not saying every action on a three manifold has to be free, but there's some n that extends the action in a free way. So that's just a warm-up that'll come up later. So maybe the more important warm-up is the following, is that let's suppose that G acts on T freely. Acts on T freely so that the quotient is a torus. Then the claim is that the action always extends. Okay, so T, you know, whatever T is, if the quotient of T by G is going to be a total. Of T by G is going to be a torus, and T has to be some disjoint union of tori. So here's T, and G is acting on this union of tori freely. And then the quotient, I'm saying, is just a single torus, S, is S1 cross S1. So there's a G bundle on this, right? And that G bundle is determined by the monodromy. So we get these two cycles, if that's my base point. Cycles, if that's my base point, we have an element A and an element B. And what we know is that A and B commute. Okay, so but now we can surger this and build the extension explicitly. I think I want red. I have red over here. And how does this work? Maybe I'll draw the picture again over here a little bigger. So that's just my assumption. I got a picture like that. And it's this example that is ultimately responsible for the Bogomolov, as I'll explain in a bit. But so I'm zooming in. This is just the same picture. This is S. And I have these two monodromies, A and B. Well, whatever. I switch them. It doesn't really matter. And now what I will do is kind of Is kind of look at a regular neighborhood of this curve here, and you can fill in a handle, right? So you can imagine taking a pizza like this, and B is going to be in here. And so this is a disk crossing interval, right? And you can make the cyclic subgroup generated by B, you can put that, you can put a G bundle on this. That you can put a G bundle on this disk, on this thickened disk, where the monodromy around the boundary is this is the same as b, but then there's going to be a fixed point. So it's not really a G bundle on here. There's going to be like some ramification. Okay, now what I do is I'm going to take this pizza and I'm going to stick it in there. And maybe I have these lines like this so you can see. Like this, so you can see this gluing in a handle. And I'm filling in this torus to get a solid torus, is the point. And it's a solid torus without it, without, it's not actually a G-bundle on a solid torus because we have ramification. And the ramification will be along the core of the solid torus, so like in the middle there. Okay, so imagine gluing this disc in, and you can build a solid, an action on the solid. Basically, I'm telling you what the quotient. Basically, I'm telling you what the quotient space is of the way I'm filling in. And the way I'm filling in is like, well, if I look at this B cycle, I swapped these, but let me call that A and this B. If I look at like a lift of this cycle here, some cycle up here, well, this point will be stabilized by the cyclic, a preimage of this point is stabilized by the cyclic subgroup generated by B. And you can. And you can kind of extend into a solid torus on each piece where there's ramification in the core of the solid torus is what I'm rambling about here. So I maybe didn't draw this super great, but when you do this, when you put this one, when you glue in this equivariant two handle, what you get on the inside is, you know, if you look at the complement of this two handle and the white torus, what you get on the inside. Us, what you get on the inside is like the interior boundary there is going to be a sphere with kind of two ramification points, which I guess I was drawing in blue, like this, right? So this sphere is kind of sitting in here, right? But then you can fill that in, right? That is filled in. There's an action of G. Well, this is specifying in the cover an action of G on the disjoint union of balls like this with ramification along. Ramification along that branch locus. So, yeah, so that's supposed to be a helpful example. I don't know if I drew that well, but any questions about that? Yeah. A bagel bite. Yeah, I guess so. That does sound like a bagel bite. Yes. Yeah. Excellent. Cool. So that's that's that's. Cool. So that's another warm-up. So let me do one more warm-up. And this will be the case. So I guess I'm on number two now. So now G is abelian. And T is any surface. And then the claim is that every action always extends. So again, I'm going to look at the quotient. So if I look at the quotient of G on T, of T by G, I'm going to get some surface. By G, I'm going to get some surface S and that surface has a G bundle on it, right? And now the trick is to look at the separating curves on this surface. So if I look at this curve, for example, all right, maybe I need a base point, which I'll put right there. It doesn't really matter. That curve, because it's separating in pi one of this surface, it has to be in the commutator subgroup. Okay, so this curve. Okay, so this curve is a commutator or product of commutators. And if that's the case, well, the monodromy around this has to map to some commutator in A, but A is abelian. So the monodromy around the separating curve has to be trivial. So that's true around all of the separating curves. So what that means is I can just fill this in with is I can just fill this in with a handle like that, except now there's no ramification of that. Okay, so I can do that, but now what I've done is split this genus three surface S into a disjoint union of three genus I surfaces, but each of those I can now fill in in this way. So we use the fact that the commutator subgroup is trivial to reduce that. Cool. And I'm gonna do one more warm-up. And I'm going to do one more warm-up. Maybe I won't prove it, but I'll state it. A little on time. So, you know, this is maybe a little unfair to call a warm-up because it was really a theorem. This is Rennie and Zimmerman. And then Carlos and Carlos and Emilio kind of reproved it is that every action of a dihedral group on a surface not even have doesn't even have to be free, extends to a handle body. Oh, you didn't get it to a handle body. Well, okay, well, good enough. Yeah, we only need that it extends, but in fact, it extends to a handle body. And this is related to the second question I'll address at the end of the talk. So yeah, I'm a little low on time, so I don't think I'll give the proof, but in the free case, it's well, all right, let me just do it very quickly. So this is assuming the action is free. So, this is assuming the action is free. It's not so different in the more general case, but if it's free, well, yeah, so without loss of generality, let me assume T is connected. Then we can look at the quotient S. So, And what we know is that the G bundle on S has to be surjective, right? The monodromia is surjective. And now if you think a little harder, so here's S. Well, you can pick standard generators of S, okay? And because the monodromy is surjective, then the monodromies along the standard generators of pi 1. Along the standard generators of pi 1 of s, they have to collectively generate g. And because g is dihedral, well, every generating set of a dihedral group has to include at least one reflection. And so we're going to start by just saying, well, all right, one of the generators has to have monodromy that's a reflection, and I'll assume it's this one. And so this is a reflection. Then you ask yourself, so that the monodrome. Yourself, so that the monodroming around that is some reflection. And then you ask yourself, well, okay, what can I do with that? And you look at separating curves again. So you look at this separating curve and you see, well, okay, I don't know what the monodromia is around that, but in pi one, this curve is still a commutator. And what's the commutator subgroup of the dihedral group? It's the cyclic subgroup generated by the rotations. So this has to be a rotation here. So you have a reflection and two rotations. And so what that means is you can fill this in. And so, what that means is you can fill this in like that to get a 2, 2n singularity there. And then you just keep going. So, once you have that, you can use induction and fill the whole thing in. Okay, so that's the very hasty proof sketch. Cool. So, these are the So, these are the preliminaries, and basically, for the rest of the talk, I'm just going to be combining these constructions. So, before I get there, I want to introduce some language. So, let me talk about qualities of extension. So I'll let G act freely on T. And well, we already know what it means for the action to be extendable, but now let's look at different types of extendability depending on the ramification. So then this action extends in various ways. We would say it extends. We would say it extends freely if there exists an n with an action of g on it, such that the ramification locus is empty. This is just definition. The second is that I will say it extends non-singularly if, well, there exists an extending action such that. Such that the ramification locus, it's not going to be empty. I'm allowed to have points and ramification, but I'll assume there are no singular points. There are none of these vertices. It's just a disjoint union of circles. So in other words, so this is a topological, right? It's always a topological graph, but I'm saying it has no vertices. So what that means is gamma tilde is a link, right? Gamma tilde is a link, right? It's some knotted up link with several components sitting inside of n. And then gamma is an is a link inside of m. And we can think of n as a branch cover of m branched along the link. And then finally, I'll say the action extends only singularly if it extends, but never non-singularly. But never non-singularly. So, this would mean, you know, if you had such an action, it would mean you actually need these vertices somehow to build the extension. You're grimacing, and you should be. You should be, because I think you know where I'm heading. So, now the lemma that I didn't quite state it this way, but this is basically what I knew at the time, is that an action, a free action, extends non-singularly. And again, I told you that example of the warm-up one was where the Volga Molov came into play, and now I'm really putting that to work here. So this will extend non-singularly if and only if the class of this action inside the second homology of G is a Of G is a sum of toral classes. And a toral class is just any class on a disjoint union of tori. And the proof is very simple. Really, just letting the definitions do the work. So here's G. Here's G, or sorry, here's S. Yeah, here's S. Well, no, I guess I'll draw T. I'll do things upstairs. So I'll draw T. So maybe it has more genus. And then N, T is bounding N. And the action on N extends the action on T, G is acting everywhere. But I'm telling you that the action, the ramification locus is just a disjoint union of circles. There's no vertices. And you have circles, there's no vertices. So the ramification locus will, you know, look something like this. So there's two components there. Maybe there's a third component that's kind of like, you know, knotted up, right? So this is gamma, tilde, the ramification of this. And now, so what's going on here? We have an action of g on n, and the only points that with stabilizers are the blue points. But now you can take a regular neighborhood of the blue points. But now you can take a regular neighborhood of the blue points. And if you drill out a regular neighborhood of the blue points, the boundary of those, you know, for any one of these components, the boundary of a regular neighborhood of that thing is a torus. And there's a G action on that torus. And so the action of G on this T, it's freely bordered to an action on the tori you get, on the union of the tori you get from the regular neighborhoods of these things. So that's the proof of the one line. And now give the definition. Well, I can give a, I guess I'll say the lemma. This is how I found the counterexamples using this lemma. And one more assumption. Right. So the corollary here is that if the order of g is odd, That if the order of G is odd, and well, I'm saying let's look at the homology of G, the second homology of G, but we're going to kill all the toral classes. So that we're going to kill the subgroup generated by Toro classes. Well, as Bernardo already told us, this is the Bogomolo multiplier. So if the order of G is odd and this is non-trivial. And this is non-trivial, then there must exist an action of G, a free action of G, on a surface T that does not extend. And then the corollary to the corollary is that, well, you have to find what's the smallest odd order group with non-trivial Bogomola. With a non-trivial Bogomolov multiplier. And now, at the time, I did not know what the Bogomolov multiplier was. So I programmed a calculation in GAP to find, I didn't know what this was. I knew that this was the thing I needed. And so I used GAP to find the examples. And there's three of them of order 243. So, what I'm doing here is giving you the GAP ID in the small groups library in GAAP. So, these three groups have non-extendable actions. And hence, we get counterexamples to the evenness conjecture for those groups. So, it turns out that was a key one that. How did it look like that was a good one like that? Oh, yeah. I mean, they're ugly. I don't know. Yeah. You saw the one of order 64 in Bernardo's talk. So I had found, so I found all the groups of order like less than a thousand with non-trivial Bogomolovs. I like computed that only to find out later what the Bogomolov was and realized Gap already has a function that does that. So, but yeah, so there are smaller ones, but they're all pretty ugly. They're all p groups. They're all p groups if you're looking at order less than a thousand, and they're like pretty gnarly p groups. So I don't have any intuition for them. There's lots of p groups, right? There's something like a few hundred groups of order 243. So okay, yeah, I can. Okay, yeah, I can say some things. So, yeah, I mean, this is the Bogomola multiplier. Thanks to Bernardo. We're all warmed up to see that. And then I had prepared something that he also already talked about, just to remind you, it was when I realized, you know, I had to dig through the literature to see if like, where did this construction exist before? And where I found it was in this algebraic geometry and birational geometry. So that's where the name comes from. And, you know, so all of these groups were already known in some sense because they're counterexamples to problems in birational geometry. Examples to problems in birational geometry. So, but now let me give a theorem because there's this pesky assumption of odd order. And what we have, so yeah, I didn't really explain how I use that assumption. I didn't prove the corollary, but basically, the point is if it's odd order and the action extends, then there are no singularities ever. Then there are no singularities ever because the singularities have to correspond to points with stabilizers that are either cyclic. Well, ignore the cyclic ones. Those don't have singularities. It's the points with either dihedral or platonic singularities, right? With stabilizers that are dihedral or platonic. And if it dihedral and platonic groups always have even order. So you just simply can't get a stabilizer. That's one of those things. So the action, if it's out of order, it has to. So, the action, if it's odd order, it has to extend non-singularly. There's no singularities that you can even construct. So, the question is: well, all right, what about an even order? Is it possible that like these, you know, you can extend, but only because there's these singularities there? And the answer is no, it's very interesting. So, so this is what so Bernardo introduced a word to us that the algebraic geometers know a lot about, which is blow-up. Okay, and Is blow up okay, and uh, the word, so that's the point. If you have singularities that are platonic, you can blow them up to replace them with a network of dihedral singularities. And then when you have a dihedral component, you have a component of the ramification locus that has a like a dihedral group attached to it, then you can fill that in by Rennie Zimmerman or by Carlos's work. So, in fact, you don't need the odd-order assumption. Assumption. So the claim here is that if G is any group, any finite group, then there never exist actions that extend only non-singularly. So yeah, let me not say too much about this, but the point is that the corollary is that the Bogomolov for all G, the Bogomolov is Of is exactly the obstruction for extension. Right. And yeah, so another theorem I don't have to write down. You can also use this to compute the torsion of the equivariant board. Uses compute the torsion of the equivariant Borders and groups in dimension two. It's a direct sum of all the Bulgomolovs of the quotients of the while groups of the different conjugacy classes, subgroups, whatever. We saw the formula in that talk. So yeah. Cool. Any questions about this? There's definitely some work to be done in that theorem, but the key point is blow up. The key point is blow up, and then you use some other stuff about dihedral groups. They're isoclinic. They are isoclinic. Yeah. And I think that's an entire isoclinism class. The Bogomolov is actually an invariant of isoclinism. So, but yeah, that is the only isoclinism class. That is the only isoclinism class in order 243. So, but yeah, so because of this now, maybe I can give another corollary. I won't remember the groups, but he wrote one down, is that there exists, so the smallest groups with non-extending actions are order sixty-four. So I knew those things had non-trivial Bogomolov when I did these calculations, but I didn't have this theorem yet because I didn't use a blow-up, I didn't know the blow-up construction. Yeah, and how many are there? There are four, seven, six? There's several in order 64. And again, I think it's just one ISIC client in the class. Yeah. Okay, so I've got like five minutes left. So let me say a few things about. So, let me say a few things about the second question because I said I was going to address two questions. And so, maybe I'll just warm you up to some ideas. Like, in some sense, I expect Marco will repeat some of this, but I only have five minutes. So maybe that'll not be a problem because it'll just prepare your minds for what's to come on Thursday. So, my question too at the beginning of the talk was like, well, if the action extends, can we guarantee things about the way in which it extends? And let me make it a little more perspective. Extends and let me make it a little more precise now. So I'll call it question two prime. And let me say if the action extends, so in other words, what we know now is that that'll happen if and only if its Bogomolov class is zero, then can we guarantee that it extends to a handle body whose boundary is T. Boundary is Toundy and right. So for instance, so the point is to generalize the Rennie-Zimmerman lemma that I wrote down earlier, right? Rennie and Zimmerman proved that if G is dihedral, then the action does always extend to a handlebar. So it turns out the action, so I just want to stress, the action on the I just want to stress the action on the handle body is singular. Okay, so you know, so in general, you shouldn't expect to get an action on a handle body that is also non-singular. That's asking for way too much, because that's basically saying all this, you need a system of separating curves where the monodrome is trivial and it's just going to be directly a disjoint union of pori. So it's not particularly, it's way too much to ask for. So we're interested in having singularities, but having just a handle body. And the theorem. Body. And the theorem that really is kind of due to Marco, but he explained this stuff to us, and we'll be writing it up with Carlos. So hopefully that will come this summer. Is that there exist extendable actions that don't extend to Hamilton? And I, you know, I'll leave it to Marco. I presume he will explain this. And he'll also say more about the Putman Weiland conjecture, I believe. Okay. I don't mean to put words in his mouth, but I think he will. So let me end with kind of. So let me end with kind of an indication of why this is a subtle question. Was there a question? Well, yeah, so yeah, I'm going to address something about that. So the short answer is we don't know the obstruction, but let me give you a sense of why it's complicated. And this is really something, it's not really written down somewhere. We'll put it in our paper, but it really does follow from the work I did on. Did on this obstruction theory back in my PhD. It's just a matter of applying it correctly. So here's a lemma. It's that stabilization of an action on a surface by a trivial handle. So let me kind of say this. So trivial handle stabilization. Well, let me. Well, let me extending to a handlebody is always true. So, what I mean is if it's extendable, we have an extendable action, and we want to know, well, does this extend to a handle body? Then it's always true if we're allowed to stabilize. So let me draw a picture. I think this will really make the point. So I'm drawing S. So here's S. I've got a free action of G on T, which means I have a G bundle on S. And so you should imagine there's a G bundle on this. And we And we're assuming that that thing extends, okay? And we want to know: does it extend to a handle body? So, what happens is I can, if I stabilize, so meaning I add additional handles on this. So this, I'm adding a one handle where the bundle on the one handle is trivial. So, this is a trivial G handle. So, if I do that enough times, Times, then the fact that the action on S extends, so let me call this new thing S hat. It's S with additional handles on it. Then S hat, as long as I put enough handles on it, does extend to a handle button. So, I mean, this is a hard, this lemma follows from a hard theorem, but it is. So, it's basically saying is, well, if you had enough genus on S in the first place, then if it extends, it does extend to a handle body. So, so this tells you is that this question is not a stable question. So, I don't quite know how to build a good obstruction theory for it, but I will finish. Theory for it. But I will finish there and thanks for listening. We have enough time for too many questions. We started with the question soon. We start with the question about Oh, do you oh, do you need it? Okay. We can start with the last construction. If I recall well, when I calculated an example, the genus of the contra example was pretty set up from the Pogomolov class. If I knew, I knew exactly what it was, genus 2. Yeah, and then you're genus 2. And then you're adding genus, then you're changing the class. No, because I'm. The class, no, because I'm putting a trivial handle on it, I'm keeping the class the same because it's a trivial handle. There's a free G boardism from this thing to this thing. You just attach that one here. Okay, just I can draw better. It can completely explicit the genus of the class once you have the map from the way you construct the class, the homology. The way you construct the class, the homology class, something that's explicit, you're talking about a representative of the homology class, of the Bogomolov class, right? But that's only defined as a representative, right? So it's only defined up to tori, right? And up to trivial bundles. Up to tori by tori, and also trivial bundles, because we have the homology relation first, right? We have H2, which is border free, free G boredism. So you're allowed to stable, you're allowed to change by putting a By putting a distro union with the surface with the trivial bundle on it, you're allowed to do that. And then you're in the Bogomola, you're also allowed to have the kill off Tori. But yeah. Yeah, there's better pictures than this. Sorry. Yeah. There's a little rush. Yeah. There's another question. Yeah, I'm sorry my mic died to the people on Zoom. If Marco was watching, I guess he had to read for. So he had to read very closely. Could you just say a few words about how non-extendability relates to the evenness conjecture? In some sense, I leave that to him. Okay. But what? So what he wrote down, what did he have? So he had two BG, and there's something here. And there's something here. There's a co-kernel. So, it's torsion, is the short answer. Okay. But the non-extendability means you have torsion classes. But, and he's the one to ask, but yeah, what do I put here? I put omega, well, BG here, right? Oh, I have this backwards. Okay. So he wrote down an exact sequence. So it's this into something like that with the G on top. Is this all actions? Is that a two or three? Yeah, okay. Oh, oh, no, but I'm not sure. So, yeah, it's basically this. So, yeah, it's basically this, right? So, the co-kernel of this is the bogemole. I think. I think. No, I wrote. Yeah, I wrote it. Let me see. Where am I looking? Oh, the top. All right, I was trying to raise them. Okay, let me see. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Carlos. So I have. So I have uh so I look at yeah yeah so I have uh three-dimensional manifolds with boundary, where in the interior of the manifold, you're allowed arbitrary uh stabilizers and on the boundary you're only allowed trivial stabilizers, right? So this is a relative borderism group and um then yeah, take the boundary and when we take the boundary we land in And when we take the boundary, we land in the here. Yeah, thank you. Sorry. Yeah. So that co-currental is the bogemol. Okay. And so if the bogemolo is non-trivial, that means you had to have torsion here, I suppose. And then you get torsion in the equivariant Bordism ring. Yeah. I see. So a non-zero Bogomov multiplier implies that it's a counterexample to the geometric evenness conjecture? Yes. Okay. Yeah, let me maybe write the theorem. He flashed it in his talk, but it's kind of quick. He flashed it in his talk, but it's kind of quick. So let me write that through. Well, you were trying not to overload us with notations, which I think we all appreciated in the first talk. So let me. So the theorem. And in some sense, what I wrote on the board is kind of a flavor. It's like a variation of what I'm about to write. Not exactly the same. But what we found is that the torsion The torsion of the two-dimensional equivariant bordism in either oriented or stable unitary is isomorphic to the direct sum of the Bogomolovs of the kind of, I don't know what people call this, wild groups mod subgroups. So you take the direct sum over all conjugacy classes of subgroup. The wild group is the normalizer of that thing. You take that quotient. Of that thing, you take that quotient. So, in the particular case that K is the trivial subgroup, what we have inside of here is a term that's exactly B0G. So that's what we were finding. But in principle, you know, you could have a G where like this, the top Bogomolov is trivial, but there's some smaller term in there that's not. And maybe those, whatever these were, these things. These were these things, or whatever we had, these Chevrolet groups might be examples like that. Do I have a question? You raised the picture, but suppose we know that the free actions even freely. Even though not freely extend to handle body, and there's also this the Miller relation that is a way to go from one action to another action. So this, you say that if you steal, you arrive to something that can be extended as a handle body. But how you can come back? Oh, well, I don't know. Yeah. So, I mean, if I mean, Marco has our has examples, right? He has an example. Yeah, but in his case, we have a gene, S is genus two. S is genus 2, and we get some cover that's some large degree cover. Yeah, it's easy some large surface sitting over a genus 2s. But if we stabilize just a few times on s, then that it does extend to a handle body, even though the thing on s itself does not extend to a handle body. So that's what I mean by it's not a stable property. Yeah, I understand that, but um, well, the middle relations, yeah, is that you could and also you glue, yeah, yeah, it's the gluing glue. Yeah, yeah, it's the gluing gluing is like stabilizing so every time you apply a gluing, that's kind of like adding a handle. So maybe in that part, you can find the obstruction. Yeah, you want to, yeah, it's like you want to do the miller relations, except you're not allowed to glue. You're only allowed to cut. Yeah, we can talk about that. Yeah. I don't know if there's another question. Probably not. Thank you, Eric. Thank you.
