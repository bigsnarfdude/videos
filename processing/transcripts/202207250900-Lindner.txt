Can someone online confirm that you can hear Anke? Can you hear me? Yes. Perfectly. Okay, great. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice to be here. It's my first long trip after this long period, so I feel a little bit confused, but it's very, very nice to be here in person. So I want to talk about morphological transitions of flexible filaments and viscous flows. So in this situation, the elasticity is concentrated in the filament and the viscous flow is concentrated. Filament and the viscous flow is concentrated by everything that happens around. And I'm not sure if I should show with the pointer on the screen or there. So it's actually work that has done, the experiments have been done in Paris in our group. So together it is Olivia Duvo, my colleague, and two students, Jana Niu and Francesco Bonacci. And it's a collaboration with the simulation group of David Saint-Eon and his very good student, Brato Chacra Barti. Should I use the pointer? Okay. Okay, that's what I've really pushed to be honest. So let me start with a very quick introduction why it's interesting to look at the interaction between flexible filaments and viscous flows. So I think many of you know the motidity. Know the motility of microorganisms that often go through the use of flexible flagella that can actually beat, like here for a clummy or here for a swimming sperm, or you can even have these assemblies of flagella beating here. But they have also been recently used quite a bit in the use of microfluidic devices where you can produce flexible objects that can be used as flow sensors, as like in the two first examples, or even. First, examples, or even as a valve that can open or flow depending on the direction of the flow that you apply. And there's also many industrial applications, like for example, paper and pulp fabrication that goes through a suspension of viscous filaments or fibers, or problems of lost circulation in oil wells or other situation where you actually want to prevent flow through a fracture somewhere. So, our approach is actually to use a lab system. I could just get rid of this if I'm not using it. Maybe, or maybe not. Okay. So our approach is actually to work with the model system in the lab. And actually, our questions are twofold. So mainly, we want to understand the microscopic dynamics of a flexible object transported in a flow. So, for example, if this object is subject to a deformation due to the viscous stresses, this might change, for example, the transport of. Change, for example, the transport of the objects through the flow. And then, in the second step, we would like to understand what happens due to the stresses that this object will exert on the flow on the macroscopic flow properties. And I think I will spend a lot of time on this part today, and maybe a little bit of time on this part, but it really depends on how things go. And I want to show you a specific example. So, actually, in the group, we work a lot on free structure interactions, but the object I want to talk to about today are actually flexible Brownian filaments. Flexible Brownian filaments, and the object I will be using is an actin filament. An actin filament, I will come back to that, can have a length between 5, 20, or 40 micrometers. It can be observed under the microscope because you can make it fluorescent and is actually subject to Brownian fluctuations, mostly in the sense of shape fluctuations along its lengths. It also has a little bit of Brownian rotational noise, but very little diffusion of the center of mass. So, upfront, just to So, up front, just to explain what are the forces that are acting on our system. So, very classical for all these free structural interactions. I will, of course, have viscous drag forces. Everything in this case is a small Reynolds number, fully viscosity damped. And we have elastic restoring forces from the bending modulus of the object that will resist deformation by the viscous flows. And in our case, we also have Brownian forces mainly acting here in the form of shape fluctuations. So, we can construct with this an So, we can construct with this a number of dimensionless dimensionless numbers. So, which is the very classical elastic viscous number, then in mostly of all of our problems of re-structure interactions, compare viscous forces with elastic forces. But here, about the standardness, it's just to say that I would always be in the limit of very slender objects. And then here, we also have a new non-dimensional parameter that occurs from the competition between the Brownian forces and the elastic restoring forces. Brownian forces and the elastic restoring forces, which I will characterize as the persistence lengths. And I will say a bit more detailed what the persistence lengths is in a bit, and the length of the Brownian filament. And that will really tell me if it will, the aspect will be of a small rigid rod, of more like a flexible filament. So if I put those together, I will now just spend you a little bit of time to explain you what is the active filament and how we deal with it in the lab. So active filaments, Lab. So, actin filaments, I think you all know, are actually biological polymers that we all have in our muscles that help the cells move and help us move our muscles. But they can also be used in a very controlled way in the laboratory. And that is really the specificity of Olivia, my colleague, who works a lot with these kind of systems. So, basically, you assemble the actin filaments by using actin monomers. They have a Brownian motion. They will assemble through Brownian motion to form a spontaneous nucleus. Form a spontaneous nucleus, and once the nucleus is formed, the actin filament will grow. And then in the laboratory, you can actually stop the growth at a certain moment, you can stabilize the filament and you can actually make it fluorescent. And if you do that, what you observe is something like that. So now these are actually filaments observed. No, why not? Yeah, now everything broke. Don't worry about that. Yeah, I managed to completely force my computer. It's real official old-fashioned crush. I don't know, seems like that. Google computer crows? Yes. Oh, it unfrows. But the film does not want. But the film does not want to show. I don't know why. Okay, I'm sorry. So you need to believe me. It's a it's actually a pity because what you can see very nicely on the film that you can actually see in real time how these filaments will actually fluctuate under the action of Brownian motion. So you can maybe guess it a little bit from these shapes that they are not very straight. And what we will do once we have these fluctuations and these all these different shapes over time, from this we can actually measure the persistence length, which is the length over which deformations decorrelate. Which deformations decorrelate. And this is a measure of the elasticity of the bending modulus of the filament. If the persistence lengths is of the same length as the filament, we quantify them as semi-flexible. And this is typically the regime that we work in, because the persistence length is here to be measured around 17 micrometers. And then we can use them as a model system for an elastic filament. And we can construct the bending rigidity that in this case is given by the persistence length and KVT. KBT. So now, maybe it's just slow, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if this actually is not what normally happens. No, no, nothing is playing. No, nothing is playing. I'm not sure I can. Yeah, now something happened. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it's very slow. Okay. Let me just see if I'm there. Yeah, it's okay. So now we're back. Maybe there was something wrong with the film. I don't know. So the first thing I want to do is that I want actually not to show you what happens if you put this filament in a simple shear flow. This filament in a simple shear flow. So, just a quick reminder: a simple shear flow is called simple, but it's not really a simple flow. So, a simple shear flow is actually a combination of a rotation and a compression and an elongation along 45 degrees. The compression in this direction, the elongation in this direction. So, now if you put a flexible object in this kind of flows, you can actually expect that both of these elements will play a role. First of all, the rotation will actually rotate the filament around, and then actually when the filament And then, actually, when the filament rotates through the compressive and the elongation equator, it will actually react. And there have been numerical simulations by Mike Shelley and his group quite some time ago already, where you can see exactly that. So the filament will rotate. For those who know, this is called a Jeffrey orbit, which is very classical for elongated objects in shear flows. And when this filament gets close to the 45-degree orientation where the compression is maximum, it can induce a buckling instability and then it will continue to reduce. And then it will continue to rotate and will actually straighten out again. There's also some experiments, very nice experiments in literature, quite old experiments by Mason, by Foglax and Mason, very beautiful, where they actually put a filament in a qued device in corn syrup and actually started to rotate. And you can see that it does not exactly reproduce this shape, but it has more like a hairpin rolling around situation. And things like that have also been reproduced in microfluidic. So this is also an acting. Microfluidic. So, this is also an acting filament in a shear form in a microfluidic channel by the group of Bausch in Munich. And you can see that again, it more or less reproduces this hairpin-like structure. So, despite the fact that there were already some experiments, the full picture was kind of still missing. So, we set out to look at the dynamics of these filaments under flow, and we wanted to work in a simple shear flow as much as possible. So, in a microphone device, I think you all know that mostly in this channel flow, we always have a parabolic flow profile. We always have a parabolic flow profile. So, what we did is that mostly the microfluidic channel is actually oriented like that, and you observe from the top. But we wanted to observe in the direction of the parabolic flow profile. So, we rotated it upside down so that we could observe in the direction of the shear. We took care of two things. So the first of all was that we were far away enough from the bottom so that we did not feel the shear induced by the bottom plate, so that we can consider the flow to be a 2D flow, just the shear flow. And also, we took care of the fact that the channel was wide. Took care of the fact that the channel was wide enough so that the scale of the filament and the scale of the shear flow were well separated, so that we were really in the limit of a simple shear flow. So experimentally, this is not completely trivial because we need to work with a very high magnification and collect enough light from the active filament to have a good picture and also observe the filament while it's flowing down the channel. But we need to be far away enough from the bottom to be sure to be in this plane, which I think in this case, because we want to work with a channel which has. we want to work with a channel which has a width of 150 microns is about 150 microns too so you need a very very good microscope objective to get the resolution to be able to do that but it can be done and in this case we have the definition of the elastoviscous number that i already introduced which actually compares a viscous forces to elastic forces which you can see here the viscosity the bending modulus and you can see one the shear rate and you can see a very strong dependence with the length of the filament which comes to the power force because it goes in the viscous forces and Because it goes in the viscous forces and in the bending modules. And the Slenderness, the Brownian effect. And of course, we work always at small Reynolds numbers. So let's see how this looks like. And I hope this slide will be more corroborative. So first of all, we are observing while the filament is transported downstream in the channel. So we actually need to follow the filament. And we do that in the way that we move the microscope stage back so that the filament will always stay above the objective. And while doing that, And while doing that, we can observe different dynamics. So, if you have a very short filament, it is rather like a rigid object, and you can actually see they will just rotate around with the flow. So, here, what is it performing? It's what is called a Cheffree orbit. So, a Jeffrey orbit is the more the object is elongated, the longer it will be aligned with the flow, and then we'll have a rapid movement through the orbit and will stay aligned with the flow again. Jeffrey orbits are normally calculated for non-Brownian filaments, and in the case of a Brownian filament, what mainly changes. Case of a Brownian filament, what mainly changes is that you will have noise that acts on the filament while you are aligned with the flow, which means that the time you spend aligned with the flow will be shorter. However, once you are in the orbit, the dynamics are relatively comparable. So now if I make the filament a little bit longer, so it means that actually it becomes more easily deformable. So I hope you can see it and I will show it on the next slide, that actually can undergo this, here you just saw it, the buckling instability when the filament is oriented in the direction of the compression. Oriented in the direction of the compression. And also, what is what you're supposed to see here is that sometimes it buckles in one direction and sometimes it buckles in the other direction. So it is indeed an instability. And when I increase the lengths even more, here you can really see the fluctuations of the shape, and you see that some end kind of came up, and then actually this end is rolled around. This end is rolled around. So the filament became so floppy that it cannot sustain the rotation of the filament as a whole, and rather, one end bends up. And this is actually kind of this snake turn that you've seen on the previous slides from other groups. And just for the fun, sometimes it happens that this motion is induced on both sides, and you will see that it does something like a snake turn, which looks like an S. Okay, and as a summary, that's what you can see here. When we increase the length, so by increasing the length, this is our main control parameter because the length goes in as a power of four, we increase this viscolastic number. And here now you can see as a function of time, these different dynamics. And for the pleasure, I also showed one which is very, very, very long. And you have one that is very long, you kind of go from something straight that becomes completely coiled and then gets straight again. So, how to understand all of these different dynamics? So, to do that, These different dynamics, so to do that, I will have a lot of time to digest everything I say. I really don't know why it's like this. Does it always uncoil? Oh, if it always uncoils, in our case, it always uncoils. Yeah, oh, so the question was: does it always uncoil? Yeah, so we always saw that it uncoiled. You could imagine that something really strange, like a loop, happens in there. I think it so the There. I think it so the loop can happen because we have a little bit of noise, but in these very long ones, somehow to get the end through, I am, I don't think it would happen. But I would really like to continue. Can I ask in the meantime, what's the typical time scale at which this happens? Oh, so it is completely given by the shear rate. So our shear rates are between 1 and 10. And so the time scale of the Jeffrey orbit is given by the inverse of the shear rate. Okay, because looking at these videos that you showed, it looked like. Because looking at these videos that you showed, it looked like you were adjusting the stage while the film is slow enough to actually do that. So actually, the stage is programmed at a given speed to follow the filament. But sometimes, depending on where you are in the Pozoi flow, it needs a little bit of manual adjustment. And I also, I mean, maybe we will end the talk here. So, anyways, you can ask me any questions about this situation. Maybe I should. Maybe I should do something with the Zoom again. I think yeah, I try, but even escape is not working. So I also never know if like I'm just jumping at three slides or not. But yeah, it seems to be the correct slide. And so basically to tell you how we do to understand what is happening is that we actually collaborate with Marto and David and they may And David, and they may are like specialists on slender body theory. So they implement these three forces. Very classical is like slender body theory for the hydrodynamics. Here they use non-local. Non-local means that when the ends of the filament get close, that they can actually feed the interaction between the two. For the flexibility, normally we use Euler-Bannouille beam elasticity, and here they indeed induce the Brownian force distribution. The Brownian force distribution that actually, in this case, fulfills the fluctuation dissipation theorem. And when we run the simulations, you can actually see that the simulation and the experiments seem to resemble quite a bit. So the nice thing if you run simulations with Brownian noise is that you do not need to care about the input of an initial perturbation, which actually makes comparison between experiments and simulations very, very easy. So with this, we can construct a biased. With this, we can construct a phase diagram. So, what we do is that here you see the control parameter that we have already seen, like going along this axis, we go through these different dynamics. But what we also wanted to do is that we wanted to characterize this effect of the Brownian fluctuations. And somehow we set out with the idea that this will have a big impact on the dynamics. It turns out that if you plot these LP over L, where you actually have something which is non-Brownian on the top and something very Brownian on the bottom, that basically it does not change the transition. That basically it does not change the transition from one of these dynamics to the other. The only thing what you can actually see is that it smears out the transition. And this is actually very well known. If you have an instability and you add a bit of Brownian noise, that actually it smears out the transition threshold and you can get unstable a little bit before or a little bit above. And these are all these great points where we can either observe one of the dynamics or the other. So what you can also remark that we can find You can also remark that we can find kind of a value for the threshold. The first threshold is so for the spatling instability is around 300, and then we have a second threshold which is around 1500. So interesting here is actually that the first threshold has been predicted by Siri quite some time ago already, but it was very difficult to observe in experiments. So nobody had really observed this instability. Whereas the second instability, mostly the snake movement, has been observed a lot in experiments. Observed a lot in experiments, but it was not very clear what actually triggered the transition. So we were quite happy that we, oh, now it's gone fast. So we were quite happy that we could evidence at a threshold, which is very close to the linear stability analysis performed by the group of Mike Sharley, this buckling instability. But we wanted also to understand what happened for this trend trading movement later on. And I just made the drawing here again so that it's very. Deal the drawing here again so that it's very clear. I rotate around when I'm oriented along the 45-degree, so the buckling will set in and then things will continue to rotate. So then we wanted to understand what happens for these other movements. And to understand these other movements, what we actually saw that actually, if you look carefully, what we always saw is that it actually seems to start with something which is a little bit like this J shape. And that's what you can also see here if you look around. See here if you look around. And also, this happens at a much higher viscoelastic number, so I'm far away from the onset of instability. So, what our hypothesis is that I have the filament, the filament starts to rotate a little bit as I'm at a very large number of mu bar, even if I'm far away from the 45 degrees and actually my compression is still smaller, it's high enough to induce the beginning of an instability. So, it will induce a global buckling instability on the filament. On the filament, and then the filament will continue to rotate. So, when the slightly bucketed filament continues to rotate, it will actually orient the end again aligned with the flow, and this part of the filament will actually point upwards. And then this part is bent around by the flow. And then actually, Barato and David wrote down the equations for this kind of J-shape, and we could show that the J-shape can only exist for a control parameter above a certain value. Yes, please. So, I just had some hard time to so typically in elasticity problems, we have the compression all over. Yes. In this case, you have a tangential force that can make the stress along the filament non-uniform. Yes, it is non-uniform. Where is exactly the compression? So, actually, you can write down the tension inside the filament. And if you have these tangential forces that compress the filament, you get actually like a parabolic stress. You get actually like a parabolic stress profile inside the filament. So all of it, so all of it is compressive or everything is compressed. But at different magnitudes. Exactly. And the maximal compression is at the edges or at the center? No. The tension is maximal in the center. The middle left, the buckling happens at the edge. Yeah, but only in this case. So I am not sure I would say that buckling happens at the edge because if we start with the one that is actually like the what I call global Like the what I call global buckling, it's really like a C shape that you can also see if you press on an elastic rod from two sides, it will buckle like in the C shape. So it's the same kind of instability. You can give a C or a W or S, whatever, if you go to higher modes. And our idea is that when you go to the J, that it also starts with a global buckling here. So when you have the stress distribution, it really comes from the tangential flows of the viscous stress, and that it will have a global buckling. That it will have a global buckling, and only when you continue to rotate the global buckling, that you will realign part of it with the flow, and only this part will under compression will be under compression, and then this one will actually form this small G-shape. Thank you. Yeah. And what is different here is that if you are closer to the onset of instability, buckling will only be induced when you're already at 45 degrees. And then when you continue to rotate, actually, the stress will decrease. Whereas here, you already buckle at a moment where you continue to rotate. The moment where you continue to rotate, your stress will increase. Are there more questions or comments? Okay, so with this, we have the impression that we have nicely understood what happens under shear. And I think I will jump over that because I want to continue a little bit. So, so far, I've talked about simple shear, continuous simple shear. But in many applications or biological flows, we actually have oscillatory flows. So, we thought it would be really interesting to see what the filament does if I don't rotate it continuously. I don't rotate it continuously, but actually rotate back and forth with an oscillatory flow. It's also interesting for many applications in viology, where very often you actually measure things under oscillatory flows. So the setup is very comparable to the one that you've already seen, despite the fact that now we do not impose the flow rate, but we were imposing the pressure, because it's much more easy if you want to have a direct response of your system to impose directly the pressure difference and to still have flows that are slow enough that we can follow the object. Slow enough that we can follow the object and have the correct range of shear rates. We actually had to put some resistance before and after the channel to slow down the flow in the middle of the channel. But doing all of that, actually, we can apply an oscillator quite nicely here. And what you can see, here is probably the pressure difference and the shear rate resolved as a function of time. You can see both of them are nicely sinusoidal. And what you cannot see, there's always a tiny shift between the shear rate and the Between the shear rate and the pressure, because there's always some elasticity in your system that actually creates this shift. But here, actually, this time shift is very small compared to the frequency of our oscillations. But what you can actually also see is that, oh no, you cannot because it's normalized, but typical oscillation frequencies are at the order of magnitude of a second. So we cannot go faster because our system would not allow us to do it. And again, this is drawn here. You have the professor fight and the Ellen. Drawn here, you have the propressive part and the elongational part of your system. So, what is interesting about the system is that now you have more parameters to actually play on the system. One of them, for example, is that you can actually have an initial fiber orientation. So, you saw that under continuous shear, I always rotate many times around. So basically, I would always start from something that is aligned with the flow. Now, if I'm actually going back and forth, I can imagine that I start here, I go back a bit, and I go back and forth. So, I have an initial orientation. And forth, so I have an initial orientation of the filament when I start. Let's say, for example, my half cycle. I also have a new time scale. Before the time scale, and so there was the question that I would just ask, the time scale was fully given by the shear rate or the inverse of the shear rate. Now I can add the period to the system and we construct actually a non-dimensional oscillation period that now I can influence either by the shear rate. If I do that, I will also change the elastic number, or by the period of my oscillation. So I have a new time scale. Period of my oscillation. So I have a new time scale in my system. And basically, also the last two viscous numbers now will become time dependent because it will actually be given by the gamma dot that fluctuates over time. So the values I will give are always the maximum shear rates, but we will see for the dynamics that is really important that it will now be time dependent. So what does this give as an influence on the fiber morphology? So let me just walk you through two different things that we observe. So in all the cases shown here, we are very far above. Cases shown here, we are very far above the buckling threshold. So it's 10 to the power of 4. And remember, the buckling threshold was like at 300. So, what I do here is that I will actually increase the initial orientation of my filament. So, if it's more or less aligned with the flow direction and I apply my flow, it can actually rotate around quite a bit. And you see this nice C buckling that we already know. If I align it a bit stronger, you can see again that it will buckle, but now it's starting. That it will buckle, but now it started a bit later, so it is more time to rotate around. And you will see that it is kind of already stretching out again because it was rotating through the compression and going again into the extension part. This one is nearly at 45 degrees. It's still, well, actually, it's at 25, not 45, but so it's in a slightly higher angle. So it would have this nice C-buckling and then it's actually stretched out again because it will go through the compressive part onto the other side where it's actually stretched again. Other side where it's actually stretched again. Oh, let's zoom, let's deconnect it. Yeah, I know I lost the internet connection. Yeah, it's really nice. It's really nice. I can also turn my screen. I should really. So, for those who have a big presentation, maybe you would prefer to copy it on the computer there. It on the computer there. Okay, I have no internet. Yeah, Eduroam is also not always extremely reliable. Oh, you were kicked out also? Yeah. Ah, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, exactly. So I'm not sure if this was the right meeting. I can just try it. Meeting, you can just try it. Yes, there is a guess, yes. Okay, or you seem to ask me if it works. Yeah, something is back, not me, but something is back. Just go back to the emails and I also have to find the address again. I think you still don't have it. I think you still don't have internet. Sorry? I think you're still disconnected, or I'm still disconnected. Yeah, you're right. I'm still disconnected. I can't connect to Netball. I have no idea why I was going to. Is it right, I guess? Is it listed? OBC visitor? Yeah, I think it's open. Okay. Maybe just something is strange with my computer. Should I just restart my computer? Is anyone else having trouble connecting? No, I think they're all connected. I will just try once again. Yeah, this seems like an issue with the computer dynamic. I think so too. Just restarting. There seems to be general unhappiness of my computer. Are there any questions in the main? I can try to answer them by. I can continue telling you the story and then I'm just showing you the slides. Can I ask a question then? Yeah, you can. I'm trying to multitask to answer and push back my computer, but please, Pablo, go ahead. Back my computer, but please, Paolo, go ahead. I don't want to add to the stretch. No, no, it's okay, please. So, on the first part, when it was steady, what was the Becklin number on the flow versus the Brownian motion that you can measure? Is that you straddling the Brownian to the non-Brownian or is it doesn't matter? You mean the Peckley number in the sense of the displacement of the center? In the sense of the displacement of the center of mass? Right. Yeah, so I don't have it in mind, but basically, the displacement of the center of mass, you can really neglect it compared to what happens. So the fact that it's really kind of long. Sorry, I need to find the login again. So the fact that the filament is between five and 10 or 20 micrometers long makes actually the diffusion coefficient of the center of mass really small. So it completely follows the streamline. Completely follows the streamline. So, what is the rotational diffusion? So, the rotational diffusion actually will be the thing that kicks you out of the equilibrium position with the flow and a lot the shape fluctuations. Everything is kind of I don't know what happened. Everything is kind of, I don't know what happened. Everything is very, very, very slow. Yes, my computer is, I don't know, having problems with the time difference, or I have no idea. Because I never work at after seven, so I decided that it is impossible. I think it's really bad. It doesn't really manage to open that. Oh, but I think to have internet. Seem to have internet. They need to connect to them. Hear your computer screaming. Yeah, yeah. The price of the twists. Okay, so look at the presentations here. Why can't I okay. Okay. Oh, here we go. Do you think something happened? Happening it's just trying to open Zoom. There it is. Yeah, you don't know how long it will last. Okay. Well, so far so good, but I still need to move. I can't believe it. Okay, so uh, we are back. So, what we basically the take-home message here is that depending on the initial orientation, the dynamics are different. So, we can just have a continuous buckling and then the period is ended. Or we can go from the compressive part to the extensional part. In this case, I will buckle in the compressive part and I will unbuckle in the extensional part. In the extension part, and in some situations, which is actually kind of surprising, the filament does not buckle at all, despite the fact that it starts well in the compressive gradient and that the control parameter is really high. And just to tell you, we matched here again experiments and simulations. And what we also wanted to show here, you see the deformation happening on the filament, showing that actually this one does not deform at all. And what is interesting to note is that actually the way the filament rotates is fully given by the Jeffrey orbit dynamics. The Jeffrey orbit dynamics, and we think this is the case because basically the Brownian fluctuations play a role when you're fully aligned with the flow. But as you start here with a finite angle already, we have a very nice correspondence between the predictions from the Jeffrey orbits. And I pray that the next slide will work. So the next thing we changed is that we actually changed the oscillation period. So this is a very short oscillation period and this is a long oscillation period. So in the very short oscillation period, actually the filament nearly does not move and you can see that it just remains. Does not move, and you can see that it just remains straight despite the fact that it's well-oriented in the compressive quadrant. If you start, you have a slightly longer oscillation period, it will start to slightly deform, and if you're even longer, it will fully deform. So, from this, we can retain that our new two new control parameters have a very important influence on the system, and also that surprisingly, I can create situations where buckling does not take place. And I will take a small detour before explaining to you why buckling cannot take place. But just actually the fact that we can produce nice and other shapes that you have not seen at all in this in the continuous shear flow. So remember, in the continuous shear flow, basically we always saw a C. And at some stage, the C could not be produced anymore because the filament was so flexible that it could not sustain the full rotation. However, linear stability theory predicts the C, the S, and the W as higher modes. So we could expect, and that's also what we sought in the beginning to observe in shear, that In the beginning, to observe in shear, that we will observe all these modes in the shear flow. So now we have a new situation where we can actually initiate the period or the flow with the filament aligned not with the flow, but already with a finite angle. And in this case, we can prevent the formation of this G-shape and of the tank trading motion. And we can end up with something that would actually produce these nice higher buckling shapes. So again, the role of the fact that I can initially put the filament at the surface. I can initially put the filament at a certain orientation becomes very important. But now I would like to explain you why we think that the buckling does not always take place. So I will now show results from the simulations because it's much easier to produce many different initial conditions from the simulations. And what you're seeing here is the bubbling probability for different periods for a given condition. So what is interesting to see is that if I have a very short To see is that if we have a very short period, you can see that there's only a small number of initial orientations not far from the 45 degrees. We have a reasonable number of buckling probabilities probabilities, so a reasonable number of buckling taking place at small angles or at large angles, the buckling will not take place at all. If the period gets longer, actually this picture changes a bit, but basically what's still is the fact, if I start at a very orientation, very... Orientation very close to the orientation alignment with the flow, it's difficult to introduce buckling. And basically, if I'm at an angle, I don't know, a bit higher than 60 degrees, I never observe buckling. So if we look at that, so basically there's two things that we need to retain. If I'm very close to the flow, of course, I would move through the full compression of the flow, but it will take time for the filament to arrive there. So until the filament arrives to the full compression, actually the flow The full compression actually the flow has already moved on, and in my oscillatory part of my flow, I'm far away from the maximum compression that I can induce, and I'm getting close to a part where actually the flow velocity or better the shear rate will go to zero. So that's why it's not always advantageous to start very close to the flow orientation. And then this part is more easy to understand. If I start with an angle which is quite after the compressive part, I mean, I just don't have enough time to bottle. Time to buckle. And this is actually also shown just again on a summary plot where here I have reproduced the same data, but now the buckling probability is coded in a color. Here I have the period and here the initial orientation. So we see that for already all periods that we tested, if I'm above 60 degrees, nothing will happen. And you can see for the small hole, actually, it's difficult to buckle also if I'm close to the alignment with the flow. I also want to point out that everything that we studied is actually. Everything that we started is actually a period where I can at most go do like one, I mean, go once from the compression to the extension. So it is not that I can several do several tours. So to understand that a little bit bigger, better, I think I already kind of explained with my hands what I wanted to draw here. If I start here, the time it takes to me to come to a region where the compression gets to be above the threshold, the flow has already decreased again, and I will not. Flow has already decreased again, and I will not feel a high enough compression to have a positive cross rate of my instability. And if I start here, I will maybe never see a high enough cross rate. But to understand that a bit better, and I will try to explain this in a reasonable way, Barato and David did what they call a weakly non-linear Lando theory. So there's two things. It's not only linear stability analysis, but they went onto the weakly non-linear part, but also what is the end. But also, what is the Lando theory adds is that the control parameter is time-dependent. I would maybe just cite one of the examples. So, first thing that what you do is that you look at the growth rate of your stability analysis. And of course, the initial perturbation will only grow if the growth rate is positive. And if we just take like a situation like this yellow one here, it starts at a reasonable angle around 30 degrees. So it starts to rotate a little bit and very soon. To rotate a little bit, and very soon, so sorry, this is the angle here, and very soon it will reach an area where actually the compression rate is so strong that the growth rate is positive. And so for during all the time until it goes to the extension quadrant, the growth rate will be positive. In this case, if we look at the amplitude of perturbation, so they all start at something that we call 0.02, which is the Brownian noise of the initial shape fluctuation, it will start to grow until we can detect it because we. Until we can detect it, because we also need, of course, an experimental detection threshold to know if growth has taken place. And so this one would be counted as a buckling in our situation. However, I have other situations like, for example, this one that starts at a smaller angle, which actually goes through quite a part where the cross rate is positive, but this is not enough to bring the initial perturbation above the threshold where we detect the bubbling instability. And it will maybe not go through all of them. Will maybe not go through all of them in detail, but it summarizes nicely the combination of the fact that you spend a certain time in a regime where your growth rate is positive, but that also for an instability to manifest itself, especially in a system with Brownian noise, you need a little bit of time to make it grow. And this is summarized here. And now this is a result from the theory. Again, we have only a certain region where perturbations can grow strong enough that I can measure them. And this corresponds quite nicely to what we This corresponds quite nicely to what we saw on the buckling probability. And to conclude this part on the oscillatory flows, I just wanted to tell you that what I looked at right now was only the first half period. So it was really not a lot. So there's many things to do going from here. For example, for you look at the first, the full period, going there and coming back. And then we could also go to much longer time. So just for if I look at the first period where If I look at the first period where I go there and then I come back, it's interesting to note that there are situations where actually we have like one cycle. So we have here we go there, we have one buckling instability, then I go back and it stretches out again because what is compressive at the way there is actually extension on the way back. However, if I continue to rotate longer, so if I rotate in the first half through the buckling instability again into the stretching part, if I reverse now my flow, it will buckle again and go back. It will buckle again and go back. So, for some conditions, I would actually observe two bucklings per period, and for the others, I will only observe one. And if you go even further, and this I will just let the maybe let the film play. So, a really interesting question to study here is what happens with reversibility or irreversibility if I go to longer times. Because we have two sources of irreversibility. I have a little bit of noise, of course, which can kick things out of their orbit. Which can kick things out of their orbit. But also, despite the fact that we're at small Reynolds number flows, as we have the elastic deformation of my filament, there's nothing that obliges us to come back to the initial condition. And that's something that we're working on right now at the moment. And I have many other things, but I have no idea where I'm time-wise. We started 50 minutes late. So like five minutes, if that's okay. No, it's okay. We have a lot of time after. We have a lot of time afterwards, so if there's more to discuss, we can do that afterwards. But if I have five minutes, I really want to go to the compressive flow. Because now, everything I did so far was under shear flows, and shear flows are a very typical flow that we observe. But to understand a system are not necessarily the easiest things to start with, because we have all this combination about rotation and deformation. So at some stage, we thought, well, maybe let's just. If the worms are long enough and you have a sufficient three-dimensional effect, can you get them to not? Yeah, it's a very nice question. So can I answer this question at the end of this part? So maybe it would be easier to work with a simple compression. And there were very nice experiments under simpler compression, also with actin filaments and flow. And these are actually experiments done in the group by... Are actually experiments done in the group by Goldstein where they positioned the filament at a stagnation point inside a microfluidic channel. So you can see that this at a stagnation point you have these hyperbolic flow lines. So you have a perfect compression and elongation. And then indeed observe these nice higher modes that I already showed you only under oscillatory flow and not in simple shear flow. So we thought that maybe we could do something a little bit different, but again, observe these very nice linear instability modes and actually invert the flow. Uh, actually, invert the flow to reproduce these hyperbolic streamlines into the direction of flow, just having a restriction in your channel, so we could observe what happens to the filament for a longer time. Because what you can see here is that actually this thing we have this nice deformation of the C, but sooner or later there's always a small perturbation that will happen, and actually things will be stretched out again and will leave your stagnation point. So, it's a very difficult experiment to have control over filaments for a long time. So, oh, that was fast. Oh, that was fast. So, to produce this in a microfriddic channel, we actually collaborated with a colleague of ours in Strasklide. They made an optimization to have a perfect elongation on the center line of the channel. So you might wonder why we need to optimize something. You could imagine we are in small Reynolds number flows. I would just print a channel with a hyperbolic wall and everything should be hyperbolic. But there's two things. First of all, you have a zero flow condition on the wall. So even if you print. On the wall. So, even if you print the hyperbolic streamline at the wall, the velocity will be zero. And also, microclinic channels are flat. So, if I start with something very wide to get very thin, I will continue to change my aspect ratio. And when I change the aspect ratio, I also change the flow profile. So, the optimization came out with something like that, which is not so far from a hyperbolic channel, but they also have these kind of small ears here, and these ears actually prevent an overshoot and elongation when I enter this part, which is very. Uh, the this part, which is very different from if you have like an abrupt constriction, you normally have a very strong overshoot of elongation when you enter. So, we actually implemented these channels. So, we also have something before we have a flow focusing, so the filament will just come in on the center line, so they will actually enter exactly where we have the optimized flow. And then we can just test that in the experiment things work nicely, like predicted by the numerical simulation. So, the important part is that indeed velocity increases linearly with distance. Increases linearly with distance up to here and then decreases linearly again, which creates this constant epsilon dot. But of course, it poses a problem for our experiment because remember, we need to move with the flow to observe our filament. And now we need to displace our microscope stage with something that accelerates linear with distance. So it became a bit more complicated, but in the end, everything was possible. So we now need actually to make two things. First of all, it's trivial. We need to follow the filament so that we don't lose it. To follow the filament so that we don't lose it. But also, our exposure time is really long, it's like 50 milliseconds. So, we also need to be sure that we displace the stage with the same velocity as the filament is transported, because if I have a difference between the two, I might not lose the filament, but I might actually induce image blur. And by programming actually a retriject loop between the stage and the flow, we managed to have both of them actually in very good agreement. And by doing that, we can observe the following. We can observe the following. So, I might show this several times. Here, you are in the straight channel. So, in the straight channel, nothing actually works or pulls on the filament. So, you can nicely see these fluctuations. When I enter the extension part, I'll fire it away. Okay, so when I enter the extension part, I start to pull against the thermal fluctuations of the shape with the viscous forces, which is also really nice because it produces me a perfect initial condition. So, the filament may be perfect. Initial condition. So the filament will be perfectly straight before it will be compressed. And then this is what happens. So it looks very beautiful, but we were a bit confused by this because we thought to have a C or W or S, and we really didn't know what was going on there. Until someone pointed out, well, it's 3D, it's a helix what you observe. And once you know what you're looking for, it becomes really clear. And let me just show that to you on the next slide. So now, even if you look at the experiments, you can see we have. Even if you look at the experiments, you can see we have these very strong kinks. There's no way something in 2D would produce so strong kinks, and we also have the impression that there's things that we can observe that look like loops. So, going back again to Brato and David, we actually compared that with the numerican simulations, which have the nice thing that you can look from the side, which we cannot do in the experiment. And indeed, what they saw that from the side, it is really a cold state and it has this circular radius. So, what happens is that under compression, now we form a 3D structure. A 3D structure which looks like a helix. And to be sure, that is something very general, we also performed this simulation by Lisa-Fauci, which have no Brownian noise, and where you can see that again by pushing from the side, you will form this helical structure in the middle. And I will make this a bit shorter, but I still want to introduce you the main mechanism. So it was a bit surprising because nobody had really seen that, nor predicted that. So actually, why nobody had predicted it is very easy because everything had been performed in 2D. Been performed in 2D. All stability analysis have been performed in 2D, and also all numerical simulations have been performed in 2D. But what turned out is that if you do even the very simple linear stability analysis and you allow for growth in the direction out of plane, it turns out that the two modes are not coupled, but that actually their growth rates are very similar. And in this case, if you go to a very high control parameter, which is done here, so you have all these modes. Done here. So you have all these modes that appear at different critical control parameters. At very high control parameters, there's always a pair which is selected. There's always a pair of an odd and of an even mode, which have the strongest growth rates. And if you combine an odd and an even mode, in plane and out of plane, you end up with a helix. So in the end, the solution was quite easy. As soon as you allow growth out of plane, and you have to be in a very strong compression for a long time. Very strong compression for a long time. This is why it has not been observed in the experiments. You naturally create a helix. And I just want to show you the film because it's actually quite beautiful. So, this is slightly non-linear. And if you are slightly non-linear, the growth of the first mode will actually trigger the second mode. And then this happens. So you see that first of all, it grows in one plane, and then actually it grows out of plane. And I want to insist on the fact that it's actually still quite surprising to have these kinds of instabilities because in a These kinds of instabilities because, in a mechanical experiment, if you press on elastic rod, if you want to have a helix, you need to induce a torque on the ants, which is not at all the case here. And I will stop with my small summary on that. And once you know it, actually, you can actually see these helices in many cases. So, these are numerical simulations by the group of Winkler and Gonfan, and it's actually Gerhard Winkler who told us that this is a helix. And then, in the many experimental And then in the many experimental systems, so this is fiber spinning. You clearly see the helicus structure here. This is a simulation in a turbulent flow. There's clearly a helicus structure here. And this is some experiment in biology where actually filaments are extruded through a separate hole. And the biologist actually said, and wow, it goes out of the hole and it explodes. Now it does not explode. So it actually also forms this kind of structure here. And I think I stop here. And if anybody's interested in reality, you can come and see. Come and see me afterwards. Thank you. Any questions? Thanks, I stopped, but there is something that at some point I started to be confused by. And maybe you mentioned it and I just missed it in the beginning, but the In this case, the base state under a given flow of the filament is not so trivial for me. And I want, for me, it will be much easier to, I would like to have a sense what is really what shape, like maybe even the C shape or part of the shape are not really an instability. They are just the solution of the base flow under a given base state of the filament because it's subjected to normal forces, to tangential forces. To tangential forces. So, how do I know that it's really an instability? Okay, what is any? I'm sure that there is some part of instability here, but what is an instability and what is not? Okay, so the base state of the filament is to be straight. I mean, let's not think about the zone fluctuations. Why? Let's look at the careful things. Under shear flow, you put it straight. Yes. It's subjected to some non-trivial tangential and normal forces. Why it should remain straight? Oh, oh, okay. So, your question is if it's an instability or if is if it's an instability or if it can be something exactly under the external forces of the okay so i understand so i the the question the question basically is so if i have a straight rod and apply a force from the sides then actually we have the buckling instability that occurs above a certain threshold however if i do a beam bending experiment where i hold the filament here and it will deform under gravity it will just continue to increase to deform uh under flow that's the question right more or less yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly so uh Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, yes, I agree. It's a very good question. In this case, what we can clearly see that if I rotate in the shear flow, that it will, or let me start something simpler. If I'm in an extensional flow, then the question, the situation is clear, right? If I'm in a purely extension or in a purely compressive flow, then I have only tangential forces that will act on my filament, and it clearly is an instability. If I'm in a sheet, then I can't really see where there are compression, then whether there is compression. Why can't you see where there's a compression? I mean, if I have a flow with hyperbolic streamlines, I clearly have a compression of the flow acting on the filament. Yeah. And I mean, in this case, I think it's completely clear that it is an instability. Under shear, especially when I'm at an orientation that is not at 45 degrees, then indeed I also have other forces. Then, indeed, I also have other forces on the filament. And this is also somehow what we see when we have this tank trading motion. And our explanation for the moment is that still goes through an instability and then only exists above a certain threshold. But I think this part of the model could still evolve or be discussed. The picture kind of works like that. When I'm very close to the instability onset, when I go between the Jeffrey orbit and the Go between the Jeffrey orbit and the C-shape that forms. Compressive forces are not strong enough to do anything on the filament before it reaches the 45 degrees. And in this case, there's no deformation that occurs before the threshold, which also goes in the effect of the instability onset. Thank you. Yeah. I know there are more questions, but so we have to satisfy several conditions at this point. We want to have a discussion. Discussion. Um, I definitely want some coffee, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and we have an XTAR coming up. Uh, so the way that we're going to solve this is that we're going to have coffee and discuss at coffee. People at Zoom, they should just start putting questions in Zoom and then we'll somehow get to those questions. And the third part of the solution is that we're going to delay Anna's talk by 15 minutes so that we actually have a little bit of time to drink coffee if that's okay. Bit of time to drink coffee if that's okay with you. Okay, good, and then um, yeah, so we try to come back, and yeah, thanks.
