So to illustrate the purpose of this talk with the Venn diagram, basically the thing that I would be interested in is the intersection of two, let's say, problems or themes. On one hand, we have here elliptic quantum groups, which I'm sure a lot of people care about. And even if you don't care about And even if you don't care about elliptic quantum groups specifically, a lot of people care about quantum groups, and everything that I'm going to say still applies to those. And then there's also a geometric part of the story, which has to do with moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces. So I'm not going to be very specific about which kind of sheaves I'm considering, because I want this to be like a survey talk. But the gist of the Venn diagram that you see here is that in the middle of these two circles, Is that in the middle of these two circles, of the intersection of these two topics in mathematics, is elliptic homology. And by studying elliptic cohomology, we can obtain interesting realizations of elliptic quantum groups. And the geometry that we have to consider is that of moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces. So let me be a bit more specific about a setup. And if at any point there are any questions, then please feel free to interrupt me. Free to interrupt me. So, the setup, a little bit more mathematically than what we've seen on the previous slide, is the following. So, a classical construction in geometric representation theory goes back to the work of Nakajima and Grozhanovsky many years ago. Which, I mean, as far as I can tell, Hick started a lot of the problems that I've been working on. I had been working on. So, Hakajima and Krozhnowski find in a seminal construction defined an action. And I'm going to write the main players on the slide, even though I'm sure everyone is familiar with this. So the action of the Heisenberg algebra, which I will call GL1 hat in this talk. And here in the right-hand side, you have a geometric object. And the geometric object in And the geometric object in question is the direct sum of the cohomologies of the Hilbert schemes of points on a surface. I don't want to dwell too much on what kind of surface I'm considering, so let's just take it smooth and projective. Even though with small modifications, you can certainly drop the projective assumption. So this was, I think, the construction which I started. Started a lot of these problems. Now, the other side of the story actually came along with work on quiver varieties, which happened roughly around the same time. So maybe 20 plus epsilon years ago. So the work that I will mention was due to many people, and I'm going to list some of them. And apologies that I won't be able to list everybody who did wonderful work on this subject. On this subject. So, Ginsburg Vassro, the Nakajima, Shifman Vassrow, Lubaraniolo, in no particular order, or I should say in alphabetical order. I mean, the history of the topic is quite huge and others. And others. So, this work on quiver varieties defined a similar reaction to the one above, but of a slightly different algebra and a slightly different cohomology space. So the algebra that you're going to put in the right-hand side, in the left-hand side, is not GL1, but what is known as the Jangian of GL1, hat. And in the right-hand side, I'm going to put or Side, I'm going to put, or people have put, I mean, this construction is quite classic. So, this is H-star equivariant cohomology. And here you put the Hilbert schemes of endpoints, but on the affine plane, which is a quiver variety for the Jordan quiver. So, the goal in this talk, and like I said, it's a survey talk, so I'm going to keep it alight in general. Going to keep it alight in general. The goal is to unify these two constructions and to extend to elliptic homology and see what interesting features we can discover if we do so. If there are any questions about this, even though everything right now was pretty vague in general. Okay, so let me be then even more specific. And now that I have listed the main players, I will actually give you some definitions of them, not in complete level of detail, but some level of detail. So let me start with the algebra, which appears here. So the algebra that I mentioned before, although Algebra that I mentioned before, called the Yangian of GL1 hat, is an algebra with many generators and even more relations. And I certainly will not be able to list them all, but I want to give you at least what the generators are. So it is an algebra over a field of rational functions in two parameters. The generators are denoted en, fn, and hn. So some people use up size instead of h. Some people use up size instead of H's, but it's all the same thing. Modulo, a bunch of relations that, you know, I think in total, there are, depending on who you ask, maybe like somewhere between five and seven relations. And I'm not going to list all of them, but I'm going to list what I think is maybe the most important one of them and definitely the most illustrative for the purposes of this talk. So the commutation relation between E's and F's is given. E's and F's is given in my normalization by this formula over here. Now you might say, well, why am I writing the formula in this way and not just absorb the constant T1, T2 in Hm plus n, as is the case for the classic Lie algebra SL2. The reason I'm doing that is for a geometric purpose that you will see in a second, but I just want to show you this relation, the commutator of E with E. You, this relation, the commutator of E with F is T1 T2H because it is very illustrative for what happens among the relations in this algebra a bit more generally. Now, the algebra that I defined over here is not exactly the one that you want to study from a geometric point of view. What you want to study geometrically are integral forms of this. And there are a number of integral forms of this algebra, and I'm not sure, you know, I haven't studied them. You know, I haven't studied them much in depth. I'm not sure if they're all isomorphic. I'm not sure which is the correct one, but you can define some integral forms of this algebra. And this is what I want to study in this talk. So an integral form is just a, instead of having an algebra over the field of rational function, you have an algebra over the ring of polynomials. So this would be a sub-algebra. A sub-algebra. It's going to be denoted by y gl1 hat int. It is a sub-algebra of ygl1 hat. And being an integral form means that when you tensor ygl1 hat int over z with q, well, q of t1 e2, then you get the entire y of gl1 hat. Now, the condition which I want from this sub-algebra, and this is going to be important, so I'm going. And this is going to be important, so I'm going to write it down. The condition that I want is that the commutator of any two elements in this integral form has to be a multiple of t1, t2. And this is the reason why I wrote the commutator of e and f as I have at the top of this slide, because I really want to illustrate the fact that the commutator of anything has to be a multiple of t1, t2. And this will be something that is going to play an important role in a bit. Important role in a bit. Now, this something which you see over here, well, let's call, let's give it a name. Let's call it commutator of AB red for reduced. And it's not other than the commutator of AB divided by T1, T2, if you have a notion of division. But in general, this is how you define AB red. You postulate that the commutator is always going to be a multiple of T1, T2. True. So we will see this commutator of A B red showing up in no time. If there are any questions about the definition of the Yangian of GL1 hat or, well, I haven't given you any details on the integral form, but at least what's on this slide. If there are any questions, then please let me know. Okay, so now that I have defined the representation. The representation theoretic part of this talk, namely the algebras which I colored in red at the beginning of the talk. Let me define the geometrical spaces which we have seen and which we will see. So we start by saying let S be a smooth projective surface over S. You can drop the condition adjective, but you can't really drop the condition smooth. Really, drop the condition smooth, or at least I can't. C. And then we define M a moduli space of certain coherent sheaves on S. And the reason why I'm being vague about this is that there are a number of different choices for the moduli space M, and all of them, from the point of view of representation theory, behave roughly in the same way. And there is Roughly in the same way. And there is very strong reasons for this. But if you don't like the vagueness of the statement, then just think about the fact that one of the standard examples of M is exactly the disjoint union of all of the Hilbert schemes of S as n goes from 0 to infinity. So you take the disjoint union over all n of the Hilbert schemes of n points on S, and this will give you a candidate of the moduli space n. And if you just run the entirety. And if you just run the entirety of this talk for the Hilbert scheme instead of this mystery moduli space M, then nothing will be lost. And this is going to be a very valid thing to do. But I just want to say that everything that we say here applies to more general moduli spaces as soon as some technical conditions are satisfied. And one of the most important technical conditions, at least to me, is that this moduli space must have a universal sheaf. So there must Sheaf. So there must be a universal sheaf on m times s. And, you know, in the geometric representation theory of this object, this universal sheaf will play a very important part. Okay, so now we have a moduli space. Now let's do something with it. Let's consider a certain correspondence, which you know people have studied for many, many years. But I'm going to But I'm going to denote it by Z. I'm going to tell you what the points of this correspondence are. So whereas the points of M are coherent sheaves F on S, points of the correspondence are going to be short exact sequences of pairs of coherent sheaves. So F prime is a subsheaf of F and the quotient is going to be a length one. Is going to be a length one skyscraper sheaf or x a certain close point in the surface. So, in terms of points, the points of z are given by basically two coherent sheaves which sit inside each other, and the quotient is a cx. That's the more rigorous definition of z. It's not quite equivalent with what I'm writing here in terms of short exact sequences, but I think it's a bit more illustrative if we think of it as such. Now, this correspondence has. this this correspondence has three ejection maps because z parametrizes f prime f and x we can take the maps that remember f prime f and x so the map which remembers f prime and this is going to be a map to m this is going to be called p plus the map which remembers f and this is once again a point in m so it's a projection map to m this is going to be called p minus and the third map is going to be called ps because this remembers To be called Ps because this remembers the point where the quotient lives. So this is not M, this is S. So now we have three projection maps from this correspondence Z to the moduli space, the surface, and the moduli space, respectively. And the only one other thing that I will need about this correspondence geometrically is that it has a line bundle. And I'm going to tell you what this line bundle is in terms of closed points. So if you have a closed point, So if you have a closed point here, which is given by a triple f prime f and x, then over such a closed point, I'll tell you what the fiber of this line bundle is. The fiber of this line bundle is the one-dimensional space given by fx modulo fx prime. So this is going to be a one-dimensional space, and this will be the fiber of the line bundle L. So in the course of this talk, we will encounter Of this talk, we will encounter the moduli space M as the most fundamental geometric object that we're considering, and the correspondence Z, the projection maps P minus, P plus, and P S, and the line bundle L, and those will play an important technical part in the construction. This has probably been one of the most concrete slides of the talk so far. So, if anyone has any questions, then please let me know. Okay, so let's move on to the So let's move on to the connection between representation theory and geometry. The connection is the following. So once you have the Jangian of GL1 hat, which we defined two slides ago or three slides ago, and you have the moduli space M, which we defined on the previous slide, then we have an action of the former on the latter. So you have an action of Y, GL. have an action of y gl1 hat the algebra on the cohomology of n and don't think of the cohomology of m as being as a don't think of m as being a single space like you said like you saw a couple of slides ago the blueprint for m is the disjoint union of all of the hilbert schemes so it's best to think of m as a disjoint union of of connected components which are indexed by you know Components which are indexed by a first and a second term class, and the second term class is going to change throughout this construction. So let's let me tell you what the action is. So to completely determine the action, I have to tell you how the generators EN, FN, and HN act. And I will do so. I of course will not prove to you that the action, that this is a well-defined action, which would entail checking all the relationships. Which would entail checking all the relations. I only told you one relation anyway. But let me tell you how the generators act. So En and Fn, they act in similar but opposing ways. So En acts by the formula Ps times, sorry, P plus times Ps, push forward first turn class of L to the power n times P minus pullback, and F n. And Fn acts by the exact same formula, but you change the roles of plus and minus. So this is a formula: P plus fallback. And if we go back to the previous slide where we actually had this geometry, then you can see how this acts explicitly. So En starts from a class here, it pulls it back to Zn. Here it multiplies. Here it multiplies it by a power of the first turn class of the line bundle, and then it pushes it forward to the cohomology of m and s via these two arrows. So the end result, let me erase this because it doesn't look so nice, the end result of the formula for en is something in the image of pi plus times pi s push forward. So it is a cohomology class, not on m, on m times s. So this is going to be something I have to explain. But the To be something I have to explain. But the thing that you really should take from this formula is that En starts from the cohomology of M, pulls back, and then pushes forward to the cohomology of M times S. And Fn does the exact same thing, but it does so with respect to the map I minus instead of Pi plus. Now, there are many reasons why you would want to push forward to M times S instead of just to M. So, first of all, if you want this construction to make sense or a non- Or a non-projective surface S, the map pi plus will not be projective, so the push forward is not well defined, but the map pi plus times P S is projective, even if S itself is not projected. So in that case, P plus times P S is the more natural map that you should use for a push forward. But perhaps more seriously, the reason why you should consider PS, the map PS as well. PS, the map PS as well, is because you want cohomology classes from the surface to play a role in this whole construction. And if you don't have PS in the formula, so if in the formula for P for EN, you just had P plus push forward, first term class times P minus pullback, then you would not be seeing the wealth of cohomology classes that come from S. So I think it is a good idea to keep ES in the definition of the operator for EN. And similarly, Operator for En and similarly keep a PS in the definition for the operator Fn. Now, having said that, Hn is going to be given by multiplication by, well, the N plus one term class of a certain universal class. I don't want to write exactly which universal class it is at this stage. Maybe if we have time at the end of this talk. Maybe if we have time at the end of this talk, I will give you a formula. But it is a certain universal class, so that's why it was important for m times s to have a universal class, because otherwise we could not define the operator Hn. But note, however, that universal classes do not naturally live on M. They also live on M times S. So Hn, just like its cousins En and Fn, have S built into them. So they don't take very Into them. So they don't take values in the cohomology of M, they take values in the cohomology of M times S. And I will explain what this means on the next slide. Well, before doing so, I want to point out that the proof of the statement on this slide, namely the existence of the action, the proof is a standard. But the only thing that I really have to explain, and I will do so in a second, is the meaning of the word action in quotes. And I want to do this. And I want to do this on the next slide. So what is the meaning of the word action in quotes? You see, without quotes, an action of an algebra on a vector space or whatever just means that for every element of the algebra, you get an endomorphism of that whatever. So in the setting at hand, we would need an endomorphism of the cohomology of M. Of the cohomology of M. But the formulas I'm writing here are not endomorphisms of the cohomology of M, they are homomorphisms from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M times S. So we have to say exactly what does it mean to have an action in this head-up where we don't act by endomorphisms of something, we act by homomorphism from some things to something else. And this requires a definition, and this is what I want to do on the next slide. But if there are any questions about the formulas for EN. Questions about the formulas for En, Fn, and Hn, which determine the action of the Jangian and the cohomology of moduli spaces, then please ask me, how would be a great time? Okay, so let me tell you what action in quotes means. It is, you know, it's a bunch of formulas, but I hope to convince you that it is a reasonable axiomatization of what people have been studying for a long, long time. Long time. So an action in quotes is an obedient group homomorphism. So typically an action just means a homomorphism from an algebra to endomorphism of something, but now we're not going to have mapping to endomorphism of something, we are going to be mapping to. Going to be mapping to homomorphisms just to match with the formulas that I have written on the previous slide. Here you put homomorphisms from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M times S. So you have this extra factor of S in the codomain of this formula. And of course, it's not enough that you have a group homomorphism. You need a bunch of axioms because you need to mimic. To mimic the property of being an algebra action. So if you mapped into the endomorphism of something, then you have an algebra on the left-hand side, an algebra on the right-hand side, and you could ask for phi to be an algebra homomorphism. Right now, the right-hand side isn't exactly an algebra, so let's mimic what it would mean or for phi as defined here to give us an action. So axiom one is that if you apply phi to the identity element, Apply phi to the identity element, then you just get the pullback homomorphism. I mean, there's a natural projection map from n times s to m, and you get a pullback in cohomology. That's quite reasonable. And we ask that phi of one is equal to that. Now, this should be a homomorphism of algebras over Z T1 T2. So if you recall, Y, this guy here was a Z T1 T2 algebra. And And the thing in the right-hand side is not technically an algebra because T1 and T2 don't really make sense geometrically yet. So let's give them some meaning. And the meaning that you give T1 and T2 geometrically is that if you want to apply phi to any polynomial in T1 and T2, and it should be a symmetric polynomial, but let me not dwell too much on this issue. So phi of a scalar times any element is times any element is equal to the composition and let me write for you the composition so first you go from the cohomology of m to the cohomology of m times s by the homomorphism which corresponds to a so let me just say what a is so a is any element inside ygl1 hat int but now after having But now, after having written down this formula, we should also say what ft1t2 corresponds to. And ft1t2 is going to correspond to a multiplication operator. I overshot. So geometrically, f of t1 t2 is going to correspond to multiplication. To multiplication by the polynomial f, which you apply to the churn roots of the cotangent bundle of s. You see, you are on m times s. Any cohomology class on s can be naturally pulled back to a cohomology class on m times s, in particular the churn roots of the cotangent bundle. And the operator that you write here is just multiplication by those churn roots. And if f is an arbitrary Those churn roots. And if f is an arbitrary polynomial in the abstract symbols t1, t2, which is symmetric, then you can naturally make sense of it as a polynomial in the churn roots of the cotangent bundle of S, which is going to be a cohomology class on S. And this is a condition which mimics the fact that phi should be a homomorphism of Z T1 T2 algebras in the situation when the blue thing in the right-hand side is not a priori a Z T1 T2 algebra. A priori a Z T1 T2 algebra, and this is how you mimic this condition. All right, so having explained this part, let's explain the part about the algebra action. So, what happens if you apply phi to a product of elements? So, if you take two elements A and B in the Yangian, then what is phi of AB? Well, this is also going to be a composition, and I have to tell you exactly what composition is. It is. So, you go from the cohomology of M. You go from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M times S, and you go there with file B. So now you're in the cohomology of M times S. And now you want to go to the cohomology of M times S times S. And the reason you do that is because now you want to apply phi of A, but you have an extra factor of S which is going along for the ride. So now you're applying phi of A as a homomorphism from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M. From the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M times S, and then you just have the identity on the extra factor of S. But now you ended up on M times S times S, and you want to end up in the cohomology of M times S, but no problem, you can do so by just restricting to the diagonal inside S. So just do the identity on the M factor and restrict to the diagonal in S. So let me just write here where delta Delta is the diagonal inside S times S. So these three properties which I've written over here would be enough to define what it means to have for such a group homomorphism to give you an action because they mimic the algebra properties of the Jangian. But the most interesting, if you ask me, property is the fourth one. And this is what I want to write down. So the fourth one. Down. So the fourth one happens when instead of applying phi of AB, you commute two operators. So you want to commute phi of A with phi of B. And here I'm going to use different colors for a reason that you will see in a second. So phi of A, phi of B is going to be a homomorphism from the cohomology of M, not to the cohomology of M times S, but to the cohomology of M times two factors. Homology of m times two factors of s. One of the factors of s is red and the other factor of s is blue. So now when you write the commutator of phi a phi b, what that means is the commutator is just going to be the difference of phi a phi b minus phi b phi a. And then how do you define phi a phi b? Well, you go from m to m times s to m times s times s. And I'm using the colors on the two factors of s so that you know every time. So that you know every time which factor of S you apply I of A. You apply phi of A in the red factor and you apply phi of B in the blue factor. And if you do that, then phi of A, phi of B, and phi of B, phi of A can be naturally interpreted as homomorphisms from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M times S times S. Now, the property which I'm about to list has something about what this particular homomorphism from the cohomology of M. Homomorphism from the cohomology of M to cohomology of M times S times S is. And the property is that it is supported on the diagonal. So the particular operator that this is equal to is going to be a diagonal push forward of something. Let me not write it like this. Let me just write delta push forward. And here I get to write. Here, I get to write another operator, and the operator which I want to write here is phi of the commutator of AB red. So, if you remember a long, long time ago when we defined the integral form of this Jangian, we said the commutator of everything should be a multiple of t1, t2, and that particular multiple should be called commutator red. Well, this is how that commutator red appears in the play. So, the condition is this fourth property, which is saying that the commutator. Property which is saying that the commutator of a red operator and a blue operator is supported on the diagonal of s. And by the way, I'm abusing notation above because m times s inside n times s times s is also listed as, is also written as the diagonal, even though it should be written as identity on m times the diagonal. So that's the slight abuse of notation up there. But it is the fourth condition is an equality of operators, and I think it is the most important one. Is the most important one in this definition of action. So, once again, all of these properties were things that people had considered before, but I think they were typically considered and written by expressing the cohomology of S in terms of kinetic components, which in cohomology is absolutely equivalent to what I'm writing down on this slide. But I think that this kind of formalism, which has S, which has the factors of S going along for a ride, is more beneficial. Along for a ride is more beneficial if you want to consider cohomology theories where you don't have QNS decompositions, like Chow theory or algebraic K theory. If you have QNS, then you don't need all of this formalism, even though I particularly kind of enjoy it. If there are any questions about these four axioms, which determine what an action is, and which determine the appropriate statement of the formula on this slide. So, on this slide, you see On this slide, you see a main statement about what the action is. And here on this slide, you actually see a lot of axioms on the formum definition of an action. Okay, well, if there are no questions, then I finally get to what is the topic of this talk: elliptic cohomology. So, everything that you have seen. So, everything that you have seen so far is in usual cohomology. It also works, like I said, in Borel-Moore homology, in child groups, and whatever. But elliptic cohomology is a theory of a different nature. So I want to say a few words about what elliptic cohomology is. But before I say a few words about what elliptic cohomology is, I really should say a few words about what cohomology is. So, what is usual cohomology? And this is not a course in. And this is not a course in algebraic topology, so then I will be extremely vague and imprecise. So let me just say that usual cohomology is an assignment where to each manifold, I mean, I'm working in the context of algebraic varieties, but let me just say manifold because this is a little bit more a little bit more. It's a little bit more true to the history of this topic. So, to any manifold, you associate a ring. And basically, with the manifold x, you associate the ring h upper star of x. Now, here's one step which is completely unnecessary in the case of cohomology, but you will see it applied on the next slide. If you have a ring, then you have a scheme, namely the affine scheme, which is the spectrum of that ring. So, here you have spec of h upper star of x. Spec of h upper star of x. So if you really wanted to, even though once again, it's unnecessary to any manifold, you can think about associating a scheme spec of the cohomology of x. And this construction, of course, it has a number of properties, but I think for the purpose of this talk, the most important property is that to any line bundle on X, you associate an element in cohomology. So to any line bundle on X, So to any line bundle on x, you associate or one associates, I should say, an element called the first term class of x of L. So this is inside the co-molecule of x, such that, well, you have the property that C1 of L tensor L prime is C. is c1 of l plus c1 of l prime the usual property but if you wanted to think of this not in terms of the ring h upper star of x but in terms of the scheme then this is completely equivalent so to give an element in this ring is completely equivalent with with writing down a map or like a map of schemes from spec of h upper star of x to a1 and this map A1 and this map will be called C L. And the tensor product property is or reads C of L tensor L prime is going to be equal to C of L plus C of L prime. And this plus here is the group law on the group scheme A1. I mean, I really should have written GA, but I think A1 looks nicer. So this is the group law of A1. So, this is all I will need to know in this talk about what usual a cohomology is. So, things which are on this slide, more or less. And having said that, let me tell you what elliptic cohomology is. So, elliptic cohomology. And this particular point of view on elliptic cohomology was invented by. Was invented by Aginsberg, Kapranov, and Vasro. The dashed lines. And in the context of moduli spaces of sheaves that I will be considering, it was also studied later by Yang and Zhao. And, you know, my own approach with this borrows quite heavily from Yang Xiao. So the elliptic homology is defined similarly, but instead of using the group scheme A1, you use an elliptic curve E. So you just change the group scheme from A1 to an elliptic curve. So elliptic curve. So let the curve E instead of A1. Okay, so what is the assignment of elliptic homology exactly? The assignment is that when you panifold X, you associate a scheme. So the scheme in question is the analog of what a The analog of what a spec of the core molecules of x was. And I'm going to denote this scheme by Ax. And I want to point out that at least when x is a smooth and projective, then as an abstract scheme, you actually have that the cohomology that had Ax is isomorphic to spec of H upper star of X. And this is the elliptic cohomology version of the isomorphism between cohomology and Between cohomology and K-theory, which is given by the Chern character. But I think it's best not to think of them as such. So I don't think it's very constructive to think about the scheme that you associate in elliptic homology as being isomorphic to the scheme that you associate to cohomology for a reason that you will see in my next line. But the reason I'm saying it is because I want to point out that this scheme AX is not some kind of wild thing, it actually is. thing, it actually is as an abstract scheme just the same as what you saw as what you had before. It's just the interpretation of this thing which is changing. So the interpretation is the following. For any line bundle on X as before, we had a map from spec of the cohomology to the group scheme A1. Now we get a map. From this scheme AX to the elliptic curve. And the tensor product property of term classes just reads that C of a tensor product of line bundles is C of L plus C of L prime, and this plus now is the group law on the elliptic curve. So, from this point of view, elliptic cohomology is much the same as usual echo homology, except that you change the group law, which controls the tensor product of line bundles. Any questions about the parallels between a cohomology and elliptic cohomology? Okay, if not, then I can get a little bit more specific. More specific. So, whereas a cohomology class was just an element in h star of x, and if you think about it, an element in the cohomology of x is nothing than a global function on the spectrum of the cohomology of x. An elliptic cohomology class, you would be tempted to think of it as a global function on the scheme A, but you shouldn't. The way you should think about an elliptic cohomology class is as Cohomology class is as a section of various line bundles on this scheme. So don't think of elliptic cohomology classes as being functions on this scheme. Think of them as being sections of line bundles on this scheme. And the reason why you should think of it in this way is that the standard elliptic homology classes that you will encounter. Homology classes that you will encounter in this business is given by taking this map CL, which you saw on the previous slide. So remember, CL is a map from the scheme AX to the elliptic curve E, and you can pull back along this map any section of any line bundle on E. Now, E doesn't have a lot of interesting global functions, but it has a lot of interesting line bundles and therefore sections of line bundles. And when you pull back Of line bundles, and when you pull back these sections of line bundles along Cl, then you get naturally sections of line bundles on AX. So this is one reason why you should think of elliptical homology classes as sections of line bundles on AX, even though it's a little bit more complicated to wrap our heads around this. But I want to point out that this is this is This is a technical step because, at least when x is smooth and projective, the scheme AX is Artinian. And if you are over an Artinian scheme, all line bundles are trivial. So, you know, if all line bundles are trivial, then whenever you have a section of a line bundle, then you get a function on AX. But the problem. Function on Ax, but the problem is that the trivialness, so the isomorphism between a line bundle and the trivial line line bundle is not canonical. So if you wanted to use this little Artinianness issue to take a section of a line bundle and get a function on Ax out of it, then you would not get a canonical function on Ax. You would just get an element of Ax up to a unit, and the choice of that unit is not a natural one, so then you would. Unit is not a natural one, so then you would be stuck with a lot of arbitrary choices that are very hard to factor into computations. So, even though you shouldn't think of these line bundles as being some kind of complicated things on a complicated scheme, they are all isomorphic to trivial line bundles on X, but just that the isomorphism is non-trivial and you really should not make any non-natural choices. So, these two issues, namely the fact that Issues, namely the fact that a big family of examples of elliptical homology classes are pullbacks of sections of line bundles on E and the non-canonicity of triviality of line bundles. These two are reasons why we really should think of elliptical homology classes as sections of line bundles over AX. And this goes back to the original perspective of Ginsburg, Capranov, and Vassaro on this. Okay, so having said this, let's hide a bit. This let's uh hide a bit more, you know, more explicitly sections of line bundles on E. So, explicitly, let me take my elliptic curve over C. So, let me write it as E is, you know, C modulo a lattice, and we write that lattice as Z plus Z tau, as people usually do. And let's say that this is isomorphic to C star modulo the powers of P. So, this is the multiplicative representation of an elliptic. presentation of an elliptic curve. The isomorphism from left to right is x goes to e to the 2 pi ix and p is none other than e to the 2 pi i tau. So it is going to be a little bit easier in formulas to think of the elliptic curve as a C star modulo powers of P than C modulo lattice. And if you make this choice, then let me show you a very explicit class of line bundles on E, actually, which I'm pretty sure we all know. I'm pretty sure we all know. So it's a line bundle called dn, lambda. n and lambda are called the factors of automorphy. So these are line bundles on E, and you can explicitly think of the sections of this line bundles as being meromorphic functions. I mean, I really should be saying meromorphic functions and open subsets of C, but I'm going to abbreviate this as meromorphic functions on C star. On C star such that f of z divided by f of p z is z to the n times lambda or all c. So the way we should read this formula is the following. There are no heromorphic functions on c star which are invariant under multiplication with p, except for constants. So except for constants, we don't have any meromorphic functions with the property that f of z is equal to f of well. That f of z is equal to f of, well, holomorphic functions, that f of z is equal to f of p z. But if we allow this ratio to not be one and we allow it to be z to the power n times lambda, then we get some interesting twists. And these twists depend on n and lambda, and they give us a big family of line bundles. So, natural examples of this construction are the function z to the power n, if you take the ratio. If you take the ratio z to the power n divided by pz to the power n, then you will find that this is a section inside a section of the line bundle d0 p to the minus n, and this will play a part in in a bit. But also, the Jacobi theta function theta of z in the normalization I like to work with, this is a section of the line bundle called d1 and minus 1 here. So the number n is 1 and the number lambda is minus 1. And the number lambda is minus one. So we will see in the next slide both the section of line bundle z to the power n and the section of line bundle called theta of z. If there are any questions about this slide, you know, the explicit line bundles and sections of line bundles on an elliptic curve. Okay, then having said that, it's time for me to give you the elliptic cohomology version of. Elliptic cohomology version of the theorem about the action of the Yangian on the cohomology of the moduli space M. So, you know, up to assumptions on the moduli space M that you want to consider, but all of these assumptions are satisfied, for example, in the case of the Hilbert scheme, then there exists an action, and the quotes are in the exact same sense as before. The thing with the extra copy of S that you've seen me develop quite in detail. So there is an Up quite in detail. So there is an action of the elliptic quantum toroidal GL1. So this is an algebra which I will say a couple of words in a second. And this thing now acts on sections of line bundles on AM. And once again, the meaning of the word action is not, is that it does not send the section of a line bundle on AM to a section of On AM to a section of a line bundle on AM, but it sends a section of a line bundle on AM to a section of a line bundle on AM times S. And that's how that's how the quotes around the word action apply. And then we have all of the axioms that are completely analogous to what you have seen before in the case of usual cohomology. Now, this elliptic atom group, in the presentation that I will be using, it was defined by Ekono and Oshima a few years ago. A few years ago, and they defined this as being the Q algebra, well, the algebra over the field of rational functions in two parameters, Q1 and Q2. And these Q1 and Q2 are actually closely connected with the T1 and T2 we saw before. They are none other than their exponentials. And just as before, we still have generators EN, FN, and Hn, but now we don't have a single HN. We have two. We have Hn plus and Hn. Two, we have h n plus and h n minus, so we have two family of h's now. And the other thing is that the number n doesn't just go from zero to infinity, it goes over all of the integers. And then you have a bunch of relations as well. So you see the generators have changed a bit. The relations also changed, but the standard relation which I chose to list has not changed really so much. So the commutator of E. So the commutator of Em and Fn is going to be equal to 1 minus Q1 inverse, 1 minus Q2 inverse. And here you put Hm plus N minus minus Hm plus N plus. So this is, if it's not literally the same as a definition of Kona and Doshima, I think it's quite equivalent to it, and it's the normalization which I think is the most suitable for. Suitable for geometric applications. So instead of t1 e2 as a multiple in front, we have one minus q1 inverse, one minus q2 inverse. And then, well, actually, let me be a little bit more ambitious about this. And instead of just saying that, and it is equal to a multiple of that, let me put theta of q1, theta of q2 here. It is a stronger condition, and I think it's a better normalization. Better in normalization. Okay, so this is the analog of the fundamental relation in the Yangian that I have shown you before. So this is the analog in the elliptic quantum group. And to show you what this action is, let me tell you again how it acts on the generators En, Fn, and Hn. So En, Fn, En, and Fn, they act by the same formulas as before. So P plus times P s push forward, F is P minus. forward f is p minus times ps push forward here you have p minus pullback and here you have p plus pullback and the whole question is what do we multiply with in between applying the pullback and the push forward so in the cohomology case we had multiplication by the nth power of the first term class here in the elliptic cohomology case remember that we have this let me actually write it here so l was a line bundle on the Was a line bundle on the correspondence Z. So this gives you a map from the scheme associated to Z to the elliptic curve, and this is going to be called C L. And what you do is you take C L push forward of a section of a line bundle on E, and that's going to give you a section of a line bundle on Z, on AZ, which you can stick into this formula. And the particular section of a line bundle is just the section of a line bundle Zn that we have seen on the previous. That we have seen on the previous slide. So, this is the elliptic homology analog of multiplication by powers of the first churn class. And Hn plus and minus, these are a little bit more interesting. So, just as before, they act as multiplication by something. But it is very interesting what that something is. So, in the elliptic homology case, these operators will be multiplication by Laurent. Multiplication by Laurent coefficients of one in the same series. And let me tell you what that series is. So one and the same series, which I'm going to call psi of z. So this is actually going to be a function on a z times m. In this case, it'll be almost a function. In this case, it'll be almost a function. So, this statement is almost true, but it's very close to being a function and not exactly a section of a line bundle. And then I should really erase this z and call it w because this variable means something else. So, phi of w this, and then there is an extra variable w in this definition of psi. So, psi is a Laurent series depending on this variable w whose coefficients are functions on the scheme z times. On the scheme Z times M. And now you may ask, well, then what's the difference between Hn plus and Hn minus? Well, they are orang coefficients of one and the same series, but expanded in the vicinity of two different contours. So they are expanded near the contour where the absolute value of w is one when the sine is plus. Is plus and it is expanded near the contour where the absolute value of w is p when the sine is minus. So you are in one of those interesting situations where if you have a meromorphic function of w and you take the Laurent expansion around two contours, well, the Laurent expansions along those two contours may be very different from each other, and they should be very different from each other because they exactly, their difference exactly keeps keeps. Exactly keeps track of the poles that your function has in between the contours. And this function, which I'm calling psi, and I probably shouldn't call it psi because psi meant something else in this talk. So let's call it phi. This function psi is the function of w does have a lot of poles. So that's why hn plus and h n minus, even though their definitions seem quite similar to each other, they are quite different from each other. And this makes the construction quite And this makes the construction quite non-trivial. Okay, so I will stop here.
