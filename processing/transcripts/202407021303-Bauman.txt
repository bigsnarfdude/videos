I call it a thin domain, expecting or hoping that we could prove that there were activity defects and using the Landau Digem's energy and where they would be located. And here we're going to look at a slab. So it's a two-dimensional domain, really of any smooth shape, but simply connected and smooth, crossed with a crossed with two flat contours of the same shape. One, the middle is at x3 equals 0, and then we go down to minus epsilon to the alpha and up to epsilon to the alpha. So that is the situation. And so there we start on this. Okay, so as I this is the sort of shape, it's not going to be electrical, any kind of nice, smooth, simply connected domain. And for a while we sometimes call the height delta, two delta, and sometimes two epsilon to the L. So we use them interchangeably. So we use them interchangeably. We have fixed boundary conditions on the Q tensor. And on the top and the bottom, we just have the condition that N is a bottom of the E3. And really, what our condition is, is that the Q tensor or the top and bottom should have the Q31 and the Q32, those two components. Those two components in the third column and at the beginning of the last column. And so that's the condition there. And that means that, well, I'll say later, but in some ways it might favor having E3 as a its value of n. So Okay, so first I just want to introduce the ideas of what we're looking for. We have defect core radius we're going to be looking at. Delta is half of the height, and epsilon is small. And here I mentioned several people, including Lorentovich, who have looked at this. Brentovich, who have looked at this problem more from the physics point of view. But really, we mathematicians get lots of intuition from those things. And the director model, they looked at just removing epsilon disks. That's not how we're going to do it, but that's kind of a quick way to think about what's Of a quick way to think about what's going on. So, C epsilon is epsilon neighborhood of the degree. So, the question is what pattern minimizes the energy. We have these boundary conditions. On the sides, it's going to be n0, sorry, n1 and n2. They are functions of x2, so you have the same boundary. Of x2. So you have the same boundary values across from the bottom to the top on the sides. And the degree, well here, we're going to compare degree n0 equals 1 and n dot e3 equals 0. And there were several suggested candidates, and one of them is two disclamation lines whose sections are degree one half. Sections are a degree 1/2 defects. And that's what we actually found when we looked at this infinitely thin type of model. And then you compute the energy on the domain without taking out those cores, and you have 2 delta pi log 1 over epsilon. And then another thing that could happen is two surface points. Two surface point defects. One, half of a radial hedgehog and half of a hyperbolic hedgehog. And that would have a different kind of energy if you just sort of use a back of the envelope calculation, 4 delta pi log 1 over pi delta. And so the first one has energy 4 alpha delta pi log 1 over epsilon. Second one, 2 delta. Second one, 2 delta pi log 1 over epsilon. And for the thicker slabs, that's where alpha is less than 1/2 because we're looking at epsilon to the alpha. The second one, where you're going to have hedgehogs, has less energy. And for the thinner one, where alpha is between a half and one, it had less energy. But that's a back of the envelope calculation. Calculation. And there have been many, many, I guess, experiments that are very helpful to see what can go on. Many of them had shells, spherical shells that were coated. Okay, so now the analysis. So we're going to work with the landowner. With the Lambda Des energy here. And so, and we're going to do the 1 over 2 delta because there's a convenience for some of our estimates. And so that is 1 half. We're taking the equal elastic constants. So 1 half of the length of dq squared in 3d plus 1 over epsilon squared times f of q, where q is a tensor. Here's a tensor. So the Q is going to be in W12. S is the set of 3x3 tensors such that Q equals Q transpose and the trace of Q equals 1. That's the standard of what goes into a Q tensor in this model. F is going to be non-negative just by adding the appropriate constant or subtracting with Doesn't affect the math. And it's going to be zero if and only if Q is in what I call lambda sub s. S has a certain formula in terms of the coefficients in the F of Q energy. And the lambda sub S, the zeros of it, are S n tensor N minus a third R. So basically, you can think of it as the sphere if you want to think of it. As the sphere. If you want to think of going from the center out to the sphere, then it would like to be at the top and the bottom. And of course, n tensor n is the same as minus n tensor minus n. And so we look at it that way, you'll always be noticing that. Okay, and that is an important feature of liquid crystals that you can. Crystals that you can interchange n and minus n. It doesn't change the energy. Okay, here's the formula for the Q. It's complicated, but you can, there are various ways that you can get a hold of it, and I'll show you one of them later on, and that's the one that we use. We use. So we're going to be trying to minimize the energy over Q in W12 from the domain into this tensor class, S, where Q13, Q2, 3 are 0, and Q equals Q0 on the boundary. And Q0 is in this space. We're going to let the degree be just D over 2, where D is a natural node. where d is a natural null. And 0 less than epsilon less than or equal to delta, much smaller than 1. So our main results. So I didn't mention, but those two energies that we looked at, the back of the animal calculations, those two were equal if alpha is one half. And it's not at all clear what's going on. It's not at all clear what's going on there. So we're not looking at that, at least not yet. 0 less than alpha less than or equal to 1, alpha not equal to 1 half. That's what we're looking at. And we are going to look at epsilons going to 0 and let Q J be minimizers. And this E, it's just the energy with epsilon J to the E. Epsilon j to the alpha height, etc. And A of epsilon to the alpha j, that's just going to be these W12 candidates with the proper boundary conditions. And what we can say in the first theorem is that there's a number n, natural number, and there are points alpha 1 through alpha n in omega, and there's a q bar. And there's a q bar, which is c infinity on omega closure away from those points and maps into lambda sub s, which is the zero set. And that the q bar, the limiting q bar, is actually, it will be a function only of n x1 and x2. It will look like two planar n by n by n minus a third i. So uniaxial and planar. And n, n1, n2, and 0. So that is our result for what happens in these, where these things congregate. And also for each sigma less than sigma naught, we have Sigma naught, we have that the qj, which is a function of three variables, will converge to that q bar of x1, x2, and the gradients will also converge. And they'll converge uniformly outside of neighborhoods of these of these, I would call them defects. Okay, and And we can look at these in more detail. So, here, if you let theta sub L denote the polar angle of x1 and x2 from the center, so we look at that center and just like in calculus, angle that it makes with respect to that center. Let q be a harmonic function that satisfies q equals q naught on the boundary. Q equals Q naught on the boundary. And that is part of the formula that we get if we're in the thin region, where 0 less than alpha less than 1 half. Oh, sorry, we're in the thick region. D is even, and if the original of D, we had degree D over 2, if that's what we had, then N is D over 2. What we had, then n is d over 2. We're going to have d over 2 detects in that region. And they look like this. They are written in terms of the angle there and the cube, this harmonic function. And the third component is 0. On the other hand, if D is odd, and we are in the thick region, And we are in the thick region, then the number of those defects is d plus 1 over 2. And this is the formula for it, depending on that harmonic function and on these polar angles. And in the thin region, we have this formula. So again, So again, it's going to be planar and it's half degree defects. And here that Okay, the next thing is that constant m. We have a formula for a constant m that is important. It depends on which case you're in. And we have a formula for a number L, depending on these cases. And what those What you, what those, the significance of those is that M times S squared log one over epsilon minus L, S squared log one over sigma, is a lower bound for 1 over 2 epsilon to the alpha times the energy in these tubes, these tubes that are going around the defect. And that's something it's good to know, and especially if you. Good to know, and especially if you want to prove a theorem, it's good to know. And then the last one is that for those who have worked on Ginsburg-Landau, we have these sort of lower order terms that account for the cube. And the ones that we do get those, and it's part of what goes into how these. Goes into how these defects organize themselves, they want to be spread apart, and these are the same sort of things as in Vince Problando without raises in Henley. So, those are our main results. So, let me look at some ideas in the proofs. You know, in Yinstra Lando, you have some lower order terms, and they kind of relate to green functions. Just making quite exact what the whole formula is. Okay, so but Okay, so a big thing for us was that, and I learned this, I think, from Sluckin, one of Sluckin's papers a while back, that you can take any Q and S and you can write it in terms of something in R5. And the reason we have to do that is And the reason we have these more ugly denominators is that we scaled it so that they have the same length, which is very convenient. And this cube from R5 into S is an isometric isometry. So that is great because we're more used to working with F of U where you've got something in R5 than F of U. Then F of Q tensor, Q, etc., or N tensor, N, sorry. And I'm going to abuse notation, and I'm just going to call this sometimes F of Q, sometimes F of U, and I think you can, it's easy to not get them mixed up. So, in terms of U now, the Landau Deschenz energy looks like this. The boundary condition. This. The boundary conditions are that on the sides, u0 is a p naught, which is p10, p20, r0, and h10, h20. The p0 is s over square root of 2. It can be associated with n1l plus i n2l squared. So s over square root of 2 eats the i n. The r0 is s over square root of 2. The R0 is S over square root of 6, H naught is 0. Those are our prescribed boundary conditions. And one thing that you will notice when you look at this isometry is that if degree D over 2, that's the degree of N naught or the degree of Q, P naught will be twice that. It's just, you know, That it's just, you know, it's part of the idea. Boundary conditions imposed on the top and bottom, and in terms of U, it is that on the top and bottom, H1 and H2 are equal to zero. A minimizer also satisfies the natural boundary conditions because we didn't impose anything on P1, P2, and G, and these are the natural boundary conditions I'm talking about. Happen about it. And I guess one thing that's interesting is that a set of all Q that have E3 as an eigenvector and are in the zero set, they are two sets, two components. So one of them that is in the zero set of F, but is also has E3 as an eigenvector is S times E3 times E3. is S times E3 times V3 minus the third eye, so the top and bottom on the sphere. And the other one is lambda 2, looks like this. P1, P2, S over square root of 6, 0, 0. So you can actually draw that in 3D, which is nice. And so that's going to be, and here the P1 squared plus P2 squared is S squared over 2. S squared over 2. So it's going to be a ray on the sphere, and it's an opposite. And since the u0 is in lambda 2, where it's in the zero set, we have f of u equals zero on the lateral boundary. It's something that we kind of forced as a good way to start. Sort of something on your side to get you started. Okay, so from now on, like I said, we'll take delta equal to epsilon to the alpha, and we're going to look at the minimizing problem in terms of u. So these are the boundary conditions, and the first thing we do is to find an upper bound for the energy. And that's kind of the back of the envelope. And that's kind of the back of the angle of calculation, but maybe with more details about looking at a disk and taking something harmonic outside of that and trying to make something nice on the disk itself. And so this was based on a construction of functions in the admissible space. So that's what we were doing. And this is the that we got. That we got, and also, there's we're going to introduce some minimizers on the energy ESO too. And this is just, I guess, a statement about one of the issues, and that is that when you have a minimalizer, we're going to show that we have sub-sequences. In terms of U, this is what they look like. Is what they look like. These are the limits. And at first, it's a little bit hard to get the degrees. Not so hard, in fact, just this construction. We had the end, the number of points, exactly matching what we get in the end. And we had the degrees in mind, but not the Not these, D sub L, the, and that's the degrees in close, closer to certain places. Okay, so that is the situation here. So we introduce, it's very hard to think of how to start. And what we were thinking is that maybe it should. Maybe it should be a little bit like what would happen in 2D, right? What would happen at the equator, for example. And so, what we did is we formulated an energy. So, the one that we had was 1 half du squared plus the 1 over epsilon squared f of u. This one, we have knocked off the derivatives with respect to x3, and we have added. 3, and we have added an h of u squared, which was not part of that. And e sub 2 of u is going to be the energy with that index. And we're looking then for this. It's a 2D problem. So we'll have PgNH and W12 with these bounding values. These bounding values. So here is a comparison. That's our E sub 2. Our E1 that we started with was this. And you can see that we have the x3 squared and we don't have this. And the reason we did it is that it's a nice thing for getting estimates. thing for getting estimates because by Poincaré you know you have control on h squared and this is integrating from minus delta to delta by a certain part of the gradient squared and what that means for this E sub 2 that we've cooked up is sub 2 that we've cooked up is that you don't have E sub 2 that energy is not less than or equal to this energy but if you integrate it from minus delta to delta then the E sub 2 will have an upper bound has a relationship with the E1 and that's because of this so if we were just put in that extra dimension then it's very Extra dimension, then it's very useful. That was one of our tricks in the beginning. And what we get here is that if V epsilon is a minimizer of E2 in omega and U epsilon is a minimizer in D, then we can say that, well, E2 is this, but then we can do a 1 over 2 delta. Do a 1 over 2 delta minus delta to delta, that's for free. That's equals. But now you have an upper bound on that. That's a very nice, it's a nice way of getting, especially lower mountains. And yeah, and the last equality inequality used a star which was that palm grade. Use a star between that point A. So minimizers W epsilon and E2 epsilon have this bound that follows from this. But it also works for many other things. Okay, and yeah, I just want to mention, oh, this FF is a mistake from tech. From tech. But there's something behind here that I'm not going to talk a lot about. It's kind of messy, really. There's going to be a set J epsilon of W beta X. And we formulate a notion of good quotes. But you're not going to really see it, but it is a big piece of the background. Of the background when you start being able to make constructions and get a hold of what you're looking for. So we're going to take a beta less than alpha and we take the admissible functions in A tilde, that's the W12, which have the right boundary conditions. Now it's just on, it's a 2D, so it's on the plane. So it's on the plane. And we're going to assume that the energy for that W is bounded by 2ms squared log 1 over x. And we're going to define this set. And here it is. All the taus, it's a set in R between beta and alpha plus beta that satisfy a certain inequality. And that's a very useful inequality. If tau is in j epsilon of theta x, and if epsilon is small, then the length of p will be greater than or equal to s over 2 square root of 2 on that boundary. And these balls can be interior, or you can have x at the boundary. I just epsilon to the beta balls. Epsilon to the beta balls, but and the idea is that this is an inequality that gives you some control on the F of U, the bulk term. And we can also show that the measure of this, it's a subset in the interval from here of beta to alpha plus beta over 2. 2 alpha plus vein over 2, it has a positive, it has a bound from below. It's got a certain measure. And that's important for the math. And now let's assume that w is a minimizer of e2. Back there it was just an admissible function. And you set, we do a dilation, a scaling. w epsilon tilde is w of x plus epsilon to the tau y and And assume that tau is in this j of beta x. And what we have is that if we make that scaling, then the images, the new function is actually Holder continuous, uniformly Holder continuous. And the reason is that this The reason is that this formula that this was, this formula, it kind of pops in when you do a scaling from your boundary in epsilon to the beta radius to this huge Construct of omega tilde. But if you integrate this thing, then the upper bound, it's a log over here. And you get very good control because we're just taking then balls of radius one. And so this is a way of getting a lot of control here by a lot of regularity, uniform. Uniform undercuts, which means that you get a sequence that would converge, a sub-sequence. And this is all very complicated, but later on it comes up in the Struver construction. And that's also a very complicated thing, but very powerful. Okay, and so let me say another thing about W minimizer V2. Minimizer of E2 and with this scaling. And that is given any eta greater than zero. You have Helder continuity here. And if epsilon, there isn't epsilon naught, so that if epsilon is small enough, you have this going on for all of the x tilde of the boundary of that ball. So this is useful information, and even better is And even better is that the W image of the boundary of that ball is going to be in lambda 2 V naught. And what that means is the V naught neighborhood of that lambda 2, which was the ring where F is still. So it's a lot of information. It is very technical, but it turns out to be in the background. In the background, and it gives us a lot of things. So, and another thing, I mentioned beta glidpoints. So, we say that X, which is the center of this ball or disk, is a beta glid point if there's at least one tau in J epsilon. In J epsilon, which has degree of P being zero. Okay? So there's at least one radius in tau, in J epsilon, here. And if not, we say it's a bad point. And there are things that are, we call them good points. And you know, they are very nice, they have a certain relationship to the Relationship to F of U. Okay, and now I want to formulate. So, all of this is still, it's in the background, but it's important. And let me tell you two properties. One is for these alphas fixed, we're going to say let F be a family of w and epsilon, where w is admissible, epsilon is positive. Epsilon is positive, and it satisfies property 1 and 2 if these two things happen. One is that E2 of W has this bound, which is in turn bounded by S. The other is, and that's why I'm talking about this set J epsilon, we require, we say for any 0 less than beta less than alpha, there should be an epsilon naught of beta. There should be an epsilon naught of beta, so that w epsilon is in this set. If x is in any, is any beta good point, then w will be a lambda 2 v naught. So those are significant points. Okay, and in the end, you know, we're going to get this kind of convergence and. And this P-bar is going to look like this. And so these D sub L's, they're going to be either one or two. That's what happens. And later we can figure it out, but not at first. So that's what it looks like in the U variables. And the thing that I want to, the reason I pointed this out to you, is that those two properties, one Is that those two properties, one and two, if you have a family, this C epsilon, a family of W epsilon, just satisfying those two things, then that is the structure that allows us to get theorem A, to get those points, to get that convergence. That's what's behind it. Okay, and then, you know, since Then, you know, since those two properties are satisfied for minimizers of E2, then you have a nice, you can apply those to the minimizers. For example, you can get a result like this by using this theorem. And how do we prove this result? As I said, we use a struvotype family of disks. Use a struva-type family of disks and annuli. And it basically is a recipe starting at 5 epsilon to the beta up to sigma over 2. And it's a way of choosing balls and big balls with an inner ball and certain annuli on which various things happen that give you some control. And so, but those two properties, that's the hypothesis. Properties, that's the hypothesis. If you can get that for your family, then you've got therapy. And so, yeah, I think, I guess here I just want to mention that we can get this kind of estimate. Okay. So, and in the end, what we are able to get for the 3D problem is that we have this pound on the energies of E two outside of the balls, the disks. Some ideas in the proofs. Is in the proofs. T epsilon behaves like a Ginsburg-Lando order parameter. You don't see it right away, but you can see it in the lambda 2. P1 squared plus P2 squared is S squared over 2. So that's in for lambda. You have a gradient P squared and that bulk term. And it's Bulgar. And it's there. It's there. So we show that we'll have disjoint disks, B epsilon to the beta of AL epsilon in the union of B sigmas. And for that type of situation, we're going to have length of P epsilon on the order of S over square root. On the order of s over square root of two in here. And the degree of p epsilon on the boundary, these are these balls that we picked out, will be either one or two. That is something that comes up in the proof once you get close enough to being able to force the energy to be concentrated near those zeros. So, and when you're in those areas where length of p is proportional to s over square root of 2 somewhat uniformly, then here's the Ginsburg-Lando. Then when you look at the F of U, it looks like this. And that's like the Ginsburg-Lando. So techniques that you can think of using. And once you have that, you can. And once you have that, and here I'm just throwing out certain things that we get along the way. And this work was really kind of a slog, really, of just getting some, I mean, it was fascinating, but the proofs were very technical. So it was both. And so one of the estimates, for example, we end up being able to prove things like this and And very detailed things. And for the E sub 2, analyzing that formula, if the degree is 1, then here's an estimate due to Bolivari, Montero, and Canavari. These are our epsilon to the beta radius balls that we're looking at. They come up. They come up, and if the degree is 2 on those, then we have this kind of estimate. And it is a slog to show that those degrees, the balls, so they're in these smaller balls, they're in these epsilon to beta epsilon. That's what you're getting. That's what you get. And that leads to more estimates. And I don't really expect you to really see that these are useful, but it's just, you know, it's a lot of estimates to narrow in on what's going on. And eventually, it seemed like eventually, but really it's kind of midway through what you're doing, it's a great thing. thing, you find out that the u epsilon, now this is the 3D minimizer, that if you take these slices at zero, they satisfy properties one and two. That is great because then it's kind of like what we got for the 2D minimizers. You know, we have this structure here, even though they're not minimizers. And once we have that, then we can lift this. Then we can lift this information throughout the tube, and this is kind of why we put kind of use of two energy in there because you hope that whatever is going on at zero in the 3D minimizer, it's going to be, especially with epsilon small, it's going to be close to the final result. And one thing that was interesting that we saw right at the beginning is that these. Beginning is that these 3D minimizers have a symmetry. They think for a minute, the T1 and T2 are, they have, with respect to the X3, the P1 and P2 are even. The H, I think, is odd, and I've forgotten about. Think is I, and I've forgotten about R. But anyway, the point is that you can then build a periodic solution, but only the ones from minus delta to delta will be minimizes. But having that periodic solution, you're in this tube and you didn't have a lot of control at the top and bottom. But now, because it's a weak solution, it's got more regularity. And so that is also very helpful. Very helpful. And at the end, we, in the process, we took the energy and we multiplied inside by partial u with respect to x3 and integrated by parts. And you find out that you have equality, I think it was equality of the integral of length of h squared with the integral of one-half. 1/2 the two-dimensional gradient squared plus 1 over epsilon squared f, which comes in very handy once you get to this sort of middle point where we have this 2D energy density. Then that becomes very useful because that's when we start to get things like the length of h squared, it's bounded and And various other terms are bounded, and it also makes it easier to get the upper bounds on the E sub the energy or the three problems. Start there. Thank you very much for this very nice talk. It does seem that I've got Very nice talk. It does seem like there was a lot of technicalities involved, yes. Any question from the people on Zoom or in the room? I didn't catch. Is part of the statement of the result that for the three problem, you can characterize the zero set? Like, say when you have a half-degree vortex, can you say there's a line segment, a bunch of line segments? Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Those A sub L's in the theorem A, they were for the 3D problem. Yeah, and they're like the centers of the tubes, really. Yeah, but those formulas were the 3D formulas. But, you know, getting all this 2D information, and this is really great because you get a lot more control when all the boundary pieces are smooth and both, you know, being weak. And both being weak solutions, even though they're not minimizers, you still have regularity that goes with it. Those A sub L's were, and then I guess another comment is that was really bad. Once we have done this 3D regularity and merging, you get all these. You get all these very nice properties, and it turns out that if you look at the center disk, for example, and you have your u epsilon, your minimizer, look at the values of it, and take a disk and then find the minimizers of e2 with those boundary values. And that minimizes. That minimizer that you get is bounded below the U epsilon energy on that disk. And the value of that at the E2, it bounds by a constant the minimizer energy there. So it's sandwiched in between the E2 values and Values and something that is plus C of that. So that was very helpful for her. And you can get the idea that some of these things make the 3D analysis and the fact that the other behaviors outside of what's happening on at z equals zero should be similar, very similar. Read a little bit on why the degree is one or two. Oh boy. I think Struva had already done some work where he was looking at degrees. And I think we looked, you know, what if it's one? And then if it's even, what happens? What happens? It is odd what happens. And somehow being able to throw out all of the numbers that it could be except one or two. But there was a lot of inequalities. I see. And, you know, just using really they were struva ids. But. Whose ideas? Struva. Struva. Yeah. So. Can you go back to Elliot, S-T-R-U-W-E. Yeah. Strupa. People in Ginsburg-Llano and other problems of this nature with the bulk potential. Which work in particular? Pardon? Which work in particular? Oh, I don't know. I'm not. I don't remember. Yeah. The interest of time is just a little bit of a. In the interest of time, Mr. Justice, thank our speaker again.
