This is and this is more or less the the the one of the main ideas of my talk. This is we have here differential equations, and here you one you have a function, I have the differential of a function, and differential of a function is a collection, if you want, of collectors. And then there's something a function is something is given information here, and we need to connect this with this. But this is not possible, basically. You need something like this to connect these two spaces. To connect these two spaces, to connect functions or differential functions or forms you want with vector fields here, vector field or dynamics here. And then this is necessary sign structure. This structure appears, for instance, when we have a symplectic form, or we have a Poisson structure, or whatever, almost Poisson structure. There are many, many categories for this intuition. I will start with something that perhaps is well known for the audience, but I don't know. This is the I don't know. This is the Lagrangian system, but it has to introduce some notation. I will start with the simple case. This is Lagrangian and the standard Hamiltonian case. And I will show how to write well-known numerical integrators, synthetic integrators for these cases. And then how to, the method that I introduced to obtain these numerical integrators is useful for another extension. This is my idea, not to simple copy. This is my idea not to simple the situation, but I don't know. I'm more specialist in the audience here, but at last it's simple to apply exactly the same technique to obtain the symplectic integrators in other situations. Okay? Well, we start with a configuration manifold, Q, which is a manifold, thinking part three. We want an Lagrangian function, which is a function depending on positions and velocities. Okay, this is the situation that we have. We have having some principles. We have having a principle, okay? We are looking for trajectories of this action and we are trying to find the extremas of this action. And the extremas of this action automatically gives a system of second-order differential equations. That in this talk, I will assume that it's possible to write as an explicit system of differential equations. This is precisely the condition of regularity of the drawing. In other cases, well, you have singular. Well, you have similar arrangements, it's interesting to work by track or whatever, but in other cases. But in principle, we will assume that this system is a system of differential equations, and then it's possible this is the condition that Lagrangian is a regular derivative. Okay? Well, if we have this situation, we can, if the Lagrangian is regular or regular if you want, or we simplify, we can move from one side to the other side using. From one side to the other side, using the well-known transformation, and then we can connect this position and momenta to check position and velocities to positions and momentum. And this moving to the here, we are moving from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian side. But this is only possible, I remember, because what? We have Lagrangian is here. It's interesting because we are interested also in cases when it's not possible to connect both. It's not possible to connect both these situations if they are rendering singular. In principle, it's not possible to obtain a Hamiltonian version. It's the same to go to DIDAC, DIDAC algorithm to obtain a version of the Hamiltonian side. And even if I have a Hamiltonian that is not regular, it's not possible to move to the Ragranian side. And this is precisely the case of optimal control theory, the super Hermann geometry, etc., etc., where appear this particular situation. Well, we can definitely. Well, we can define it. In this situation, we can move defining this Hamiltonian here. This is easily defined by this condition, by reassuming the regulatory condition, but the Hismatric. And we can apply locally at least the easiest function theorem. And then we can define this Hamiltonian. And then the regularized equations are equivalent to the Hamiltonian equations. And what? I would like to write these equations in a more implicit way, if you want. And then using this constant. Using this construction that is the symplectic form, it's possible to define this one form in the quotangent bundle. This is a one-form here, which is defined in this very simple way. Taking a vector and projecting this, and we're reading the covector here. This is the covector, it's the point, which is basically the one form. And then locally, if you want, this is a definition for different circumstances people, but the definition is. But the definition is this one. This is something quite simple. And then the canonical sympathetic form is precisely, well, you can select the sigmus, but it's the differential of this one form, or minus the differential of this one form, is the standard sympathetic form. But if you con work in these coordinates, standard coordinates is the typical integral coordinates in this case. It's this one form. It's twofold, it's simple, and then the Hamiltonian, the implicit Hamiltonian equation is. The physical Hamiltonian equation is precisely this omega q. This is important for me. This is moving, permits to move from the differential of a function, of a function to a vector field, the Hamiltonian vector field, which is given by this. Automatically for this equation, well, it's automatic also for these equations, but automatically for this equation, by the properties, which isymmetric or whatever, we obtain the property that we have preservation of energy and we have also the And we have also, this condition here is exactly the symplecticity of the flow. Okay, this is a differential way using this derivative to express the condition that the flow is preserving the symplectic form. This is nothing, this is nothing to and this is how automatic from this kind of equations we have using that this is a close to form, not the generic to flow, we obtain these conditions. Also, perhaps we can introduce symmetries, etc. Introduce symmetries, etc. Momentum preservation here, but for the moment, it's okay. But this is perhaps, I don't know, parochial way to introduce this connection between things. But believing that, perhaps it's interesting. We have, this is our space here. The other moment, remember that I have this scheme here. No? I remember. And I say that it is necessary to. And I say that it's necessary to connect the cotangent, where leaving the functions and the differentials, with the tangent boundary. Okay? But here, precisely, the simpleton to form is doing this form. It's taking a vector field here, which you can think of a vector field here as a section of this band if you want, to move to here, which we have a which is the a function here, a reference of a function here. In this case. And this is exactly this movie. We have the situation here. We can move from here to here, and then, well, we have the symplectic to form. We can move from this space to this space and conversely, because this map is a symplectomorphism. Symplectomorphism, I don't want to enter into details. Here is clear that the sympathetic to form is a potangent marker, we have a canonical sympathetic to form, and here you can take practice. And here you can take, perhaps, if you want, the pullback of these two forms, nothing more. Or perhaps it's possible to take the tangent leaf of the two forms. But these are technicalities, whatever. But this is asymptomatics. This is one of the things that I can take. One thing is asymptomatics. Where this impectomorphy depends on the form, but this is not important for me. Depend on the formula. This is not important for me. This is symplectic or at the symplectomorphism. And now we move to the language in theory. This is about Lagrangian sub-manifold. If we have a symplectic manifold, we can work even in better space initially. We have a special type of, we have many types of sub-manifolds, but one of them is a sub-manifold of asymplectic manifold. You have here. And then we say that this is a Lagrangian sub-manifold. Say that this has a Lagrangian so many four. If the sympetic for the pullback of the sympathetic 4 is zero, it is applied to tangent vector to this are many four. If you take two vectors tangent to this are manifold, the sympety four is zero in this case. This is quite different to Riemannian geometry in this case. And also, we have this dimension, which is in some sense the maximum dimension that verifies an Space in this case. Okay? This is the Radiansum manifold. And the Ragnius manifold for me is the K for introducing symplectic integrator. Symplectic integrator is the same in some sense of other Rhyniansum manifold. An example, for instance, this is precisely the case that we are using here in the Hamiltonian side. If we have a one-four, imagine that we have the differential of a function. Automatically, the image of this differential of a function is a Lagrangian manifold. This is important. This is important. This is that if you have a function, the differential of a function, the image of the differential of a function, thinking as a source manifold here, is automatically a Randolph Manifold. Also, in this case, in the Potanium Band, even what particle fibers are also the Reinhards of Manifold. There are many, a lot of categories of the Random Southern. Okay? What is this? This is what? This is a construction. I remember. I remember. This is a construction, but this is not exactly the situation that appears. We have also situations that are interesting, also in mechanics, because this is precisely the situation that appears in, for instance, in the so-called superhuman geometry or Arabian mechanics. If we have the situation that we have initially as a meaningful, okay, we have as a manifold of a meaningful M, and instead of having a function here, And instead of having a function here, we have a function here. This is important for me. For instance, if you want to, for constraint-symplectic methods, constraint-symplectic methods are based exactly in this kind of categories. If we have in this dissertation, we can construct a franchise as a manifold of the Potangian market, which is a Lagrande submerged. Okay? We don't have enough. Okay? We don't have enough variables here to cover. This is projected here in one. We have a Lagrangian manifold in this space. This is an extension of the initial piece. And this is interesting because you know there appears and you have coordinates here, but we don't have, and these are less than n. And this is the dimension of this system. We need extra variables. And the extra variables from the literature are called Larenza multipliers. They are precisely the Lorentz multipliers that are. I see there are many multipliers that apply in cross-trained by some alcales or whatever. Okay, this is another situation. And this situation, well, I put here this condition, but it allows us to introduce also, this is interesting for me, introduce this anti-symplectomorphis. This is a like a symplectomorphism, canonical symplectomorphism between this this strengthened, the cotangent bundle of the cotangent band and the cotangent bundle or the tangent band. The tangent bundle or the tangent bundle. Why? Because it's interesting for me because Allagrangian is a function of the tangent bundle. Then the names of the differential of F is a submanifold of this manifold. And then with this, we can move to this space where we have the sympletic canonical to form, and we can move. The sympletic canonical to form, but we can move to a vector field, if you want, or as a manifold of the tangent boundary here. This is important to construct this kind of sympetomorphies because they allow us to construct the numerical integrators in a principal nice way. Something important that is related with some of the talks here, which is is splitting methods, for instance, or whatever, are based also in compositions of methods. Splitting methods or composition of numerical methods. Methods or composition of numerical methods, and in this level, we are seeing this as the composition of Lagrangian submanifors. You have two Lagrangian submanifors and the sine regulatory conditions you can compose in the typical way. You have this kind of thing, taking the pairs of points in the initial and the final point, such that this is a point in the intermediate space, where you find that it belongs to both. Automatically, in this case, we have that this space. case we have that this space is a Lagrangian so many form. Then this is the reason that this is an asterisk, a geometrical reason, because the composition of many symplectic methods, we obtain a symplectic method. And this is in my construction, that is really in some sense, the way to obtain higher order methods because okay another example that for me is interesting is well we are thinking here the symptomic manifold. Here, a sympathetic manifold here, which is keeped with this core, the standard sympathetic form here, and meanings, the sympathetic form in this space. And we can take this, and automatically, the graph of asymplectomorphism, the graph of asymplectomorphism, is a Lagrangian manifold of this space. Okay? Well, we pay this price, but the important thing that this is the, this is Polish mathematician, Pasaguia some years ago, but this is the two. Years ago, but this is the 2GF tribe. And for me, what missed everything, but the important thing is that we have connected this space where I take the differential of Alarange appears as a large manifold here. And I can introduce more things, but I can move by using this simple optomorphs here, to a Rhythmian summary for here, and I move here to obtain another Lagrangian sum manifold of this space. Another Rhineland Summerfold. Space. An analytics of many follow-up tenant space automatically is created with a vector field preserving centrifuges. Well, it's possible to define this map here, composing bulk, or it's possible to define more intrinsically entirely, but at the end of the day, we have this situation. We have a Lagrangian here, okay? And then we can produce a Lagrangian submanifold. Lagrangian subminifold is the name. Larangi so many fold is the image of the differential of L, okay? And then I can move to the space of the tangent space. Okay? But I know that this is a very, if I don't know, Baroque way to write the equation, but believe me that I move to this space and alphabetically I obtain an aggrandise of many four SF of this tangent space. Okay? And what this is, if the differential of L is given by this. If the differential of L is given by this set in coordinates, it is given in this way. The S L it's possible to compute is exactly this, and automatically this equivalent to the Euler Lagrange equation. But in the audience, some people are thinking that, well, to obtain the Levant's equation, this guy takes this road now to obtain the Euler Lagrange equation, but well, but it's important to have this scheme because this is the scheme that I and now I want participants. Now I want participatory. I'm using some techniques that this is the idea. This is the first part of my talk, the continuous side. And I want to move to the discrete side. The tangent under this star cube, where the dynamic is given, is decided to move to this space of two copies of the cotangent band. And this is the discretization of an space. The tangent band, the discretization of the band. Tangent band, the discretization of this is two copies of M. This is the way to discretize. And this is important because, well, appears these discretizations have a very nice geometrical structure, algebraic structure, which is related, for instance, the relation of a Lie group with the Lie algebra. It's exactly the same relation. Then we need to introduce this, to the space, and then to transform the Lagrangian. And then to transform the Lagrangian sum manifold, the classic plectomorphies, flashing plectomorphies of this space. It's exactly, one of the examples that I pose, is exactly like an implicit synthetic method. Okay? This is Alranian Summerfold of this space, it's like an implicit synthetic method. To be a Rhythmus of many fold is exactly the same to syntheticity, but we are working on this idea. Well, we are working on this kind of two copies of cotangent marvels or sympathetic metaphors. Okay? Well, and then, Eric, where is Eric? And then, this is exactly that I will use, this is for the right, in a simple way, some category, not all the category of sympathetic integrators. I will use also the retraction in a different way that you are using for utilization. We have what is introduced by Mirik in the previous talk. Merry in the previous talk, this is fantastic. We have a traction of maps, which is imagine that, for example, we have this on Rn this way, we denote this Riemannian, but it is also the typical example is the exponential map on a Riemannian minifor in this case. But as was defined, a retraction map is a map from the tangent space to M, okay, it's moving the vector to a point, near a point. To a point, near a point, is exactly the escatitis that I am looking for, but for a different fit to construct numerical integrators, not to optimize. Then it's possible to relate with this optimization, but this is a different, sorry. And then, well, verifying these two properties, the zero vector is sent to the initial point, and we have this like local higherity condition that is more or less mimicking. That is more or less mimicking that is happening with the exponential of Armenian knife. It's exactly that this mimicking here, or a second-order differential equation. And then I will use this kind of retraction, but well, for optimization is okay. You can apply all these methods that we recommended before. But we need something additional, a modification which is quite natural in numerical methods, for example, the mid-point river, etc. Rio, etc., etc., need to introduce different extensions of the discretization map. This is precisely this map where also the initial point is moving to another point. This is a very fine sign properties that believe me that these are like an extension of the conditions of the previous one, of a typical retraction map, where the missile point is fixed in the water. And then verify this code, and it's possible to prove like a And it's possible to prove like a corollary that the discretization map is also a local diffeomorphism. This is something important in retraction maps, but also for this extension, discretization map in this situation. Examples, well, this is an example of attraction as before, but the midpoint now is an example of discretization map also. Okay? And what this method, we will have a retraction, we can construct another discretization. Another dispetition map using these conditions. And this is interesting, for instance, for Riemannian exponential. We have the Riemannian metric in our space. We can produce this retraction map that appears there. For instance, like the midpoint field for a Riemannian manifold. Or in the sphere, we can, instead of working with the Riemannian metric, we are taking the projection. You have a, I move in this direction and then I take to. this direction and then I take to to have modulus modulus one and we obtain this uh this like the midpoint using projection of uh we will have as a manifold of a Euclidean space with the Euclidean metric for example in this case we have many many possibilities and one that Arya knows better is to use this kind of uh exponential map in any group in this case the exponential map in any group we can apply these these techniques. And apply these techniques. What's the relation of this with my original problem, not to construct in a very Baroque mode the synthetic integrators? But well, we will use this like the way given this information, we have like the information how to move from the tangent bundle to two copies of M. But I am working with Hamiltonian side. I don't need to work with two copies. I don't need to work with two copies of n. You need to work with two copies of the Cotanian matter. But there is the notion of lift of mappings. And this is nice. Okay? Well, this is like an eskin there. Well, this is also because after the talks by Fernando, etc., appear these adjoint methods. Also, we will have a retraction map, we can produce. map we can produce the we can produce the action map and we can also in this level that this is nothing to do for the moment with numerical integrators we can produce also this the symmetric well we can say well at this prediction map is symmetric we verify this condition for instance the midpoint we will verify this condition it's interesting because well you know if it's symmetric perhaps you obtain a second order Perhaps you obtain a second-order method instead of a first-order method and whatever. And this is the thing that this is not perhaps complicated, but the idea here is exactly we have something here that we want to lift. And one thing that is possible to lift is to consider this is a local diffeomorphism, that this is proof, it's a local diffeomorphism, and I can take the inverse, I will go locally inverse, and take this map here. One map from the cotangent bundle of TQ to the cotangent band of Q times Q. And many times it's only necessary this thing, but in this paper we used also the alpha, this map and trivial symptom of this to produce a new this, believe me, that this is also disproved, that is also an escatization map. Then if I have a dispretization map on this level, automatically I am obtaining an escratization. I am obtaining a discretization map on the level of the tangent of the cotangent band. And this is, remember my continuous scheme, and appear this very baroque way to write the equations of motion of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian side. I need to move from, for instance, for these spaces to two copies of the T star Q T star Q. But it's important for me that everything is asymptotom. Is the is asymptomorphic and then the Lagrangian so many four paragraphs. The Ragnan submanifold character is moving from one space to the others. Okay? And then automatically, I can move a Lagrangian submanifold of this space, but Arrhenius sum manifold of this space. And automatically, this method is asynthetic in the regular case. Okay, well, this is. Sorry, but what's the meaning of the minus the self-defense? Ah, yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. This is typically we have a key standard simpleton for, which is, but here we are. Which is, but here we are changing the signature in the first part. If you want, if you have this form in coordinates, there are many ways to do this. Sorry. This is the standard symplectic form in this space, T star Q times Q, you want, and the unique thing that we are doing is changing this. But this is not a, this is like this, this is like a simple program. Is like a symbol to morphism between all these spaces. And the important thing is this result, important thing that is a consequence of the construction. The leaf of a mark of adipheomorphism automatically is a symplectomorphism. Believe me, this appears in classical books, foundational mechanics, for instance. You have an adipheomorphis here. The lift, the lift of this map to this space, is a simple. map to this space is a symptomorphism. This is all. This one is by construction is a symplectomorphism. And this one also. And automatically we have a higher traction that also has the property that is asynchronous. Then this is key for me. Only using a higher traction in the base space, I am producing something that is moving Lagrangian many force to Lagrangian summifuls in the discrete setting. And then we are moving to And then we are moving to the symplectic integrator. Well, if we have a Hamiltonian side, and using this retraction, I can move to this system of differential equations that by constraction, this constraction, this is the Hamiltonian vector field, and we take the retraction this way, whatever, we obtain this equation that appear there, or using the geomorphism, but this is not important. Okay? And this is more or less the scheme that I will. And this is more or less the scheme that I want to maintain. This is the continuous that side is the continuous side. And the unique thing that I do, this is different than other authors, because they try to discretize extractors. And for me, this is the continuous side. And then adding an extract structure, which is in this case higher traction or discretization, automatically I am obtaining these two copies of the Cotantian band. And then I have a Lamanosum manifold here. Automatically, I have a Lamanosum manifold. Automatically, like a fragmentation method. And this is as this is by nature as this is like an implicit symplectic method. Okay? Okay, this is all this trip to obtain this. We have this retraction here. We can lift this retraction here and we can take and we obtain this method, no? This is a very classical method, that this is a symplectic method automatically, okay? Well Method automatically, okay? Well, this is a long trick to obtain this, and then, but also, it's possible to work in manifolds. Why not use one of the retraces that they propose in different manifolds? For instance, we are working on Hamiltonian system on the sphere. I can take the retraction that they propose at the beginning. Sorry, here is, I need the norm of this vector field here, and I can take this, the inverse of this, and while doing things automatically, I am obtaining a syntactic method. I am obtaining a symmetric method on the sphere. But I am doing exactly the same. This is because the computations are more important, but always a symmetric attraction. I take the cotangent difficult retraction, and more or less I am obtaining automatically from the differential of H or the vector field. I am obtaining a numerical method, which is by construction. Okay? This is, well, references, I will skip this because my time is limited and here, but also. Here, but also it's interesting that the composition of sympathetic manifold for me is a very baroque guy, is a composition of Lagrangian submanifolds. And then I can compose Lagrangian submanifolds and to obtain the method that appeared using the Joshida method or whatever, this coefficients or whatever, I can obtain the composition and use symplectic iterator. It's important because with the retractions, in principle, I only obtain. In principle, I only obtain first or second order methods. But composing, in this case, I can obtain higher-order methods. Okay, and then this is the introduction to my talk. This is the third part of my talk. This is, for instance, applications to holonomic mechanics. In holonomic mechanics, well, holonomic mechanisms work on, you can work on the manifold, and this is like the intrinsic way to the sphere, but they are, I don't know, working with. But they are, I don't know, working with talking with engineering people or some they prefer to work in a vector space on array, you know, and they introduce a Lavanian multipliers. And this is the situation that we have. We have instead of this, we have a manifold, finite dimensional or simplicity, and we have some manifold of this space, which is given by holonamic constraints, and a function defining this space. And then what we want to obtain this, I don't know, constraint simplex. Constraint simplex integrator that appears in the literature, in many books by Sally Moore, Page, etc., appears this study of this constraint syntactic method using the same technique. But there is something that is funny for me, but I don't know for you, that we have a continuous problem. The idea here is I want to obtain a numerical method. Obtain a numerical method preserving exactly the constraints. That is, if we have Q0 and Q1, the constraint, Q0 verify the constraint, the economic constraint, Q1 verify the economic constraint. Not the middle point. This is not important in a manifold. The point, the initial point, and the final point of the method, etc., is verify this. And then we introduce a trick. For me, it's funny, that we have a retraction map which is arbitrary. I can use whatever arbitrary. I can use whatever attraction. But in order that everything is okay, I need to modify the tangent space to the holomic constraint even in this way. This is taking the product, which is something that I want to maintain. Q0 belongs to N, Q1 belongs to N. This is the thing, the holonomical strength. And I take the retraction, the inverse of the retraction, and I obtain something different from the time. Something different from the tangent space. It's a short subspace. That is, if you want, this is something like this. I have the middle point, I can apply the middle point here, and then I change the constraint by this thing here that now are depending on velocities. If you want, in the case of us here, I have the this constraint and the derivative is also need to impose there. And then we obtain this kind of different constraint. Then in the continuous side, In the continuous side, I am not moving on the sphere, okay? But in the discrete case, I am moving exactly on the points q0 and q1 and living on the sphere. This is a technicality that is, in my opinion, funny, but for me, it's exactly this. From this, remember this other construction that I propose here of the sub-manifold, La Reign-sub-manifold, I use this one. I can use this one, and I produce also. And I produce also exactly the same procedure. I can take the continuous side, I move by using the lift of the retraction, okay? And then I obtain a numerical method that is automatically simpler for the holonomic case. But this is exactly, I will obtain a well-known method if you want. I take this discretization here, I take it also the modification by the time step here, I take it inverse, I take it. We take the inverse, we take the constraints in this sense, and take the leafs of the mappings, and automatically, but we obtain one of the well-known methods that appears in the literature of synthetic method, which is listed here. And also, I have two lamental multipliers. I impose this condition, that the initial condition and the final condition belongs to the legend of the A. This is, you two are familiar with this constraint synthetic method. This constraint synthetic method. This is the typical condition that we are there. And then, well, we can apply over 9 mechanics. This is the case of a very simple Lagrangian. Mechanical Lagrangian, you want this matrix is constant, but we can apply to more involved situations. For instance, we can think in this space, and perhaps I like SO3, but imagine that I don't like to work on SO3, and I consider SO3 inside of the set of. Inside of the set of matrices. Then we are introducing constraints for the SO3. This is typical in many worlds. And this can introduce it by using this kind of constraints here. And then, which is, we have dimension 3, and you are introducing the set of matrices of three columns and three rows. And then we have six additional degrees of harmonic constraints that are introduced using. Constraints that are introduced using Matisse. For instance, this method, this method for, sorry, it is, I also use the composition. I can use also the compositional method and I use this kind of rattle method for holonomic constraints here. This is, for example, this is well known in the literature here. And also, we introduce the condition that the initial and final condition verify the condition that belongs to this manifold here. These are many forms here. And then this is a method that is well known. Also, I can take also contraction by Kermel, and we can use this new space method that is by Peter Pets and Sigril Tendecker. And I don't know if you're familiar with this. And this is exactly the thing that we are obtaining here. But this is only for Ali Group. I am working on Ali group. I can use this trivialization. And this is for me. And this is for me, this is the Hattle method for the for Namic constraints when we have a Lie group and we have constraints on the Lie group. And then we can apply the realities. I am not working on Andy space. My Andy space is the idea group. And then we have like joints, elements there that are introducing holonomic constraints. It will disappear in engineering, robotics, et cetera, frequently. But applying the same technique, lift whatever. The same technique, lift whatever. This is perhaps more involved here, but we are producing exactly the same methods that here. And then, for the moment, and I have only 10 minutes now or something similar, I have introduced it. You can see all these taus or whatever things and mappings that appear in this head earlier. It has our paper in this, in this exactly in this topic. But this is how to move from already. I was talking about Sano June that this. Radio was talking about Sanoji that is to move from the Lie group to the tangent to the Lie group to the Lie algebra and to work on the Lie algebra all the time. And this is more or less the idea that is behind this. But this scheme, this is my intention, that I don't know, is that the same ideas moving Arania so many fold is possible to apply to other situations that are more involved. For instance, this is, we have This is we have an optimal control problem, which is a fully actuated, this is a particular case, a fully actuated case, another case that was possible. And we have like a control of this one, not this point of source, you want to minimize this. And then by substituting, you can work with Talagran depending on position, velocities, and accelerations also. But if you want, this is exactly, you can apply exactly the same techniques to here. And this is interesting. Techniques to here. And this is interesting also for the problems that are related with splines or manifolds. This is precisely given not only for second-order differential equations, but given by four-order differential equations, six-order differential equations, and an even number of differential equations, and you obtain this. And these equations are, at the origin, it is biasional, but with Alagnum, which is regular order. But, boy, believe me that it's possible to start with. To start with using the same technique. This is the important thing that they want to transmit. It's necessary to pay a price, but after this price, this is exactly the same. But also, we can take a retraction, but also we can take an instead of cotangent lift, tangent lift of this, and it's possible to check by using some technicalities that we can move to some kind of attraction in these higher-order spaces also. And then we can produce. We can produce also the same situation. The dynamics is given by other plants of manifold in this space, and using this kind of attraction, we are moving to this kind of space. Here it is not explained because this is not exactly the space that they want to move. We have the differential of the Lagrangian there. It's necessary to work also with the cotangent lift, but we are obtaining also symplectic integrations in this case, and we are working with. The resources on these case. And we are working with people in Imbra, Fatima, etc., which are expressed in SPLINES to, for instance, to find cubics on the sphere or whatever using this technique that automatically preserves the manifold, the sphere for instance, and automatically selected to the network. That is something that is inherent in these dynamics. And I am finishing because one system with System with symmetry. I am talking about simpleticity, but symplecticity also gives us almost preservation of the energy. But what about symmetry? This is also a very well-known topic that appears in many books of people of the audience. But in this case, we can think in this situation. We have a retraction map or excretization map that we have also the action of LIG group. And we ask that this diagram commutes. Okay? Commutes. Okay? If this diagram commutes, we have a retraction that is related with the symmetry that appears in the system. Now, the idea is, well, I find a retraction, but I find these conditions about the Lie group of symmetries. If our Hamiltonian of our Lagrangian is also invariant by these Lie group of symmetries, automatically our numerical method preserves the momentum. This is uh this is the condition. This is the condition. Preserve the symmetries of the system. Only with these two ingredients. In continuous system, we know that have some symmetry properties, but taking a hydraulic, verifying this property, automatically we are obtaining the dynamics of the system. Well, I don't want to enter, but this is a momentum map, this is the thing that we want to preserve. And well, this is exactly the construction, but this is the thing that I want to to This is the thing that they want to prove. It's possible to prove if our Hamiltonian has a one and we have an element of the real diagram in such a way this quantity, which is a function of the quote magnet, is a constant of the motion. And if our retraction map or differization map automatically presents this set of symmetries, automatically our method preserves also the symmetry of the system. Okay? This is also because I well know. Also, because I will not result in the lecture to offer, but also it's possible to apply to this in my more involved situations, we think applying the same regulation here. For instance, we can think in this typical retraction here, and automatically for any matrix, we have this relation there, and then this is a very simple retraction here, and then if we have a Hamiltonian presser in the we automatically will have press correlation also. That's a reason of this constant of the motion of the system. But this is, well, I am obtaining results that are well not in the research. I will skip this part because for me, it's quite, but that is interesting also for time, but it's the situation when you see we have working all the time in these kind of spaces. But in some moments, we are talking that in the case we need to move. Case we need to move for this space to this space, and in case of reduction, we need to move to for the potassium band, for instance, this space, this reduced space, to two copies of this. And then we can define the notion of attraction, but also here it's possible to define the notion of retraction. This is precisely the idea of anaphorism. Work also in the category of this kind of spaces. As the name is not the best, this is Librum volts and the alternate, but this is like an extension that covers all the situations, and then the reaction is always in the same category. You will have the tangent specialty group, and I take the Causion by the Legroup, you obtain the Li algebra. All these things are in the same category. Well, I don't want to enter into an extension of definition or retraction and expectation map to these spaces. But the important thing is that we can derive. The important thing is that we can derive numerical integrators for this, apply exactly the same recipe that automatically preserves the Leap Poisson structure in this case, okay, by the reduction. In many cases, we are obtaining well-known results in the reduction by Clachhan, Class Modeling, etc. But this is the situation that we have in the case of in the case of this situation, for the case of in the case of a Lagrangian system on a Lie algebra, we obtain this kind of We obtain this kind of integrators, but automatically reconstruction is we are obtaining this situation. And let me finish. Well, but the German is very kind and yeah, but in this situation, we have this situation that our numerical method is defined on the dual of the Lie algebra. But here we have we are working, if you want, on the cotangent magnet value group. This is like a Margaret Fali group. This is like a synthetic realization of this speech. And this is, we have, in this species, we have this situation. But something that we are working on this moment that has an interesting question, and I don't know if there are people in the audience that know better, but this is in the situation that we have a puzzle and it fall initially, apodynamically, it's possible. And then in this situation it's not possible it's not it's totally not easy to construct the the sympathetic realization. Sympletic realization, but there are some constructions related to matization, which is by concept, etc., that permits or allows us to define a local symplectic loophole, a local symplectic space here. Here we can apply standard symplectic terminals and we have like a Poisson morphism that is possible to define analytically. And then we have some exact tubing that for any Poisson manifold and the dynamics, we can construct. For instance, a second. We can construct, for it's an second-order method that is preserving the Poisson structure to the order that you desire. Not exactly, because we only take an approximation of a map, analytical approximation of the map, and we can produce this problem that in principle, only in the case of deposon cases or whatever, yeah, it's possible to to define that for quadratic, etcetera, or even for non-canonical sympathetic to force, it's also, in my opinion, I don't know, it's a it's an open question in It's an open question in in such for non-canonical sympathetic form because there are rule chains of coordinates in principle, it's not easy to find. But in the case of Poisson manifold, it's possible to derive. Okay, and this one, this is like an example, but it's possible that this part is magnetic integration, and we can define all these situations of the two different problems. We don't have time to talk about optimal control problem, but optimal control problem is also defined in Control problem is also defined in terms of a generating function, and the generative function is defined defined automatically as a variance of many faults, a problem can produce the dynamics. Dirac, many false, etc. Well, this is my the end. This is other topics that I commented also with Eric during the talk that I am interested in this accelerated optimization, which is also related with this manifold, and even in Riemannia, many folds. This is also. Manifolds. This is also what this application of method when we have initial, not initial condition, initial and final condition, and we want to know the solution or the minimum, for instance, for an optimal control problem, and we have an application to an abigolation problem. That is interesting. Also, other topics, but they are not related in principle with a topic of this type. This is only possible integrators. And this is one of the topics that. And this is one of the topics that I continually thinking of this kind of non-horron dynamics, which is non-virational. And then it's possible to apply the same technique. I can produce a sub-manifold and apply the retraction or whatever, but the sum manifold is not a random. We can produce methods in this way, but what are the properties that we are verifying there? And this is something that is very working on this. And with metric metric, it's another kind of dynamics which. Is another kind of dynamics which is a mixture of Poisson and Riemannian, semi-Riemannian structures that is very useful in the case of thermodynamics when you have preservation of energy and the growth of the entropy of the system. And this is also interesting even to use in this case not this method, but to use uh discrete cardinal methods for for this. I'm sorry, thank you very much for your your question faster. Give a question. Okay, questions. Let me kick off. There is one issue that always slightly bothers me in mechanics. So, mathematical analysis of PDEs is based very much on weak formulations. And once you are living in the And once you are living in the Lagrangian world, you have weak formulation, it is natural. And here, once you are moving to the Eulerian world, the Eulerian world, somehow you are losing the weight from the need to do everything in a much higher form of So is there any way of doing everything in a week four? Using this time. Using this, uh I like to explore now to have this week. I'm going to I I am using not very restrictive conditions, of course, many presentations here. And I use this topic that I started to work on two years ago. But this is quite interesting. There are many things, also the field theories, how to semi-discretize how to find these techniques also. Okay, another question. So at the end of the talk, designing geometric methods on the code and boundary and so on. Can you do it with methods that reserve volume? This is the work by Antonio, Sana, etc. They have this study. But it's here with the simplicity, we have presentation of what you are thinking method continuous. Method, continuous system that are preserving the volume, but they are not preserving the. Also, this is interesting also in non-colonial mechanics. There are systems that are preserving volume, but are not variation at all, they are not synthetic in any case. But this is something that would like to discuss: that it's possible, how to it's possible to adapt these ideas to the case of bio generators. But there's some what's the reference that we are thinking in Antonella, I think, that have some. There are some methods, there is a method of macroclub and QISP does it and so on, but in a very different way. And do you think that that is possible? This is something that... Because you cannot do it with standards. Thank you very much for the presentation. Uh I have one question. Is it possible to extend the consideration I mean you're using this like random consideration, right? This is the This lagrinium consideration, but this is the root of everything. So, could you extend the consideration to classical fields, like the I don't know, electromagnetic field, for example, or simplification of web? Yes, for the moment we are working in the case when we have situations that we have space and time separately, but we can semi-discretize question maintaining the Laura Next structure, of course. The learning structure and that would be theory and also semi-discrete system. And then we can apply this activities as it is. But also it's possible there is an observation one by Francois Lauren, etc. discretizing discretion with these integrators. Probably the returns are clear. But this is the for the moment the simple way to escape is to seem the discrete action as possible. This is, we are working in the case of non-vary conditions. This is more important for that. We are working with that. And then we have some problems for convergence of the practice. Very interesting to study. Thank you for your talk. Are there extensions to this method to do that? I don't have this but there is some some work of work. I think the description is also at the continuous phase using data that like a method. Yeah, yeah, I'm the method. This is made by on other Ortega and Papers and I think that also by I think that also this topic. And then is how to interpret the discretization of this in in this with using this aspect. But my my idea here is using the to have the method of yes in the research work. method that yes in the research well-known methods, but also to say well the same technique that you are using, it also applied to other situations and this exactly, you are not doing exactly the same steps that's quite simple to obviously. Mathematical example that perhaps is not there, I know that there are some pages about uh Rattle method for Linggroups and this is a special paper that devoted to this. Here is a one this is Yeah, it's but this is applied to this particular subject. This is this is quite interesting topic. This is I know my colleagues all that I can say that you need to move to this to test. And this is a advice. Okay, so I'm sorry for this TQTT structure. Thank you again. It was really lovely.
