Okay, so I will talk about one of my favorite problems that I talked about at the brewery yesterday a little bit called the singularity conjecture and it has to do with the harmonic measures for random walks on Fuchsting routes. So and then I'll tell you a little bit about the more recent developments. So okay, so let's start. So let's start with a space that all of you are familiar with, which is Are familiar with which is the unit disk, and then if you have the boundary on the unit disk, again, there are many, many notions of boundary, but whatever notion of boundary you have, it better be that the boundary of the unit disk is the circle. So, for instance, the topological boundary, if you want, there are other notions. So, and we, of course, we also know that the unit disk from a geometric point of view. The unit disk, from a geometric point of view, carries a metric, has a hyperbolic metric of constant negative curvature, also known as a probability metric. Okay, so yeah, there's a little feedback. I'll follow up myself a little. So, first of all, so what are the measures that are naturally supported on the boundary of the disk? Well, there's one measure. Well, there's one measure that we all know, which is the Lebesgue measure, of course. Maybe let's denote this by lambda. So what is a nice property of the Lebesgue measure? Why is it nice? Yeah, the fact that it's rotational invariant is really nice. So it has a really good big group of automorphisms. Group of automorphisms. So, this measure is geometric in men. There's also, if you're more into probability, there's other reasons why the Lobeck measure is kind of nice. And for instance, one thing we could do is you can start at the center of the disk and you can run a Brownian motion, which is defined with respect to this hyperbolic funky energy. So, this means you run a stochastic process. This means you run a stochastic process with some complicated differential equation that I don't know very well, so I will not write down. But there is a notion of Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold, and it so happens that if you do it on a conquering disk, you will have some paths, but these paths eventually will converge to the boundary of the disk. So you could pick another path. And so it turns out that by just by the symmetry. Out that just by the symmetry of the problem, if you start at the center, there is this rotational invariance, and the SD that you would write also has this rotational invariance. So it turns out that in the end, the heated measure that you get on the boundary will also be invariant, so it will be the battery. So this will mean that this is also a heated measure for Brown and Bush. And in general, well, you have other if you, yeah, in general, negative the cut benefit, maybe the Gorman parabolic space or cut minus one space, things like this, you can also have a Patterson-Sullivan measure, which is also a geometric measure that is somehow a further generalization of this picture when you have a group actually. Picture when you have a group action. So I'll say a few more words there later. So what are the other types of measures that we care about? Well, we care about harmonic measures for random walls or heating measures for random walls. And I'll explain what that is. This is a discrete version in the sense. Discrete version in the sense of this Duranian motion. And so, what do you do? Well, we know that the group of automorphisms, so the group of isometries, the orientation-preserving isometries of the disk, what group is this? Maybe the disk model is a bit hard to say, but in a hyperbolic plane model, we all know. What group is this? Yeah, it's various transformation, so it's PSL to R. So this is just a group of two by two matrices, basically, nicely grouped. And then what you could do, of course, we know that we have interesting discrete subgroups inside here, or even non-discrete subgroups. So, but countable subgroups inside here. So you could have some gamma, which Could have some gamma, which is a countable subgroup of this, and those they act on the disk and they have some interesting dynamics. So the construction of random walks on Foxy Roses is just like this. So you fix a measure, fix measure probability measure mu on PSL2R, basically, on let's call it SL2R from now on. It SO2R from now on with countable support. You can do more general, but I will only consider countable support, so discrete versions. And then what do you do? Well, you draw a sequence of elements. So you draw a sequence of elements G1, G2, G3, like that. Like that. It's a sequence of elements of the group. So each GI is an element of the group, and each of them are drawn independently of each other. And they all have the same law, which is so this is ID. And then, okay, this is a kind of boring thing, but what we really care about, we consider the product. We really care about we consider the product g1 g2. In fact, Fustenberg, who started more or less this field of math, wrote the famous paper, non-commuting random pumps. So you can think of the normal, you know, the classical probability theory as doing random walks on R. You take a random variables and you sum them. And you sum them, and then you want to know central limit theory, and everything is like this. And here we have a group of matrices, so it's a non-commutative group, of course, and you compose this random. And so this is a, of course, this choice depends from the, it's a random, random choice. It's on the sequence. So the sequence W n is called sample. It's called assemble path. And yeah, so for what's an example, what does it mean? So if you're not, I mean, in this audience, maybe you should be familiar with, you know, IID random elements, but very concretely, for instance, what you could do? Well, you could say you can fix a generating set. So you fix some. So you fix some number of elements as one as k, so generators of some gamma, which is some books and group from some discrete subgroup, for instance. And then you pick each of them with equal probability, for instance. So in that case, you would call μ, you would write μ to be 1 over k, the sum. One over k, the sum of the delta masses as s now. You have a box with k generators, and you draw one, and you call this g1, g2, or blah, blah, blah. And you put it back in the box, and you draw G2 and so forth. Okay, and so what you're interested in is, of course, is the asymptotic properties of this. Properties of this of this and also where we where we can do the random work on the group, but also the group acts on this geometric space. So, what we often do is we look at what happens when we take this random group element and we make it act on our element. And so, you get some picture like this. So, you start with a oh, base point, then you're going to have. Base point, then you're going to have W1O, W2O, W3O, and so forth. Is it clear that you close to the boundary? Sorry? Is it clear they get closer to the boundary? Well, that's a non-trivial statement that I will take immediately. Yeah, so exactly. And in fact, if you do it, if your group is like z squared, for instance, then the random work would be recurrent. So this is going to be different. So, this is going to be different. But in our situation, we have this hyperbolicity, hyperbolic metric. And so, in this negative curvature setting, indeed, the random walk will converge almost surely to the boundary. And this is a fundamental lemma of Firstenberg. I can go here. So, Firstenberg says the following. So, another important object. Object would be gamma of mu is the group generated by the support of mu. So if gamma of mu contains two independent laxodromic elements or hyperbolic elements, which say hyperbolic because it's just matrices, so the trace has to be normally bigger than two. And independent. And independent means that the fixed points are destroyed. So you have a hyperbolic element that has two fixed points. So this is one of them. And you have another one when it has, at least somewhere inside the group, you have to have this picture. Of course, you will have more stuff, but then for every point inside disk and for every disk and for every for almost random sequence the limit exists let's call it xi exists and it's a point on the boundary again this is not obvious that we already put accumulate inside something like this but this doesn't it's i need that the picture is pretty similar to The picture is pretty similar to what I was saying before: that, like, you have a discrete version of this Brownian motion, which is red wall. Hold on, thank you. So, if you do random development systems, you would typically pick the start of the point, randomly apply these elements. Yeah. He was doing the opposite order. Yeah, so this is not the model process on the, it's almost. It's our macro process on the group, however, this is the choice that for which the whole theory works, otherwise, you don't even have this convergent at. So, in fact, from the time of person, everybody did it in this way, even though the first time you see it, it seems like you're doing this thing in the wrong way. Yes. So, okay, so now we can define the main character, which is this harmonic. Main character, which is this harmonic measure or heating measure. So, the heated measure, let me call heat and measure. So, which depends on this choice of measure mu, so mu mu is the probability of hitting a particular subset of the boundary. So, it's a measure. Is a measure is in is a yeah, so is a probability measure on the boundary or of the disk or the space that we are looking at. So yeah, so it's just literally that you take subset that and you ask this should be pretty basic, but uh there any questions about the setup? Is it obvious that it's independent of all? Is it obvious that it's independent of all indeed? It is not completely obvious, but almost obvious, because what happens is that if you pick another point O prime, the trajectory of O at O prime will have bounded distance. So the next trajectory will have bounded hyperbolic distance. And if you have two sequences that have this bounded hyperbolic distance and they go to infinity, then they converge to the same body. Again, this is a feature of the hyperbolic. Again, this is a feature of the hyperbolic. Of course, today I'm just going to work with the most hyperbolic example, which is the disk, because as you will see, there are still open problems. But there's a huge, huge research about generalizing this to zero spaces and all sorts of Higgins space and all sorts of other spaces that are not quite hyperbolic, but are kind of hyperbolic and so forth. But today I will just focus just on the other. Today, I will just focus just on the actual constant coverage case, but you know, okay, and so and also that the other the other interesting remark and the reason why we call it harmonic measure is that mu mu is harmonic or sometimes called mu stationary means it's not invariant because so usually this group generated by the support is a non-amenable group. By the support, it's a non-amenable group, so there would be no invariant measures. But there's a measure which is invariant on average, and that's the stationarity harmonicity. So it means that you start with the measure. You start with this measure, and you push it forward by your generators. So you have G star, and then you average over all possible generators using this. possible generators using this this this measure here. So you have mu of g like that and this one is the same measure. So in fact actually just existence of a harmonic measure is a much simpler statement than the convergence result. Because existence, if you have a nice proper space like this, you look at the boundary and the measures on the boundary and you can apply just a fixed point. The boundary, and you can apply just a fixed-point theorem by compactness. That's a sum, but it could be more than one, and so forth. But in real situations where we have the convergence to the boundary, then you show that, okay, this hitting measure is harmonic, and then every harmonic measure has to be the hitting measure in this rank one hyperbolic situation. And rank higher rank is more complicated. Okay, so what is the main question? So, again, so this is a So, again, so this is a fairly new mu, but again, very, very importantly, this mu can change, and different things can happen if we change mu. So, the general question is: what can you say about new humor? This is even more general. So, the general question is, for instance, can mu mu be equal, for instance, to a geometric measure. In this case, for instance, we have a bad measure. Or maybe you want to weaken it to say, can it be absolutely continuous? Continuous. Or maybe the dimension maybe is the same. Can the dimension of this be equal to the dimension of geometric measure? Again, in general, you have a more general notion of what the geometric measure could be. You mean geometric by alpha or something else? Well, for instance, Patterson-Sullivan, Patterson-Sullivan, yeah. For instance, I mean, it measures that don't. Yeah, for instance, I mean, measures that don't depend on a random process of a group, but rather on ambient countries. Okay, and so this question has various, so you'll see the history because, okay, the first American that again started the whole story already solved this question in some sense in the maybe 60s or 70s. The 70s and he proved the following. So, for any lattice gamma in PSL2R, then okay, there are generalizations to others and simple equips, but I'm not going to go into that today. So, for any lattice gamma in PSLR, there exists a measure mu such that Such that indeed, such that mu mu equals but on and out, sushi. So it seems like, okay, the problem is over. That's it. So of course, this is a very fantastic theorem. And in fact, it's the first step to all this super-rigidity story that maybe some of you are familiar with, because you want to understand something about the manifold. The manifold and its boundary, and you want to, for instance, you want to know whether a certain abstract group can be embedded as a group of isometries of certain manifold. And the way you pass from the manifold to the group, one way is to construct such measure on the group that somehow still reconstructs the geometric structure on the boundary. So, this was a very, very, you know, problem. You know, profitable line of research, but we kind of want to go the opposite direction. So, so, so, what is the sort of drawback of this? So, the construction, so the, however, this construction has somehow this problem that mu is constructed, mu is constructed by a discretization of this Brownian motion. And as a result of that, so somehow the idea is you have your ground in motion, you fix fundamental domain for your group action. And then somehow, you know, you look at the tile and the tessellation, and you wait until the burner motion hits this tile, and more or less, you assign to this tile the weight. Assigned to this style the weight given by the probability of hitting this tile plus. This is not exact because, well, you have to repeat this argument inductively and show that indeed this procedure converges, but this is more or less. And in fact, this was written even more in much generality by first by Malinus and Sullivan, later this more general theorem of Malinus and Sullivan, where they Where they use the discretization of boundaries. So, in this case, what is not nice though is that this is not. So, the support of mu, by very nature of this construction, well, the support of mu is infinite. So, this measure has some tail. You have to have infinitely many generators to do this. I mean, the group can definitely generate, but you have to pick an infinite subset. Subset. So is Mew unique? It's a very good question. I don't think so. Because you square, yeah, sure. Okay, yeah, you could always do something. Yeah, sure. No, no, you're right. You can take a convolution of you with itself, and it will have the same error. But yeah, this is a good question, but I don't. Question, but uh, I don't think in principle it would be because I think you have certain degrees of freedom when you do this construction. The other question, okay. So, what about what for facts? So, the second question, so this is Q1, Q2 is what for finitely supported measure, because you know, this is what we have in mind when you play coin toss or something. Now there's this new field of like you know random geometric topology, probabilistic approaches to geometrical theory, for instance. And in those fields, people really like this simple case where you pick your generators and you run the simulation on a computer and you want to know properties of these random group elements. And so this is very useful. Very, very useful. I mean, this is this sensible hypothesis here. Well, so here there was a conjecture, but okay, so there's more drama coming. So the original conjecture, so there's a whole conjecture, in fact, which goes back probably to the 80s. And on the one side, there's people like Givas in France, and also in the former Soviet Union, people like The Soviet Union, people like Vershik, Makaro, Kaimanovich, they already were thinking about this in the 80s. But it's not, it's hard to find what was the earliest written account of this. But definitely this is written by Khaimanovich and the prince in much later. I think the paper in the end is 2011, but okay, maybe it still took a little to get published, but still it's from the 2000s. And the way it's written here is a follow-up. And the way it's written here is is the following that every so every so for every for any for any finitely supported mu on SL in fact even SLDR for any d then the measure on the boundary you have the flux wave it's a bit more complicated but you can think Bit more complicated, but you can think about that. So mu mu is singular. Yeah, with respect to the geometric measure. This is always. Oh, can you still see it here or is it too low? Beating low. Yeah, yeah. I will not write below that, but I was. Yeah, that line, the last line you wrote was like, hi. Okay, okay, I'll go low. Right. So, so the conjecture is basically you can never do this. So, so far. However, it turns out that I think there's a little bit of a cultural problem. So, what people like Herman Homic and their students were thinking about was definitely discrete groups. But if you go away from discrete groups, then this conjecture is false. This conjecture is false. I have a question about this. So if you think of generating we have the whole sequence would be a full shift. Yes. It seems you have to put a very new measure. You could go other invariant measures and get, you know, maybe then you shouldn't expect the hitting measure to be similar. Correct. Or the measure that. Correct. Or the measure that I'm trying to understand why we focus on Bernoulli methods. Increments are independent by, I don't know, this is what people do usually, like in probability, like increments are independent of each other. But yeah, of course, you could have a share. you could you could uh you could have a shift of paratype or something and try to be the same of course again so that the measure of the spatial increments is is the product measure yeah yeah about given measure on the stick like we have the full stick to generator then we expect the heating measure for any compiler to be in no no no Could be in no novel way. Only could be in yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. In the context images, the movie should go for sure. I don't yeah. I don't think anyone has as well. What do you mean, maximum should be there? It's not a uniform measure now. It's not a uniform measure for sure. No, he measures five minutes generated. Yes. Yes. Yes. So and then you take it on the video. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Which one can take? Oh, no one in this statement because the support is infinite. So maybe you say, okay, is there a potential such that this is true? So this is a measure. No, yeah, in this construction, you fix a, yeah, you have a countable set, you fix some weights. You pick some weights for this countable, and then you take the Bernoulli measure on this potential of the more questions. You're disappointed. We don't know if that we should be familiar with. I think you can. I think it should be possible. If you relax the Bernoulli assumption, I think it should be possible to get longer. Yeah, yeah, no, it should be possible to be honest, because then you have a way, way, way, way, more. Maybe I can make a comment about this. Every known method of producing a major and new and that's what the issue is essentially goes back to those players, the average increase. The average increase, I think there'll be some, but it only gives us a lot of measurements, and it's all basically like some careful geometric airlines. So like regions of the factory, easy away. I think the really selective part of this man was exhaustive in a sense, it wouldn't be we know, but it doesn't forward forward. Okay, very good. So let me Okay, very good. So let me finally. Yeah, so however, this conjecture, the way it's formulated, is too general. It's false. So we have to fix it. So because there's the following results, there's two different papers, one by Bougain, and about 12 or something, and then there's this paper by Barani, Holykot, and Shimon, where they do produce examples. Example also around the same time, I think. And there exists what? Our paper is earlier than Monday. Okay. What years? Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah. The fact was at least two years. Yeah. Oh, really? Okay. Okay, anyways. So there exists. Yeah, so there exists finally supported. exists finally supported supported mu on SL2R such that mu is absolutely continuous. Now we're not gonna care too much whether it's on the nose of the bag or is absolutely continuous. I mean but in any case this exists however there This exists. However, there is another issue here: is that if you look at the group generated by this, so if you look at gamma mu in this case, which is the group generated by the support, well, so the measure, you have a finite stack of matrices somehow, which you find through some somewhat complicated procedure, but then basically when you when you take the group generated by them, those group will be indiscreet. Those groups would be indiscreet, so it's not so. In a way, there is no geometry in this case because you cannot take the quotient of your S1 to R by this group and get a nice molecule. And I think this probably was the original meaning of this conjecture. So I will, so we can fix it. Fix it and is the following. So for any finally supported mu such that this group generated by this is discrete yeah new mu is So this is the So, this is the this is indeed the singularity conjecture. And at this level of generality, it is still. And I will discuss what is known. There's one big subcase where it's known, and for the other case, we made some progress, and I'll tell you what the progress is. But in this level of generality, because here you really want to. Generality because here you really want to fix any possible generating set. So you have a bookshelf and group here, and you're really free to choose any generating set. And then you have a lot of freedom. And as we will see, it becomes pretty hard to control what happens. Further questions or yeah. Complaints are the known examples, but the measure is singular, but it's how the dimension is poor, the dimension of lambda. No. No, I will tell you. No, you don't know. It's not true. It can't happen. Can happen. Yeah, I'll show you. That's the thing. That's the theorem. Yeah, exactly. So, okay. Okay, so okay, so now we have basically two cases which are quite different from each other. So, but since this is a But since this is supposed to be a semi-talk, I want to talk about so there are two main cases. So one is you take H mod gamma mu and this is not compact. And the second case is when you take the quotient and this is compact. And this is a quotient in this case is a hyperbolic manifold or orifold at least, so it is kind of nice, but okay, I probably cannot write very much about it because of the screens. And these two cases have a very different flavor. So there's also a third case, so to speak, because if gallery is discrete, well, the curve volume could be finite or infinite. Co-volume could be finite or infinite. So let me add a remark here, which is also an interesting case, but we will sort of. So if the volume, yeah, if the volume of H of gamma mu is infinite, so in this case, then the limit set of gamma mu is strictly strictly contained, it's not equal to the circular. Maybe it would sorry. So, so in this case, it's of course on the nose that the conjecture cannot be true because the harmonic measure is supported on this smaller Lieben set. He still makes sense to compare the harmonic measure on the next best guess, which would be, for instance, the half-off measure on the appropriate dimension. Yeah. Mention. Yeah. So, in fact, there's a recent paper by Lessa and Garcia where they make some good progress here. And in fact, these guys do thermodynamic formalism. So if gamma mu is a Schottky group, meaning it's a free group generated by two large body translations. Yeah, and there are some other technical assumptions, but, anyways, there's some nice examples. But, anyways, there's some nice examples where the fundamental domain looks like this. So, the limit set is canto. And for some nice mu, so okay, I don't want to, for some mu's, there's some condition here, then they proved indeed that the dimension of the harmonic measure here is strictly less than, yeah, the say the half-the dimension. The say the half the dimension of the limit set. So I don't think it's fundamental set. So the limit set is, you know, you take a point, you take its orbit, you take the closure of its orbit. So there is nice focus here. And in fact, it's particularly nice because this is using some thermodynamic formulas, like our method doesn't. But in fact, I think, but here it's nicer because there's a free group. Here it's nicer because there's a free group, so the coding is extremely simple. And so that helps a lot machine. So, in fact, it's a good direction to go into like trying to extend this method to the, say, for instance, called compact case. Okay, so in a non-compact case, what happens? So, so if it's finite volume, then the limit set is indeed as one. So, so it becomes harder. So, okay, there's two cases. So, okay, there's two cases. So, when you have a non-compact manifold, a finite volume looks more or less like this. It has this famous cusp. While in the second case, of course, something like this. The colours have a body. So, it turns out that in this case, is the conjecture is true. And this, there's different levels of generalities in which this can be improved. And I will show you what our approach was. And I will show you what our approach was, but I mean, basically, there were earlier approaches that would more or less give you this. And the reason why this is true is because of this cusp. And I'll show you what is the role of the dynamics of, for instance, of the geodesic flow in the cusp here, would help a lot here. But this method that is nice in this case completely fails in the compound case because there is no cusp whatsoever, of course. Because there is no casp whatsoever, of course, and so you cannot really use it at all. Okay, so let's look a little bit at the non-cocompact case. In particular, maybe everybody's favorite subgroup of SO2R is SO2Z, I think. So let's maybe fix our attention on that because this is. This is the one that also has, of course, relations with continued fractions and stuff. So it's much easier to explain what happens in this case, even though we know it in general. So for S and 2Z, so we have the famous ferrite oscillation or some variation thereof, like you take the line from zero to infinity and you look at its image. Image, you get this oscillation and hydrographic triangles. And the beggar case is to consider is, and then you have these two matrices that we call R and L. And so, for just as a toy example, let's look at what happens if we do random walk on the Do a random walk on the semi-group generated by these two things. And so here we take mu just one half r plus one half. In general, it's more complicated, but this gives you a sense why definitely this conjecture should true. So we know that we have a coding for the geodesic flow in terms of this finite oscillation. And in particular, what happens is, okay, we can normalize. What happens is, okay, we can normalize a little bit. So, for instance, let's look at all only the interval from zero to one. So we take a geodesic that ends up somewhere like here. And we have a cutting sequence which tells you whether the geodesic cuts, this is a hyperbolic triangle. So we could cut the hyperbolic. So it could cut the hyperbolic so the G add essay cuts the hyperbolic triangle going to the right or to the left and in this case it's R even though maybe then I should change the name from R and L anyway so or you can you can cut it like this go go there you go I think maybe we should change the name yeah And so it's well known by the series coding and like this: that if you pick an endpoint, psi, and you look at the geodesic flow and you look at the caddy sequences, you can write psi in a continued fraction. For instance, in the usual like regular continued fraction like that. And then we know that the cutting sequence is, you can read its coefficients from the cutting sequence. So the cutting sequence here would be, for instance, I think maybe it's L A one fines or A two times. Like, this is how I got it. I started in this field because I had worked a lot on continued instructions, and then this was kind of a problem that has something to do, at least in this particular case, and in general, it does nothing to be curved. So, what is the red curve there? What is the red curve there? You have a it's a geodesic that converges to psi. It doesn't depend on where it comes from. Well, if it comes from far, yeah, so if it comes from far enough, basically. Far enough, basically. Yeah, so there's some normalization. Maybe, maybe, I think maybe it's enough that this point is below minus one. Yeah, from here on, because the geodesics sort of converged to each other. So if you go to the other side, then we can have that. Yeah. And so you see, so what happens if we do this type of. Of discussion, we can see already that there's a huge difference between the harmonic measure and the Lebesgue measure. Because here, if you look at the Lebesgue measure of just, for instance, the set from zero to one over k, for instance, well, of course, this is one over k, nothing to say. But if you look at the harmonic measure of Of the subset of the interval, well, how do you get there? Well, basically, you have to do L K times. And then you can do a better interval. So this is, yeah, so this is the probability that, yeah, you have, yeah, so the, so cutting sequences, cutting sequences starts with L to the K. And so this is. L to the k and so this is basically two to the minus we should think of the cutting is equal to minus yeah it is yeah yeah i i called l and r exactly yeah exactly yeah sorry so you're you're gonna go towards psi when you when you do your your walk in the l r bonaway correct that's right All right. Yeah, that's okay. That's yeah, sorry, yeah, I guess it wasn't completely easy. Yeah, yeah, the cutting sequence is the one from here. Yeah, I have it from here. Okay, this is just to show how to do it sort of very, very completely. But so as you see already, there's a discrepancy. So there's a polynomial decay here, an exponential decay. The k here and exponential the k here. Now, these two things are very, very far from each other. If we do the other case, they will both be exponential. And so that already is a really is a telltale that well, yeah, that shows why the uncle path case is way hot. So, how do you so let me let me tell you what our actual result is here so So and we can so the the actual the actual general theorem so so this this this case in for SLTC and yeah so this this this the approach is is basically due to Givage Lejeune from quite a bit of time ago like I don't know 08 or something even even earlier I think 1990 1919 yeah 1999 yeah okay anyways I think Thanks, Mark. Yeah, okay. Anyways, I forgot exactly. Maybe the 90s. No. So, the approach is you need to look at the this this cutting secret has something to do with the winding of the geodesic flow in this hyperbolic manifold. If you want to do it in general, you have to, in a geometric fashion, you have to do that way. And then, okay, then there's other people that studied this problem like. This, this, this problem like the run, clutch chain, and ours. Let me put these names here because and then La Sher-Sinsky Mature that we will mention later for another reason. So, there are so these are possible approaches to this problem. So, the most general one is the one we We proved a few years ago with Joseph and Flaiba, which is the following. And so it just tells you a little, like really, it uses this geometry of this geodesic flow to prove the singularity conjecture in this non-compart case. This non-compo, non-compact case. So, the point is the following. So, we have to set, you have to define a few things. So, in general, so what do you want to do? So, you pick a point on the boundary. So, what does it mean that the measure is singular with respect to each other? Well, you have to say that if I pick a point randomly with respect to one measure, it's a second property. To one measure, it has a certain property, and if it picks the point randomly with respect to some other measure, it has a different property. So, now what is the property? Okay, so here what we do is we look at the geodesic from zero to the point. And so let's call it gamma of t. And then we have this group action. So we have a group gamma inside Sil to R, which is R. So to R, which is R. Let's call it, yeah, this is gamma mu. So this is a non-co-compact lattice. And anyways, it has, there's a lattice of points that are the orbit of zero. And we call gt the one which is closest to to galaxy. So so what do we do is the following. So we let let g t Let G T such that, so we given we're given a boundary point and we get, we call G t such that the distance between G T O and gamma t is the minimum one, so it's less than the distance between HO and gamma t for every h in yeah. There could be more than one choice, but okay, it's not really. And then we have two metrics. So the other thing we can do is we can fix a generating set. So you fix S, generating set. Find it. And we have the word metric. So the word metric of G is the minimum number of words, the length of the word that represents it. So the minimum K such that So the minimum k such that g can be written as s1 sk. Yeah, maybe the generating set is symmetric to make things easier. So okay, and so and then we look at the following quantity. So we do the following. So we let gamma, yeah, gamma in SL2 pi at non-so compact. Finite volume lattice and yes, and what do we do? We let mu such that gamma mu is gamma twice and it has some finite first moment, which is the following, the integral of g in the word magic. So g. G by it. So, this is the word magic. So, it's more general than just finitely supported, but it has a nice strong moment condition. In fact, first the burst counter example has finite first moment, but in the hyperbolic metric. So, this is a different addition. This is in a word metric, so this is a strong. Okay, and then define rho oxi as the limit. As the limit, st goes to infinity of the ratio of these two metrics. So g and t, right? So, so, so for sine in the boundary. So, again, what do we do? We look at point of the boundary. And in a way, what the idea is we look at this geodesic that goes there and And we look at the winding of the geodesic in the cusp, and we want to know how big is this winding. And a good way to measure how big is the winding is to compare these two things. Because this is the word metric, and this is the parameter, which is also the hydrobolic distance. Because in the cusp, like in this case, like this, if you think about it, If you think about it, if you go, if you do, you have a big extreme in the class, okay? So the word distance is like maybe n, because you have to go like that. But the hyperbolic distance is log n. Well, actually, I mean, the genetic is this one, but anyways, so the hyperbolic distance is log n. Well, if you count the number of fundamental domains that you cross is this n yeah, so this you can think of this word magic also. So, this you can think of this word magic also, the number of fundamental domains that you have to cross to go to beauty. And so the claim is that's the following, then there exists some C, touch that. So, first case is rogue side is infinite for Lebanese, almost every side. And the second one is, however. And the second one is, however, that rho oxide equals this C for the harmonic measure. So whenever you pick a generic point for the Lebesgue measure, the numerator is way, way bigger than the denominator. So the ratio goes infinity. And if you pick a random walk, so you look at the random, you look at the random walk. The runoff, you look at the runoff walk, you take the limiting point, and again you look at the geodesic. Then these two quantities are proportional. So the average is finite. So you're using this heuristic, wouldn't it actually benefit you if you don't have a finite volume? How do you have a finite volume? Yeah, it does benefit you. But why is it an assumption that you have a finite volume? Well, to prove it, you need to use, say, a God extinction. Is say ergodic, you know, an ergodic theorem on the unit tangent bundle. So, I mean, it makes sense to, but you know, the same thing even if the building is not fine. So, so I haven't thought about this. I'm pretty sure your result already only uses the existing over a parabolical thing. So, it's not changing now. Yeah, I think it should be a problem. I think it should be now. Maybe by Junior, but I think by a Liazzo. It could be not, but anyway, yeah. But it's somehow the other case is kind of different. Okay, so more questions, Andrew? Yes, it's a simple one. On your presentation there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, what I want to say is the following, maybe let me do a picture is like this. So, if you look at a geodacid, If you look at a geodesic, so if we count the number of fundamental domains that this geodesic crosses, this is n, but the geodesic from here to here, the actual hyperbolic geodesic, has to go up. And so the hyperbolic distance is of the order long n. Yeah, I think it would make more sense to write it like that. Yeah, okay. Now we have still what maybe one minute to look at this case, and I want to. To look at this case, and I want to show you that this result is extremely simple if you think of the continued fraction situation. And that's how it came up. That's what was the intuition that inspired us to do it like that. So, because so, again, if we are in this situation where we have psi. Where we have psi, which is this limiting point that has a object fraction expansion. Okay, let's say this is zero at the beginning. We forget about that. So we have something like this. So what do we know about so again, so the word length of this element would be basically is the sum of the coefficients. Is the sum of the coefficients up to certain points. But you're looking at again, you're looking at this fundamental domain. And you know, you can't, anytime you're crossing a domain, you in this dual treat, if you choose L and R. L and R. And so the total number of L's and R, so I just use this. And because of this graphics here, roughly the time, on the other hand, is more or less the sum of the logs. And now, why is this ratio? Well, now everybody here is an expert on the Gauss model. Here is an expert on Michael's mark. So, is this an exercise if you ask your ergonomic theory students? And I do actually some people took this one. Can I test that? So what's going on? So what's the statistics? What's the relevant, the relevant fact here? Well, so the relevant fact is that, so we know that the famous fact is that for almost every, for Lebesgue, almost every psi, if you look Almost every psi, if you look at the arithmetic average of the continued fraction coefficients divided by n. Well, this one goes to infinity. However, even more classical fact, but always amusing fact, is that the geometric mean of the product of these coefficients famously converges almost surely to some constant, which is the The inching. And why is that the case? Well, the reason is that the distribution of the coefficients has this one over k, the case. So the probability that A1 is k is roughly 1 over k squared. And so famously, if you do the expectation of A1, which should be, by the Gaudic theorem, should be this limit. Gardic theorem should be this limit. Well, this is the sum of k over k squared, which is infinite. On the other hand, if you do the log of them, then it's fine. So the expectation of log a1 is the sum of log k over k squared, which is fine. So, as a corollary, you can immediately see that if you want to do a1 plus an divided by log A1 plus log AN. So, this is the word metric basically. This is basically fine because this goes to infinity. Lebesgue almost surely. Lebesgue almost surely. Pretty good exercise. And geometrically, you have to look at the geodesic flow and this manifold and ergodicity and basically apply an ergodic theorem. And you look at the observable, which is kind of similar to this one. And well, if you do the for the harmonic measure, on the other hand, everything is exponential fail, so everything is summary. Everything is summary, okay? So, this is the first part. Uh, maybe any questions? Can you see the red one? Maybe I can use another color. Well, it's a similar idea. I mean, it's like you look at this geodesic that goes in the cusp and you construct a function that explodes in the cusp. Classical kind of Margulish function type of thing, and then you take the Birkhoff average of the Geodesy flow along that function, and that also diverges. So the hard part is not, the intuition is very, very clear. The hard part is that you do it twice, you do this thing twice. So you have to do the same procedure with both measures. And you have to find some object that is stable enough that. enough that you can indeed compute or estimate in both situations. So in the other case for the random walk, for instance, the hard part is that the random walk is not along the geodesic, the random walk is something, but then you have to use some result that tells you that, okay, the random walk is not so far from the geodesic, you can, and then you can still do the average, and it's the same overage. Okay, very good. So in the interest of So, in the interest of talking about the more recent stuff, so this is the old in some sense. So, the new part is a co-compact case. So, the co-compact case is much harder because, as you see, there is really no cost and there is no discrepancy between this polynomial behavior and exponential decay. In fact, whatever type of shadow lemmas that you're trying to prove. Shadow lemmas that you're trying to prove, or things like this, the k will always be exponential for both measures. And so that's much much cheaper. Okay, so what is that? So what color do you prefer? Red. Red is good? Yeah. Okay, because yesterday I didn't like the red very much, but okay. So maybe why do you even Why do you even expect the hitting method to be similar in that case? Yeah, exactly. Well, I mean, again, what I say is a bit is a bit, you know, heuristic. I mean, yeah, it's not completely clear that it should be true, I agree. But the point is, what happens is you have this approximation, this Brownian motion approximation, where you're taking this limit. On the other hand, here you have to make a choice, the first. Here you have to make a choice at the first step. And then, this choice that you make at the first step, precisely because it's Bernoulli, you have to do it forever. It's like this approximation that you do at the first step, you're not going to change it. And so basically, what seems to be the case is that this, yeah, this forces you, yeah, you can never recover this error that you did in the first time. If you allow the nombernoulli case, You allow the number Noulli case, you can correct later on. So you make a mistake now, and I can correct in a million years. But the problem is, if I correct in a million years, I have to correct in the two million years as well, and in three million years. And that's a problem. So anyways, so that seems to be the case, anyways. So I'll give you more more. Once we know what we know, we have even a stronger case for the congestion. So, okay. So, very so, what are the important characters here? So, there are these numerical invariants for numerical characteristics of random walks. Some of them have been mentioned before already. So, the first one is the entropy. So, what is the entropy? Well, if you have a measure, we all know. Well, if you have a measure, we all know this. So, we have just a measure. The entropy of a measure is the sum of minus mu of g log mu g. This is classical definition. This is not dynamical. So what we want is we want to consider n step of the round walk. So the definition of h mu is the limit as n goes to infinity of h of mu n. h of mu n divided by n. So what is mu n? Mu n is the convolution of mu with itself. So mu n is yeah, so it's just the following. So mu n of g is the probability that the n step of the walk equals g. So instead of looking at one step of the walk, I'll look at n steps, and the entropy will increase linearly. And the question is, what's the coefficient? And the question is: what's the coefficient? So, this is uh, it's this is only dependent on the measure, there is no geometry of the hyperbolic plane. Yeah, yeah. So, mu is a measure on the group of groups. Yeah, yeah, mu is a measure on gamma, which is a subgroup of also to arch. So, part of you is countable in this definition. Otherwise, you have to replace with integral, which I guess you could. And of course, yeah, we want this to be finite. Even of course, if the subscript is finite, everything is finite. And in general, it's not always true, of course, but this has to be finite. Okay. And then there is the volume growth, which is purely geometric. Your metric of the volume growth is called V, it's just the thing someone maybe Nima mentioned it before, or Ben, I forgot. So, one over n, the log of the number of group elements that move the base point at most n. So, this is just a growth rate of balls with respect to the group of n. And this is perfect, only geometric. Is perfect only geometric, there's no probability. And the last object is the drift, which is mixing the geometry and the probability. Let's call it L. And this is just the following. So it's just the limit of just the speed, literally the speed of the random walk. And this exists almost surely. It's the same number almost surely. So you take a random path and you look at the distance. If there is some If there is some finite first moment, okay. Just about it regarding. Okay, and now, first of all, we have an inequality, which is pretty simple, in fact, but somehow interesting. And this inequality indeed was called fundamental by Guibarsh, so that's why. Fundamental by Guvars. So that's why it became even more interesting. So this has been introduced by, sorry, it was introduced by Gemar, sorry. And then later by Mershik, he imposed the question that I'm going to tell you later. And this, then he called it the functional inequality. So the inequality is pretty simple. It's just that L is less or equal. L is less or equal, then h is less or equal than l times v. This is just a convexity inequality, like just a Jensen type of inequality. As long as the quantities are finite, you apply basically Jensen's inequality and you get this. Now, what is the much bigger question, which again came from Vershik, is that Is that under which conditions is this an equality? Yes. Equality. And indeed, it turns out that it's very nice the fact that this problem, which also has its history, and the singularity problem. And the singularity problem are equivalent. And so there's this very fundamental theorem of Blashier-Lasinskian material that we will really use a lot in our recent work is that, first of all, these two problems are equivalent, and in fact, even more. So let's say that let gamma act compactly. On yeah, we can do it in various slightly different generalization, but let's say in a proper geodesic magic space X and in that case, it's geodesic and the action is co-copact. So let's let gamma, okay, and hyperbolic, let's gap let gamma is a hyperbolic group. The gamma is a hyperbolic group. So X also is a hyperbolic metric space. So they're quasis of metric to each other. And then we let yeah, so let, let's say lambda be the. Let's say lambda be the Hausdorff measure of dimension equals the dimension of the boundary vector. So so because X as a metric structure, this is a hyperbolic space in the sense of Blomov. So it has in our case we're gonna just look at the disk so we can forget about this, but maybe. So, we can forget about this, but maybe it's a bit nicer to do it in the generality. So, then the following, and then, okay, and then mu a measure which is nice, for instance, mu with a finite two per exponential moment. Okay. Okay, let's say finite support for the simplicity of the talk, but it could be a bit bit more general. But still, it has to have a pretty strong moment condition. So, then the following. So then the following are equivalent, which I think is really nice. So the first one is that indeed μ is absolutely continuous to lambda. The second is that the house of dimension are the same. So that the house of dimension The half-develop dimension of is the same as the half-developed dimension of lambda. So, in this situation, the dimension gap is equivalent to being absolutely continuous. In a co-compact case, so okay, in the non-co-compact, it will be consumed. And then the third is that H equals Lb. And the third one, which is the strongest, and I will just wait, is that There is another metric which is this green metric. So the green metric minus V the hyperbolic metric, the metric on X are bounded up to an additive constant. So to say that there exists some C such that for any G, you have, you have. Have, you have. And so, so you see, so what is this? This is a so-called green metric that I will define over here, which is a metric which only comes from the probability. So, the green metric is the following: so, d mu of 1g, for instance, one is the identity is. instance one is the identity is the minus log of the probability that at some point there exists some part of the log that reaches g so this is a very of course probability from zero to one if you do minus log it's from zero to infinity so it's like a metric and it's not hard to prove it satisfies the triangle inequality And could be a pseudometric, but the ingrists of control situations. So you see what happened. So, okay, so the property, first of all, property which is interesting is that d mu is always possessed to the word metric. So for this, say if I So, for this, uh, say final support. So, what is it? And the quasi and the one magic, if you have a co-compact action on the group, is quasi isometric to the metric on the ambient space. So, which is which is quasi isometric to the distance on this ambient space x, which in this case is the distance. So, what does it mean? So, what does it mean? That there exists some other C, C, C, tilde, such that if you do the distance, yeah, the word metric of, sorry, get about the word metric, the hyperbolic metric and the word metric are and the grid metric are the same up to an additive and multiplicative. To an additive and multiplicative does. So, this is always the case. So, these two metrics, the ambient metric and the green metric, are always up to multiple negative and additive constants the same. But what is this theorem requiring? And it's showing a much stronger result that the distance, the difference is bounded. So, this is way we expect. So, this is way, way stronger. So, this first of all to say that the singularity conjecture is not a problem in coarse geometry. It does not exist in this problem in coarse geometry. They're all in the same cost class. It's a really problem in fine geometry. It depends extremely strongly on the choice of generating set and the choice of this mu. So, that's one. Of course, if the group action is not co-compact, for instance, in the task. Is not co-compact, for instance, in the tusk case, then it's completely different because then already at the level of quasi-sometry, this equivalence fails. So that's another idea why in this Kofopa case, this result is much cheaper. And so the goal that Peter and I try to tackle is indeed in this The struggle is indeed in this co-compact case to try to use this result and, in particular, to disprove this in order to disprove, I mean, to find, to prove the single IP condition. So let me write a main theorem. Unfortunately, taking more time, so might not be able to give a lot of design of the proof, but Here's all the proof, but that, of course, so how do we construct a co-compact function? Well, if we go back, if we go back to the work of Poincare, the most classical way is you have a hyperbolic polygon, and you want to introduce some pairing. To introduce some pairing between sides to construct the toscillation. So you want to find some matrices that map one side to some other side. And then under, you know, Poincaré's conditions, this group could be discrete or not. And yeah, he gives family this type of condition. So what are we assuming here? So we're introducing a bit more structure to get a little bit of a nicer result. Result. However, in genus 2, every group has such a representation, it must be said. So that we want a fundamental domain that is essentially symmetric. So indeed, so really, so we want to start with a so okay, so so let P be centrally symmetric. Naturally symmetric hyperbolic to unknown and again in fact in if if if M is four so it's G optical is genus two surface every river surface of genus II is hyperglyptic so you can actually find reverse Elliptic, so you can actually find representatives, but in hyogenous, and then when we have essentially symmetric hyperbolic octagon, we can, or to and gone, we can choose represent some generating sets. And the one we choose are the following, where we pair opposite sides. So we know that this pair, this side, by definition, has the same length as this side. And so we can find some matrix that maps this. That maps this to that, and so forth. So, we have that this one is like this, this one is paired with this, and this one is there. So, we assume we assume particular pairing, but we allow to vary a lot of things. So, this is a moduli space of many dimensions. It's nice kind of manifold, the moduli space, because we are allowed to change the geometry of the To change the geometry of the polygon as long as the symmetricity is preserved, and we're allowed to change the weights, the probabilities that we assign to this generate. So we say we let G1 Gm yeah, hyperbolic translations. And so let's call this P. This is not generating set. So the theorem is an and yeah, and we assume that the group generated by T is discrete. By t is discrete, and well, to assume that, for instance, we can assume, yeah, so basically, that sum of the angles is a rational multiple of pi. I mean, it's a slightly, slightly more tricky than that. There's two cases, depending on the parity of them. So, for instance, yeah. So, assume he generates a discrete group. Yeah, so this is an angle, conditional angle. Again, here we the this set is really a sort of nice modular space. It has this continuous parameters and like dimension and you know the hyper elliptic logos is like what g minus two I think or two. G minus two, I think, or two, yeah, anyways. So it's less than the whole dimension. Okay, so the theorem is the following Peter that you can talk to later. So it's the following indeed in this equation. So if mu is supported. Is supported on tree as common, then indeed U mu is singular, so it generates this nice focal part Fuchsian group, but the harmonic measure is singular with respect to the back, and then okay, this is kind of for free because of BHM, moreover, the dimension. And moreover, the dimension, the house of dimension of new mu is strictly less than one. So we have this dimension. However, our method does not give effective measure, you know, any estimate. So on the estimate, let me mention this recent work. Work so note for the regular case for this patient. That for here, we can we're allowed to change the geometry of this. I not did not be regular, but for the regular octagon octagon, there is this work of Olikot and Vitnova, where maybe should come out soon, I guess. So the dimension here. Soon, I guess the dimension here they have, for instance, a numerical method to estimate these things. In particular, for this one, I think it's something like 0.8.6. I checked yesterday. So they have a method that once you fix a special picket from Penguin, you can apply to us. So before, yeah, instead of talking about the proof, because of course I have no time, maybe I give a few more remarks that are related to this. But the first remark is that, yeah, by Kanaka, after, well, first of all, it was letter P and then PHM and so forth, then we know the dimension, so the Hauser dimension of this limiting measure is indeed H over L. So in a way, H L to this, so H L V, so H over L equals V. V so h over l equals v so and v is the dimension of the boundary. So in some sense, it's a what you're trying to an equivalent program is to estimate this ratio. And of course, as usual, the entropy is hard, but not maybe extremely hard to estimate. But usually it's the Lyapunov exponent that is the hardest one to estimate. In fact, that's what most people do. So in fact, there's also another recent. Also, another recent. So, what one could look at is you could look at all function groups. For instance, even one presentation like this, you can ask what happens if you make this size, if you change the size. So, you have this modulated space. In fact, at some point, I asked the following question. Asked the following question. It was proven by various people that I don't remember. So it could be Azamar, Gadre, Esa, Guzel, something like this, maybe Yannik, maybe someone else that I forgot. Anyways, this was an AIM aim group. No, maybe his name was on is it on the paper? I forgot. Maybe. Maybe Charlotte. Maybe John. Anyway, there's an aim group where they prove the following: that as if, so yeah. As yeah, as you go to the boundary of modular space, let me say like this, this representation. So you have a representation rho from gamma and to SL2R. So goes to the boundary. Boundary of modular space, which just means basically that this polygon becomes very uneven. So maybe there's one way to do it is you pinch one such curve and you make the other one. Then L goes to infinity. And so in particular, the Hausdorff dimension goes to zero, because if you fix gamma, then H would You fix gamma, then h would be fixed. And so it's a good question, which also has some thermodynamic flavor to see whether one could write this drift as a function on moduli space. And maybe it's an analytic function. And maybe this could be used to do things. So the idea is that the reason why I think this is a very good evidence is that somehow this guy's prove. Somehow, these guys prove the very degenerate case where the polygon is very uneven, irregular. And on the other hand, we prove the more regular case. So, in theory, the more regular case, you did the hardest, because, but even for the regular, we know all very well that the dimension is well below one. So, the conjecture would be that this dimension is maybe nice and elliptic function moduli space and then and then uh And then you can find the location, maybe the maximum would be when it's regular. I mean, this would be like this is a science fiction yet, but this is kind of the picture, I think, that is called. Okay, I think I'm run out of time. No, thank you. Are there any questions or any comments? What do you think? First, what year is this entropy? What is my quality? What year? Oh, Givash is from the 80s, like maybe 83 or something. Yeah, and Verschik is 2000, but definitely, definitely the inequality itself was already known. But he sort of poses all sorts of questions in other contexts as well. I have another question, which is the three quantities, they seem to be an Now they seem to be quite easy maybe to simulate. Does Henry, we can reduce the question to just the equality if you try to get an equality for any moving. Of course, everything you try is singular, right? I mean, otherwise everything is singular. Otherwise, we would already found a counterexample. Yeah, so that's a way always in the favor of the conjecture. Yeah, talk about the stationary position because it may not go continuous. You mean discrete? What do you mean by discrete? Yeah, but you mean still countable support or you mean continuous support? I mean, both are valid. Yes, but I mean both are valid things, but which one do you mean? Under extremely regular, extremely weak conditions, the runner work will converge to infinity. So that's nothing to do with the truth. Of course, you can do stupid things like you can do an irrational rotation and just an irrational rotation. If you add an irrational rotation to an antibodic element, for example. Rotation to an antibodic element, for instance, this is a valid case. This works, except you don't, well, you don't have such a strong conjecture, but you can talk about HMH. First and bad proof that the drift is positive in extremely galaxy. You go beyond Bernoulli, then we're gonna. Beyond Bernoulli, then we don't know. Yes, so okay, there's two types of higher dimensions that you all know. So there's a rank one, higher dimension, and higher. Rank one, higher dimension, yes. So we I have another paper with a bookstore for mine and you are. To Dopo Miner and Yaron Decker, and we do the same in high dimension. And the only difference is that the way you measure this excursion in the cusp, you have to take a higher power, precisely because the polynomial decay has a power and you have to match the decay, the polynomial decay. So the power will depend on the dimension. But we actually have exactly the same. If we talk about high rate, well, then nothing more. well then nothing more it's of course an interesting question
