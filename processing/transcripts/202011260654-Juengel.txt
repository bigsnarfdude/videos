to the organizers for inviting me since in fact i would not have been able to to go to banf in normal time since it's now teaching period so that's nice to sit at home and be at the same time in banff okay so as already mentioned i would like to speak about a fluid model for mixtures which is in fact a cross diffusion Which is in fact a cross-diffusion system. And this talk is, I will present two models and the main features that I have temperature in it. And the physical setting is as follows. So I have a fluid consisting of n components. And I assume that I do not have any mean or barycentric velocity. So this vanishes. It can be criticized, but I assume this in order to avoid to have Navier-Stokes equations included. And as I said, the main feature is that the temperature is variable. So I'm Temperature is variable, so I'm considering heat conduction. And in this presentation, just to simplify, I neglect reaction terms. Then, this situation can be modeled by so-called Fick-Onsager equations, so high conservation equations for the partial masses, rho i, with some current densities, which are just the linear combination of the so-called thermochemical potentials. I've explained it on the next slide what it means with some coefficients. With some coefficients mij, which gives the Onsager matrix. And I have a second equation, the equation for the temperature or here for the energy density, which depends on all the partial densities and the temperature theta. And the heat flux here is also given as a linear combination. Okay, so this situation requires some further comments since E and the Qi's are not defined up to now, and I will do it. Up to now, and I will do it in a thermodynamically consistent way by given the Gibbs free energy. So it's just a function which depends on these variables. And the thermochemical potential is given by the quotient of the chemical potential, which is just the partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the partial densities divided by the temperature. And the energy density is given by this expression. So these kind of systems, they are well. So these kind of systems, they are rather well known in some sense in thermodynamics. They can be derived in the isothermal or for special non-isothermal case, I've given here some references, especially from the French and Italian school. And up to now, so we are interested in studying cross-diffusion systems, but we did some analysis only for the isothermal case. So Dita Botto, for instance, did something and also with Enos Stelze, we proved something just for this. We proved something just for these equations here, not for the heat equation here or the energy equation. Okay, so I will not consider this in the whole generality, but I will just study two special models in which the main mathematical difficulty is that the matrices M or N are only positive semi-definite, so they may degenerate. And yeah, the question is how to deal with this. And for that, I need some techniques from fluid dynamics. Techniques from fluid dynamics, and maybe it's interesting. Okay, so the first model is again the Fick-Onsager model, a bit specified. So the MIGs here are appearing again, but now the other matrix is just consisting of these vector components Mi with temperature theta. And the energy equation is then given by this expression, where here I have the Mj's for the thermochemical potentials and I have the heat conductivity. I have the heat conductivity kappa here or this term. I have some initial data and I'm considering everything in the bounded domain and I impose no flux boundary conditions just to simplify things. So here the main feature of this model is that I assume that the sum of all these fluxes is zero, which means that the sum of all these partial densities is constant in time. And then I say that the total mass say that the total mass density which is rho defined just as the sum is actually the same like the initial datum so in the total mass does not change in time okay so for for these models i need to specify the free energy in order to specify all the other quantities and i assume that i have here this uh yeah rho log rho term and a term which depends on the temperature and i think i've forgotten the log here so this should be theta The log here. So this should be theta times log theta minus one. Sorry for the typo. Then I can compute the thermother potentials explicitly. So they're given by these expressions. And the energy density is that one of an ideal gas. It's the total mass density times the temperature. So interesting, what's interesting is then the assumptions on the matrices, on the matrix, it's symmetric because this is the Onsager relation. And since I assumed that the sum of the fluxes is equal to zero, I need to assume. Is equal to zero, I need to assume that these two sums here are also equal to zero, which means that the kernel of this matrix is non-trivial. And then it's clear that I don't get all the estimates I want to have. And this is here expressed in this kind of coercivity assumption. So I assume that the matrix is only coercive on the complement of the linear Hull or span of the vector consisting just of elements one. Of elements one, and I allow for second degeneracy. So, this is clearly it's degenerate since on this kernel this matrix or this here vanishes. On the right-hand side, I also assume that when rho i is equal to zero, so when I vacuum, then also I do not have any information. Okay, still we can do something, but before let me mention some ideas. So, why did we assume So, why did we assume? Let me go back these assumptions. So, that we have this projection, this is natural because of these assumptions in order to set up the model. That we've introduced in row I here. I just did it since there is a paper by Pierre-Tendr√©, and he mentioned that in order to model dilute gases or gas mixtures, then it would be appropriate to include these kind of terms. So, he did it in a much more general approach. Here's just an example. That example. So, the main feature here is now that we get some estimates coming from the entropy density. It's just the derivative of the free energy with respect to the temperature. It's given by this expression here. And when you take the derivative with respect to time along solutions of the system, then you get this expression here. So, you get some information on the gradient of the temperature, and then you get some mixed information on, well, on the thermochemical. Information on well on the thermochemical potentials. I will explain to you how we treat this. First, let me show you the existence results. So under some assumptions on the coefficients, which are more or less satisfied for special situations. The most restrictive assumptions may be the heat conductivity, since here I do not allow for degeneracy and I need a special growth in theta square. This is because of some S. Theta square. This is because of some estimates. Then we get the global in time weak solution, which is bounded from below and above a strictly positive temperature, and we get some regularity which is natural for weak solutions. So what is the idea in spite of all the difficulties? So the first idea is that I'm removing the last component here of the partial density by all the other partial densities. This is possible since the sum of This is possible since the sum of everything is given by the initial data, which is known. And then I formulate the equations in terms of some kind of dual variables, which are just given here by these logarithmic expressions. And the interesting thing is, and this may be well known for those of you who know these Fick-Onsager approaches, that the reduced matrix, when I remove the last row and column, it's positive definite, at least for positive density. Positive density. Okay, I will come back to this point later. So, because of this reformulation and the transformation between Vi and rho i, I get L-infinity bounds, since I'm now working with the Vi's as the main variables, and the rho i's are just nonlinear functions of the vi's. And once I have the solutions vi, then I can compute the vi's, and then you see by this expression. compute the vi's and then you see by this expression just inverting this transformation variable that this is bounded by the initial data. So this is the reason why we get the upper bound. So what is still not clear is well this positive definite for rho i bigger than zero, but it might happen that it's equal to zero. And there we're doing the following. We try to exploit the entropy or the entropy production term, which is coming from this term here, since this one here is exactly or can be bounded. Exactly, or can be bounded by this expression, and this is bounded. Okay, this is something we know from the analysis. And the funny thing is now that this expression, although it looks very complicated, gives a bound, so some terms cancel, and this gives a bound for the gradient of the square root of the row i's, and this gives me the gradient estimate. So by this, I'm overcoming the fact that the matrix M, even the reduced matrix, is only positive semi-definite, since rho i could be zero. Since rho i could be zero. Okay, and then we have another difficulty since we need to define objects like this: the heat conductivity times the gradient of theta. And that's not so clear how to do it since we have not much regularity for the temperature. But luckily, taking the test function theta gives H1 estimates for theta square. And by this, we can define these products, which are then some nice L Lebesgue space. Lebesgue space. So everything clearly is combined with some approximation procedure, which here is now more or less standard and some compactness results. The second model looks easier, but it's more difficult from a mathematical viewpoint. So here I have just one species plus the energy density, and I have here some very special definitions for this. Definitions for these thermochemical potentials and have a special expression for this diffusion or on-saga matrix. So, this is not coming out of the blue, but this has been derived by Favrich Schmeisser and Perner by deriving or by considering a Boltzmann model with a kind of background temperature exchange. So, not the particles are colliding, but there's just an interaction because of the temperature. And in the diffusion limit, they And in the diffusion limit, they got this model. And the nice feature is that there's, in fact, an underlying thermodynamic structure, since you can find that this is the free energy you need to consider. And when you, for instance, just for consistency check, you're computing the energy density, which I've not defined here. Then you see that this is given by this expression. Okay, so this model, in fact, it's written maybe in a too complicated way, just to show to you that this fits in the framework. That this fits in the framework of the models I want to consider. Another formulation is this one. So this looks easy, easier since you have a Laplace structure, but in fact, it's quite delicate since you have a degeneracy at theta equals zero, which comes clear here from the Onsager matrix. And maybe you can also recognize it here in this equation. Okay, how to treat these kind of models? We have been able to prove also global existence of weak. prove also global existence of weak solutions with positive non-negative density, particle density, and positive temperature in some space of weak solutions. And in fact, the analysis was a little bit more tricky than for the first model, since we needed three ideas. Okay, the first idea is the same like before. We are just writing down some energy inequality and it's that one. So we get some estimate. So we get some estimate for the gradient of the square root of the product of particle density and temperature. And then we get some information on the gradient of the temperature, on the log of the temperature, which by the way then gives a positivity. Okay, that's nice, but it's not enough, since this kind of regularity is too low to identify here these products when we pass to the limit in the approximation. So we need further estimates. And here we are exploiting the Laplace. And here we're exploiting the Laplace structure here and using as test functions. Basically, it's a little more complicated since we have no flux boundary conditions, but basically it's the using as test functions the inverse of the Laplacian applied to rho or to E. Then these Laplacians cancel, and what you get is an estimate here when you multiply this by rho, this is this term, and when you multiply this here by E, which is this term. Which is this term, and then after some estimations, you get this information, and this is a kind of higher-order integer for your functions. In particular, this gives the W11 bound for the energy, well, for rho times theta and theta itself, which means that for the energy density, you have some gradient bound. And this, together with compactness, some Aubelion's result gives you strong convergence for E. But now the problem. For e. But now the problem is you do not get any gradient information on rho, since I recall, I go back, that this is just a gradient information of rho times theta. And if theta is equal to zero, then you're losing any information. So you need to do something else. And what we did is then taking some tools from the mathematics of fluid dynamics and we re-normalize the equations. So let us assume that we have some approximate solutions rho epsilon theta epsilon and then the re-examples epsilon and then the renormalized particle density equation or mass conservation equation is given by this one so you're using f prime of rho epsilon as a test function and then this is your renormalized equation and the nice feature is that by this somehow you you can truncate your rho epsilon and you can apply the so-called give curl lemma since using all these estimates you have been before and this truncation allows you to um Allows you to verify the assumptions needed for this lemma. And what you get is then a little bit classical for those who know how to do it in the Navier-Stokes, for compressible Navier-Stokes, that the weak limit of some smooth function f applied to rho epsilon times another smooth function g applied of the approximation of the temperature, that here the weak limit of the product is equal to the product of the weak limits. And then you need to And then you need to work a little bit that you not only use move functions, but you specify, oops, sorry, to specify fn j. And you can prove that the weak limit of this one here, oops, here epsilon should go to zero, is given by the product of the weak limits of rho epsilon and theta epsilon, which I denoted here by rho and theta. And this is somehow the main tool in order to prove that eventually you get that rho epsilon converges almost everywhere to rho. Almost everywhere to row, and together with the estimates, you can conclude. Okay, so this is somehow these two models. Let me summarize how we treated these degeneracies. So for the first model, we could overcome the degeneracy by using these dual entropy variables, by just reducing the system together with entropy estimates, some additional estimates for the temperature, and using some method which I call boundedness by entropy method. called boundedness by entropy method in order to get L infinity bounds. And for the second model, again, it was based on the entropy estimates together with an yeah, you can call it H minus 1 method to get these higher order integer ability estimates combined with renormalization techniques and deep compactness results. Okay, so these were just two very simple examples and you can proceed and do things more realistically. Or more realistically from a physical viewpoint. So, for instance, considering compressible heat-conducting mixtures. And this we did with Miroslav, Milan, and Nicola Zamponi, but only for the stationary case. And let me make some advertisement for Milan's talk on Friday, 8 a.m. bench time. He will present more results on this model. Another model for the transient case, but only for constant temperature, has been considered by Dariadri, Gajewski, and G√ºlke. and G√ºlke some years ago, but the transient model is open. So we already started to work on this, but this is really a hard problem. And yeah, maybe you have some ideas. There are also some other questions. For instance, I use this generacy in row I. You could also use some power here. But the question is, is this really a physical assumption? So it's a little bit ad hoc, maybe. But the model of Dorie was a little bit more complicated. So it would be nice to understand this better. Nice to understand this better. Moreover, the regularity is rather low and would be interesting if we can get more regularity, which is important for numerical approximations and also maybe with the hope to get uniqueness of solutions. Okay, that's what I want to say. Thank you very much for your attention.
