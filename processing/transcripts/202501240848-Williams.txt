And how about the facilitators, too? Because y'all feel like we're going to be able to do that. Yeah, so I'm starting, I guess, for the dynamics group. So on Monday, I gave a talk about dynamics on Catalan objects induced from lattice structures on these objects, different lattice structures. So from the non-crossing partition lattice, we have the correverest complement map. And then from the distributive lattice of DICPAS, as well as the Tamari lattice, we have notions of row motion. Motion, and all of these dynamics are sort of the same in a sense. And I talked about some homomessy results for natural statistics on these objects coming from plane partitions. And then I sort of suggested that maybe we can look at extensions to the Foos-Catalan setting. But during the talk, Cesar Sebaikus got interested in this question of just why do variants of the Tamari lattice seem to have the same romantic. Lattice seems to have the same row motion dynamic. So, why is there kind of invariance of row motion for different variants of the Tamari lattice, including, for example, the framing lattices coming from triangulations of flow polytopes that Martha talked about in her talk. So, I was really happy that there was like this unexpected connection between kind of different communities that came here. And then the project evolved more in that direction. So, we sort of explored Cesar's ideas and conjectures. Maybe Ben will talk about what we've seen so far and what we've seen. What we've seen so far and what we're still working on? Yeah, so what we've sort of, at least at the moment, really refined what we're looking at is we're looking at sort of these lattices that are coming from what are, so at the moment we're really looking at what are these cross-tamari lattices, which are really coming from these shapes. So just sort of like a simple example of one, if I can figure out more efficiently, right? Right, would be say something like with this, and there's a one way of thinking about it is that there is, you're able to sort of put a binary tree structure on these in an equivalent way of thinking about it with local moves of flips, and of course, and it's corresponding to effectively a one-skeleton of the specihedron, and it's just a very certain realization of it. And one thing that we've been observing is that. And one thing that we've been observing is that, and it particularly needs to be sort of satisfying a couple of properties. So the rows and the columns need to be convex, so you need to be connected. And they need to be satisfying containment relations. So that means sort of each row, the rows need to, you can totally order the rows and the columns by containment. And it seems as though under sort of all the ways of arranging these, at least keeping those, where we're just messing with the rows, right, where we're just permuting the columns, not the rows, that is still satisfying. That is still satisfying this, it seems to be exhibiting all the same good behavior in the classical case. And so that's sort of what we have kind of been defining for how we've been looking at. And we've been able to verify that this is working up through actually all of the ones, you know, up to all the way up through looking at a So we've basically what we spend all of our time doing is trying to sort of understand these as best we can. They are semi-distributive lattices as they're concrete lattices, but also because they're intervals in an ambient Tamari lattice, they're also trimmed. So they're sort of the best of both worlds for how we can compute remote motion on them. And it seems as though all the good behavior is being preserved. And if we were And if we could be able to figure out how to properly translate all of these results, it could provide new interpretations for sort of understanding the dynamics between potentially very disparate options. And so I want to keep things short. So that's kind of where we're at. Alan, I think they have slides. Could you help them get some type of thing? Wait, maybe check the other type. Okay, no, so maybe I think you use this somehow. I don't know. No, I think Zoom people can. People should be able to see it. Are you able to see? Are you able to see the slides? Yes, yeah. Okay. I'm going to be talking a little bit about the work that we did in the Removie Future group. So I'll start by reminding you a little bit of the background of this project. So if you take a lattice and you take the set of congruences on the lattice, you get another lattice called the congruences. Get another lattice called the congruence lattice, and you can view this as a sub-lattice of the partition lattice. So it turns out that the joint irreducible congruences are precisely the ones that are generated by condensing an edge, which lies directly below a joint irreducible element. So we're focused on congruences, which are called homogenous of rank two. And these are the congruences which are generated by contracting rank two joiner disqualities. So here's a quick example. Quick example. So on the left, I've highlighted these two edges, and if you contract those two edges, you get the five congruence classes shown on the right. Okay, so if you take a Coxster fan, recall that if you quotient by an equivalence class, you get a coarsening of your original fan. So in particular, you get a coarsening by gluing together the maximal cones which form to the same equivalence class. Which forms the same clearance class. So it's been shown that in type A and type B cases, the quotient fan is actually the normal fan of the polytope, and we think this holds for all types. And we call this polytope a deformed permutohedron. So in particular, a deformed permutohedron is just a polytope whose normal fan coarsens of the brain fit. So I'll introduce one other type of polytope called a rubahedrin, and this is precisely a polytope that you get by taking the That you get by taking the permutahedron and removing some of the inequalities that define the facets. So, here, if I remove the three inequalities that define the blue facets, I get the permutahedron book right. Okay. So this is the original question that motivated this project. We were asking whether it's true that the quotient fan is a normal fan or a removahedron of a permutahedron, if and only if the congruence that we're taking is homogenous of rank 2. And this is already shown in type A and for some other small examples, but unfortunately, it turns out that this is not true. So we rephrased the question to ask which rank II quasiest hindrances are removed. Okay, so this question kind of led us in two separate directions. The first one was exploring the geometry of the removal heatra itself, and the second one was looking at the combinatorics of these quotient, sorry, these equivalence ensolments. So I'll talk a little bit about the. So, I'll talk a little bit about the removahedra first. The first thing that we notice is that not all removahedra are deformed remohedra. Or, in other words, it's possible to remove some of the defining inequalities and you don't get a coarsening of the normal span. So, we ran some computational experiments, and it turns out that in the A4 case, more than half of them don't give deformed communicators. So, one of the questions that we want to explore going forward is which. That we want to explore going forward is which subsets of these inequalities do give deformed. Okay, so another direction that we looked at about the removahedron is these sets of rays in the normal fan. And the reason is just that the removahedron is uniquely determined by the set of rays in its normal fan. You can say this because the rays are precisely those that are perpendicular to the facets, and we're just removing some facets for the look in the future. It turned out also that It turned out also that rays of a congruence class can be computed from maximal adjoint irreducible elements state of the congruence class. So, using this fact, we were able to show this lemma. And it just states that the set of rays of a fan quotiented by a join of two congruences is precisely the intersection of arrays when you quotient by each congruence. And the same thing for me. Okay. So I'll talk a little bit about the combinatorial direction now. Combinatorial direction now. So it turns out that it's easier to check whether something is a normal fan of a removahedron when it's simplicial. And we believe that the rate two homogenous concurrences have some simplicial quotient fans. So because of this, we wanted to ask when joint irreducible elements generate simple concurrences. So this has already been explored in type A and in type D. And so we wanted to know what happens in type B. So we think that a necessary condition is that A necessary condition is that J should be double joint irreducible, but we wanted to get a necessary and sufficient condition. So we were trying to extend the proof techniques that are, or I guess the strategy that's used for the type A case. So in the type A case, we use this bijection from the symmetric group to non-crossing arcs diagrams. And basically what you do is you draw lines through each of the descending runs. You just project onto a vertical line. Project onto a vertical line. So, a good fact about this bijection is that doubly joined irreducible elements correspond to single arcs which lie on one side of the vertical line. So, if you remember from the previous slide, this means that join irreducibles generate simple congruences precisely when they correspond to arcs that don't cross this vertical line. So, we thought maybe we could write down a condition in the type B case that looks sort of like this. And so, we're using the bijection between Bn and Between Vn and non-crossing arc diagrams in the orbit full model. So here's a condition that we think might be true. We think it might be that we need arcs to not cross the vertical axis both above and below the orbital point. Okay, that's the end of my presentation. Beautiful. Thank you. All right, we quit.  Okay, so we looked at this conjecture that extended every border is a lattice. Okay, so remember an extended recorder is this coset of biclosed sets. So we look at a Coxster group, we take its root system, and we look at the biclosed subsets of that root system. We look at the biclosed subsets of that root system. And then the post-set of all of those biclosed sets under inclusion should be a lattice. That's the conjecture. So, this was when I gave my presentation at the beginning of the week, this was only proven for affine cluxer groups and finite cluxer groups. We now have two more cluxer groups for which we know this. So, Ethereum, it is a lattice for the universal cluster group on three elements. So, this has So this has Coxford diagram infinity, infinity, infinity. And also, yes, for the Coxer group width diagram, it looks like that. And the tool that we used to prove this was we looked at snakes on a hyperbolic plane and the main And the main lemma, our SNIC lemma, was that there is only one SNIC on the hyperbolic plane. And using this, we were able to show that the biclosed sets in the root system for these two groups are all separable. So that means that there is some linear functional which detects whether you're in the biclossed set or not. And it's known that if you look at the separable sets in a rank three poxular group, that those do form a lattice. So because we showed that every biclosed set in these rank two ranks, In these two range-free subgroups are separable. We know that, in particular, they form a lattice. And as part of David and I's program for proving this lattice conjecture in higher ranks, one of the things that we wanted to show was that in rank 3, all bi-closed sets are separable. So we've also answered this conjecture that David and I had about, and actually that Thomas McConnell had many years ago as well, that rank 3 coxider groups should have separable liposits. Yeah? Sense. Yeah, so those are our main results. Okay, so I'm here to give a quick report on the representation theory group. We're interested in the Cox setup permutation. So we are really a big group with a lot of people on Discord and in the rooms also. So it's not an exhaustive list, but it was with few native List, but it was with Hugh, Nathan, Akel, Emine, Veronique, Johann, Elise, Daisy, Colin, Wing, Benjamin, Christian, Claire, and a lot more, I'm sure. And so, obviously, I have no time to go through the definition and all the details, but I want to give maybe a really quick overview and give an example. So, Hugh and Rome talk about this project at the beginning of the week. So, we have a postet, a finite post set. So we have a poset, a finite poset, we have a linear extension of our poset and we deduce the coxeter permutation, the cog set of permutation, so it depends on P of course, but of sigma, the linear extension. So natural questions are this permutation related to P? So what is it relation with P? And also what are the cases where the permutation The cases where the permutation does not depend on this miner extension. So, at the beginning of the week, David Spayer came with the proof that if you're a lattice, and we really believe this proof to be true, so for a lattice L, the coxeter permutation does not depend on the linear extension. Extension if and only if your lattice is semi-distributed. That's very nice. Semi-distributed AZ. And if L is semi-distributed, in fact, the clocks at Lerium correspond to the raw motion. So it was proved by Klaus, Max Zimzik, and Thomas that it's true for distributive X. And what we were looking in in our group, so the question, you have the semi-distributive lattice, it's the drawing of Colin at the beginning of the week. You have the trim lattice that this is, and this is all in. And this is all in semi-district lattices. Semi-district. So trim lattices are the extreme old and left modular lattices, but I'm not going into the details. So obviously the cogstator permutation does not depend on the linear extension if and only if you are in the summer distributed case for the lattices. But we were looking at if it's possible for the true lattice lattices that are. True lattices that are not semi-distributive, or even for the semi-distributive lattices that are not semi-distributive, is there is a canonical choice of linear extension such that it gives you the row motion. So you will have multiple co-ceptor permutations in this phase, but is there a canonical choice to recover the row motion? So maybe I can just give you a quick example. So this is a smallest lattice. This is the smallest lattices that is the smallest lattice that is string but not semi-distributed. So I can label the vertices vertices, vertices like this. I have also a labeling of the edges. I have also a labeling of the edges. I'm not going into the details, but we have a longer chain here, A, B, C, D. And in the polygon, I can find the labeling, right? B, C, D, D, B. And so, in fact, if you compute a certain set, which is, so what we look at is for all x, the set of The set of y such as y meet with x corresponds to the pop operation. So it was a, I will conclude the error. So if you have, we will look in the example, but if you have x and you cover some elements, you compute the meta as an element, it is the pop. It was studied in particular by Cole. Studied in particular by Colin. A way to, if you are semi-distributed, this set has only one max as a maximum and it corresponds to the row motion. But in other cases, in the semi-distribut, you still have this set, and the row motion is one of the maximal elements of this set. So for this example, if you compute uh if you're looking at the maximal element of this set, it will be always only one maximum. Always only one maximum, but not for four. So we can compute the row motion of four first with what we know about the romotion for the lattices. So the row motion, you look at the Darnabel label, sorry, it's C, and there is only one vertex with up level C. This is three. So the romotion of four is three. And you can recover it like this, because you can look at this set. At this set of X, where you compute for 4. So the POP of 4, there is only one, it covers only one element, so the POP is a meat of this element, it's one. So you have to look at all the vertices such that the meet with four give you one. So it's one the meet with four, it's one, two, three and six. So the maximal elements are three and six, and so the romotion is one of them. And so the row motion is one of them. So yeah, the row motion is always one of the maximum buttons. And looking at David's proof, you can understand that if you are able to find a linear extension such that for any such sets or for any such maximal elements in those sets, you always take with your linear extension as the last element the row motion. Uh as the last element the row motion, it will be the it will be uh the cost set permutation is the row motion. What I mean is that you have to take so I will compute it so this is this has one, two, three, six, but the maximum element has just two and you want you want to take with your linear extension so six before two because Free because free is the remote. Okay. And so, yes, so we have some ideas of how to do it. For this example, of course, if you take one, two, six, then three, four, five, seven, you have to take in six before free. So it will be the work motion. Maybe two idea, and I finish like this. If you have a submit history, it's like submit. If you have a semi-distributive like semi-district lattice, you have a kind of decomposition like this with a joint primary element. So you produce induction, you have semi-attis. And also for trim lattices, what you see here are the labels on the edges is a H-L labbing. So we can represent all elements with the only increasing chain that goes from the minimal element to this element. So ABC, for example, ABC, and every element. A, B, C, and every element like this, you can find what is it, and so on, and so on. And maybe we have a choice, we have to prove it, that's a choice using this EL lab link to prove that you will work over the whole machine. But we have to start. Renee, did you want to present something for us? A little bit of projector for you, or will you just talk? I tried to share my screen. Yeah, he's gonna share his screen. Can you hear me? We can hear you. We haven't got your screen up yet, but let's just give it up. Okay, it says I'm sharing. Yeah, I see it on Zoom. Like, we don't have anything. Yeah, but this automatically contacts T-Stokes. You have to have it with the laptop. It is on the laptop. Try doing the thing where you switch between. All right, Renee, go ahead. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Let me try to make this. So I will present some progress on the cocksetter permutations. There's one result and two conjectures. So the cockset of permutation is defined for every finite dimensional algebra of finite global dimension. And as it generalizes the whole motion bijection for distributed lattices, it's a natural question. It's a natural question to not study this only for posets, but other classes of arguas. And incidence algopas of posets are sub-agipas of upper triangular mixed probar field. And going in the opposite direction, linear Magniama algipas are exactly the quotients of the ring of upper triangular matrices. And they are in a natural bijection to dip paths via their Osterman-Leiten purple. And recently, Dingle discovered a And recently Devil discovered a mysterious bijection, we are homological algebra for Nakayama algebas. And with Miki and Marcos, so we had a small bond group. So we didn't participate always in the group discussions because they were close to midnight, but we discussed the 2000 bond. We proved that Ringel's homological bijection for pit paths coincides with the Fox center permutations for those Akaya micropaths which I. For those Akayam IP paths, which are canonical bijection for the big paths. And yeah, this gives even more evidence that our cox-etter permutation is really an interesting notion, not only for incidence algorithms. But now back to the topic of lattice theory. There's a famous theorem due to Dilworth, it's called Dilworth's covering theory, that in our modular lattice there are as many elements covered by K-elements as there are elements co-covered by K-elements or co-covered. Covered by K elements, or both covered means they cover K elements. And while the cockset of permutation for lattices is only independent of the linear extension for semi-distributive lattices, as was explained in Lindier's talk, we might think of it also as a good thing that for other lattices it is dependent because then we get all bijections, not just one bijection. Not just one dijection. And we can, of course, still study some of the corporate spammations have. And with Johan, Miki, Benjamin, and Christian, we studied the following conjecture. We talked at a permutation of Hong Kong. Here's a bijection between elements covered by K elements and elements co-covered by K elements. And yeah, we tested this for Uh, tested this for all modular lattices with at most ten elements, which I think is pretty good evidence that it might be true in general. And the next topic is for lattices. It seems not to be solved that when the cockset operation is independent of the linker extension, but for general ball sets this seems pretty mysterious. So we tested the following conjecture. We tested the following conjecture that if you have a bounded coset and the box set of permutation is independent, and assume that the box set of permutation is independent of the linear extension, then in all examples so far it was true that the McNeil completion of that process is singly distinct unit. And the conjecture is verified for all bounded processes with at most 10 elements. Mainly this code uses some modified code. Code uses some modified code of Lippung and Nathan Williams. And yeah, for till n equal 9, also the converse is true, but for n equal 10, the converse fails. So there are even dissective processes where the oxide department is not independent. So dissective means that the McLeod composition is even disintegrated. And an interesting case to study is the strong road order of the symmetric. Strong road order of the symmetric group. And for n less than or equal to 4, there the Coxeter permutation is an involution. So it is very interesting to ask if this continues to hold for higher n and what happens in the other types for the strong word order. And yeah, in general, I think it's a very interesting question when raw motion is an involution. I think for lattices, the only example I know is the Boolean case, and for both at the Boolean case and for bosets this can happen more often. So yeah, that's all I have to say. Thanks for that energy. Can I ask you a question? When you've checked that the constant permutation is an involution on on permutations, is it some involution that we know, or is it something really odd? So I end up with things Feinstrad and detect no results. So it might be something new, or at least not in Fleinchnad. So it's related with what is in the badge by action? Yeah, but but at S5 it fails to be able to do it. So I think we'll have Thomas. And we have a coffee break after this, so you know, there's more time to discuss. I'll be all in very quick. Maybe I'll finish before you. Yeah, okay, so our group was doing white slip categories, thepology of white slip categories. So this is a reminder. Oh, actually, let me first say, this is a small enough group, so I can write down the name. This is a small enough group, so I can write down the names. So we had Julia Zuno, Emily Barnard, Eric Hanson, and myself. We're looking at the topology of wide subcategories. And so wide subcategories within algebra, these include things like non-crossing partitions of various types. You can get sharp intersection orders with wide subcategories, non-crossing pre-partitions, and some other exotic things. And in all these examples, And in all these examples, it seems to have a very nice topology. I just wanted to prove this in general, and actually, there was a very nice general result by two of these people who were trying to extend. So, yeah, so the approach that we're taking is a bit different than approaching before. I think we're looking at a certain map from the telerigid or teletilting complex, I suppose. So, telerigid modules, two widespread categories. Two widespread categories. And the point is that if this map has particularly desirable properties, if it has something, satisfies this thing called a sort of posted quotient fiber lemma, then the nice topology here will induce nice topology on the post-device kits. That's the idea. And so, progress that we made on this. So, I stated three problems at the end of my talk. So, the first problem was, first of all, actually, just to verify that this map. That this map, the dual map is actually a positive quotient map. So, not all order-preserving maps are positive quotient maps. This turned out to mostly be just translating things that was in Asso's original paper. Key idea here was to do something called travel-type reduction, and plus some other things. So, yeah, so that was solved, no problem. The second part was to show that the particular way that this post- That the particular way that this posted quotient arises has some desirable properties. So, this quotient, if we wanted it to be ranked homogeneous, that was no problem. So, that point's done. Upper, regular, that essentially followed from the way that we did part one. And then the hard part is showing detractable fibers. And I will say we don't have a proof of this, but we have the structure that could form the proof eventually. Form of the proof eventually, you know, just needs to fill in a lot of things. So, this is maybe still a question mark, but I'm pretty sure we'll eventually get there. And then, question number three, we didn't fix. Can ask what definition of post-et function you're using, just because you can get the partial order by anything in the middle. Yeah, so the induced partial order is. So the induced partial order should be the class of x less than equal to the class of y, if and only if there exists x prime and y prime classes of each of these so that x prime less than equal to y prime. So this is the induced relation. It doesn't always give you a plus map. Yeah, I guess you know that there's some kind of plus it map here, but you don't know that the induced relation on this is precisely that one. There might be sort of more electrons that was language. That's me, right? But I don't know which piper graph. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The other one also says hypergraphs. Alright, hello. I was in the flows on hypergraphs group, which was me, Rupert, Martha, and Joseph. And to give you the context. To give you the context of what we were thinking about, we started with the idea of flow polytopes. So if you have some directed acyclic graph and maybe something like this, and you want to think about a flow going through your graph, and from these flows, we can build a polytope. And so the idea is that we can make an incidence matrix for our graph G, and then And then we solve this linear system. So, this A vector is our net flow. So, usually we think about this as we put one unit of flow in at the first vertex, we flow it through the graph, and we take one unit out at the end. So, this A vector is usually equal to like E0 minus E power many first, it's half. Okay? And so, our goal for this project was to try to generalize. Our goal for this project was to try to generalize this to higher-dimensional graphs or something of the like. So, this is kind of our first problem: it was not totally obvious what this generalization should be. So, if we want to bump up the idea of a graph, is that a hypergraph? If so, what does it mean to be a directed acyclic hypergraph? Maybe instead we should think about our graph as a one-dimensional simplicial complex. And in that case, what does it mean to be a directed acyclic simplicial complex? Simplicial complex, and what does flow on the facets of this complex look like? And so, these were the kinds of things that we talked about a lot. I don't think we really came to a clear conclusion on what thing is the right object to be studying. And a big part of why is this A vector. In all of the cases we tried, it was not super clear what the natural analog of this A vector should be. So, having this 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, negative 1 is very natural in this case. Negative one is very natural in this case, and it's not clear what a natural net flow would be. So we thought a lot about that and just like what, how could we kind of bump this up? What should that look like? When we kind of were feeling a little stuck in that direction, we decided to try a different approach. Another connection to these flow polytopes and like to the weak order is once you build this polytope, you can triangulate it in a Polytone, you can triangulate it in a very nice way. And the dual graph of that triangulation, when your graph, if you have a graph that looks like this, with just lots of bumps like this, the dual graph of the triangulation will be the B quarter. And so this would be something like this. And you could think of this as 1, 2, 3, and you think about And you think about like this swap of the 1,3, the 1,3 flip is like switching which edge from the first bubble and the third bubble you take. So there's a very nice like visual connection between what's happening in the graph and the flows and what's happening in the lattice. And so we were thinking maybe we can use the higher purpose order and this like packet reversal and maybe there's some sort of flip that we can do just like this. Like this. So we're still thinking about that. We don't really have an answer for this either. Martha was just telling me that there's a paper by Siegler about cyclic hyperplane arrangements that maybe could be kind of related somehow if we have different hyperplanes and we can move them around and bump them up and down a little bit. But those are kind of our ideas for the future of trying to maybe study these cyclic hyperplane arrangements a little more, or also maybe narrowing our scope to Narrowing our scope to shifted simplicial complexes because they're a little nicer instead of just all simplicial complexes. So, those are ideas of just how to bump it up a dimension and maybe find a cool polytope that is coming from a hypergraph or something upon the square. So, in the bulk hypographic polytops, we are a small subgroup of Vincent's groups. So, we work together with Felix and Andrea. So, we, I mean, okay, we haven't any results yet, but I mean, we started discussing hypergraphic polytops, so we started playing with very simple situations like if you have two hypergraphs, no interval hypergraphic polytopes. So, if the intervals are like this, you have you just have a You just have a Minkowski sum of two simplices, which reside in different directions, so it's just a product. So that's very easy, a product of simplices. So as you grow in complexity, for example, one can think of what will happen if we have something like this. And this means that we should also have this figure. And we started to try to enumerate the phases of the corresponding polytops with respect to how the interval. With respect to how the intervals interact with each other. So we consider like we played a little bit with cases like this one, or maybe cases like this one. And we do have an intuition of how to enumerate. So if possible, find the f vector of the corresponding hypergraph polytope. So that was one direct. So that was one direction. And also, as a general question, after we met with this Pinsan, maybe very general, but it's just to try to find families of hypergraph polytops which behave nicely so that we can find the effect. So, I mean, find families and this. Oh, hypergraphic. For which you can say something about the F vector and deviation, for which we can compute. So this might be quite complicated because we have Minkowski sums, okay, they are simplices, but the Minkowski sums are quite capricious. I mean, some faces disappear inside the Minkowski. Disappear inside the Minkowski sand, so you don't know what is really happening. So, but okay, but anyway, we have a nice way to tell the phases of the hypergraph polytopes from acyclic orientations of the hypergraphs. So, maybe for dramatics is some nice one. And so, also some other directions after we met with Vin Sun. So, with Vin Sun said, okay, so. Vincent said, okay, so it's a characterization of Vincent that if we, in the case where we have a simple graph, so the corresponding polytop is simple, okay, if there is a nice condition that if G is chordful, but it's not for me. Sorry? Ah, okay. It's not yours. Never mind. Okay. Uh cordful. So So, a possible generalization is if we can say something about some families of hydrographic politopes, because there is a condition, I think from Colin's paper, there is a condition to say when a hypographic pole top is simple, but with respect to the orientations. So, maybe a possible question is to find the characterization of that pole contact. But poor contact. So, okay. Um and a nice characterization. Okay, and one more direction that we consider. So Vincent told us about some nice hypergraphic A hydrographic polytops that the corresponding posit is distributed. So for the kilotops, I don't know how it's spent. And also they shred their so um oligos, I mean hypergraphs, I don't know. It's a yeah. So there are two large plastics Two large classics, class of polydopes, and actually, and posits from hyperchlorographs, that they are distributing. And we, okay, maybe explain, and they have nice characterizations of when they are distributed, of why they are distributed. They are always distributed, but they have nice characterizations. And, okay, possible. Okay, a possible direction is so for hypographic polytopes, the corresponding posits are very often very simple because they are distributive and it might be a product of chains. So it's very easy to enumerate or do things like that. But maybe find more complicated situations and do something with them. So I mean for each interval Hypergraph Okay, okay, it it it often happens, okay, it might be we might have Okay, if it's a in case it is distributed, it might be very simple, it might be in the case that the corresponding poset uh is just a product of change. just a product of change so this is a very product of change this is a very simple distributive lattice but okay find more that are distributive and they're not so simple find some that are unit tributary but not Not so simple, not simple, not simple. Not so simple as a bow. That was pointless. Yeah. So the code says that when it's distributed fiber interval fiber polythes, all of them are produced of simplicity. It's so disturbing how LinkoSDSON suddenly behaves as for Linkoxynx, which is indisputable. Some things which I'm sort of noticing. I was really surprised by this information. Update Zones open probably? So it started with the conjecture that Oliver presented about posets having a unique cycle in their HACA diagram being of dimension atmospheric free. So, of course, if there is no cycle, the poset can be seen in dimension two, because well, we can always choose the point. We can always choose the points in the plane such that we respect the forest structure. But as long as there is, well, for some that have a cycle, they still remain of dimension two, but usually dimension two is not enough to embed them. So, how do we, what I mean by embedding them, it's so I put points in, let's say, our Say, or three, I put points and I look at the cones that they define. And if y is included in the cone of x, then y is bigger than x or smaller, let's say. Let's say bigger. So if we have this, then let's see. Okay. Okay, and so what we did is we, well, built for any such possess, so now it's ERM with Nathan, Natasha Pollier, and Adrian, I can't remember your last name. We proved it, we found a way of embedding any such post-set. So we first started by looking at what kind of cycles could the Looking at what kind of cycles could appear. And so, for a cycle to appear in the Hasse diagram, if you go around the cycle, you must see an arrow, well, you must see twice an arrow in the correct direction at least, and twice an arrow in reverse direction, because otherwise, you would have a direct. Otherwise, you would have a directed cycle or a shortcut, and you want to avoid that. So, there are two kinds of such cycles. There are those where there is a unique source and a unique sink. And so, we gave a construction for that, which is basically these kind of things, they are just two-dimensional, but we embed them in dimension 3 anyway because we want some more room. And there are those where there are several sources and several things, and maybe. Of things, and maybe these are the simplest one where the directions always differ, alternate. And so we give an embedding of those. So the arrows go up always. We give an embedding of those and then we I will describe it very quickly. And then we just add, so that's the first ingredient. And the second ingredient is. And the second ingredient is: if we have an embedding of a postet, we can always split an edge. And so adding a point such that we split the edge. And so that is easy. And we can always add an edge, an incoming or an outgoing edge from any point. It's a little bit more trickier and requires that we have this little rule. So, let me explain these different points and especially the construction for that one. That's fairly nice. So, for this one, let's say we put the point of the things in a circle, let's say a regolo. Let's say a rigola engulf Then we put this circle as the in the plane x plus y plus z equal to zero, so in this hyperplane, such that any two such points are not comparable, so we we first have those and then uh we will add the thing. We will add the sink in the middle of a circle that will be in some direction. So we will push the circle containing the red points and let's just focus on one point. So if we look at the directed cones, Cones. At some point they will meet and there will be so this region, we want the X to fall into this region, but we don't want the X to be contained into so we don't want we want the X the red X to be in the cone, well in the intersection of those two cones, but not in any of the other cones of the cone. Codes of the white points. So, first thing to remark is that there is such a region, and it is so we can reach, when we push the red circle, we can reach a point where there exists a position where we can put this x, and from that height on, we can always find a place to put the x. Find of place to be x. And we do that for every such x, and we find that there exists an A such that this hyperplane can contain all the x's at the same height and in the proper intersection of the two neighbor codes. And when you have that, well, that is exactly an embedding of poppies. So with the Sources being in the first circle and the sinks being in the second one. And then the two constructions for this one, that's quite easy. So that's for the one. For this construction, we want to add a vertex somewhere. So let's say we've got those cones. And we want to And we want to add an X in the middle, and we want that it contains the white one, but is not contained, well would be contained in other white one, but does not is not contained in anything well or does wait a bit yeah I I want just this to be Yeah, I I want just this to be uh uh a meat irreducible and joint irreducible element. And so I just added very, very close to to to this point. I have some room because uh I always so I never when I've got two cones that are included that are never touching the the smaller one is never in the boundary of the the other so I can always do that. And then the last point was to try to add uh some To add some, so let's say that I've constructed the cycle. I can now do that if one is finalized. Yeah, but I'm splitting the arrow. Imagine that uh either a row has uh one edges or one has two corn edges, then we'll have opposite problem. But but first no uh um we do we we first do that, we we start with the cycle, then we split oh sorry, I was not uh clear enough. We do that with the circle, we we we split the uh um I try to do that with the exactly this. How many cycles you just add one point to the edge of the point you do add one point to the first one? Okay, so I want oh yeah, no I see what you mean. So I have this X that is uh that is no, sorry. So I've got the the red X that is here, it has its cone. It has its cone. Oh, yeah, you're right. So, what we do first for this is we can look at the negative of the cone. And so, I want, oh yeah, so there is something. So, for the yellow, I want the yellow crops that I had to be inside the this cone, say, but outside of that one, there is uh some room where they do not uh they do not steal meat. So They do not steal meat. So I have all this region that I all this space. Maybe we need to write a little more carefully the details, yes. But I think I can't get the details. Yeah. We still need to do the details. We can figure it out. But the point is, we could solve also adding an edge and I believe that the techniques should really. Techniques should really work because we always have some room where you look at everything that you contain, everything that you want to avoid, and there is just a finite number of lower covers, and there is always a room in the negative of the cone and the intersection of the negative of the cones and the cones of the lower covers. So, yeah, basically that's it. That just about wraps it up for us. Yeah, thank you everyone. Maybe I should say, so we're expecting hopefully there will be papers coming out of this, and we would love to know about the papers when you write them, so please let the organizers know. I think this is important for logistical reasons, also, but also we'd just like to know what comes out of this. Thank you all for coming. Thank you all for coming. Yeah, of course this is so much fun.  Okay, so Okay, so I'm gonna go to the back of the line. Uh we're just saying right right now. So you're hearing what's up. So it's very important to remember this conference. I'm actually seeing something. Right, right, right. What do you do about the push page? Well, you would be there first. Here we go. We're going to have one student. So we have two threats to each person. One more. I might see you right now. I submitted to suffering. I did. I guess I did teach that one. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's like it's up. I can't do it all the time. Oh, there are some. So, yes, I just want to reiterate this. I think it would be wonderful. Yes, and since we're further along in the process, Since we're further along in the process, you know what about our experience and see what we're doing and yeah, so I think the right way to do it is to get like the old team back together, good props, and they'll use this and try to try to call it. Any group that we can Any order that we should probably like that without even speaking just to have around the corner. I think that's right. Yeah, like I would have liked to go look at guys who did universal stuff, but I kind of felt blocked in these physical files. The pictures of our snakes? Yeah, so um it's really the loop very simple idea is the idea. So when you're doing a hyperbolic hyperbolic watch, that's the way it's done. Usually what we're doing is we're slicing stuff. Yeah, so it's not really a problem. They started getting more into it. And then you and then that's where they were starting, and they were wanting to sort of separate pieces of pieces like that. Separate pieces from these contacts along any time. And the edges of the tree correspond exactly to the hypothesis corresponding to the risk. Okay, that's the gross part. Okay, that's the correspondence. I didn't yeah, and then if you're doing something like absolute care, you get the same or the same hybrid, and so corresponding. So it's not as nice. Like if you're doing a hexagonal flight, this corresponds to that hybrid plane. Yeah, yeah, of course. But yeah, it's not a one-to-one. It's not a one-to-one. But here it's a one-to-one. Two-coloring colouring.  It has to be a complex thing. It has to be some color for a while and then switch it. Yeah, so they end up being a little bit more. Yeah, they end up being certain. Because of this, it ends up being like all red and red on one side, and then red sort of there. And blue here. Okay. And And so you have three vertices. If you do a local talk, you can say that. If all three of them are fine, it's just the X. If it's not between the colors, it's got to be two and one. And so it's like, let's go ahead and just draw little pieces of arts into the regions on either side. Okay. And there's going to be one coloring. And then you can check that any vertex, it's always going to be continuing to look like a one manifold. Okay. And so it always looks like a one manifold. And then in the regions, there are most two color changes. And so you can always. And so you end up building a one manifold. In fact, because there's a but if there's a but if there's a color change, this has to be one of the color changes, okay? So you can actually orient it that way, and then there's always a way to trace back. So you went to your own site, then what do you think? So you end up tracing, so every three that you draw traces back to the origin, which says that you actually have a connective connection. So there's a cyber drawing, or it could be a circle. Circle. Okay. Because if you ever have this situation when the actual caps off and both of us are heading back towards the normal channel, this ends up being those separate finite center finite cooks. So you have several different parts of the natural weakness. And then if you're not the weak part, the poster, it is a hypothetical subject. But that's the snake. So that's the state. Okay. So then it's like, oh, and then it accumulates the boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Then there's an actual boundary. See, the way we chose to sneak was focusing on the regions. Right, you just find it all here. And with our common numbers. Corresponds to being lie closed only with respect to the regions. The regions correspond to things generated by two adjacent edges of a tree, which corresponds to something that's conjugate to two adjacent edges of the origin. That's a standard parabolic. The others are arbitrary parabolic. So if you're buying closed with respect to parabolics, and if there's a snake that gives you a scent that's black. Like if you said that's black welfare box. But then buy closed is more. And so then on the second day, the show buy closed whole stock is actually the hypopline. So the hypoplane actually separates roots and the skin. Wow. But yeah, those are the snakes. But yeah, those are the snakes. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's that's cool. And then two, three, and fifty. So being bipolar with respect to every, you know, rank two parabolic is not going to be enough. It has to do with one lane or something. Yeah, but there's sort of a useful page on something. There ended up being like a snake equivalence class. You like you draw a snake and like little wiggles. I will let you know. And as you do little wiggles, basically every snake equivalence class ended up having a Equivalence class ended up having a unique pipeline representative. Okay. The snake ends up wandering along some biome that attached in the tree. Yeah. And there's lots of snakes that didn't put away with say biome. So, yeah, and then the three. And then the three, three, two peaks. So give me an arbitrary generator rating. Like I don't have anything. There's lots of universal concerted groups inside. Okay, I know that don't intersection. Generates a yeah, right? And so for that one, it has to be like a sleeve. And so there's going to be nice end points. So that gets you started. What's special about the 2.3 Infinity is that it has a universal colour. Ah, yummy. And so you draw the snake that comes from that, and you actually see that you've got the same. Once you put all the screens and kick on the edges, that all the other fellows player just opened up. Do you have something to report? Yeah, very cool. So, when are you guys taking off? So, when are you guys taking off? Um, in an hour and a half. Oh, you're on the level three? Yeah. I've had my flight tomorrow morning. There was nothing, even, I mean, I still have connections, but there was nothing this evening. So I'm just gonna hang around. Yeah, well, it's nice. I mean, yeah, it's lovely. And then there's one or two people that are staying for a conference next week. Oh, yeah, there's no, no, but there's the conference. No, no, but there's the conference here next week if like some kind of cluster algebra's freezes thing. I think Amina is here for that. Oh, that's really definitely pulled to chocolate stuff. Oh no, no, I guess they're out. No, we want to go to FL2A4. Iron said, yeah. Yes, no, no, I'm not sure. I just want to recheck that I'm actually getting still the right annotation. Getting still the right annotation. Yeah, I mean, I should get back at least kids, but yeah. Well, but if you can't, it's just not possible. How are you all doing? Gotta get one more bit of sweets. I've never eaten so many desserts in a week. This is really good. Or I don't think I have. It's maybe like in Vienna or something. We'll call. Yeah. And I went to Vienna for FipSec. Every morning I went. Feel sick. Every morning I went to this cafe next to the dorms, and my breakfast every morning was Milsch Cafe, which is, you know, coffee with milk, and Appfelstrude. Applestrude. It's like, I had it the first day. It was so awesome. I'm like, this is going to be my breakfast. Because you can't always do this. Did you see Renee's question in the Discord about whether we should include in the paper the 1001 people bid on Nakiyama algebra? I don't know what the hell is that? Yeah, well, I also understand. I also don't know what an Akuyama algebra is. Yeah, and here's like in a very elementary way. I suspect he doesn't know what that elementary way is. I guess I'm sort of relieved as well. I mean, it still seems to go right. We don't have a good example of that. I don't know. I don't know. I also think that the control system might be good. I do like the idea of the speech. I'll push that like if you all it like, then like maybe there's maybe there's some reasonable. Way a million years ago, with Peter McNamara, were we thinking about scrimmage? Are we thinking about some kind of like postets that have someone? No, we're getting. Oh, yes, of course. Well, okay, but like, oh, I guess independence is also going to be like, yeah, I guess that would come with the same sort of canonical linear order. Yeah. They were giving up these two money files. Yeah, it's working with you, but it could be a little more nervous about that these days. Sure. It's always a good idea. It's always a treat to watch the master at work. Yeah, I mean, we had a good run there for partly just started thinking about the program. I agree. Yes, we can use this. We've got our trying. Here's the hyperbolic disc. I've drawn it all the way inside because now it's the code. Did we need to do this five sets of posts? I think it's great. There's the complexity inhibition. So the rules are feeling. It would make sense to go through. This is only the frustration of the freakiness of not knowing whether things fall. There's not that much, right? That was the severe. I think it's the best 2C power here. Yeah, corresponds to the current. So if you're working with sort of real versions of my post with the child, every line has now to use a color change. There's a deep that if you're like, okay, well this line is actually all colours on this sort of It's actually all solid colours, sort of nice and solid. You don't mean with a unique color change. Yeah. Right? And then there's going to be a similar sort of color change over here. Oh, okay, I need to go. Okay. And then because of the complexity, you actually know that all of this is going to be rare. I didn't follow the what was the colours? We're talking about pipelines. We're talking about bike cloth sets when we say order. This is like, we're like deep into our front, actually. But then you sort of have this yellow line. Yeah. Right? Yeah. And so I was partly thinking about this, not just here, but I was thinking about it in the higher right. And so you have some simplex in high-dimensional space, and you've got a ball model. Yeah. And you end up having, on the edges of the simplex, you end up having unique transformations. Edges of the simplex, you have to paddle unique transition points, and then you might worry that if you had like a red, red, blue, blue, then you'll end up getting something that on the boundary looks like sort of a yellow quadrilateral. Right. Yeah. And you might worry about whether these are all coplanar. Right. But you can tell that they have to be. Yeah. But you can tell that they have to be the red. Yeah. Because the things that are yellow have to be approachable from the red and can't from the blue. And because of that, you can end up seeing that this actually has to be coplanar so that there really is a hyperplane. And so this is just a way of rephrasing the. So if you do the real version where you're not discreet, then all real by close sets are. By close sets are weakly separable because you end up getting a hyperplane, you get a hyperplane, and then on that hyperplane, you have to make another choice, and that might have another hyperplane, and there's another choice. If it really was. No, but so if we went up dimension by one, we could have an all-red triangle, but I guess that would be okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have a blue dot and a red triangle and you cut it off. Yeah, you show things work there, and then it has to kind of work its way up until Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, and so this was just a way of rephrasing the separable and weakly separable as being basically as being the real version of my closed. And then when our roots are dense in a sufficient sense, then this kind of thing still works. That's kind of what I was doing with those triangles. So the thing that this really reminded me of is like, okay, we've got some discrete. It was like, okay, we've got some discrete set inside some continuous thing, and the properties of the discrete one are extending to the real. And that sounds, that kind of rigidity sounds to be like lattices of the groups. And it's like, oh, wait a second, this is a lattice of a Lie group. Right? Because the symmetry is a hyperbolic space is a Lie group. And the subgroup generated by the Cox group is a lattice, if you're in a co-finite polyps. And so it's like, maybe that's why this is working. Like, maybe that's why this is working. That we're saying we've got bi-closed sets on some lattice inside a particular Lee group, and therefore it's really coming from something continuous. Yeah. And so it didn't go, it didn't, like I said, I thought it was going to solve everything, but I thought it was kind of a pretty it may be that like David found this one argument, but we may, my goal is to have it like an explanation as opposed to a proof. As opposed to a proof, you know what I mean. I want to say one more thing, which is that once I started thinking about these continuous sets of things, I was like, okay, well, what does that look like in the disk? Which reflections are we allowed to use? And so like this corner corresponds to some hyperplane, as does that one, as does that one. So sort of say what you end up having is that there's we have our fundamental domain. Our fundamental domain, these points correspond to reflections that don't cut the fundamental domain, if and only if. And so basically you're ending up looking at saying, I've got my fundamental domain and I'm allowed to use any reflection that moves it off of itself as a way of reinterpreting that. And then you could change this from a From a triangle to. You don't care that it cuts enough than a cool cut. No. No, because you end up doing, since you're only allowing this, you could end up doing sequences of these reflections that sort of like this moves to somewhere, moves to somewhere, but it's not landing in a tie layer. It's just moving somewhere. And so you just are flipping thumb in the domain room when you're in the group generator of its continuum of generators. And in fact, And in fact, you can do this for, if you give me any convex set around the thing, then there's going to end up being a convex set one of these objects here, and you're using the reflections that move it off of it. Anyway, I was just trying to understand the context in which we're working and the continuous portion of the Yeah, and you know, and in this setting I'm doing, I'm also getting something like this. I'm kind of saying we have to have at least as much, you know, red here as we do here and at least as much blue or something. So, you know, in terms of the roots or something like that. I was setting my picture up like one, you know, using one red vertex, and then you could get a flipped picture using the other red vertex. Yeah. Cool. So how long are you around? Sorry, how long are you here? Are you leaving today? I'm leaving at 2.30. That's always tricky, though. Actually sometimes it's not the best uh Sometimes it's not the best uh strategy. What you want is to be able to go to bed at the right time. And so sometimes at night without sleep with help actually is called. So actually I think the best plan when you go to Europe is to sleep with a little bit, two, three hours. That probably will get you exactly at the right time for the time next day. When I've flown to Europe, I feel like if the flight leaves the United States later, I do better. If it leaves the United States at midnight, it's better than if it leaves at 6 p.m. for me because I see zero work or something. It's just the same, but then in one case, you have to sleep at the beginning of the fight and the other case at the end of the fight. Right. For me, I personally seem to do better with the midnight ones. The fact for me to sleep on the trainer must be very, very tired of the weather. I mean, they always start by serving you a meal, right? So you must be a little bit more. This would be at the end of the flight. This has already the end of the flight, yeah. But then you have to stay awake until it's lit enough when you never talk. Yeah, it's much easier to get the other way. You find it easier coming. Go west with much reason going east from it. Yeah, at least sometimes even going the time difference doesn't exceed eight or nine hours. But if 12 hours has no way when it's very bad going just 30 hours. Those are for you, what is uh India, yeah, the other worst. When the when the uh ICM was in India in twenty ten. Was in India in 2010. I flew there and I flew from San Francisco and we went over the North Pole. Yeah. It was sort of amazing. It was like, okay, we're going to go from California to Abu Dhabi, I think, was one of the teams works. If you go the right way, you might win one day. Yeah, one side of the day. Yeah, so twenty five is a world. No way to add that. So I learned a lot of high cooperation between. I knew nothing, so it was very easy to learn a lot. I mean, it's the first time I heard of Vertend Muller, actually. I knew the program well, but you know, Vertend Muller. Yeah, no, this week worked out better for me than I was expecting. This week worked out better for me than I was expecting because I was expecting everybody to be focused on finite things. And so, when the week order people were interested in hyperbolic flexible groups, it's I was hoping that someone would be through as it covered some people, but no one else. Well, I'm interested. Complex reflection groups. Yeah, I mean, we should have a big research like that. So, what kind of things are you thinking about with complex reflection groups and stuff? I mean, if we're seeing I'm always Everything. I'm always interested when it seems possible to generalize something to cover. So there are so many things which can be generalized. Yeah, specifically the finite ones or more general ones? Oh, no, I just studied the finite one. I will not look at this. Apart from looking at full systems, I will not look at anything related to a file or so um All right. So we haven't talked much math, but so I assume you know this result of Coxeter from 1954. It's like take a brain group on end strands and potion by the peak power of the generators, yes. Of the generators, yes. Yeah, then this is finite if and only if n minus two times n minus two is plus four. I guess you find that so yes, yes, yes, okay. And uh, so so when p is free, that's it. You should get up to p32, which means uh yeah. Yeah, so so if you write down n and p, if n is to. Two if n is two, then this is just cyclic right because that's z closure. If p is two, then this is just the symmetric group. And then other than that, there are basically five pieces. Yeah, so you have G4, G25, G32. And so all five are and now that's probably G8, I think this one. And with five. And with five, it's something like G16 or something else for. Right, right, right. Yeah, I don't know the subscripts very well, but I know that all five of these are complex reflections. Yeah, I can tell you for sure. I think that's... Oh, I can write down the diagrams. 425, 32, and that's 8. And I'm not sure for this one, which has two fives. We just two, I guess, sixteen. I guess 16, but electron. But yeah, so these are all nice couple X reflection numbers. You can also look at these border cases. And so like here, you'd be looking at not quite the This is almost, but not quite, the 3-stream breaker backing on a complex plane. So this is the triangular tiling. Complex plane. You could start here and you could do a 2π over 6, which is RFA. You could start here and you could do a 2π over 6 rotation. And And every year it would be a group? And so is that a quotient of this group? Yeah, this is a quotient of this group, but it's not this group. But if you, this group is acting on affine constant C, so one positive one zero, you can think of this as a affine patch inside C2. Your presentation was put it inside complex hyperbolic. This group is bigger, and then this acts on this bait. The difference is the key at the center of the brain is going to act trivial. But when you extend it, send it to activities. And I think the same thing is going to happen for those. I think these, so this is actually important. This is actually slightly extended sort of half-eyed complex. So yeah, you can see all these will be representations of the white book, but it's also do you know the dimension? So they're they're very natural affine colour, but they're very natural. Affine colour. They're very all three of these acknowledgment affine space, they have a finite quotient. And so they're sort of like this one is an extension of that. And so it's sort of I2 sig or something sort of is one way to put it. It's like to translate permutations. And then similarly, this is a finite complex reflection group extended. This is a finite complex reflection. And I can say exactly which groups. And I can say exactly the terms. And in fact, I think there's at some point there's their map from a grade 6 contract. Yeah, what got interested in the HICA algebra corresponding if he could find the HICA algebra for that. Yeah, so this is exactly that. Exactly that this is exactly what actually. Yeah, so this one is an AM extension on there. You have to push it up by the side. Yeah, basically, and whether or not. Sorry, when you say BF5, no, I mean, um, because you want this one, it type is uh It corresponds to F5. You want something corresponding to F5, which is S6. This corresponds over there to S5. Let's see. So this is going to be corresponding. We'll give you the button. Screen for five. Yeah. So this is a screen. So yeah, one thing is probably for this one, I'm not fine. For this one, I want five. Yeah, for that one, I want six. You are talking about this one is the finite one. Okay, it's finite one. This one's the output one. Okay, okay, yeah. Yeah, so this one has to come to that one. Okay. But anyway, yeah, so from the old result, we know that the only finite reflection groups that are potions of the grade group by in this way are those five. By ping this way, are those five? They're all nice and complex with function groups, but these three are really interesting. Yvonne was interested in some finite, some H algebra of finite dimensions, some quotient of the co-algebra of this one. Yeah, I don't remember what his model matching was, but I remember that he explicitly proved that there was a homomorphism there was a way to send a six-category group. There was a way to send the 6 ten-breaker remotes cubes to the 500-breaker mods cubes, which is a very unusual math. But I think there's a way to sort of add in affine geometry. Yeah, to understand how exactly. So I played with a couple of these, but this one I understand very well, and it actually hyperbolic perfection that's not displayed. And so this entire line makes sense to me, but this one's alpha and these are all hyperbolic. And then I played a little bit of this one, but this one's the one that I made drinks. Because it's closely connected to G32. Yeah, but it can be outputting across here. Anyway, but you already I assume you already read this result. That's very exciting. Yeah, I I forgot that. But I did not look at the proof of but they were actually actually I I've got an idea how I did not look at the proof. I didn't forget the proof. Yeah, it's a very short, maybe he was giving it to a general audience, a general math audience. It was the Canadian Math Society national meeting. And so he gave a talk where he was explaining to regular mathematicians. Actually, I have a vague idea that the classification of complex effects, a finite complex function group, is complicated because. It's complicated because on all these particular cases you have to look at it in dimension two. And I was wondering if there would be an argument like this, which would simplify drastically classification for dimension two. I think dimension two is easy. So I mean if you look in coin or original, it's not so easy. So you think it can be written much shorter than it has? Yeah, so please do it. Write it. This Swiss journal, which is for exposition. Which one? There is one paper dedicated to exposition, Swiss journal, I forgot the name, which is just for exposure mathematics. Okay, so imagine you've got a two-dimensional one that's happening on C2. Yes. Then it induces an action on CP1, right? Through the hot themat. And so it's going to act here by rotations. And so this is, you end up getting an action on the two-sphere by rotations. And two finding groups of rotations on the two-sphere gets either cyclic, dihedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral. Yeah, that's it, right? And if it's simply productive. And if it's simply codihedral, it's preserving a set of poles, which pulls back as a basis. And so these two are in the gene case, the hand case. And so it's really, so everything is either tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral. Yeah? Right? And so we know the image group. It ends up being things that we know the image group. But the thing is that you lose information when you look here. When you look here, right, and but if you if you go down here, if you look at the so if you go down here, you can see what possible complex reflections you could have. So like in the icosahedral case, you can have a vertex rotation, you can have a edge rotation, or you can have a phase rotation. Rotation. And so this is going to be order 5, order 2, order 3. Right? And so, I mean, when you look at the icosahedron, it's like you could be rotating a vertex. Your generators here could look like a vertex rotation, edge or face. And you always end up with all the vertex rotations, all the edge rotations, all the face rotations. If you have one, you have all of them. And so if you, if me. And so if you give me this is my notation for the dimension two. The non-empty subsets are three. These are the seven positions. Yes, so all of these end up having the osahedral group as its quotient, and you just need to know what the center is. So, from this knowledge, you can easily find the center. Yeah. Yeah, so that's more nice geometry. So, first off, there's a nice little fact that says that imagine you have a spherical triangle in this alpha beta gamma, and you have a rotation of 2 alpha, and you're taking. 2 alpha, a rotation of 2 beta, and a rotation of 2 mel. Then you get the identity when you take this tension. And the proof is think about the reflections. This is a trick that I learned from Panama. And so the rotation of 2 alpha around this point is equal to p times 2. Sorry, where P. Sorry, where P and Q are reflecting this line. Reflecting this line. So, this reflection followed by that rotation is a two-foot rotation, right? And so, if you do view that path, what you're getting is EQ through R R P. So, you get the idea. But now, imagine that these were really complex rotations up here, or complex rotations. Complex rotations up here, or complex reflections up here, that end up multiplying to beat the identity. So if you have RS and T complex reflections, that end up giving you R2 alpha ST theta, T2 gamma, and this could be density down here. That ends up meaning that this times this times this is in the center. This times this times this is in the center. And you want to know which one. And you can say what the center is. But then you get 30 is a center, but the center is a further 60. So let me go ahead and describe how if you tell me what triangle you're using, I can tell you which element of the center you get here. And so imagine you have some complex reflections, and I'm not going to ask you what they are, but I'm going to ask you to tell me how they act on CP1. And imagine that they end up looking like this picture down in CP1. Because they look like this picture down in CP1, in CP1 I know their product is the identity, and so I know the product up here is something in the center. I can actually tell you. Something in the center. I can actually tell you the center without knowing this. Yeah, so. And here's how. So in the case where you got all three times, can you show the center is a value 60? Yeah. So here's the general fact. So when you think about R, there's going to be, in some basis, it looks like e to the whatever, alpha i. Whatever, um, alpha i 001. It looks like a complex, maybe two. Um the next one looks like e to the beta i 001 in a different basis. And the third one looks like this in a third basis, but even though we were changing basis as we go through, this has a terminant. Determinant alpha i. We do this to alpha i. It says determinant to beta i, it says determinant to gamma i. And so the product has determinant to alpha plus beta plus m i and we know it's in the center. And so it needs to be Plus or minus. There's slight ambiguity, but up to a sign choice, you actually know exactly what the amount of. So you're telling me that if you do one half, but one third, but one fifth, uh no, I get something over thirty, I don't get something over sixty. Yeah, uh so so so here's here's the here's the um final thing to to uh Final thing to say, which is that once you see alpha plus beta plus gamma in a spherical triangle, that sounds an awful lot like the area. Right? The area of the spherical triangle is alpha plus beta plus gamma minus pi. And so what you can do is you can end up saying that the element of the center is actually e. The center is actually e to some very specific multiple of the area of the triangle. There's some constant here. And I forget what the constant is, but it ends up telling you that it's the thing of order 60. That if you take the. Yeah, I didn't get how you get 60 instead of 30 for what you told me. I didn't get well. You told me, I didn't get where exactly you're telling me. Okay, so if I take an icosahedron, I take an icosahedron that has 20 faces, and so let's go ahead and very simply subdivide and we're going to have 120 small triangles that look like. Small triangles that look like B E F. And if I do, if I have, if I'm, if I had N the top group, if I know that group, then I have this complex reflection, this complex reflection, and this complex reflection. And when I multiply those through, this area is 120th of the two-sphere. Yes, and I think the constant here must be 2 or something like that. Oh, okay. There's some constant that comes out of this formula that ends up saying it's 1/60th. And if instead you were looking at VE, then you could go and say, okay, what's the smallest triangle that I can build with just the V's and the E's? And when you look at the smallest triangle and you calculate what fraction of the area it is, Calculate what fraction of the area it is, that tells you the subject. That's what it is. I would love if you write something about the classification of student maturity. Because actually, really, it's too complicated for my taste. It's very nice, but you can. Yeah, and so, yeah, so this is the complex of like a course a couple times out of letter and table. And then I point a shipper button picture. I need this for the control. Short button picture and use this for the two-dimensional. So for the icosahedral, there's just seven. Oh, you need the draw. But then if you're doing octahedral, you end up with two, three, four. Then you have to worry about the fact that this is not prime. And so the vertex order, are you taking off or you could have floor to it? So there's a lot of it. Sorry to. Yeah, sorry to use the nice week. Very nice to be. Yeah, so the Octi Devil series concept, you know, you've got E Death, but then there's E Prime E Death right below it, and then that's it. Yeah, I mean I think the details a little bit more important. People enjoy the testing work too. Some of the things are going to work too. But if you just take the tables from Lara Taylor and put them from the substitution, it's like you're not going to lunch, right? I'm not going to much. Take care. I can't put that very nice. So yeah, please write it down. All right. I should probably go. Yeah, we're going to go to our registration. Alright, gonna be Linda. I wish I could stick around and chat with more people. It's been a lot of fun. I really appreciate it. Yeah, so I guess you and I at least will be contact on the file. So you?                                                Well, we will make a cup of colour.  Jesus Christ, it's working.            Yes or that's time we're here, I'm sure. I just think I don't think so. Yeah, I want to point out. How much else do you think you just stayed inside on that one? Well, let's have a secret.                                                                                                Hello? Hello. Amalicht?  Thank you.    I have fun it has to uh perform your question logic of control curve. Yeah, okay. Okay. Nothing's big to use. I don't know. But not minimalist in bias. If I would not organize close. Okay. And I was essentially the same. Okay. But the shoes are small. But the market is too much. Okay, it's more of a   This is cool.
