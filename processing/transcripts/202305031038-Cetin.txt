Many thanks to the organizers for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to speak about this work. So this is still a work in but it's we already have a draft and if you Google it, if you Google this question, you can find it. There are still some things that we want to define. But so more or less the main ideas are in the paper and also in the presentation today. Okay. So I'm going to be talking about retail internalization. So a typical example of this is when you are, let's say, using some investment apps like Robinhood. So you place some orders while you are drinking your coffee. And then you think that Robinhood collects these orders and then sends it to the exchange to execute over there. To execute over there. But actually, this is not what they are doing. So, what they do, they collect all these orders and they send it to Citadel, whom we call as the wholesaler in SCO. So, what Citadel does is, of course, they also have their own clients, they also have their inventory. So, what they do is, so they they they take this order and then they uh internalize, meaning that that they they cross the trace that they already have. They cross the trace that they already have. And then they decide which parts of this amount of shares that are coming from CITADAP to internalize with their own inventory or send it to the exchange. So this is the decision that they made. And this is a practice that is actually growing quite fast because there is this recent paper from 2022 said that 2022 said that reports that if you look at the average share of internalized trades, given the weakest stock trading volume, this amounts to 17% of the whole volume. So this is a big thing. And what happens is that these wholesalers, by receiving this order from investment apps like Robinhood, the brokers, let's call them brokers, what they do is they pay. What they do is they pay for this order flow, and this is called the payment for order flow. So, this is something that is quite common in the US, and Robin Hood is a US app as well. But this is also a regulatory issue because this is about retail investors who are non-professionals, they're not institutional traders. So, regulators, of course, have a duty to protect them. And so, the UK, I do. And so the UK regulator thought that this is harmful to the retail investors, so they banned this. So whoever investment app keys in the UK, if the band they receive these orders, they have to send it to the history. And the European Union, I think, is also thinking at least to ban this practice. And there's a discussion in the US whether to ban this practice, but it hasn't been banned yet. But it hasn't been banned yet. They discussed this, I think, in 1997, and they thought it wasn't harmful enough at least to ban. But there is still an ongoing discussion about at least how to regulate this internalization. I always do this. Right, so the people who argue against this retail internalization say that, okay, so. They say that, okay, so this reduces the liquidity in the exchanges because what happens is that there is this big chunk of trades that are moved to the wholesalers, and instead of being sent to the exchanges, they are moved to the wholesalers. And at the end, this increases the execution costs on the exchanges. And in turn, this is also harmful for the retail investors because even if they receive some kind of price improvement. If they receive some kind of price improvement from these wholesalers, the price improvement depends only on the price of the exchange. So, if the price of the exchange goes up, then of course then they're not getting a meaningful price improvement. And there are some papers by Easley and some other authors that they have some academic papers that they show that actually this retaining. Retail internalization is harmful for these retail investors. But the main argument of all these papers is that the retail orders are uninformed. So that's why when you remove them from the exchange, the asymmetric information on the exchange is increasing. But if you look at some more recent empirical studies, there are some empirical studies that show that if you look at retail order flow, they can predict. Order follow data and predict the future returns, which might indicate that there is some improb trading in these retail orders as well. And if you look at the performance of internalization, they think, okay, so when there is some competition for this order flow, then this is going to improve the prices. And so again, there are some studies from the late 90s that show that. That show that if you compare the transaction cost where the trades are internalized and where the trades are not internalized, there's not really a harmful effect for e-tail internalization. Alright, so what are we going to do? So we answered this debate by comparing two trading mechanisms. So, what we will have is we will have two market designs. So, one of them is based on the model of Garliana, Peterson, and Poteschman. So, you have some liquidity suppliers that are kind of price takers, so there's you're looking for the market clearing price. So, what is different from them is that now we have the possibility of impromptu trader. The possibility of impromptu trade in this model. And of course, when talking about market impact with asymmetric information, of course, one of the canonical models is due to Kyle. And the second model that we will be looking at is an extension of this Kyle model, where you have this competing all-sailors that are competing in a battle fashion for this order flow. And then we're going to compare the products of the strategic trend. The profits of the strategic traders and the transaction cost in these two models, and try to decide which one is met for them. And interestingly, what we find at the end is that if you are looking for a strategic trader, and if you compare the profits of the strategic trader, who's going to be risk neutral in our model, actually they prefer the retail orders to be transferred to the wholesalers. So there's a reason why there's all these. So there's a reason why there's all these retail traders, retail trades being transferred to the wholesalers, at least in our model. And it doesn't matter whether they are informed or uninformed, they always prefer the traits being sent to the wholesalers. And we also have some noise traders in our model because you need them for the query. And if you of course they are not rational because they are not strategic, they are not trying to maximize anything, but They're not trying to maximize anything, but if you you can still compute the their loss because they always lose in these models and they are indifferent so their their profits do not decrease more under the wholesalers so they are indifferent and all the strategic traders are actually preferring the wholesalers to execute their trades. So our liquidity providers are Our liquidity providers are risk averse, so they have exponential utilities. So, by doing so, also we are extending the model of Garliano, Peterson, and Poteschman to allow adverse selection that is coming from the asymmetric information. And also, we have an extension of the Kyle model by allowing the market makers to be risk givers. Because in the previous studies of the Kyle and its extension, the market makers are always risk-muters. And this risk aversion of the market majors or liquidity providers, of course, having a backing from empirical studies. Because if you look at the empirical studies, what you find is that they try to have inventories that are mean-reverting around some target level, and this is, of course, indicating usually some risk aversion. And this is what we also find in this one. And this is what we also find in this work. Another interesting thing that we found is that we discovered a kind of a universal parameter that collects all these risks in the market. So there's the risk erosion parameter of the market makers, there's adverse selection that is coming from the existence of the insider, and there is the risk of the inventories for the market makers. And all of these things can be put into a single parameter. These things can be put into a single parameter, and that allows us a comparison over the markets in terms of their liquidity measures. All right, so let me start with the market with competitive agents. So, this is going to be the market that models the, let's say, the lit exchange. So, what we have is again, we have a single risky acid with the fundamental value. So, we're going to be assuming that this fundamental value has a normal distribution. Because this would allow us to solve everything explicitly. And also when I discuss later on the competition between the market makers that are risky averse, this is also going to be very useful. This is also going to be very useful because it will simplify the problem a lot. So, let's assume that we have some asset that is going to be threaded over this interval from 0 to 1. So, this is probably going to be a short take, so it is probably okay to assume it is a normal distribution. And the risk-free interest rate is 0. And as usual, we have three types of agents. The first Class of agents are the so-called noise traders, and what they have is that they're not strategic, and the accumulative volume in this whisky asset is given by sigma times some round of motion. And then there is an insider, let's say. So let's start with an incon trader already. And this insider knows the value of V from time zero onwards. And the insider is. And the insider is disputed, so she wants to maximize her expected profit out of trading. So, what happens is that, of course, all these things are combined together, and then let's say this is collected by some broker, and the broker is going to decide whether he wants to sell these orders to this exchange or to the wholesalers. So, let's look at the problem of the exchange. So, the liquidity is provided by this competitive. By these competitive agents. So they observe net demand, which is given by sigma vt plus xt. But of course, this xt is going to have some important information about the value of the assets. So what they do is they basically do some filtering from this total trait to get some conditional distribution about the value of the Value of people. This is going to be what is important for the price. And what we assume is that they are perfectly competitive and they form a continuum of mass one. And they're all identical, so they have the common risk aversion parameter row. All right, so this is what we mean by the equilibrium here. So we're going to be looking for some market clearing price like this. So basically, what is going to happen is you're going to be looking for some drift term plus some lambda terms which is going to be weighting the total, the changes in the total demand. Of course, in the equilibrium is that we find lambda is going to be a constant. But we don't exclude all the other possibilities in this framework. So what happens is that Is that so? Given this price process, the insider is going to maximize the expected profit. And what the competitive agents are going to do is, so you have them indexed by this A, and A is any real number between 0 and 1. So they have this expected utility from the final VAT. So this is the VAT from trading between time 0 and time 0. From trading between time zero and time one, but at time one, of course, the price is going to be jumping to V, and this, so you're going to be holding theta one shares at this point, and then you liquidate, this is the extra profit that you make at the final date. And then you compute the utility from this data, and then you maximize overall the data. And the inside of this is neutral, so she's going to be maximizing the extra. She's going to be maximizing the expected wealth, but of course, state is going to be replaced by X. And then you have market clearing. If you add all the trades of the liquidity providers, they should be taking the opposite side of the total work, which is the X star that is coming from the insider and Z, which is the noise divide. Yeah, so thanks to the Gaussian structure, Thanks to the Gaussian structure, we can find the clue we make explicitly in this case. So let me write in the differential form. So in this framework, what happens is that the insider, of course, wants to exploit her information advantage, but the problem is since the price depends on the whole demand and the changes in the demand, of course she has to be careful with the rate of trading, because if you trade too much, then you move the prices too much and then you lose your informational Your informational advantage by paying high transaction costs. So, at the end, what happens is that she's going to be trading in a continuous fashion. And this is a finite deviation strategy, right? It's absolutely continuous. So she's going to be choosing this alpha t dt. And so I'm going to be talking about the optimal strategies for the insider later on, because it's going to be similar to the second model as well. To the second model as well. But what is going to happen is that: so, this is how the insider sees the total demand, but what the liquidity provider sees is basically some filtering problem, right? So, in day one filtration, you're going to be having some innovation process plus the projection of this alcohol into the filtration of water. Alright? And in equilibrium, this alpha hat is given by this term over here. So when the insider trades optimally, given this price process, she makes sure that the inventory, the total inventory of the competitive agents, remain a mean worth of process. And the mean reversion is around the level zero. And what we don't see here, because this is the demand process and the price process from the point of view of the liquidity providers, but the alpha t is, of course, different than this. So the alpha t is going to be this term plus something else, which is going to disappear when you project it down, but the point of Projected down, but the point of this extra term is to make sure that you have some kind of a bridge, a Gaussian bridge, let's say over here, so that when you plug in this yt onto this Plusian rule function, then p star one is becoming equal to v. Okay, so this is always basically what is happening with the chi-move. Basically, what is happening with the Kyle model and its extensions, the insider is trying to make sure that the prices converge to the actual value. And the way you of course show this, at least the optimality for the competitive agents, is by duality because you're having an exponential utility here, so you know how to solve this. You just do some uh background engineering and you are expecting the Gaussian process. Expecting a Gaussian process. So the optimal value should be of this form, but given the pricing rule, you know what L should be. So you can find that log L1. And then under Q, right? So under Q, the price should, under Q, the price should be a markingale, which means Y should be a markingale. But this means that we have. But this means that you have to get rid of this drifter, so you're just going to be having sigma times the grounding motion. Okay, so you know the distribution of y1 star, and then so you can compute w star by taking the appropriate expectations, and then when you put everything together, you know that they match, and then you have the market convenience. All right, so as in the kind model, what you have is the price of the near. What you have is the price is the linear function of the demand, and the prices are converging to the actual value of fee. But what is different is that in Kyle and its extensions by BEC, the demand is not mean-reverting, it's a marking here. But now we are having a mean reverting demand. And the reason for this is, of course, there's some kind of missharing that is happening between the liquidity providers and the insider. So the insider is kind of helping the So the inside is kind of helping the liquidity providers so that the inventories do not fluctuate too much. And we can also do the same thing with a strategic trader, which is uninformed. So you have now another mean version with a different speed. The form is very similar to what we have seen before, but it's a different lambda. But it's a different lambda. Okay, so here you have rho gamma square over two and in the previous case you have lambda which is bigger than rho gamma square over two. You have some additional terms here that is coming from gamma which is gamma square which is the variance of v and sigma square is the variance of merge strengths. Alright. So this is what we have. So this is what we have. And another interesting thing here, which is different than the case with the insider, is that now there is a jump in the trading strategy of the strategic trader. So strategic trader trades continuously until time one. For that time one, basically she becomes another market maker, right? So she just takes half of the orders and so maybe. And so reduce the inventory of the market maker significantly. So again, it is median working, but it is medium working at a slower speed because the risk of market makers are slower now, are lower because they don't have the adverse selection risk. Okay, so now let me look at the case with the whole saving list. So the difference here now that we are not looking for the market clearing price in the previous case, but now the wholesalers are going to be offering price and they will compete in a bar turn fashion to get the orders. So whoever offers the best price is going to be getting this order. So the problem is, of course, how are you going to describe this competition? So I'm going to be doing it today. So, I'm going to be doing it today simply here, so the details are more in the paper, but let's only look at the beginning of the trading in a very small time interval, let's say from zero to delta. Okay, so the number of shares that are going to be allocated is going to be delta y. So, this should be y delta minus y zero, and y zero is zero. Okay, so the market makers are going to be quoting L lambda and phi. Get lambda and phi. So you have n market makers. So this means that when they clop lambda and phi, they are going to be absorbing this demand at price lambda i times delta y plus phi. And let's say delta is small enough and delta y is infinitesimally small. So the interesting thing here is if the market makers quote different phi i's Alright, so here, since delta y is very small, the leading term here is now phi. So if they quote different phi i's, then the buy order is priced at the minimum, of course, of all these values, and the sell order is priced at the maximum of all these values. Okay? And then you have a negative bides spread. So of course then the inside. Of course, then the insider is going to be taking advantage of this by profitable round trip trades. And so, whoever is getting the order is going to be actually having an infinite amount of loss. Okay, so and then you can do this, of course, for later dates as well. So, at the end, what happens is that they don't compete on phi, so they are competing on lambda. So, if we fix the phi, So if we fix the phi for all of them, and now if you look at the cost of execution, then it is lambda i times delta y square plus phi times delta y. So the minimal cost obviously is going to be the one that has the smallest lambda. So the competition among the market makers is actually offering the smallest lambda, which is kind of the pretty cost of small trades. Okay? Okay, yeah. So now this is kind of nice because so now we don't have to worry about the phi's. So we are fixing the phi for all the market makers and they are going to be quoting lambdas and the prices are going to be of this form. So you have phi of t plus the integral of lambda of s dys and at every point the smallest lambda is going to be chosen. All right. All right. And all market makers are identical, so we limit our search for a symmetric equilibrium. And one key point to remember is when a market maker tries to, let's say, deviate from a candidate equilibrium, then he has to take into account the action of the insider as well. So you're not fixing the response of the insider. The insider is going to be responding to this deviation. Would be responding to this deviation in the lambdas. Right, so this is a little bit of a technical result, and it is even more technical at the paper because we have to consider different, a bit more general situation than this. But let's say we are looking for a phi which is constant over time, and you have lambdas which are right. Lambdas, which are right-continuous functions, but piecewise constant. Okay, so in a way, I say this lambda is the market lambda. So we can get lambdas like this. In principle, they can be any piecewise constant functions. All right. All right. Uh, but what we find is that uh if the lambdas are decreasing on 0, 1, okay, so this is time 0. So let's say this is time 0 and this is time 1. And here 1 is not included, so it's And here one is not included, so the final data is a little bit tricky. So let's say all the market papers first choose a lambda. And then let's say some deviating market maker decides to undercut these market makers. So let's say there's some time S, and then this guy decides: okay, I have made enough money, so I can maybe. Enough money so I can maybe get more trades by less than undercutting the other guys. Because what happens is when everybody is quoting the same lambda, the order is allocated randomly to one of these market makers. So even if you quote the same lambda here, you may not get the order, but we can think of this. So at type S, I'm going to be undercutting the other guys, and I'm going to be having all the order myself. Okay? Myself. Okay? But if he does that, then the insider is actually going to be making infinite profits in this case. So you can show that if you want to undercut the others, you cannot do it sometime in between. If you want to undercut, you have to undercut it from time zero. And then what we can do is we can go slowly up to that lambda level. That lambda level later on. So the lambdas can increase over time. But what happens is that at any point of discontinuity of lambda before time one, the insider's optimum strategy is to make sure that the prices converge to the wrong valuation. So if the insider knows everything, then V tilde is V. If you are an uninformed strategic trader, V tilde is just the expected value of V. Okay? And then differently than the other kind models, you have In Angela-Kai models, you have this strange condition at time one that if you have because you can basically change the value of lambda at the last instant because there could be some bulk traits that are coming at time one. So we are not assuming that the insiders or strategic traders are continuous so they can make jump trades. So the So the so this is basically saying lambda one which is the lambda at the next instant after time one minus should be greater than or equal to lambda of one minus over two. So in this case, so let's say it is the same lambda by the other guys By the other guys at time one. So there's a deviating market maker who did not quote lambda, so he doesn't get the order up to time one. And let's say he quotes lambda over three at time one. Since this is a smaller lambda, of course, he's going to get to order, but as soon as he gets to order, he's going to be incurring an infinite loss. Most okay, so you can undercut only by half. Why is it half? Because this is a quadratic optimization problem at the end, so that half is coming from there. And then the interesting thing here is you can find the equilibrium, and in this case, there will be two equilibrium, so it's not just one. But what happens is that the lambda is exactly the same. Uh this is in line with these other uh papers, the empirical papers that I have uh discussed at the beginning that the transaction costs are not really changed by moving from the competitive agents to the whole savings. Okay, so the lambda is exactly the same, but of course the mean reversion level is different. So if you look at y star, it is not mean reverting around zero, it is mean reverting around a different level. Around a different level. And this is because the market makers are competing, so they can take more risk. So they don't have to have inventories that are linear working around zero. But the speed of linear version is exactly the same. Just to say A here, but we have a B now which is not zero. And then And then the speed of mean reversion is the same, but you have now two different mean inversion levels, BI's. And I think the reason for this is because they don't want to have inventory risk, but they don't really care about the sign of this inventory. So as long as what matters for them is the magnitude of the inventories rather than the sign. So that's why you have two different meanings. two different uh linear version levels. And let me briefly describe how you find this this equilibrium. Okay? So we know that in equilibrium lambda must be a non-decreasing function over 0, 1. So let's say you have, we are looking for the optimality of the squared at lambda, and we are thinking about a And we are thinking about a deviating market maker. So, again, so what is going to happen is that either you're going to be the winning market maker, let's say at time zero, so you quoted lambda, but at time s, let's say you have quoted lambda plus one, meaning that you don't want to make the market after that point. Okay, so this is one form of deviation, and the other form of deviation is again like what I said before. Deviation is again like what I said before, you undercut at times zero and then you slowly increase your number. Okay, so that is a more complicated case, so I'm not going to be talking about that. But the easier case is the first one. So you keep your orders and let's say until time tau jing, which is the exit from the market. And this is the final value of the market maker. Of the market maker. So you have profits until time tau j, and then you have y tau j, and then you're going to be liquidating it at the final time at price P and you bought them at price P tau star, and so this is going to be the external profit. And then what you do is you find your equilibrium parameters so that this guy is a martinier. So it's not optimal to to optimal to to uh to do this kind of thing and because of the uh competition expected to gain is zero and but as I said before the target level of inventory is not zero but it is some other constant and you can do the same thing with the uninformed trailer it's a much simpler Trader, it's a much simpler equilibrium in this case. Again, lambda is again the same as in the competitive case, rho gamma square over two. But the difference with the strategic uninformed traders is, of course, they don't know strike the bridge. So the price at Taiwan is not equal to mu, it would be something else. And it could be random. But here, I mean, this is the jump of the strategic trading at Taiwan. So basically, what she does is she Basically, what she does is she takes almost all the inventory from the market makers. And so, basically, the market makers have no inventories get time. So, let me skip this and talk about this row and parameters if I have finance fair. Right, so what we have seen so far is. So, what we have seen so far is we have two market designs, and lambda, which is the most probably important parameter of liquidities, is the same in both of them. And now, what we're going to be looking at is what is the impact of risk aversion on the liquidity parameters. All right, and so now, so remember the utility at time one is given by one minus exponential minus two times w. Where w is the one. So let's multiply this rho by gamma times sigma n and then divide this by gamma sigma. And then we call this rho gamma sigma rho n. Okay, so rho is the risk aversion parameter. Sigma is the volatility of noise trace, which is an inventory risk for the market makers. And gamma is the let's say the adverse selection risk because this is the variance of V, which they don't know. This is the variance of V, which they don't know, but the insider knows. Okay? And then, if you do this, you get a utility of this form. And then this W over gamma sigma is kind of dimensionless. And the reason for this is W is, this is the word, this is time times currency. And gamma squared is the variance, so this is currency squared times time. I mean, we do it only of of course zero, one, but you can continue in principle. Continuing in principle. And sigma square is the quality variation which is in units of time. So W over gamma square makes the things unitless, and then Mr. Roam allows us to compare over different markets. And let's suppose mean is zero for the following plot, and let's start with the profit of the noise traders. Noise traders. They are not strategic, of course, so they, I mean, they don't have any choice, but if you compute the expected profit, then you find it's equal to minus lambda times sigma squared because they lose. And lambda is the same in both markets, so they are indifferent. And then this is the profit of the insider and strategic trader. Right, so these are the values of the So these are the uh the values of expected profit of the insider and the uninformed strategic trader. So we have here gamma times sigma, and gamma times sigma is the profit in the current model. So this is where rho is equal to zero. So as you see, if you normalize everything by gamma sigma, they all become a function of rho and all the and this additional value is the difference between these two of it and these functions are always And these functions are always positive, so they always prefer the market makers to competitor agents. And then you can look at the value of information, which is suppose you're a trader and then you are interested in buying this information. So you were an uninformed strategic trader and then you want to purchase this information from somewhere. From somewhere, how much would you pay for this? So, this is the value of information. So, you just subtract their profits. And the interesting thing here is it is not monotone. Everything else that they will see is monotone. But this thing is not. So, at least for because the question is, of course, what is the meaningful range for this row n, right? Rho gamma sigma? The decision to acquire information uh twice. Information so I mean we don't we don't okay so I understand your question but we don't model that what we do is so let's say if you were a strategic trader uninformed this is how much you would get and if you were and if you were informed then this is how much you would you would you would This is how much you would get at the end. So you kind of make this decision before the market starts. Income trader in the market to strategic tradition. So everybody knows the type of strategic trader. Yeah, so this is, I think, this was the interesting plot that I wanted to show that will tell you that the value of information is not monotonous. Of information is not volatile. But if you look at the market depth, then again, everything is once you normalize by the Kyle's depth, then everything is a function of this rho m again. But these things are monotone. So this is exactly, so the depth, the relative depth is decreasing in rho m compared to the curve. So what we also have is, of course, as we have seen, we have also price reversal in this framework because Reversal in this framework because, so in Kai, of course, the prices are martini, so there's no reversal. But here we have negative of the correlation, so there's a reversal in the prices, and then you can again compute the intensity of the price reversal, and everything becomes now a function of rho. And of course, in Kyle, there is no price reversal, so we are not in we are not scaling by Kyle, it's these are the exact values of of price reversals uh as functions of A. Uh as functions of correlation. So to conclude, what we find is that ex-ante, so it means if you compute the expected profits, all strategic traders prefer market makers to competitive agents. And we have this universal parameter that allows comparison for the markets with different uh raw, gamma and sigma values. Raw gamma and sigma values. And the market depth decreases, of course, when the market makers are risk averse. They become less efficient. They converge slowly to the fundamental value and they exhibit price reversal. The surprising result is that the value of information is not monotonous. And so, of course, the reason behind all these things is risky aversion of liquid supply. These things is risky aversion of liquidity suppliers requires the insider to share this risk with them and then so that there's some equilibrium. So you have a miniverting inventory level and the target level of inventory is higher in market makers' equilibrium because of competition they can take a little bit more risk. And the reason for this is competitive agents. And the reason for this is competitive agents have positive utility, so but the market makers have zero utility, expected utility at the end. So they have some room to take some extra risk and this is perception in competition. So that's all I have to say thank you very much. Questions? Maybe
