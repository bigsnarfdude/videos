Also, you know, the fact that the tour got cancelled, I think that was meant as a sign that you should take a wildlife warning seriously. You can ask Ilya for reenactment if you want his Ilya and the elk story. So anyways, we're happy that everyone made it here. I think we've got a pretty funly planned. So without further ado, let's start. Alright, thank you so, so much to the organizers for making this happen. It's really an amazing place, and it really has a special feel in this conference for me. It's a bit of a birthday conference, it's the 10-year HHS. I quite like that. Okay, right, so what I'm going to do in this talk is talk about combinatorial HHSs. So that's a way to prove that something is an HHS, which Which since you're at this conference, I'm assuming it's something you think is reasonable to try and do. And I want to kind of give you the definition right away. I want to illustrate it first for the case of the curve graph and the Martin class group. So let's call this a case study. So case study and Martin close group on the surface. Group of a surface and any square graph. So, right, what's the HHS structure on the mapping class group? So, HHS structure of the mapping class group, well, it is like there's other data, but it comes with, you know, the main piece of data is a collection. Piece of data is a collection of hyperbolic spaces, and these hyperbolic spaces are the curve graphs of subsurfaces. So, okay, see y, y subsurface. Right, and then there's a map from the mapping class group to the various curve graphs and other things, but the main thing is this collection of hyperbody species. And now, the key remark that kind of got us started on Combinator. Of got us started on combinatorial HHS, is that the curve graph of the main surface contains all of these. So see the curve graph of the main surface contains all of these hyperbolic spaces as links of synthesis. I will illustrate this in a second. But this is maybe kind of the main insight. And it's false, as stated. So this contains two lies. This statement contains two lies, which we will explain in a second. Okay, so let me illustrate this fact. So the easiest surface to illustrate this with is just the complement of a curve. So the complement, so if you take s minus gamma, so some curve gamma, I mean so this is s and d. So this is S and this is gamma. What are the so C S minus gamma is has vertices all the curves contained in S minus gamma which is the same as saying all the curves disjoint from gamma just to say that this you can identify with the link of gamma so again so what's the what's the link of gamma? So it's all the curves in Japan. Gamma, so it's all the curves that shown from gamma, which is to say all the curves containing S minus gamma. So for subsurfaces that are a bit more complicated, they're not just a component of a curve, instead of the link of a single vertex, you have the link of a simplex. So the link of a simplex is all the vertices connected to that simplex, to all the vertices of the simplex. So if you want the paragraph of Of maybe this subsurface. So you can describe it as a link in various different ways. For example, as the link of these two curves I'm all about to draw. Like this one and this one. You could change this curve to something else. You can change this curve to something else if you want. Okay, this is clear. So inspired by this, there's a question. Maybe I can put it here. So CS contains all these hyperbolic spaces. Could it actually be that it encodes the whole HHS structure? HHS structure of the mapping cluster. So that would be fantastic. You know, the HHS structure has lots of data, lots of pieces of data. There's like projections between these subsurfaces, like correlations between them and all that. Could there be that there's this one object that that encodes That encodes all of this. So, okay, so now maybe the first lie gets revealed. So the first lie in that statement is that this is actually not quite reasonable for the test group because the cur there are some curved subsurfaces that are not links, and those are curved offs of lineula. So the charge graph of an annulus is not a link. It's not a link in the paragraph. Okay, so there's annuli are the most complicated surfaces. Text that are really painful. Yes, in particular, they're the only ones because they have a completely different definition. They have a completely different definition of the current graph, and it just, you know, they don't show up as things. So, okay, so maybe, maybe not quite this, but maybe for the pants graph this could work. Maybe it works for the pants, which I will recall it. So, but in short, the Plant's graph is some graph that is an HS, and the HSS structure has hyperbolic spaces, which are all the curve graphs of non-annular substrates. Maybe that's the object whose HHS structure is encoded by the curve graph and follow. So, I'm gonna follow up with this. Okay, so the Panzgraph so it's a graph, it has vertices and it's a x. So it's a graph, it has vertices and edges. The vertices are passed compositions, which you have a collection of curves that cuts out your surface into pairs of fence. And you can also think of a fence decomposition as a maximal simple clink in the charger. In the curve, I will probably just say simplex for now on because I got used to saying simplex for no particular reason. So fancy composition, so and that's the same as maximal synthesis of CS. Okay, so it's nice that there's a very clear connection between the vertices of the pencil and the curve on the. And the curve on. Okay, and what are the edges? So the edges are, so when you connect two fancy compositions, two fancy compositions are connected. So first of all, they share all but one curve. And the one curve can be changed according to a couple of different types of moves that I will go in a second. That I will go in a second. So you change only one term according to one of the following. So you could have a curve in your patch decomposition which looks like this. It is also a Fermi-Planet composition, and you switch it for something that intersects it once. You switch this one for this one. You have infinitely many choices. As long as these two intersect once, you're allowed to change one for the other. Persection number one. Okay, and this is. Okay, and this is the case when around a curve in the pensive composition you see a once functor torus, so genus one, one functor, or one boundary component. And okay, so it's possible also that around the perminear pens decomposition you see a four sphere instead. Okay, so you could be seeing this. Now on the fourth sphere, there's Uh now on the four sphere there's no curve of curves that intersect exactly once. The minimum possible number of intersections is two and so you can swap and that's how you define the move. So you're allowed to swap two curves if they intersect twice or nine intersections. And that's the genus zero or boundary component case. Okay, is it clear? Just a few essentially you just Essentially, you just keep all curves the same and then you change one curve with something that intersects either once or twice. Right, and so as anticipated, the reason we are brought this up is that the HHS structure of gas, so I mean, all the hyperbolic species in the HHS structure. All the hyperbolic species in the association structure of Ts are the Cy, so the curve complexes of non-annular subsurfaces. So all surfaces except annular, all subsurfaces except annular. Okay, so that's the pencil. And now related to the moves, I can reveal what the second lie was in this statement that In this statement, that curve graphs and subsurfaces are exactly links. So, the second line so in what's adjacency What's adjacency in a curve graph? So you connect two curves if they are disjoint, except for these two surfaces. So adjacency sigma one one and C sigma zero four. Okay, so you don't have any disjoint curves in there? In them, in either of these subsurfaces. And you connect them exactly with what are by one mood. So it's defined by the same moods. Alex, do you consider disconnected subsets or only connected ones? Yeah, so you need to consider also disconnected, but that's fine. I mean, for this connected, it doesn't really matter because you connect. I'm just wondering, like, are you including that in your data of all subsurfaces? Right, so you, yes, you have to for kind of You have to for kind of combinatorial accounting reasons, but from challenging perspectives, what the hyperbolic spaces are, those are bounded curve graphs. Okay, so let me show you what happens when you try to realize like the paragraph of sigma one one as a as a link. So Yeah, as a link. So let's say that you're you want to look at this sigma one one. So you you make up fancy composition of the complement. I'm sure I have to put this. Probably only one missing, not two missing. Okay, so you look at these curves and so the only curves is shown from this are contained in here. So that's fine. But there's no So that's fine, but there's no edges, like yeah. So the vertex set is correct, but the adjacency is not correct. Okay, so how do we fix this? So to fix this, we kind of need additional edges. And here's a way to of adding the correct additional edges to Additional edges to well, I'll do it for a general subgraph. We're interested in a link mostly, but I'll need the general graph, subgraph case also. So if you have a subset or subgraph of CS, you can denote its kind of its augmentation. So let's denote it like this. So you add the edges that come from the path graph. That's the denotation. That's what the notation wants to suggest. So that is phi, and then you take edges x, y. Okay, so that, in this particular case, the definition is more complicated. I mean, I could do it in a simpler way, but I prefer to do it this way, so it's better with what comes next. So union edges x, y, if you have two. Two fancy compositions. Basically, these are fancy compositions. One contains X, one contains Y. And these are connected in the past drive. So, if you think about what this definition means in this particular case, I'm just connecting. I'm just connecting curves that intersect once or twice. But instead of saying that, I'm going to say that you can complete these curves, your fancy compositions, and these fancy compositions are connected in PS, so they share all curves except X and Y, and then X and Y look either like this or like this. Regardless. Okay, so if I do this augmentation, like indeed, the collection of all paragraphs of subsurfaces is really the same as the augmented links. Augmented links. All the collection of the augmented links. And this is maybe kind of out to quasi symmetry. I connected a few more things, but I only connected things to intersect once or twice, so I didn't change the QI type of all the curve graphs except these two, and I got exactly the correct edges for these two. Is this uh have any questions? Yeah, because this is a query of the kind of graphic definite. It just wants to remove the weakness set, the exceptional subsurface, and you get back some other components. I'm just wondering, like, kind of like, we just look at adding edges when they up here and some, like, maybe you can choose some pants if you consider where exists. And wondering, can you think of the pants starting with pants graph and encoding that to get this graph? Well, I mean, which graph? Like the. Like this augmented code. For CS, like the whole thing. Yeah, for the whole thing. I mean, this is for any subgraph. You can do it for the whole curve. Subgraph. You can do it for a whole paragraph and you would just be connecting curves that intersect once or plus. So you don't change the third type. You can also do annual like here, a little bit, right? You could just get the all the curves that form a pancolic connected to this Pancomposition. Add the curve also to your Also, to your adding the curve to the link, okay. Adding the curve to the link is something I'll get back to. It might be a different idea than yours, but there is no way to add those things. Okay, so okay, so this is a little bit more technical. There's this way of adding edges which fixes this problem that we're gonna that you know that we uh definitely have that We definitely have that if we have a graph, then there are some links that are just discrete. And we don't like discrete links, so we have to write some edges to make them non-create. Okay, so now we are actually ready for the general combinatorialized HS, which is modeled on exactly this. Okay, so before there is, so So before I erase, so remember that hands depend positions are exactly maximal sequences. So the definition so X W so there is So up there is a combinatorial HHS so if x plays the role of the kernel graph or maybe I don't know if yeah let's say that x is a flat syncretial complex doesn't matter like the graph or a flat syncreticial complex x is a simple complex Complex. So, and W plays the role of the fence graph. So, w is a graph with vertex set, the maximal synthesis of x. So, synthesis of So we're going to put a condition on X, which implies that it's five-dimensional in a second. So there are maximum sequences. Okay, and right, and what are the conditions that it needs to satisfy? There exists constants. Does there always exist constant? And I, you know, I wouldn't normally like Normally, like write all the conditions, but you know, I don't want to like I will actually write all. So, and they come in, I would say that they come in two flavors. So, there's the three combinatorial conditions, and there's And there's one which is the geometric relation. Okay. So the first one is that it's a bit stronger than actually infinite dimensional, so you cannot have chains of inclusions of links which are arbitrarily long. arbitrarily long chains have length at most so this corresponds to you know the the hierarchy having bounded in many layers so the second condition there's actually a slightly more general ones that would work uh let me write to slightly simpler ones for simplicities And delta and sigma. There exists other simplices phi prime. Okay, so what I want to write in this condition is that the intersection of two links is a link. So in terms of the curve graph, so what are all you will like to say, okay, what are all the curves that are contained in two subsurfaces? That are exactly the curves that are contained in the intersection. That are continuing the intersection. There's some slight complication with the boundary components, so it will look a little bit more funny. So the link delta intersects with the link sigma is another link. And then there's some downloaded stuff. So this is the joint. Yep, sorry, what does the join mean here? What does the join mean here? So the join is, so that means that all vertices of pi are connected to all vertices of delta, and you just connect everything. Oh, okay. What a simplices. Symplices. Simplices. Synthesis. What's the bike frame? Yeah. Indeed, in the motor creating itself. So they. So, there are some boundary component issues. So, you could, let me see if I can make an example where the intersection mix exactly one curve. Right, so let's say that you look The component of these two curves. So that's one subsurface, so links. And then you apply the pseudonyms of in the component of this one. And then you have another subsurface, and the only curve containing both is this one. So in this case, this part becomes empty, and then we just have one curve. And then Sigma is then at the right if you want hot ID. Yeah. So you can yeah. You can do it either, right? Yeah, yeah, you can do it with either, yes. I could do it with either, yes. The pi is not sequent? No. So you should read this as the intersection of two subsurfaces is the subsurface contained in one of them. Correspondence between link and subsurfaces. Correspondence between link and subsurfaces. So then that's a projection of sigma to be delta. That's what's supposed to be written as pi some curves that fill the same amount of space as the signal. Right, yes, yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, so last combinatorial. Bas combinatorial condition is just weird. I don't know. I can't find any explanation about that. So, okay, if you have to, but you need it. So, this condition basically kind of guarantees that if you look at a link, it's also compared to our LHS. So there's some kind of compatibility of Compatibility of structures on links and structures on the whole space. But don't worry about it too much, but just for completeness, so if you have two versus the links of delta, these are not as adjacent. And Xi are containing some maximum synthesis, which are the Synthesis which are W adjacent. Synthesis which are W adjacent. Then you can replace those. So not only you have maximum synthesis which are w edges, and you can require that these maximum synthesis contain delta. Place that side. Sympathies contain it. Okay. That's... Don't worry about it too much. It's actually a bit of a pain in practice to implement this one because you have to fine-tune the the edges of W button. And but you're bored you can think why is this true for the passcraft and passcraping for X-grade that you're creating? Yes, so the WGI, so right, so um drawing delta will just draw as a point, but it could be a simplex. So there's x here, and there's y here in the link. And these are contained in Pence decompositions, or maximal syntheses. And in W, there's an edge between these two. So, and in this situation, I want to say, okay, I can replace these two actually with syntax like this and like this, which are still connected enough. Which are still connected in W. Oh, like they there are also maximal syntheses which are connected in W, which contain X this is also like the last condition we found, like when you were twenty one that I didn't prices like When you add additional ideas, it doesn't matter if you look at the whole thing or just in the context of the algorithm. So now maybe, like, we're mostly geometers here, so we're interested in geometric conditions. So the geometric condition is that these links are hyperbolic. Delta plus W is hyperbolic. So okay, these these will be so these are the colour graphs in our So, these are the paragraphs in our working example, and in general, these will be the hyperbolic spaces in HHS. So, this is not a hyperbolic, like all this constant. And also, there's a funny thing that you need, which is somewhat similar to the fine graph condition of Lodish, if you're familiar with that. It doesn't matter. So, this thing here is. This thing here is QI embedded in a funny space that we'll call y delta. So this thing, and somehow the HHS projection will come from closest point projections in this space. That's what happens. So you take X and you remove all the simplicities delta prime, which are the same length. Okay, so as I drawn before here, but it's disappeared, there's various ways There's various ways in which you can represent a curve graph. I mean, there's various simplicities with the same link in general, and so you remove all of them, and then you add the edges, the additional edges. And that's the case. So I would say that the main one the main point is the links are hyperbolic. So if you want some complex where all the links are hyperbolic. And that's when I give talks about this, that's what I usually say like this, and that's how could be other recognition. That's your your special audience. You're a special audience? Okay. So, and what's the theorem? The theorem is that if you have a unit or HHS, so the short version of the theorem is that W is an HHS. Okay. Probably and the more precise version of the theorem tells you that these are exactly the hyperbolic spaces. It tells you what the productions are, it tells you, you know, based on like when two syntheses are nested or orthogonal and so on. So it tells you the whole structure. But that's the main point. So you have to. So you have to, I think this is much shorter than the definition of HHS. It's much more much less painful to check and complete things. And it still gives you all the axioms and volunteer results. That's fantastic. Is an HSQI to work on other HHS? Sorry, what? If you have a general HHS, is it quasi-isometric to work? Is it quasi-isometric to a yeah, so uh most types. Um yes, so there's there's a partial converse. You need an HHS structure which is kind of nice enough. I mean essentially the combinatorial conditions are fine. And combinatorialized. I will this doing very badly with time. So this theorem does it doesn't apply to the mapping classroom so far. It doesn't apply to the mapping classroom so far, right? So far, no. I will tell you how it applied. You answered the question? Yeah, um so I guess can you take the constants in the HHS formula, like HHS definitions, and give formulas around terms of these constants over here? Uh right, yes. Yes, so I think that if you know these two, you know If you know GIS2, you know all the various pastels. Probably pretty bad, but yeah. Probably the main contributor is the fact that you have to show that this space is hyperbolic and you do it kind of by induction or complexity. I think all the concepts get to be bandaged. Okay. Um so So I was gonna comment on this funny space for the pencil. But maybe it's better that I tell you, illustrate how to use the criterion itself. So let me just say exercise the second half of four. second half of four for the pancraph using that the subsurface projection is leak sheets. Projection is leap sheets where the light. Okay, so it's actually surprisingly easy to show this condition for the, you know, in that case, of the pathography. You know, the fact that the, this is not a complicated fact about subsurface projections. You have these joint curves and you project them to a subsurface, they intersect, not much. Like, and that's all you need to prove explanation. And yes, but showing that the Pancraph is an HS using this, it's really once you know that her graphs are a per body, it's not hard. Okay, so let me illustrate how to use the criterion in a particular case. So which is actually pretty represent so this criterion has been used a bunch of times already and many of the times that it's that it got used look like this in some sense So let's say that we are interested in the rectangle Arting group on a path of length 3 Okay, so which can be decomposed as an amalgamated product like so. So it has a particular decomposition like this. So now what's the hyperbolic spaces that you need for this, to describe this? To describe this as the niche chest are the Baser T there's so and then kind of you know the product parts look like F2 times Z and so these are the other hyperbolic spaces except you have to to a certain conof of the F two's. You'll this is not so clear to you, ignore KONOF. Not so clear to you, ignore Konov, just think F2. And the other hyperbolic directions are set. If you have all this information, you can find a point in this space. So if you know where you're projecting all these things, you can find a point in the space. So, okay, so then what's our x? For this case. So we need to find some hyperbolic graph. So some graph whose links are this. That's what we want. So the first attempt would be to just use T okay. So in T So in T, I didn't say it, but I'm counting the empty simplex as a simplex. So the link of the empty simplex is everything. So the link of the empty simplex is T, and we recover one of the hyperbolic spaces. So that's fine. The link of a point. So here's the bus serve three. So what So what's the what are the I mean the link of a point is discrete but that's fine. I mean we know that we're gonna have to run into discrete like links at some point but it looks good because it's in bijection you know with exactly with the things you called off in this episode if you think about it. In this F2, if you think about it. So set coset of F2. Okay, so if you didn't follow this very much, don't worry. These are, like, once you add the additional edges, these correspond to this. This thing should also be fine. Third right type, but there's no No C's. Okay, so that's the part that we don't make. That's not the right. So, you know, okay, if you didn't follow this part, it's fine, but it should be clear that these Z don't appear anywhere as Niggs. So we have to force them to appear as Nick. So here's the trick. Trick, let's try to keep it online as well. So and here's a trick that um has been used in nearly every use of combinatorial HSS. Use of communatorial HD classes. So there's something that doesn't appear as a link, forces it to appear as a new. So you replace each vertex with something that looks like a square. Okay? And this is, you know, what you see here is the copy of what you see here. So instead of something that looks like this, you now have like all these squids and you connect everything to everything in squeezes that came from adjacent vertices. And essentially you force the And essentially you force the you force this last type of link to here. Okay, so right, so after after speedification we have recordification, we have records. Okay, so now let me tell you what happens in general and actually why scripts are so ubiquitous. And I will also tell you what's what the x is for the magnet. So I didn't tell you about the W edges. I was planning to, but I don't think I have enough time. There's a discussion session for me at RHHS, so I can tell you more about the W edges. Thank you. But at least we got something with the right links and attributes, the right candidates. links and actually it's the right candy. So in fact the X for the mapping cost group is obtained with the same procedure. We have all the right links except the curve graphs of annuli and so we what we do we force them. With pops, yes. So you replace every vertex in the paragraph with a cone over the paragraph of annual surrounding could you just do something like that? Just pick an element of your graphically a curve and an arc and you are covering this joint sort of base curve or right so I guess that that's what you're doing here. Yeah, but I don't want that chrome guide to be suspected. But you need the chrome guide to make that a l a link. Well, I'll copy them all to some other person. Have a curve without any Have a curve without any rule to also be a good so that's the one that seems to be. But that's the one here it feels unnatural. We have here to just have a twist information that's really comparable. Yeah, there might be a simpler one, but yeah. And okay, so and actually, how to use the criterion in general? There's a candidate for For x, for what you should use for x. If you have a candidate HS structure, you can make a candidate x and then try to show the properties, the properties. And it looks exactly like this in the case of the macroquest group. So x for the map request group is this. And for there's some combinators, so this doesn't always work, but But most times it works. So, what do you do? So, you start with the following. So, you look at your candidated set. So, you think you know what the hyperbolic species need to be. So, they're indexed by some indexing set. Index inceptive. So it would be the subsurfaces for the curve. So you look at the ones that are nest minimum, the ones that are at the bottom of the hierarchy. And then you can form a graph out of those. So this would be the annuli for the for the mapping cosine. So and then you do you can make a graph where you conduct Where you connect two of these if they're orthogonal. So for the mapping class group, orthogonality is disjointness. So what I described here is exactly the curved graph in the case of the mapping class group. And then the final step is that you replace everything here with a cone over the candidate curve. Kergram. So if you know that you already start from an HHS, this works. If you don't know that you're starting from an HHS, you can look at this construction and check the problems. So in this, actually, we should write names. So this kind of kind of knew how to do this one. Already we did communator IHSS, but we didn't actually write it. But we didn't actually end so there's some help from Georgia who's not here yet. I don't think that's something. What's the argument of the script? Sorry? So a vertex yeah, so the vertex here is uh The index here is like you know, an index set for a hyperbolic space, and you do the cone over that hyperbolic space. Let's say it's a hyperbolic graph, you do the cone over the vertex set of that hyperbolic. So that's what you should try. And you know, it fits exactly, it also works here. It also works here for Dirac, which promised it works for Dirac. And yes, as I said, the W edges are always a data campaign, deciding which ones to use. I can tell you more about that maybe in the discussion session. Or there's various people who used humanitarian usage justice in their own soul. Or yeah, a few. Yeah, a few. Five, six. Okay, many. Cool. Uh okay. I think it's uh so my tablet says it's five, but I think it's ten, so started 10 minutes. I didn't really know time. Yes, plenty of time to spare. So, um, but Time square. So, um, but questions for Alex? Yeah, basic question. So, mapping class groups already have an HS structure, yeah, and then now you're coming up with this new thing, like the squid. Is it supposed to be the same thing as C-Word, or it's a new structure and it gives us more information? You recover exactly the same structure. Maybe you have a few more domains with bounded paragraphs, but yeah, it's essentially the same structure as you have. So at the end, you said if I start with a well-behaved HHS, then I apply this screen key, and it produces a nice combinatorial HHS. It seems surprising to me that you only use the minimal things. Right. And that somehow out of that you get the rest of the. Yeah, so this doesn't always work. That's the thing. But yeah, it's I agree it's somewhat surprising that is there any intuition for why like in some cases the other hyperbolic spaces pop out of it? So okay, all the hyperbolic spaces you can think of as conox of certain subspaces. Subspaces variation and somehow one of the conditions for well-behaved is that the products of the minimal things cover everything. So you can reconstruct the various subspaces in the HS whose conops are the Whose conops are the paragraphs using only those? Again. And you know, and adding or removing vertices is like coning off and blowing up various parts of your ratios. Is there any examples for your Are there any examples for will behave HHIS in this case? For example, other rags are will behave HHIS that we can have any of the colours here we need so there's like actually um Mark and George and all so it's not clear that it works for special groups that the the tool that are working on that. Working on that. I think for Route Stage and yeah, macro scripts works. And I think that the examples that have been so right, so combinatorial HSs have been used for For various cases, and you know that for example groups like various quotients of the Marken class group. So the simplest thing would be if the minimal product region is on cover, like then there's no chance of getting full coverage. But it doesn't want to be not able to. I don't know, actually. What was the W? For the right, so the W so okay the basically every maximum C. Basically every maximum simplex corresponds to a group anonym. It's not quite true that the the orbit is I mean that that there's only one orbit, but basically so you would just like to say okay w edges are you connect to maximum simplicity that corresponds to group elements that are closed. It's a bit trickier than that because of this condition. So you have to find So you have to fine-tune what the edges are depending on how much the two maximal synthesis intersect. It was kind of the tricky thing to figure out. But there's like a recipe. So there's various structures depending on how much the maximum synthesis intersect to account for this. And maybe if you think about like okay, well it will take five minutes to explain why the maximal To explain why the maximal simplicities in this case of the rug, of this particular rug, are exactly compounds. But we can do it as an exercise. You know that the core client groups are computer related. Yeah, that's yeah, that one is a core kind of group. Okay, all the crook client groups with this uh Croc cliner groups within this? All the croc clients. So, what are the other croc? I mean, for me, croc liner is just take the uh set of extension and then you put this uh grouping. Ah, ah, ah, the admissible graphs of groups. Uh yes, yes. Yes, no. Yes, so in that case, okay, so since you mentioned that, um, there's uh something interesting that happened. Something interesting that happens is that in those cases, if you have central extensions, you don't quite have a product, and then you can take one factor of the work space. But you always have a quasimorphism instead of a homomorphism to R. And that quasimorphism is what allows you to construct the fuzzy line that you need for the HHS structure. And this actually comes up pretty. comes up pretty often that you have to use a quasimorphism um and kind of you know quasimorphisms correspond to actions on quasi lines and those quasi lines are the ones that appear instead of these z's in this class how about we replace these hyboly goods with uh another high uh v-2 hs right so i don't like uh the extension could not be bounded so there could not be a quasimorphism Poasimorphism in that case. Right, so done. Yeah. So, like, if you do even just a central extension of Z squared could be the Heisenberg group. And that one's not an EGS. But there's some interesting connections with bounded cohomology. Yeah, that wasn't expecting when but somehow it's Some comments. Just one thing, like if the flag machine for this kind of seems unnatural to me, it's like so why I mean like it feels like if you don't assume this flag and this other edges that you want, maybe a little graph which the things are why you leave right so what I should really just do is say graph and then instead of simply Graph and then instead of simplicity saying peaks. And I don't know why I don't do it, to be honest. But yes, it might be that if you look at superficial complex that's not flagged, then maybe you're more flexible with doing various things and maybe there's a better version of transition viewing. Yeah, there might be a better version of this property. But you're not using flag anyway, you're and you've kidded it. No, not not really. So so yeah, no, that's a good point. I never thought let me ask one question too. So obviously, if you have different HHS structures on the same group, then you're going to get different how much row HHS structures from this process. If they have the same nest minimal hypothologies, do you still get the same So you get the same from what you said you should. Right, so you got the ID structure or the hyperbole space over.  Okay, so we're gonna start actually at 10:40 for the next talk just because we have a longer time for it anyways, and we start at late because of the youth parts. So, I meant to say it before, like you're already running late for the time. Yeah. Is it started?
