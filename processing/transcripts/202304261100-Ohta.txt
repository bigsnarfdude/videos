Okay, so it's my pleasure to welcome this Ichi Ota from Osaka University and he's going to speak on geometry of weighted fitsler space-time. Please. Thank you for the introduction. And I'm sorry for giving up my talk because the black test. So I was afraid from JetRag and I'm Jet dragons and I'm not feeling well and today I feel much better but but still it is better to give a talk like this. So I apologize for that and I thank the organizers very much for very kind support and also for the kind invitation to this nice conference. And this is the title of my talk, so Jambio What is Minister first time? And if you maybe what maybe what watched my talk in in Vienna in the conference last month it's almost the same talk I also apologize for that but actually that's the difference to me I mean after the talk in Vienna I found a mistake in my child but after that I tried to fix the mistake and only recently I could find how to I could find how to fix it. So, to me, it is very nice to give the same drug again. And so this is partly joint work from joint work with Matespra in Toronto and Yu Fondu in Hong Kong and Petrobe and Goods in Florence. Okay, so Okay, the aim of my talk is the account sidewave for the geometry of white pincer space. And I'm from positive definite geometry, so I was doing Riemann geometry and pincer geometry. But to me, this topic is the Lorentz analog to pincer geometry. Because it can be It can be the visual analog to oriental geometry, but to me this oriental analog is a viewpoint. And so I first reviewed a possible different case. I think it helpful for some people. And then I switched to the Lorentzian case, so what it means first time. And finally, I very briefly explained the Tamil culture demand recognition. Okay, so let me first give you the possibility definite insert case. We will first consider the smooth manifold, so the n-dimensional connected smooth manifold. And then a physical structure is a generalization of Riemannian metric like the following. So phase of function, non-negative function on the tangent bundle. On the tangent bundle, and we recorded a pinch ruct chain with the most inaugural, so the smooth avocado of the zero section. So, we need to remove the zero section since if it's G2 at the zero section, then it's necessary in quadratic, so the Riemann emmetric. So, we need to remove the boostness at the section. And about the homogeneity, we assume the homogeneity only in the possible direction. So, the F of C B. So the F of C B coincides with C times F of B, but only for positive C. And about the complexity, we assume the so-called strong complexity. It means that for any non-zero tangent vector B, the hash share of the square of F in the tangent space, as is non-zero B, is the positive definite. Okay, so this is a pinch structure. And one of the most important features is that we can naturally allow the non-reversibility. So here the homogeneity is assumed only for pulseship direction. So in this framework, we can include that case where F whole minus P is different from F whole P. So this is a very nice feature of the. A very nice feature of the kinetic system. And so the Hessian appearing in the strong complexity is actually very useful to compare the pins geometry with the Riemannian geometry. So since the Hessian is positive definite, we can, I mean, if this has positive definite, we can use this to define a remanial metric. So this is like. So this is like just like this. So we use this for definite matrix here. And just by definition, this is actually an approximation of the visa structure in this direction B up to the second rather since it comes from the hash. So this is a good approximation. And actually EDSP is quite useful when we cost the Is quite useful when we cost the cover. So, instead of explaining how to define the coverage in the piece of case, we just give a useful so-called Riemannian characterization of Pinsla curvature. So, by using this Riemannian structure, Vv. And so, it's like this. So, we pass, we start from a non-zero vector V, then we extend it to. Then we extend it to a first vector field, vector B, for a neighborhood such that every integral curve is geographic. So this continues essential. Every integral curve is checked. It is, of course, always possible. And then we can consider the Riemannian structure G D V It is probably. Indus from this background view to be on this neighborhood. Then we can see that the rich curvature in this direction of B, and the richest colour, the rich curvature B, it actually coincides with the rich curvature of this Greek manual structure. So this means that only in this direction B, Direction P so this Riemann structure is very useful to consider curvature. And actually, so this also means that this curvature actually is independent of strength of this spectrum. So this is quite powerful and useful technically the physical geometry. And as you can imagine, there are almost immediate consequences of this. I mean, we can reduce almost to the remaining case, like only my style meter found and also shop grommotics. Okay, so this is about the cover channel. And then to develop our analysis, we also consider a measure on the Pinstra manual. But here's a difficulty in the Pinstra case. Actually, on the general Pinstra man, of course, there is no unique choice of measure. And I mean, in the remaining case, of course, the volume measure is the only. The volume measure is the only unique or only analytical measure. But in the pencil case, there are several ways to construct seemingly nice measure, but they are not equivalent in the non-reminion case. Yeah, so this is a problem in the case, I guess. But in the end, our starting point is that we give up to fix some canonical matter, but we just Canonical measure, but we just consider an arbitrary measure. So we start with an arbitrary measure and then modify the rich curvature. I mean, the rich curvature controls some behavioral measure. So if we choose some measure, then we need to modify the rich coverage. And yeah, we modify the rich curvature into the correlated rich curvature or the backly made rich coverage according to the choice of the measure. According to the choice of the measure. And so EGS construction is very much inspired by the mining case and all success in the pinstripe case. And actually, as I said, in the past, we don't have unique measure, so this weighted salary is more essential in the piece. We don't need. You need okay, so let me quickly explain you mind the differential remote-to-age camera during the pincer case. So yeah, we fix the set abdural deposits must measure m on a manifold and we And we fix some non-zero down to vector V. And again, we employ a vector field V. I mean that with the integral curves JavaScript. Then, so by using the remaining structure induced from this spectrum field, we can decompose the measure like this. Yeah, so this measure is. So this measure is defined only in a neighborhood of this, of X. And in that neighborhood, we can decompose a measure like this. And then also let gamma be the geodeship with the initial vector V. Then, just as in the remaining case, we can define the way to reach gamma chip. Here, the real parameter n is in this frame. In this way, so the non-negative between the dimensional and the affinity, and the dt n of is defined like this, so the rich usual rich curvature plus a second derivative of the of this so-called weight function side minus the partial derivative squared over the difference between the chapter and so on. So the easiest. So, this is the usual backem coverage. And just as limit, we can also define each infinity L by these first two terms and also each L by limit. Hello, this is Jet Rich Cavity and this is very successful too costing reminder geometry and also in the case of MT. And with this curvature, we usually interest in the situation that this curvature is bounded from below by some constant k. And more precisely, it is bound to means that each n of b is bound from below by k times n square of b for any time to the and under this valid rich coverage. This valid rich curvature point, there are at least three very powerful techniques. And the part-wise curvature dimension conditions, E-D-K-N, optimal transpose theory. And actually, the validity of gravity demand consumption in the PINSA setting is, in a sense, good news, since this power technique can be used. File technique can be used also in the pinsler. But it also means that if we want to show something very Riemannian, I mean not valid in the Pinsla case, but like figure Gromo scripting serum. And yeah, we need something more since only C D does not rule out Pinsla markers. And this And this then look quite much better at the introduction of Riemannian cavity dimension constraints. Actually, it was explained already in Robert Marker's talk. The Riemannian cavity dimension constraint is the combination of some Riemannian structure. More precisely, the linearity of heat flowed by some as a equipment constant or plus the capital demand constant. Capital demand recommendation. Actually, in Nicola Gvi success, we showed the splittings, huge romotax fittings. It was very, very, very striking. This made the main topic of this talk. And also, we can also develop the localization technique, also known as the middle decomposition, by Klaatek and Cabretimondino with a pinched. to the pinstra case and in this case one difference from the usual case is that in physical case the distance battery is not geometric but you know geometry is not easy to to study in the localization technique so it yeah localization is paper Yeah, it is very powerful, but only about ocean metry we have sample but then we can do just in the pinstrack case. And also the non-linear grammar character can be studied in the pinstrack. I mean we can study non-linear heat flow on the on the pincer marriage board and we can show some kind of Bochonite, some kind of Bohr recording of the Pins. Some kind of open code of the pincer case, and we can show some gradient estimates and VM estimates or something like that in pincer case. So this is well successful in recently in geometry and field setting. Yeah, so yeah, so in Finstra case, this is very successful. So and it recently In recently, there's a very much growing interest in the raw answer counterpart due to the CDC and also localization was also extended to this kind of setting. So it's natural to extend discovery dimension technique to the piece of space. That's other motivation. And also And also, then we can give the same kind of motivation to introduce for the Lorentzian TCD construction. Yet I will explain about by then. And then in the previous staff settings, I will try to follow mainly Robert Markens work on the robot channel case and also Module Zero and Modius Brown. What is your and what else browse? Okay, so it's a teleview of the course case, and next I will explain the way to fit first. Yeah, so David first summarized our standard points. So the ordinance model is, of course, a question topic. And why did the ordinance mark? Marvel was I think first studied by Jeffrey Casey and also studied by Galway, Uga and Pai Lee since 2010. And then organic SMR was there are some crash co works, but only like VM. And recently at Minglitzki gave a very detailed study of this stuff. And there we put weight. You put weight or this sort of weighted role in this and I thought this is the topic of this talk. And also, as I said, my work is also much based by recent aesthetic approach of original X spaces and burned original spaces. So I I for almost defeats the definition of the instrumental manifold, but now with the low intersection. And we again class the transmission manifold and dimensional connected mirror. Then now the function L for the turnip boundary is a structure if it satisfies the same similar signature and the homogeneity function. Homogeneity function, I mean, I mean, the positive direction, and then the complexity is, of course, give us by the Ronan signature. So, for any uncertainty vector piece, SM of the spreads, this structure L is non-degenerate with signature minus plus plus plus. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I think yeah, we are again achieving the homogeneity only in the body function, so we naturally have the non reversibility. And actually, it seems just natural in this Lorentzian case since u usually we we don't care uh we don't care about the p past reaction, we deal only with the feature direction. So this non-reversibility seems very nice. Module versus it seems very suitable for the audience in case. Yeah, so to make it a space-time, we assume the existence of a single spectral field X and such that which is always time-like in this sense. So time is sensitive. Then we call it the feature space-time, time-time oriented by the space field X. And the feature coefficient, which is, of course, the time-connected component of time-work vectors, including vector field X. And as usual, time run time right goes against vectors or curves will be featured directly. To direct and okay, so and yeah, we can as usual introduce what geometric quantities, like distance and curvature. So given causal curve gamma, you can introduce the length by using this function f. And f is just defined by square root of minus two times l yeah. Then so the time of separation or the we could just distance d is defined the supermarket is banks between Of these banks between the points and the co-codes that you did at the point, and then just by the easy distribution function, we can introduce the timeline. Locally maximizing constant speed of the curve with respect to distance. And then we have. And then we have geologics, and as vibrational vector fields, we can introduce Jacobi fields. And by using the Yakovic fields via the Yakovic equation, we can introduce curvature, lack of rich curvatures. And we again have the same kind of rolling term characterization here as a rolling tank structure, GB. It should just same way as the piece of it. The picture key. Okay, so this is for lens case. And then again for the major, we can do the same as the Riemann case. So we again just fix our director to measure M and then. Then for a time like vector B and we consider the extension to a vector B to B and such that the entry integral curves are geologic. Then we can decompose the measure by using the original structure. This from this vector will be like this. And again, the gamma is the initial vector V. Inshallow vector V and then this is just the same way we can define the weighted rich coverage. Yeah, so let me give some remarks. So just by definition, this what it rich curves you enjoy is called autonomicity. So it is just by definition. or it is just by differential so each n is smallest is smallest and it is not increase it is not decreasing to reach infinity so if n goes from n small n to infinity it's non-decreasing and the reach infinity can be identified with each minus infinity data again non-decreasing from minus infinity to zero Say zero. Careful this range. So this means that we consider a lower bound of this curvature. The lower bound of HTO, for example HTO nominative, is much weaker than the corresponding bound for say the GP for the CSPA. Yeah, so this band is much weaker than this but yeah we have this band here actually amount to detailed and then uh previous work we showed the weighted value of the child equation and by using the child equation we can show some security several realms and comparison several And comparison cell rams, and also very good with splitting cell rams. Battery with extra range. So, extra range is a kind of combinational unification of the constant coverage of the body of the coverage boundary was expressed. Yeah, so this is by a space of dread work with work with. At work, we have to do unmigrants. And it is about spreading the value cell, of course, we cannot expect really isometric spreading them. So we can expect only the existence of one parameter family of isometric isometric transformation. But this is the most we can expect. So I mean by spraying. I mean by straight the existence of such isomotic transaction. So just in the definite case, we can imagine the Banhart space. There are many straight lines, but of course one space does not split isometrically in general. But we can but translations are isometric, so we can expect such. we we can expect such existence of translation and yeah in the rare space I guess but even to show such weak spreading we need very strong assumption and actually very technically very difficult to show such pretty so yeah I'm gonna start spoiling but I could That's fine, but I could show me under very strong assessment. Okay, so here's my prefix box. Then, yeah, let me very quickly explain that. I will cover the event. Actually, this was explained by Robert's talk, also. He didn't give the definition, but let me just show you. I'll show you the statement. So V equals the global hyperbolic mode feature space time with some fluid with a major n. And it satisfies, if it satisfies the SBH counterpart, which is bound to below by K in time rack direction, and then it satisfies time rack counter elementary constant C D Q into T C D. Q into T C D Q K N for MQ between 0 and 1. So, this is in progress, so I actually need to check the details, but I hope there's no more mistake. Yeah, and there are some comments that actually to improve the reduced tissue is different to the entropic tissue. To the entropic TCD. Original TCD is the technical. This is a bit more specialist, but yeah, this a bit weaker than this DCD and this is easier to handle. And this is a bit about. This is a bit about difficult, and see even the Riemannian and Vincian case, it's not easy to achieve this stronger virtue. And in the Royal case, cost difficulty and also Hans has a difference even from the Riemann case. Yeah, so this is a point I find mistake after my talking. Find a mistake after my talking at the end of what I try to see if I could fix the mistake. Okay, so yeah, you see the force. And also here I include the east range of n, so the non-negative n. And this case was not studied in all the case, so it's new. I'm teaching. Is new and TCD u call this case is new on the sport audience. Yeah, right, and also because the compass is also true, but you should imply it to have a job. Okay, so and then so to have a cross-out look on this new range, so let me explain Brumikovsky encode time-like Brumikovsky. So, this is a Bromikowski in quality. Yeah, so this is very much similar to the usual Rubico scan code in the UK for convex geometry. And we can extend to the Lorentzian case. And actually, this is a very standard application. This is a very standard application of the captured manufacture. And this works yes for all two compact sets A0 and A1, which is causally related in this. I didn't explain, but I think it's the meaning can be clear, I think. The causal idea compact sets. And then we consider the intermediate points, the set of the intermediate points. set of t intermediate form. So the zero is in a zero and term y in a y and we consider set of them t and so under the non-negative converture for simplicity we can show this Romikovsky encode for this range for negative air. You see that this is very similar to the Euclidean Romikovsky encoder, but here this Encoded, but here this after n is negative. So this is negative. We have the reverse input. I mean, in the Euclidean case, the usual cussian code is a reverse encoder with dimension instead of this capital N. Here we put capital N, and since this is narrative, we naturally have this equal. And also the And also the weakest power band, I mean, it's zero bound, we have only this very degenerate concavity, I mean, hash concavity of hash concavity in code. So this is the problem because you can be the phone each video. So, yeah, so this is an application. So, finally, I explained some personal questions. Of course, the first question I already explained. So, the watch pressure behind the counter-dimensional show for the pressure space time is very much related to the back shown of low-length anti-CD, I think. Yeah, I think. I think yeah, I think Robert Mark already mentioned some things about this. So this is the other ongoing work about this. I'm very much looking forward. And then the of course the isometric splitting is the time-like isometric splitting. So I mean this framework is the very easy call, but yeah, it is very good. Yeah, it may be challenging, but it's of course in a natural question. And also, I learned in this conference, it is also possible to calculate energy condition transport theory with Christian talk. So I think it might be nice to consider this problem also in the problem also in the pieceless pest and also about maybe first and another question is that i'm not sure about the this car multiple but maybe further understanding of the cases of negative and to see to from our thing maybe uh uh between zero and one between the many core i think widely I think why the Google Wide may know this is not what this may be may not be evaluated, but I did a recent work using this negative range and in a string theory, so no, not structural, so string theory and yes there's a pair of Yes, there's a paper by Deruka department, Timo, Dina, and Osiero. They studied some model space in the stream theory. Then they found that we found it negative n can be used to analyze this model space. So I hope that there may be some. that we there may be some other applications were more developmentable to this more general range. Okay, so this is the module so it is a bit early but let me stop here. So thank you very much for your attention.
