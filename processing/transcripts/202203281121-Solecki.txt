We'll talk about an overview descriptive setting. All right. Can you hear me well? Yes. Okay. Happy to be here, sort of. I almost came. Things didn't work out in the end. So I will talk about descriptive set theory. So this will be kind of abstract, but on the other hand, Kind of abstract, but on the other hand, also quite simple. This classical descriptive set theory, especially in the beginning, has this kind of nice feel of like a basic analysis course where things can be explained from first principles. So I actually intend to do some proofs. And okay, so what are these first principles here? So what is the category we are in? So we are the category, our objects are Polish spaces. Polish spaces. So Matt already mentioned what these are. These are separable, completely metrizable spaces. And the morphisms are continuous maps between Polish spaces. So this is our world. So now what's, I mean, if you take these for granted, so what are the things that are kind of not have structure that is not kind of obvious from this point of view? Well, if you have a function f. view well if you have a function f going from x to y you want to study the image of f of x this is not guaranteed to be a polish space it's just some subset of y so these are the sets that we want to take a look at so if i have a polish space y aha there will be examples of polish spaces so there's many of them just just showing up in various places they usually have additional structures Have additional structure on them, for example, separable Banach spaces or various groups like the unitary group of the Hilbert space, separable Hilbert space, the space of measures on a compact metrizable space, Borel measures, probability measures, things like that. Okay, so what is an analytic set? A set is, we'll call it analytic, if there is a continuous function. So x. There is a continuous function, so xy will be always Polish spaces here in this talk. If there is a continuous function going from x to y, such that a is its image, then such a set will be called analytic. And okay, so what can you call a Borel set? So A is Borel within this kind of context of Polish spaces and continuous maps is Borel. If a If A is equal to f of x for some continuous injected f going from x to y. Right, so this is in this in a context like this, you would you would think, okay, these are two objects to worth studying, they have probably complicated structure and. And we would want to know more about these images. This is not a standard definition of Borel sets, as everybody probably knows there, but it will turn out to be equivalent to the standard one. And here it seems like an appropriate way to go. Okay, so these are the two main notions. And the main thing will be comparing the two. So comparing the analytic sets and Borel sets. So it's there is kind of two situations. Already Matt hinted at these in his talk when we are just so I should say that there was a also Matt mentioned that there was a Lebesgue mistake. He actually had a proof, which turned out to be false, that analytic sets are equal to Borel sets, that it's all the same. This turned out to be false. So essentially, what we are doing here is Essentially, what we are doing here is one can see it as a kind of obsessive analysis of this mistake. So, the structure. So, on the one hand, we have the structure of sets. So, here we want to see analytic as being close to Borel. So, kind of we want to see them to be as well behaving as Borel sets. On the other hand, there are these classification problems where analytic non-Borel sets. Where analytic non-Borel sets are seen as being far away from Borel sets. So, yeah, these kind of two points of view, and we'll start on this side here. I'll talk about structure, but then we'll switch to this side and we'll see how far away these analytic sets are from Borel. Here, there is a slogan for these classification problems. This is the slogan comes from Simon Thomas, who Simon Thomas, who says that there's something called Church's thesis for mathematics, that if you have any set that is given to you in mathematics explicitly, in the sense that it uses only countable operations of unions and intersections, you are bound to end up with a Borel set. And if you are, so being non-Borel, you have to do something drastic there. Drastic there. Okay, so these are these two kinds of different points of view, and I will start on this. So please ask questions, of course, if anything is unclear. So just to give you some examples, there's tons of examples of these things, but some concrete examples. So if I have, let's give an example of a Polish space, a Borel set that's not closed or open, and an analytic. open and an analytic set that is not Borel. So I kind of spoiled a little bit there's a theorem here. So the parallel is spoiled a bit that there are analytic sets that are not borel. From the definition, it's not clear. Actually, it might seem that these classes are equal, but it will turn out that they are distinct. So an example of a Polish space is here. You have all continuous functions. A say all continuous functions from 0, 1 to r with the uniform convergence topology. So these are again, this is actually a Banach space, but it's easy to check that this topology is separable and complete. Okay, a Borel subset here of this space, a nice one, is we can look at all homeomorphisms. So these are continuous functions from 0, 1 to 0, 1, but they are additionally But they are additionally, so in particular from 01 to 1, but they are additionally bijected from 0, 1 to 0, 1. So this is, if you check, this is this, the spell, the homeos are not, are not, it's not a closed subset of C of that Polish space. It's not open either, but it will turn out to be Borel. In fact, it's Borel. In fact, it's Borel. One could actually check it almost right away. There is a topology. One can put a topology on Home 01 that makes it into a Polish space. Namely, one can measure the distance between F and G by looking at the uniform distance of F G and adding to it the uniform distance F minus 1 G minus 1. Minus one, G minus one. And this metric turns out to be complete, a complete separable metric on this homeomorphism group. And it makes it into a Polish space. And then the identity map is a continuous injective map from homeo taken with this metric to homeo taken as a subset of here. So with this, I have now a I have now a Polish space that I map injectively onto the set, making it Borel. Okay, and then what about analytic sets? Some natural example of an analytic set that is not Borel. Look at all continuous functions from the interval 0, 1 to R, such that there is at least one point in which the derivative exists. So there is... So, there is, if there may be many, but if at least one point I put it in the set. It's not difficult to check that this set is analytic, and it was proved by Molden that it's actually not Borel. Notice that this theorem has a non-trivial content, because if I look at the complement of this set, this is the set of all functions that don't have derivatives at any point. So, this set turns out to be complicated. It is what they call co-analytic non-Borel set. So, it's not so clear that this other set actually has elements, but we know since Virus does that it does. I should have said something here. I will call the set co-analytic. A set is co-analytic if it is the complement. It is the complement of an analytic set. It's just a word now. It's simply easier to say co-analytic rather than repeating this phrase. And I should also say that I will regard empty the empty set as a Polish space. So in particular, the empty set is Boretto. Particular, the empty set is Borel. Okay, so these are examples. So I have to start because everything depends on these Polish spaces. I have to start with talking a little bit about Polish spaces, but I will also talk about very important in the area combinatorics of that particular Polish space. So one thing that was noticed is that each Polish space, this space Each Polish space, this space. So I will look at the space of all. What is this space? This is a countable product of natural numbers, taking with the usual product topology, where this end here has the discrete topology. So I take, it's easy to see that this is a Polish space with that topology. And this is this, in some sense, this is the largest one. In some sense, this is the largest one, but in a very particular sense. Namely, each Polish space is a continuous image of this end-to-end. And since we decided to kind of that injective is special, one can look at it's not the case that each Polish space is an injective limit image of n to n. The reason is n to n, if you have a Polish space with isolated points, you cannot match. You cannot map injectively this to such a space. But there is a closely related fact to it that each Polish space is a continuous injective limit of a closed subset of n to n. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about that space. I mean, how what it looks like. So people often write, this is sometimes called the bare space. And people And people sometimes denote it by omega to omega. So in the area, n is used interchangeably with omega. So omega, one can think of omega as just natural numbers, just a different name for natural numbers. This is actually, it will come up later if there is time. It's actually an ordinal number. So there's a reason for kind of these two these two. These two notation being split like that, but for us, sometimes people put zero in omega and don't put zero in n. But for me, zero will be a natural number. So these two things are identical as far as this talk goes. Okay, so fine. So what is this topology here on N to N? It's good to fix some notation for it. NT. N t by n t. So for t n t, aha, there is another space, n less than n. These are all finite sequences, finite sequences, t going from zero and minus one to n. And using a very convenient set-theoretic convention, we write this simple. We will write this simply as n. So for me, a natural number is identified with the set of its predecessors. So this function t goes from n to capital N. And these finite sequences determine basic elements in this big space here. Namely, if I have a finite sequence like this, I'll write nt for the set of all x in n to n such that Such that t is included in x. So again, I will use, I'm using here, again, another very convenient self-theoretic convention that I view functions. So t is a function. I view functions. I identify functions with their graphs. So x, this means that x extends t, meaning the graph of t is included in x. So I'll just write this for the For the extension. So, what is happening here, these sets look a bit like that. I have a finite sequence T, and I look at the set of all X's that extend that T. So these are the various X's in N to N, while T is in N less than N. So, that's how I see these basic open sets. And notice, yeah, so this NT, each NT Each NT is closed and open, I'll write clopen in n to n, and they form a basis. The set of all nts such that t in n less than n is a basis, topological basis. It's this canonical basis. It's a nice, this basis, there is a tree here behind this whole picture, namely, if I have, I include empty as my. I include empty as my sequence. So if I have empty here, this is one of the sequences, it will be extended by sequences of length one, namely zero, one, two, and so forth. Each of those is extended by sequences of length two. And so forth. So this the the this the set the whole set n less than n can be viewed as a tree. This is the picture and the relation here is the relation of extension. So if I have two elements here s and t the relation that I look Relation that I look for is the relation of extension. So T can extend S. Sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it does. And then in these situations, if I have that situation, notice that the set N S will include NT. So I have this basis indexed by elements of finite sequences, and the finite sequences form a tree. Sequences form a tree. So let's look a little bit at the I mentioned closed sets there. So I have F subset of N to N, N to N that is closed. And there is a way also combinatorially viewing this closed subset, viewing it combinatorially as a tree. As a tree, very much similar to the tree that determines this n to n. So, how do we view this f? There will be a, so what is a tree formally speaking? So, I will have a, it's a subset of n less than n. This is a tree if it's closed downwards under extension. So that if t is in t, this implies, so for each t and t, this implies that t restricts. This implies that T restricted to N is also in T if N is less than or equal to length of T. Right, so length of T is, I hope everything here is understandable, length of T is just the cardinality of its domain. And this restriction, I treat T as a function, so the restriction makes sense that I restrict it to an actual number. A natural number that's shorter than this length. Remember, natural numbers are just initial segments of so I have t going from some finite initial segment of natural numbers. I have n here. This is the length of t this is the length of t. I have a smaller natural number that I just restrict. Okay, so a tree is any set of this. G is any set of this form. And it turns out that a set F is closed, F subset of N to N is closed. If and only if there is a tree, a tree, a tree such that F is the set of all branches through that tree. So let me write it in symbols first, but then this is just the set of all X's in. This is just a sort of all x's in the big space, such that for each n, x restricted to n is in the tree. Yes, so these are all infinite sequences of natural numbers, such that no matter how I restrict it to an initial segment of natural numbers, that finite function is in the tree. So if I have a closed So, if I have a closed subset, there will always be a tree such that the closed subset turns out to be the set of all branches through this tree. It's quite easy to see what this tree is for a given F. Namely, if you are given an F, how do you get a tree? You just define T to be the set of all T in N less than N, such that the basic element, basic. The basic element, basic elements determined by t intersect f in a non-empty fashion. It's easy to check that this is the tree, a tree, this is a tree, and that the syllable branches is actually F. Okay, so each closed subset of the space n to n has this combinatorial structure behind it, the combinatorial structure of a tree. And so let me come back to this thing. So a Polish space is a continuous image of this, and a Polish space, each Polish space is a continuous injective limit of a closed subset like this. So these tricks, little tricks, allow us to put on an arbitrary Polish space, continuous functions from one space to another, things like that, this combinatorial. There is a combinatorial structure behind any Polish space like that, no matter what this Polish space is. And it's often very convenient to use. Let me mention, because that's an important theorem, let me mention just sketch how, why is something like this, perhaps this is a surprising result, that there is this one space mapping on everybody else. I will leave this to you to. I will leave this to you to look into. This is, I'll just sketch a proof of that. This is elaboration on the proof of one. So why is every Polish space a continuous image of that? So the reason is, so if I have a Polish space, let me just draw a picture. So if I have a Polish space like that. Like that. What I will do is, I will cover it. I will fix a metric, D, a complete metric on this space. And then I cover it with open sets of diameter less than one. They will overlap in general. This cannot be helped. Doesn't matter. Well, I just cover them. And I enumerate. And I enumerate these sets. So these are open sets. I enumerate them by sequences of length one. So they are all of this form. I call them un. And then I take one single one, un like this, and I repeat the procedure. So diameter here is less than or equal to one. And I repeat the procedure. So this is my set, let's say UN. Let's say UN and I repeat the procedure I cover it with open sets and M, let's say. So these are the sets now indexed by sequences of length two, diameter less than or equal to half. But I also make sure that UNM is completely included actually with its closure in UN. U n for each n. And I continue. I take a set like this and I continue. I cover it again with sets. This will be UNMK or L and a diameter here less than or equal to one-third. And then the closure, same condition, NML, closure included in UNM. I can always do it. There's nothing stopping me. I will just always do that. I just continue doing it. And then what happens at the end, I just explicitly define a function from n to n to this Polish space x that I started with by mapping f of x to be the unique point. In the intersection ux restricted to n over n. So if I have an infinite sequence of n to n, it will give me kind of like a microscope. I will go first to this whole space, then I will pick one of these sets. Within a set like this, I will pick a smaller set. Within this set, I will pick a smaller set. And I will have this decreasing sequence of sets. decreasing sequence of sets whose diameters tend to zero diameters tend to zero and they are positioned with respect to each other in this fashion this way i can use completeness of d to make sure that this intersection is non-empty and has a unique point f of x is that point and it's easy to check that this is clearly because i did covering always this is clearly a surjection and it's clearly continuous Clearly continuous, it is clearly continuous. I mean, clearly, you have to check that, but there is not that much to check. And so, that's that's it. That's the whole proof. I should have said I assumed here that X is non-empty. So, this is only for non-empty Polish spaces. Okay, so and then you have, if you want this injective, you have to cut it down to a closed set. Okay, so these Polish spaces. Any questions here about Any questions here about this proof? Maybe just a comment that your proof actually shows that the continuous map is. I mean, you took open sets and this tells you that the map is broader open. This is because you could have taken close sets, but the fact that you chose open sets gives you that the map is open. Well, yeah, I guess. Well, no, no, no. It just shows that images of basic open sets are open. It doesn't show that you may have probably, this is not a one-to-one function. So if you take an arbitrary open set, am I right here or not? Yeah, I mean, this is connected space and X could be real, so there is no way. Yes, yes, yes. So if you have a connected space, you don't get it open. Connected space, you don't get an open. You will get that. Wait a second, how is it? Will you get that images of basic open sets are open here? Yes, yes. So because that's by the construction. And if you have an open set. Yeah. So this is not true by topological argument that every space is an open image of n to n. An open image of end-to-end. Yeah, because it's just, it would mean that every space has a non-trivial clop and set, but that doesn't work. Okay. But yeah, but if basic open sets, I get something wrong. Something is wrong, yeah. Yeah. I don't think that there is a problem if topology organizations just so you can. No, no, it's okay. Yes, it's all right. Yes, yes, yes, no, it's all right, yes. Because this doesn't show that, yes, because if you have two open sets, the clopen set and its complement, their images will intersect, so it's all fine. Yeah, so you get openness, correct? Because images preserve unions, so it's all fine. That's correct. Yeah, sorry about that. So you get actually an open, every polished space is a continuous open. Polish space is a continuous open image of end-to-end. Any other issues? How can we restrict to this in one-to-one? So when you say that every polished pair is the one-to-one image of a subset of N2D, yes. So this requires, I don't want to go into it, but this requires an additional art. It, but this requires an additional argument. Okay, so it's not restricting this map. So it's no, no, no. Any other questions here? This was not a question, no. I didn't hear it. Some explanation. Yes. Okay. All right. So a little. All right, so a little bit about closure properties for Polish spaces. So I have a Polish space. Polish spaces are closed. There are some values, it will come up. These things will come up a little bit later. They are closed under taking countable products. That's quite easy, right? If you take a product of spaces Xn, each of them has a metric DN. You can bound this metric without a problem by one and then define on the product the metric one over T. metric one over two to n d n over n right so this is this so I have so the product will be separable and if these metrics are complete this metric will be a complete metric on the product so product countable product of polish spaces are Polish again Polish spaces are are closed under taking closed subsets that's Subsets. That's obvious because if I take a Polish space, I fix a complete metric on it, the restriction of this complete metric to the closed subset is complete. And the closed subset will turn out to be separable as a separable subset of a separable metric space, as a subset of a separable metric space. So if I go down to closed subsets, no problem. Closed subsets, no problem. But it's also open sets. I can, if I go down to an open set, it is also Polish. That's not entirely obvious, right? Because if I have a complete metric on my large space, I go down to an open subset. That's not going to be complete in general. Just take the reals and an open interval, 0, 1. So how do we deal with open subsets? If I have open subset x subset of u, notice that this one is homeomorphic. That this one is homeomorphic to the graph of the function that goes from u to r, and the function is map x to the distance from x to the complement of u. So, this is, I fixed here a complete metric. So, the graph of this function, so that is the set x d of x. D of x x minus u x in u. This is a subset of x cross r one checks, it's an easy check that this is actually a closed subset. This graph is actually a closed subset of this space. This space is Polish, it's a product of two Polish spaces, so Polish by one. R is Polish with the usual metric and. And U is homeomorphic, therefore, to a closed subset of a Polish space. So, being homeomorphic to a closed subset of a Polish space, it is itself Polish. We'll just transport a complete metric on this closed subset of that Polish space, transport it using this homeomorphism to U. And we have a metric agreeing with the topology on U that's complete. So, open sets are also fine. Now, Polish spaces are closed. So, is Spaces are closed. So, is that fine? Any questions here? Oh, thanks. One over. Very good. Thanks. Thanks. Not the distance. One over the distance. Right, you want this number as x approaches the boundary of u, you want that number to go to infinity. So you don't have Cauchy sequences, convert Cauchy sequences in U. Cauchy sequences in you convergent to Cauchy sequences in U that converge to points on the boundary of you. Yes, because this would mean there is a Cauchy sequence in U convergent to a point that's not in U, it's in the boundary. So this trick allows you to these Cauchy sequences that converge to the boundary of U from the side of U, you just send them to infinity and they stop being Cauchy. To infinity and they stop being cautioned. Okay, thanks. And okay, closed undertaking countable discrete unions. That's kind of obvious. You just put these spaces at your bound metrics if necessary, and then you put these spaces at distance one from each other, and then you just introduce the usual metric on them. Okay, and there is a tricky one here that will come up later on. So, this is number four. If I have, I have just a set now, not a Polish space, but there's many topologies on it that are Polish. So I take a fixed set and I look at the countably many Polish topologies on that set X. And I assume, there's one thing that is assumed, that Thing that is assumed that they all contain a fixed Hausdorff topology. There's some topology Hausdorff actually in all applications, this topology tau is also Polish. So there's some smallest Polish topology on X, and there's some other topologies that are bigger than it. And then what I want to do is I want to look at the topology generated by these topologies. So I look at what are the open sets here. I look at open sets with respect to I look at open sets with respect to T T L, tau M, Tau N, and so forth. Some finitely many. I look at open sets here, U, V, W, and so forth, and I take their intersections, finite intersections, finite intersections, and then I declare a set open if it's a union of all such. So this is a topology. This topology generated. This topology generated by the sequence is again Polish. This is the conclusion. Is that kind of understandable? I have many topologies here. They communicate only through the fact that there is a topology that they have in common. And this is again Polish. And the reason for it is. The reason for it is it is just a product. Notice, I take X with tau n, the product over n. This is a Polish space by one. Now there is a canonical diagonal map from here to here, namely x goes to x, x, and so forth. Now, this diagonal map, usually if you have diagonals, diagonals, Usually, if you have diagonals, diagonals are closed. The problem is this X is just a set in this case. So, this diagonal is a map between sets, it's canonical, but it's not canonical as a map. There's no topology here between topological spaces. So, I have this map from X to this product, canonical map, the diagonal map. And the question is: Is this one to one? Is it by any chance Chance is it image closed? And this is where this tau comes in here. It turns out because there is this common topology to all the tau n's, the image of this map, so iota of x, is closed in this product. This has to do with this tau. You use this tau to check that this image is closed. It's all elementary. Okay. It's all elementary. Okay, and then so this in its own right is a Polish space because it's a closed subset of this Polish space, this product. But again, elementary check gives you that this topology generated by these topologies on X is exactly the topology X gets through this identification iota with iota of X. So this topology, this smallest topology containing all the tau n. Smallest topology containing all the tau n's is also Polish from that argument. Okay, so we have all these closure properties of Polish spaces that will play a role later on. How am I doing on time? I have seven minutes. Six minutes. Six minutes, not seven. Okay. So, aha, I had a pace for it. Okay, so any questions? So I'm done with this intro to Polish spaces. Any questions here? Any questions here? So, if not, so okay, so our aim is now to first of all kind of go back to what people actually consider Borel sets. So, I defined Borel set as injective images of Polish spaces. Usually, the definition is different than what I just stated as a definition is a theorem. So, let's, I sorry, we want to, one of the So we want to one of the things we want to go back to the usual definition. But the nice thing about the road is on the way we'll have to prove these fundamental theorems about analytic cells. So basic structure for Borel and of Borel and structure of Borel and analytic sets and the relationship between the two. So one way to think about what we want to achieve here can Borelness and analytic of Here, can Borelis and analysity of A be detected within the Polish space on which A is defined? I mean, it has an external definition. I mean, these are images of some other Polish spaces. Can I just looking at the space detect that something is Borel or analytic? And then how analyticity relates to Borelness? That's another question. Okay, so let's how this will be a useful piece of notation for a Polish space X. V of X is the sigma algebra generated by open subsets of X. Open subsets of x. So let's keep these two questions in mind and this piece of notation. And we want to kind of try to answer these two questions. They are kind of vague, but okay. So I will not spoil much here. There's something in the chart. Oh, why is it called analytic? I'm not so sure. Why is that? This is kind of prehistory. Why is that? This is kind of prehistory, I guess. Sorry, I have heard another name also. Am I right? Is it the same as Suslin sets? People sometimes call them Susslin sets. Yeah, so they were, I mean, there's this story people always say, right? This was this Lebag mistake. And then Luzin, they were reading the paper in Moscow. So it was Luzin was like the main guy there. And then he gave it to Suslin to read. Suslin was his student. To Susslin to read. Susslin was his student. And Susslin detected the mistake in Lebesgue's argument. And then he started investigating these analytic sets versus Borel sets. So they are sometimes called system sets. Analytic, I mean, I'm not so sure. I don't know why. I mean, it goes back to this prehistory. I think it's already called that in pre-war papers. Pre-war papers. Okay, there's more Susan sets if you go to. Yeah. Aha, you think it's the reason? I think it's you think the reason is to differentiate, not to say omega, Steve. I think this is probably an older name, analytic. I mean, this was probably culted by Susan himself. So I don't know what's the story there exactly. Could be related to the operation A, right? Yes, there is supposedly some controversy about that. I will talk about operation A, but A, in operation A, it's not so clear if it stands for analytic or for Alexandrov. And there is some controversy about it. But okay, Moscovakis writes about it. So a nice book about history. No, it's a nice book about the script of set theory, but with With a very good historical notes, is a book by Moskovakis. I think it's called Descriptive Set Theory. And he talks about these issues there and operation A and things like that. Okay, what? Effective descriptive theory. It's called effective descriptive set theory. It's mostly about effective description theory. Okay. It is about descriptive, effective description. It is about descriptive effective descriptive set theory, but I don't remember the title. So, okay. So, now the losing. Let's go back to losing. That's a very important theorem here that we need to prove. It's important in its own right, but it also relates to these questions. So, losing, I have two analytic sets in a Polish space. They are disjoint. Then there is a set in this sigma algebra generated by open sets that separates. Open sets that separate these sets. There is a separation there. So, if I have two analytic sets, very complicated sets possibly disjoint, I can separate them by a set that is in the sigma algebra generated by open set. So, A will be included in C and C will be disjoint from B. And I see I have one minute to do this proof, but let's so how does So, how does this go? So, what one shows is this. So, assume, so I have one fixes these continuous functions. Aha! So, we can, you know, A is the image of a Polish space, B is the image of a Polish space. These Polish spaces are images of n to n. So, actually, A and B are images of n to n. So, I can just, instead of arbitrary Polish spaces that look at n to n. Polish spaces that look at n to n. And then what one proves is one assumes, assume A and B not separated. Assume they are not separated. Then what one does is one proves that for each n there exists S n T N. This has to do with this combinatorics, this tree combinatorics here, such that their length, I will write for. Such that their length, I will write for length absolute value, is n and these f of n s n f of g of n t n are not separated not separated and here S n plus one extends S n and T n plus one And Tn plus one extends Tn, of course, properly, because they would have a bigger length, right? So out of non-separation of A and B, we are narrowing it down to there will be a sequence Sn here such that the image of this cone is not separated from the image of this cone when this is Tn. So notice I'm getting smaller and smaller sets that are not separated. And maybe I will say next time. And maybe I will say next time why is this true? Or you can think of it over lunch, but let me just say how one finishes the proof then. These sequences, notice they keep extending each other. So there will be an X extending all Sn, all N, and there will be a Y extending all Tn for all n. Now, for these two elements, these are X and Y. These two elements, these are x and y in this infinite sequence space. F of x will be in A, G of Y will be in B. But A and B are disjoint. So f of X is distinct from G of Y. That's what we know. By Hausdorff, this fellow is included in some open set U. This is included in some open set V, open, disjoint. I can do. I can do that. But then, by continuity on F, this U will contain F of N SN for some N, and V will contain, by continuity of G, G of N T N for some N, right? Because these sequences Sn and say, let's say these sequences Sn are getting longer and longer, and they approximate the sequence X. And they approximate the sequence x as tightly as possible. So through this sequence, these elements here for a basic basic sets at x. So if I take u and v, from some point on, f of n s will be included in u, f of n t, g of n t will be included in v. But then notice, this u is in the sigma algebra generated by open sets. Actually, it is open. open says, actually, it is open, and it separates F of N S from G of N T, which contradicts, which contradicts our choice of these SNs as because they were chosen so that F of N S, F of N T, and T N are not separated. And that's for some, and they turned out to be separate. So that's kind of a So that's kind of a quick outline of this proof. I will say a little bit how to produce these things after the break. But this is kind of the Lusian, is the main idea of Lusians field. Okay, I'll make you questions? Quick questions or long questions? Long questions, maybe we can wait till the beginning next question. One question, and maybe we can wait till the beginning next time. Anybody online want to ask a question? Does anyone online want to ask a question? Yes, maybe I ask a question. Hello? Yes, yes. Okay, so as we are in the joint conference between the smooth people and descriptive set theory, so does it make sense to you make some error? You make some hierarchy between Polish spaces. I mean, does it make sense you consider regularity of this continuous map that goes from n power n to edge? So maybe it's holder continuous, maybe the modulus of continuity can separate the Polish spaces. Is it interesting for you? This is not really, I mean, it would separate Polish spaces. So this would give you, say, if you have Polish spaces and Would give you say if you have Polish spaces and instead of continuous map, you would you would look at better better maps, then it would definitely separate Polish spaces into some finer equivalence classes, let's say. So there would be Polish spaces, you know, so but it's not really studied so much as in this kind of mainstream core part of the scriptive setting. We keep actually people. We keep actually, people go. I will say a little bit about this later. So, people go in the opposite direction. Rather than looking at all continuous functions, people look at Borel functions. And then it turns out, with this more relaxed notion of maps, that all uncountable Polish spaces are isomorphic to each other. So, actually, then there is no distinction at all. But, of course, in particular cases, people would look at more and finer situations, but it's not part. Finer situation, but it's not part of this main main main of the core of the theory. Okay, okay. I ask you because, in smooth dynamics, many times we have this regularity of the conjugacies as we hear today. So, I should maybe say that often, I think this maybe was kind of hinted at in Matt's talk, that these maps here and Polish spaces, sometimes they are spaces on which you act, but more often, But more often in these situations, they are spaces of the objects that do the acting. Or, for example, the space of all the feomorphisms or the space of all Hölder maps. These are the Polish spaces you are interested in. And then this regularity is the regularity of the objects from which you get some stuff. So often you consider, that's why maybe these regularity properties are not so crucial because you are kind of, you are looking at collection of objects. You are looking at collection of objects that are regular, and then you take them very much. Thank you for the questions, and thank you, Slave. We convene at 2:20 local time.
