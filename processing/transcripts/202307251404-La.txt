Okay. Okay, yeah, thank you. Thank you very much for the organizer for organizing this wonderful workshop. And it is my great pleasure to give a talk in this workshop. And yeah, it would feel better if I could be there physically, but I'm very sorry for not being. But I'm very sorry for not being able to be there physically. But yeah, I would like to talk about the singular solutions of 2D Euler equations and also its limit from, yeah, a hydrogen limit for the solutions. The first part, singular structure of studio education part, is based on the joint work with Theodash and Tara Galvindi. And Tara Galgindi. And also, the second part, the hydrodynamic part, is based on the joint work with Chanu Kim. Okay, so I'm pretty much sure that I do not have to explain what is Euler equation in this room. So I'm interested in 2D Euler equation. Here it is for TST form. Yeah, okay. Actually, my volume is actually. Actually, my volume is actually max. Yeah. Let me try. Yeah. Let me okay. All right. Hello, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Can anyone enter the room? Yeah, can anyone in the room say something so that I can hear? Oh, yeah, now it works. Thanks a lot. It seems like my earphone was bad. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, thank you very much. All right. So yeah, this is the vorticity form of the 2D Euler equation. And like we have a, it's just a transport equation for the vorticity and the velocity field is recovered from vorticity via. Recovered from vorticity via VOS available. And by singular solution, I'm mostly focusing on the Judovich solution where vorticity is bounded or generalized Judovich, which I'm going to explain later. And also the pernomider solution where vorticity can be unbounded, but it's still in like LP space. Then what we know is that for us. For Judovich solution or generalized Judovich solution, we have a global well-poseness. And also for deep-mida solution, we have a we do not have a uniqueness, but we have a global existence of solutions. Yeah, and also we know that by Vishic that if we add some forcing, then yeah, we have non-uniqueness, in fact. Also, these solutions are weak solutions. That being said, they are, yeah, we do not have enough regulation. They are, we do not have enough regularity, for example, we do not have a derivative for the vorticity, so the solution should be understood in the weak sense. Then for those solutions, there are two questions that I would like to pose. So the first question is: What can you say about the behavior of singular solutions? As far as we, yeah, as we already know pretty well, they are. Already know pretty well, they are, yeah, yeah, we know the well-posedness or global system solution. But beyond that, can you say something more about the behavior solution? For example, can you say about the propagation of certain structures? For example, some singular, suppose that initially we have some singular vortex like this, then can it propagate? Yeah, we can ask such questions. And the second question is then related to this. Then, related to the question of how to interpret the solutions. So, usually we interpret singular solutions as a limit of a more regular object. So, can you derive singular solutions as limits of some other object? Of course, we know that those singular solutions can be obtained as limits of smooth solutions of Euler, or we also know that there are vanishing viscous limits. But in this talk, I But in this talk, I would like to focus on how can we derive the singular solutions of Euler as a macroscopic limit of solutions of Boltzmann equation, which governs the behavior of the fluid system in a more like a smaller scale. So these are two questions I would like to pose and discuss in this talk. So let's start with the first question. Question. To answer this question, maybe the reasonable starting point would be the transport equation. The 2D OLA equation is in vorticity form is basically a transport equation. So here's the transport equation. Then if you have a transport equation, then we have an associated ODE, which gives you the flow. Then for sufficiently good velocity field, then we have a uniqueness. Field, then we have a uniqueness, and the sufficient condition is basically Oscar condition. So, let me explain what is the Oscar condition. Then, let's say L is the modulus of continuity for the velocity field. That being said, ux minus uy is controlled by L of X minus Y. Then we define the quantity M, which is the integral of the reciprocal of L. Then ask. L, then also condition just means that this m goes to infinity as t goes to zero. In other words, L does not go to zero like too slowly. And the Oscar's lemma says what Ausculus lemma says is basically the development of phi of phi x minus phiy can be controlled by the initial data. Controlled by the initial data plus the modulus of continuity. In some sense, this is just a generalization of Bronol lemma, which is more popular. Okay, so some examples of these Auscot conditions are the following. For example, we have a Lipschitz condition, then L is G, and therefore the M, which is an integral of the 1 over L, is just lower. One over L is just logarism. Or we can think of a slightly worse modulus of continuity, for example, log Lipschitz. Then L is like G times log one over G, then M becomes log log of one over G. And like we can go further, we can go like go over and over and over. So for example, if L is G times load times load times data data and log, log log, log, log, then M is just Log, then m is just log, yeah, just n plus one time iteration of the logarithm. Okay, then what we know is that for output of velocity field u, then there is a unique integrable solution to the transport equation, and that is just Lagrangian flow map. But more, there are not much quantitative information about this setup. Quantitative information about this setup. Yeah, except for the regularity below, yeah, just below lip shift. Yeah, when you have a below lip shift regularity, then yeah, you know some like a losing estimate. But if you go even below, then actually there's not much information. And we first, I would like to say that there are certain singular features which propagate by OSCOD vector fields. So this is the first result. So, this is the first result. So, the vector, you know, let's say L is the oscillator vector field and U is the divergence-free with the modulus continuity L, with where like U is the OSCO. Then let me define the semi-norm by the f over fx minus fy divided by m of x minus y to the some power gamma, where gamma can be any real number. Any real number. Then this defines the semi-norm. Then actually, this flow, this solution of transport equation preserves this semi-norm. So here, if gamma is positive, then m of x minus y to the power gamma is basically blowing up near gamma equals x equals y. Therefore, this means that this semi-normal measures the singularities. And also, when gamma is negative, then by the same reason, the semi-known measures the cost. So we can see that the transport equation preserves some sort of the cost or singularity depending on the modulus of continuity for the vector field u. The proof is quite simple. It actually follows the argument of Che and John. Folllows the argument of Che and Zhang, which is a yeah, says the preservation of logarithmic cost for the Lipschitz script. The idea is very simple. You just use the Oscar lemma to just measure the modulus of continuity for the flow map itself. And from that, you can measure the image of the ball under the death flow. And from there, you can just calculate it. There, we can just calculate it. And moreover, we can even say that certain singular structures actually keep their shape. So, this is the second theorem that we prove. So, let's say L and M are just as before, and F be some smooth function which does not grow faster than linear. Then, if in Then, if initially the initial data has the form f of m x minus x 0 plus b 0 for some at infinity function b 0 locally, then the flow of the solution, Lagrangian solution seta also has the form zeta equals f of m x minus phi x 0 comma t. So x 0 is also transported by the flow. Transported by the flow plus some error term B where B is in a low infinity. So for example, if you put F equals just FX equals X, then it says that if initially the transport the initial data has a certain singular some column of vertex, then it propagates and is for some time with L infinity error. So yeah. So, yeah, again, the proof is straightforward. You just write, you just b is the error term. So, you just measure the error, which is the difference between f of the flow map, x minus phi minus f of the initial data. Then you can use the Tuhanel form. You can just like take the tailor, then use the f prime being bounded, and you're done. So, what kind of, then you can ask what kind of shape can propagate. So, for example, as I said, well, for example, f x equals x, then you can just propagate the singular shape itself. Or you can make even like a slower growing term like skirt of m or logarithm of m, you can actually propagate. And you can even propagate something more. And you can even propagate something more pathological. So, for example, if you put if you put f to be sine of lambda g, where lambda is something small enough, then actually this shape looks like because n goes to infinity as x gets x0, therefore changes the sign like a topology sine curve as x approaches to phi of x, x0, t. So, yeah, those kind of pathological structures also propagate. And can you ask, can you be a little bit more ambitious? For example, can we put fx equals x square? It seems actually the result is sharp in the sense that if we put superlinear fx equals x squared, something like this, then b does not remain in LMPK anymore. Okay. So that's yeah. Okay. So that's the first thing. And now we try to apply this result to the 2D Euler equation. So with the singular initial data, for example, something like a singular vertice. Okay, so if M is singular but not too singular, But not too singular, then by Bios-Sava law, U still remains in a certain nice space, therefore, U is an oscillator vector field. However, because Biosaval law is also inferred certain singular kernel, so the modulus of continuity for U is actually worse than the L, which is supposed to be negative one over m prime. For example, if U is like little U is like Lipschitz, then L equals G, L G equals C, therefore, M should be logarithm. However, the logarithmic vortex is not actually even in generalized utophage. So we do not even know that there are unique solutions. Okay, then, however, still we can say something because of the Something because of the cancellation from the radial symmetry of the singular vertex. So, to say, to put it more precisely, let me first define some function space, generalized Eudovic space. So, the main point of the generalized Eudovic space is that the vorticity or Lp normal vorticity grows mildly in the integral between x p. So let's P. So let's say set is a sum function defined on the p to some positive number such that integral of the one over p set of p is infinity. So set of p does not go or does not grow too fast. So for example, set of p goes log p or log log p or something like that works. Okay, then generalized Judovich space is defined by the following. is defined by the following. F is in Lp for all LP from P equals 1 to infinity. And its norm is defined by the F of L P norm divided by set of P. And of course, you have to take the supremum over P and that being fine. Then if vorticity is in generalized use of space, then we know that it will propagate for all time. It will propagate for all time, and moreover, the modulus of continuity can be calculated by the following: so ux minus uy is bounded by x minus y times log of 1 over x minus y, and it's actually slightly worse the setup of log of 1 over x minus y. And still, this can be, this is as good and therefore flowing. And therefore, flow is well defined, and existence and uniqueness in the generalized use of each space is already established. Okay, then what we can say is the following. So first, we assume that the seta is log KOP, and L and M are L is the Oscar modulus continuity. Modulus continuity, which is actually slightly worse than Loplipschitz. And M is again an integral of the reciprocal of L. So for example, the singular vertex that we can put here is local log one over G or log local log one over G or something like that, but not local arithmetic vertex. Then the vorticity field, vorticity omega. Which starts in the form of M. So it's singular but not too singular, we're going to propagate in the 2D Euler equation. So that being said, if we allow, if we start with the M with some small error term, then the propagated vorticity will have the form M of X minus phi star T, which is another, so the center will also. So, the center will also propagate with some equation, plus the b, which is the error function as well. So, yeah, so that's another result. And the key idea is the radial symmetry of the radial symmetry. So, we just assume that BN's phi star as just before. star as just before. Then we can decompose omega as omega s plus b, where omega s is the m of x minus phi star. Then we can apply the Biosaba law for each of the omega s and b. Then u r is, yeah, and u r and u s are just like that. Then both of them are OSF. Now, the key observation is that omega s is radial with respect to the center phi star. Center phi star and US is basically circular. Therefore, US dot grade x of omega s is always zero. From there, we can say that omega s we're going to just propagate by the whole velocity field if we put the v star as the u r of v star t, t. So that is that then we can write That then we can write the equation for b, which is more or less like a uh, then yeah, we can use the dohamil, and then standard estimate will give the result. Okay, so the picture is the following. We have a certain uh singular vertex, which is not too singular. Then, up to some time, we can act the vertex will gonna just move around, but still, it retains. Around, but still it retains its form. And moreover, we can think of the multiple singular vertices. So we put the vertices here and there and there and there, then they all gonna propagate in a similar way. Yeah. And moreover, the evolution of the center will going to exclude the self-interaction. We're not gonna have the interaction between the center and itself. So it can be, it can be. So it can be some kind of analogous to the vortex wave system, which is a point vortex plus some perturbation. And one key difference is that point vertices are too singular, so therefore they do not solve the Euler equation. However, this less singular solutions are actual solutions of 2D Euler. And another question is, can we deal with more singular? We do with more singular vertices, like something more singular than look, look, and we do not know the answer yet. Okay, and another result which has a slightly different aspect is the propagation of possible non-uniqueness. So depending on we know that depending on MITA solution, which is the verticity being in LP, for some p. L P or some P between one and less than infinity, then we have a global existence of solution. However, with forcing, there is non-uniqueness, and it is open that whether there is a non-uniqueness without forcing. But we would like to say that even if there are non-uniqueness, but they will gonna behave in a certain way. Going to behave in a certain way. So, for example, let's say there are two different solutions depending on either solution omega 1 and omega 2, starting from the same initial eta, omega 0. Then I would like to ask, how different are they? Then, what we can say is that this non-uniqueness propagates with the speed, the u of the L-infinity norm of the velocity for p greater than 2. P greater than 2. So here's the result. The first result is that let's say U1 and U2 are two different weak solutions of dependent by the solution. If then U1 minus U2 cannot be too smooth. More precisely, what we can prove is that actually if U1 minus U2 are in some Jeffrey space, then actually we can control the Actually, we can control the difference L2 norm of the difference U1 minus U2 by the initial data U10 minus U20, which is 0. Therefore, U1 and U2 should be same. This says that U1 minus U2 should not be in certain Jeffrey space. And second, we can say a little bit about the sequential limit of the dependenom IDA solutions. Solutions. So let's say omega zero is dependent on MIDA, but it's smooth except for the origin. Then a natural way of thinking about this data is about different MITA solution is the limit of regularized initial data. So let's say omega 0, epsilon is a regularized initial data, which converts to omega 0 as epsilon goes to zero. And let's say omega epsilon. And let's say omega epsilon is a corresponding solution. Let's say omega star is a subsequential limit of this dependent solution. Then omega star is the weak solution of the Euler equation. And moreover, what you can say is that omega star is smooth, is in fact CK for any k if you want, outside of a sample of B1 plus CT, where C is just, yeah. Where C is just the yeah, supreme norm for the adam fitting norm for you, so there is a no yeah uniqueness. Uh, so except for that dead ball, which is growing in time, linearly in time, solution is uh uh yeah, the solution is smooth. So the known, yeah, the so by the first part, non-uniqueness will require certain uh Requires certain non-smoothness, and that non-smoothness is just cannot go very fast. It's just propagating in a linear speed. So that is the first question that I would answer to the first question I pose. So the quantitative behavior of the singular solutions of Euler. And let's think about the second question: how to interpret these singular solutions? So, usually, singular solutions are interpreted as a limit of more regular solutions. So, one can think of it as a limit of regular Euler solutions. And also, you can think of it as a vanishing viscosity limit. So, for example, Constantine and Diribush and L Gindi proved that you do. Utovich solution can be regarded as a vanishing viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equation, even in the vorticity LP level. And that's actually quite non-providable result. But in this talk, I would like to ask a little bit different question. Can we regard those things? Can we regard those singular solutions of Euler as some sort of macroscopic limits of description of the fluid in a smaller scale? Why do we care such limit? Well, it is somewhat related to the Hilbert's program of developing limiting process for the between the physical models of different scales. So it's called Hilbert's. Scales. So it's called Hilbert Six problem. And yeah, so he was interested in how to derive the atomistic point, like limiting procedure from atomistic point of view. So like a bunch of Newtonian particles to the, in the end, the fluid limit or fluid system. And one can go there like a direct, one may try to go there directly. One may try to go there directly, but like another way of getting there is just introduce some middle-scale equation, which is called mesoscopic. So, first go from the atomistic point of view to the mesoscopic system, and then going from mesoscopic system to the fluid description. And how to do that? Basically, the idea is just ruling out the small-scale fluctuation by average. Fluctuation by average. So you just coarse grain the system and then you just discard the unnecessary small scale fluctuations to get the large scale description. However, if voids are not regular, this limiting process can be very, very non-trivial. I'm going to explain it in the later slide. But first, let me try to Let me try to introduce what is the middle scale, mesoscopic scale. So, the mesoscope, so we use the idea from kinetic theory. So, it is still a continuum description. However, it still has some information about the distribution of the velocity for the particles. So, it's called the kinetic description. Is called a kinetic description, and the governing equation for the kinetic description of fluid is called the Boltzmann equation. So it has the following form. So it has the first just transport part and also the collision part. And for the collision operator, I'm going to assume that it's a hard sphere collision. Then the collision operator is usually the gain after the Uh, gain after the gain after the collision minus the loss of the collision. So, it usually has it has this form. Of course, you can think of other type of potential, like other type of collision, like soft potential and so on. But in this talk, I'm gonna only think about the hard sphere collision. Then, there are lots of different important properties of Boltzmann equation. For example, the most famous one is the Boltzmann equation. Example: The most famous one is the Boltzmann-H theorem, which says the entropy never decreases. Or you can think of the collision invariant, which is the mass, which corresponds to mass linear momentum and energy, and so on. But here I'm going to just put, I'm going to just end up with one terminology, which is called the Maxwellian. So this Maxwellian. So, this Maxwellian, which looks like a Gaussian distribution, is a minimizer of the entropy functional. And here I put the local Maxwellian because it might depend, here R mu setup, which depends on the density, velocity, and temperature might depend on the space and time. So, M of R density R and velocity U and temperature setup of V looks the Of V looks the following. So R is the density. So it just is multiplied over the 2π set at the some power 3/2. And then exponential of the minus V minus U square over 2 times temperature. So this is the local Maxwell layer, which I'm going to use several times in this talk. Okay, so we have a Boltzmann equation. So, we have a Boltzmann equation. Then, how to take the limit from the Boltzmann equation to the fluid equation? Well, in that case, what we usually do is first non-dimensionalize the equation, and then there will be some parameter, then take the limit for that. For Boltzmann equation, there are two non-dimensional numbers in this equation. The first one is called the kinetic Truhal number, which is based the rate. Number which is based on the ratio between the microscopic length scale and the macroscopic length scale. And the second non-dimensional number is the constant number, which is the ratio between mean free pass length divided by the macroscopic length, which explains the frequency of collision. So as Knusson number goes to zero, that being said, mean free path is much, much smaller than microscopy length. Much smaller than microscope length, that means that solution will the collision will be more and more frequent. Okay, or with this non-dimensional numbers, we can rewrite the Boltzmann equation in a non-dimensional way. Then it looks like as true-hall number times partial Tf plus V dot grade XF equals one of the constant number of the collision operator. And nice thing is that other non-dimensional numbers also can be written as a ratio between these two numbers. So the Mach number, which is the ratio between the macro and micro velocity scale, is usually put as same as the Sruhan number. And another relation, which is quite interesting, is that the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between the Between the viscous forcing versus the inertial forcing can be written as the ratio between the Knussen number and Mach number. So it's actually one of Reynolds number is the Knussen number divided by Mach number, which is called the von-Kerman relation. Okay, so then what kind of limit that we can take? So as I said before, as constant number gets smaller, Knowston number gets smaller and smaller, then we have a more and more collision. And therefore, the average number, because we have more and more collisions between particles, they will going to exchange their velocity more and more and more. Therefore, the average numbers will be more and more representative of the whole distribution. So, we call it a hydrodynamic regime. So, Kunsten number goes to zero is a hydrodynamic regime. Okay, and also the Mach number goes to zero is the incompressible regime because the macrospeak velocity is much, much smaller than the particle velocity. So speed of sound can be ignored. So and because of the von-Karman relation, if Mach number and Knuckles and numbers are comparable to each other, Knussen numbers are comparable to each other, then the Reynolds number is also order one. Therefore, the regime is called the incompressible neighbor-stock regime. And also, if both Knunsten number and Mach number goes to zero, but Kunsten number goes to zero much faster, then the Reynolds number will going to increase because of the von-Kammer relation. And that is what we call the incompressible Euler regime. Okay, so now we can. Okay, so now we can put the system. Now we can put the sense of limit. So we put the Struhau number and Mach number to be epsilon, which goes to zero. And kappa is the one of the Reynolds number, which is a function of epsilon, goes to zero. And then the non-dimensional or non-dimensional Boltzmann equation looks the following: the epsilon partial Tf plus beta squared xf. Tf plus beta squared xf equals one over epsilon kappa of the q of f. Then the goal is that one over epsilon of the v integral of the v f d v, which is the macroscopic velocity converged to the of the distribution, mean velocity of the distribution converged to u is what we want to achieve. And also, I And also, I would like to emphasize that here I put x in the t square, so I'm going to assume the symmetry of the whole distribution in g direction. Okay, then how can I how can we do, how can you achieve such limit? There are several methods, but I will use the method called the Hilbert expansion. So this is basically a So, this is basically a perturbative method. So, we perturb around certain Maxwellian, and in this case, because the limit is singular here, unlike the Nevierstuff limit, where kappa equals one, here kappa goes to zero as well. Therefore, the pre-factor is much larger than the neighbor stock. And because of that, we cannot use the global Maxwellian, which is Maxwellian with the Maxwell and we did just unit density and unit temperature and no velocity. That is not possible. But we can use the local Maxwellian. So you have a small shift of the mean velocity from here. Then you can rewrite the distribution as the local Maxwellian plus the small remainder of the size epsilon plus some character terms which is supposed to be much smaller. Which is supposed to be much smaller than the even characters. Okay, then what we would like to say is that the FR is getting smaller and smaller and smaller as epsilon goes to zero, because the mean velocity of the distribution can be written as a u plus integral of Vfr plus data, and therefore Fr should go to zero. Fr should go to zero. So the whole problem boils down to the stability estimate for FR. So if FR starts small, then it remains small. That's the goal we would like to achieve. Okay. Well, basically, we can do that. There are well-developed theoretical Hilbert extensions. There are lots of literature for this. And also, there are other methods that you can use. Other methods that you can use, for example, there's a entropy method, which was, yeah, for Navier Stokes, they can, yeah, like goes in, like Saint-Raymond proved like any essentially like large data U and like hydrogen limit for that. But for Boltzmann, for the Euler limit, it's a little bit more singular. Limit is a little is more singular, and therefore they have to use the relative entropy method. And there, uh, you need and list the uh uh Lipschitz regularity to guarantee that you are given a for given solution, Euler solution U, the Boltzmann limit uh converges to U. And there, uh, what you obtain is the weak convergence of the mean uh velocity of the distribution. Velocity of the distribution to you. Okay, so that's the Lipschitz regularity. And if you want some stronger Hubert extension method, then even to obtain the L2 regular stability of FR, then actually you need some higher soboleft regularity for U in H for U. So HK for K, certainly greater than 3 in this case. three in this case uh yeah no on a k yeah one uh so that like uh two so that is like uh more than lipstick but on the other hand you can get like a strong convergence and of course if you want to control fr in a higher stability in x variable then of course you will need a higher regularity for u and yeah you'll get the stronger convergence okay Okay, so now you can see an issue for singular solutions of Euler. So, the minimum regularity for whatever method you use in the previous literature, you need at least Lipschitz regularity, which you do not have. And moreover, one of the reasons we are interested in the singular solutions of Euler are basically. Are basically the singular structures there. And they are only observable in stronger topology. So we would like to get the convergence in a stronger topology, if possible. And another issue is that viscosity effect always blurs the single structure. Therefore, we would like to suppress the viscosity effect as much as possible. And the final issue is that I would like to allow the large perturbation as much as possible. Large perturbation as much as possible. So it cannot be, the remainder cannot be very large, but I would like to have it as large as possible. So we need to figure out how large it is. And all these issues are somehow intermingled. So first, let me think about the viscosity effect and the size of the remainder. If you do the Hilbert expansion method, then by looking at the correct Then, by looking at the correctors term correctors carefully, you will find that incompressibility condition will come out as a constraint to cancel out the large term, size epsilon negative one. And Euler equation will come out as a constraint to cancel out all the terms in size one. And then viscosity term comes next, and it has the size kappa. Size kappa. And it turns out that we need to suppress all the terms up to size kappa. And there are two different ways to deal with this issue. So the first way is put viscosity term in Euler. So we solve the copper negative stocks equation instead of Euler. Then we use the vanishing viscosity limit. And this is, yeah, this is doable, but it's still not very. It's not very, we are not very happy because we would like to suppress the viscosity blurring effect as much as possible. And also, vanishing viscosity limit itself is actually quite non-trivial result to achieve. And then the other way is just we introduce further character expansion. But the most straightforward way to do that is just put calculation. Way to do that is just put kappa equals epsilon, but it turns out that actually that makes the system too singular. We would like to say kappa is just like let's say square top epsilon, that would be nice, but kappa equals epsilon is too singular. And also, this consideration gives us that the largest possible size of the FR is probably the small of the kappa. So it's comparable but smaller. Is comparable but smaller than the viscosity effect. So that's the first issue. And then now we deal with the issue of the lack of regularity for the Euler field itself. Then we use the stability result. That being said, we can approximate the singular solution U by the regular solution boiler U beta. Boiler u beta with initial data u beta zero, which is the regularized initial data, which converts to the u0 as beta goes to zero. And then instead of perturbing around the local Maxwellian m1 epsilon u, we can perturb around mu beta, which is the Maxwellian m1 epsilon u beta, one. Then we rely on the stable. Then we rely on the stability that is uβ converges to u in sober left space. Then the mean velocity, one over epsilon of f epsilon, we're going to be of the form u beta plus something small, which converts to u. So yeah, we can do that. And also, there are some additional advantages for this approach. approach. The first thing is that u beta is smooth, therefore beta can be adjusted. So we can put the speed of beta going to zero sufficiently slow so that the growth of all the bad term are actually quite small. So like yeah, depending on like if so. And also because u beta is itself is smooth, therefore we can get the stability estimate for the remainder in a higher subolef space. In a higher sublf space H2 in X. In other words, we can also take the stability estimate for the dx of FR and dx square of FR. Okay, now we move on to the issue of the topology and also like a stronger topology issue and the larger perturbation. So the yeah, the key point is that actually using the point is that actually using the strong topology gives a better scaling. So here although I did not put the whole details of the remain equation for the remainder, but remainder equation has the following structure. You have a transport and also partial coercive structure coming from the collision operator, but there are two bad terms and therefore you cannot close the energy estimate. So the first problem is that because we First problem is that because we are perturbing around the local Maxwellian, and because transport operator can apply to the local Maxwellian, then it produces a higher momentum. So it's called the momentum stream. And yeah. And the second issue is the non-linearity. Our equation is nonlinear because we have a collision operator and therefore which is quadratic. So the remainder can collide to each other. Polite to each other. But the nice thing about this is that there is no problem in V variable in obtaining L2 estimate because the collision operator can be written as an integral operator and it is an integral operator with a rapidly decaying multiplier in V variable. Therefore, L2 norm in terms of V Or in terms of V can be like well controlled. What is legs? What legs is the integrability in X? Therefore, we can actually just put the like measure the energy estimate H2 in X and then use the interpolation L infinity, then it actually works. For the moment stream term, using the small pre-factor, then actually there is. The small pre-factor, then actually, there is no issue. So, this method gives us a scaling, the following scaling. So, FR itself should be of the size of order kappa. But whenever you take the one spatial derivative, you lose the scaling by square root of kappa. And therefore, dx square of FR should be order of one. And that's why you need to suppress all the terms. Why you need to suppress all the terms of today order kappa. Okay, so that's the scaling. And finally, the last thing we found is that this method actually has one advantage that we only uses basically one scaling for all the estimate, except for the moment stream term. But moment stream term has a very, very small prefector, so there is no issue. So what it means. What it means is that we now have a clear picture that which term is small and which term is large. In previous method, we have to use the sub-or method all together. Therefore, it's not very clear that which term is large, which term is small, because in energy estimate, this term can be very small, but in other estimate, this term can be actually very large. However, now we mostly rely on the energy estimate, and therefore we can now clearly say that which term is small and which term is large. Say that which term is small and which term is large. And the advantage of that is that we now can come up with a new newly designed expansion, which can separate the evolution of the Euler equation with the viscosity term. It's basically the same as what we have done for the like Kappa equals. Kappa equals, yeah, what, like a just, it's just like the same as the pushing it into a like a further extension. But when kappa is not equal to the like epsilon or epsilon square or some like integer powers of epsilon, it's not very straightforward. However, now we can do that. So now putting all this together, now we have a result that for such singular solutions of 2D or equation, there exists a sequence. There exists a sequence of Boltzmann equations where f epsilon equals mu beta, which is a local Maxwellian with the velocity epsilon u beta, plus some term of order kappa times epsilon, such that the mean velocity converts to u in the sobular space. And moreover, this u beta solves Euler equation, not the Neger-Stokes equation. So, for example, when if you have When if you have u is a vortex patch, not necessarily very smooth, because like u is one in C one alpha, then like yeah, gradu is like a lip shit. So you can even use the entropy method. So let's say you use a vertex patch, then u beta is also smooth oiler, but it's a it is a patch solution, but there is a small layer which depends on the whose thickness scale depends on better. Okay. Better. Okay, so that's all. That's it, and thank you very much for your attention. Do you have any questions? I have one. Well, I don't know if it's a question, but the second result that you have on the propagation. Second result that you had on the propagation of singularity. I had a comment that was talking about the singularity of M versus B. Can you elaborate more on that? Yeah, sure. Yeah, so the propagation of singularity, this one? Yes. Yeah, so you mean the on the B? Your comment on the it's only meaningful only when I It's only meaningful only when M is more singular than B. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. So, here, like, when like a B is more singular than M, then actually, like, well, then like, let's say B0 is more singular than M, then like B can be just defined as the omega minus M, right? And B, yeah, B, B will gonna stay in the same. P will going to stay in the same function space as P0. Therefore, like it's not very meaningful statement. But yeah, when M, for example, like M is a singular vertex and B0 is L infinity, then yeah, what it says is that M is in a very like still, it's just propagate in a same manner, and B will going to remain elevated. However, Going to remain at infinity. However, let's say M is something like this, but B is even more singular, then, yeah, it's not a very meaningful statement. So I think it's just the first theorem that you showed. There was this Old Good vector field was pertained free, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, how much the divergence-free condition is essential? What about constant divergence, for instance? Oh, so you mean the divergence issue, right? Yeah, like divergence. Yeah, I think, well, like actually, for simplicity, we just put the divergence free, but I'm not very sure whether divergence. I'm not very sure whether divergence per condition is actually very essential. I think it can go more or less in the same manner, but I haven't checked the detail. Okay, let's see for our speaker again. Thank you very much. And we have a half an hour coffee break. Have an hour coffee breaks. Thank you. First part of the slide. Oh, you know the MAC lab Eastbrook? There's a cotton shop. Yes. Yeah. So it's a restaurant, but they. Yeah, so it's a restaurant, but they also have a little high circle. You know. I figure they have to have coffee stuff, right? Or there used to be a coffee shop underneath the dining, the book dining. They closed it up. So I just said, I'm going to go to the restaurant and see if they can. I will go to the restaurant and see if they can come in.
