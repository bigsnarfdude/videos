Onto the skeleton and became tropicalized, as Renzo was saying. We said something that gave me this idea that eventually became my little contribution to Herbish Delmont theory a few years later. I have a great fondness for this place for that reason. So it's great to come back and talk about some of those things today. So my talk is going to be primarily an introduction to tropical linear series. And more specifically, I'm actually going to simplify even further and think mainly about finite graphs as opposed to tropical curves. So I'll say something about. Tropical curves, but I'll say something about how you go from finite graphs to metric graphs. So that's my main goal today. So many of you, of course, know quite a lot, or even taught me initially, what tropical linear series are. So some of this may be familiar to a lot of you, but I am going to try to intro leave some comments on some recent work as well. And in fact, this panel over here, I may or may not say hardly anything about it aside from gesturing at it a little bit, but there's a formula I just wanted to put on the board because I'm excited to talk to a few of you about it this week. To a few of you about it this week. So, I want this on the board, and I'll probably point at it once or twice. It's related to some upcoming work that I hope to have on the archives. It's too small. Is that your comment? Yes. Yeah, I will write larger for the main body of the talk. I apologize for that. I tried to crown it into a small space so it doesn't dominate my talk. But yes, if I do write too small in real life, please heck on me again. Okay, so I want to fix a little bit of notation throughout. So Isabel nicely set this up. So, Isabel nicely set this up this morning by using the same notation. So, g is going to be the genus of a graph or a curve. R is the rank of a linear series, d is the degree. And I'm often going to think about this rectangular partition, dimensions r plus 1, g minus d plus r. For reasons that at this point I can't remember, I am completely used to thinking about the transpose of the rectangular partition that Isabel wrote down, so I'm going to continue to do it today or I'll make mistakes. All make mistakes. But the dimensions of the partition are the important thing. And I love this partition for a lot of reasons. The most basic of which is that the Brill-Nerther co-dimension is the number of boxes in this partition. So the Brill-Nerther expected dimension is G minus, the number of boxes in Hanbal. So what I want to lead with before we say anything about graphs in tropical linear series is mention a few numerative facts in the Elvesberg geometry world that are informed by. That are informed by tropical calculations. So, for my purposes, why I love linear series on graphs is largely not because I'm very good at proving theorems about curves using graphs, but more because I can do computations on graphs where the comment forx is very explicit, but then predict theorems on algebraic curves. And this was the case with Hurbitz-Perlnode, they're eventually became the Hurvs-Perlnoga theorem, for example. So, as a prelude, I want to talk about some algebraic geometry statements that will be nicely reflected in the commentator. Reflected in the combinatorics. The first of these is something called Castel Monogos Count, which Isabel mentioned. Oh, I'm instantly writing too small. Sorry about that. Let me swatch back tweak. Castel Modos count. So this is an old calculation. I think it's the late 19th century. And it says the following. When rho, the Brill Nerd number is equal to zero, the number of points in WRD for a general curve So I should write here C general. If I forget to say that, it employs assuming C is a general curve, unless I say otherwise, is equal to the following number. Combinatorial stuff would denote this F subscript lambda. And this is the number of standard Young Tableau on lambda. Okay, so Isabel said something about this. This counts. I won't say too much more about it. Except, this is a great example, by the way, of. This is a great example, by the way, of an enumerative calculation leading to proofs of theorems later. So, Castel Novo certainly did not prove anything related to the Brill-Nerther theorem, but the way that he computed this was to do a certain degeneration to flight curves, which eventually was the degeneration that Griffiths and Harris used to prove the Brill-Nerde theorem. So it's a cool example from history where counting something led to a proof later on. And again, this was the case of this Brill-Nerde theory. So I like this kind of So, I like this calculation for this reason. But I do want to mention two generalizations of this to rho positive that I really like. The first of these is what you get if you compute the chow class, or if you like the cohomology class, it doesn't matter which. There's a really slick way to write this formula that people don't usually write it this way, but I really like this, is I can say that. This is what I can say that the chow class of WRD of C can be written as the number of standard Young tableau on that same partition multiplied by the Chow class of just W rho. W rho is meant to be my shorthand for W0 rho. So by this I just mean effective divisor classes of degree rho. Think of this as an avatar of the row symmetric power of the kernel. So it's something rho-dimensional. It's sort of the canonical row dimensional thing. Sort of the canonical row-dimensional thing inside the required, unless your canonical row dimensional thing is a self-intersection of the theta divisor. Multiply it by the number of standard young tableau, and you get the chat plus of the Bill Mendel frame. So the way you often see this written is this number divided by lambda factorial times the self-intersection of the theta. And it's like this way better because I don't have to divide it. So it's somehow more explicit. Also, because this is very explicit in the tropical thing. Okay, so that's the choppy. Okay, so that's the Chow class. This is the first way that this can generalize to higher rho. And the second way is a theorem they proved with Melody Chan, Montserrat, Tish Dari Vigas, and Alberto Lopez a few years ago. I think it's more than a few years ago now, actually. A few years before the pandemic is what I mean. And this is what's called to compute the holomorphic Euler characteristic. And the statement is that if you take the Euler characteristic of the The Euler characteristic of the structure sheaf of WRD. So, this is the so-called holomorphic Euler characteristic, and of course, this counts points if you're zero-dimensional, counts points with the correct multiplicity, is given by the number of set-valued Young Tableau, which I'll indicate by a subscript like so. So, this is the number of what I call set-valued Young Tableau on that same partition lambda with content one. lambda with content 1 through g. So what I mean by a set value downtown below, I'll give you a definition by example rather than making a full question. When you talk about child class, I mean a derived equivalence. Yeah, or if you like just singular cohomology shots. So just what I mean by a set-valued young test. What I mean by a set-valued Young Tableau is a superposition of Young Tableau. So here's an example. One, two, three, four goes in the same box as two, and then five goes below. So I think of this as a superposition of Young Tableau because you can choose one label from each box, and you get a standard Young Tableau. Well, not quite a standard Young Tableau because you're omitting one symbol from the list of possible symbols. But that's what I mean by a set-value Young Tableau. So if you allow yourself the symbols 1 through G. You allow yourself the symbols 1 through g, you get some number that you compute quite explicitly, and it gives you the colomorphic characteristic. So, one of the things I want to do today is. So, what is the rule? So, the rule is I put a non-empty set of numbers in each box, just from union of which are 1 through g. That's right, no matter how many. But I do have to put at least one. And the rule is that I need to have monotonicity of rows and columns between every number in this box and every. Every number in this box and every number in this box. So, in particular, you can kind of forget, yeah, you can forget symbols and get standard in the table. Okay, so I like this generalization a lot for a number of reasons. Oh, and I guess I should write some names down here. Oh, and I said something slightly wrong here, so this is what you definitely write the names down. So, this appears in a paper of Milo Duchan and myself. It was also independently proved. It was also independently proved in a slightly different way by Dave Anderson, Linda Chen, and Nikola Taraska around the same time. Their formula was different. They had a determinantal formula, and then there's some nice combinatorial argument to show that it coincides with this assuming here of calculation. Okay, so those are two kind of higher row versions of customer's count. And what I like about these is that we will see them. I like about these is that we will see them in the tropical calculation as well. And now is the first time that I'm going to point at this speculative board on the right, just very quickly, to say where this is going, in case I want to think about this while I'm telling you things about chip firing or something. One of the things that I've wanted to do for a long time is understand what the intermediate set value tableau counts are. So this one on the left, you're allowed symbols one through size of lambda. This one on the right, you're allowed all their symbols. This one on the right, they're allowed all their symbols one through g. And what is written down here is a formula that successfully identifies what all the numbers in between are. So if you count Jung Tableau with, set value Young Tableau with intermediate numbers of symbols, what you see in some sense is a kind of a formula that gives successive improvements to a count of a number of points on the top of both points. So at one end you get the other characteristic, at the other end you get. You get the other characteristic at the other end, you get the shot pass. When rho is zero, you get the equation. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, when rho is equal to zero, then g is equal to the number of boxes in lambda in these. Sorry, so what was the conclusion of this comment? So for the intermediate counts, do you have a geometric guess? On graph. Oh, sorry. On I can interpret it quite explicitly for graphs. Quite explicitly for graphs. For algebraic curves, I don't know. So, for algebraic curves, yeah, I don't really know. Well, first of all, I don't know if it gives the right thing for smooth curves, but I can tell you afterwards some specific examples where I know. If you take a chain of elliptic curves, it gives you something. I can tell you exactly what it means. But I don't know about for a smooth curve. Okay. So please can you state that as uh Uber's conjecture two? Fluber's conjecture tool? I think I can. I think I'll maybe wait until the problem session to formulate that just because I don't want to spend too much more talk on it. So I'll say out loud a formal conjecture just for the sake of putting a stamp down somewhere. I believe that if you replace this graph with a curve and write down this formula, it gives you a class in the growth and beakering of varieties. And I believe that that formula should correctly predict the K-theory class and the certain motivic class. And a certain motive class written down by Anderson, Chenna, and Taraska is where they're built on the variety. But I don't really know how to do computations with the K-theory computations that they do in their paper. So if people in here are good at determinantal formulas for K-theory, I would love to try to work this out sometime. See if we can check some examples of that. But maybe I'll save up for the problem. We should wait until the conjecture is proved and then call it a conjecture. Oh yeah, that's the slick way to do it. That's right. That's a quick way to do it. That's right. Okay. So, that really, let me actually move on to the combinatorial side of things. So, I'm going to title this section Tropical Brown-Arther Theory. But for my purposes, tropical, I'm going to consider kind of a simplified form, which is, I'm thinking about finite graphs. And so, what I want to do now is write down new definitions for WRD that apply to finite graphs instead of algebraic graphs. The point is that this is a combinatorial analog for Brill Nerd theory applied to graphs. So here's the way you set it up. I mean, let G be a finite graph. So a set of vertices and a set of edges. Uh-oh, and I think I just ran afoul of Renzo's rule of never giving a definition of what a graph is. I just need a letter for the vertices and edges. When I talk about the genus of a graph, I do not mean what some graph theorists mean, which is the minimum genus of a surface you can embed it on. I mean instead one minus the Euler characteristic of the geometric realization of G. I'm going to abuse notation a little bit. I'm going to abuse notation a little bit and write that as Euler characteristic OG, but I just need to replace the edges to find segments because it's a topological space. More explicitly, this is 1 minus the number of vertices plus the number of edges, plus the number of bits in the graph. So I'll denote that by g. This is, by the way, one reflection of the fact that in this story that topological In this story, that topological Euler characteristics on the combinatorial side usually correspond to holomorphic Euler characteristics on the algebraic side. So, one way to define the genus of an algebraic curve, for example, is replace that with a structure sheet. Okay, so I defined a graph, and then I just want to define what I mean by divisors and linear equivalents. So, by a degree D divisor on the graph, I mean a chip configuration, which a little bit more. Configuration, which a little bit more formally I can interpret like so. It's a selection of an integer weight to place on each vertex of the graph, so a bunch of coefficients for each vertex. And what I mean by the degree of a chip configuration is the sum of these ways. So degree D divisors are assignments of an integer to every vertex in the graph, such as those integers sums each. And more informally, I'm thinking of these as chip configurations on the graph. So C sub V is the number of chips that I've placed at vertex on the graph. I'm going to write d greater than or equal to 0 to mean that all of these coefficients are non-negative. So these are the so-called effective divisors. And then I define equivalence relation on these, which we go onto a new board to write this, we don't have to cramp it. So a card group of a graph. So the card group of a graph D of the graph G is going to be defined to be the divisor group, so the group of all degree D chip configurations on the graph modulo and equivalence relation. So this equivalence relation is called linear equivalence and analog to the algebraic situation. And it's generated by so-called chip-firing moves. So, ship firing moves again. I'm going to illustrate by drawing a few pictures because, for me, at least, that's the most clear way to understand what's going on here. I'm going to grab another color or two for this purpose. So, here's what I mean by chip-flaring moves. So, a couple of examples. If I have a degree three. For example, if I have a degree 3 vertex on my graph, like so, and I place three chips on it, I regard this as linearly equivalent to the chip configuration where I fire one chip in each direction out of this vertex, looking at the configuration that has one chip at the end of each vertex outside of, adjacent to this one. And similarly, just draw one more picture with a different degree. picture with a different degree. I have degree four vertex and I fire this vertex, let me send one in each direction, and this is equivalent to the divisor that has one chip in each adjacent vertex. These are chip firing moves, so in short, I can take any vertex and send one chip out of each edge of that vertex. So this is what you do for finite graphs. If I'm talking about metric graphs, which you often do in practical drilling. Which we often do in practical bill and other theory, I should add the phrase: move the same length along each edge. If there are one chip in every direction, but the same distance. And there's also a different way of visualizing this that I find much easier to think about, especially when you're doing computations, which is that for every bipartition of the vertices, you can fire one ship kind of from along each edge between the two partitions. So for each bipartition of V, again, I'm going to draw a picture. Partition of V. Again, I'm going to draw a picture instead of making a formal definition. So if I divide the vertices into two parts, the top part and the bottom part, I look at all the edges between those parts. I'm allowed to take one ship at the end of each edge and fire across to the other part, the other partition. Okay, and this turns out to be, so if you haven't seen this before, This turns out to be, so if you haven't seen this before and you want an exercise to kind of practice with thinking about these chip firing moves, this move right here is equivalent to doing this type of chip firing move at every single vertex on this half of the graph. So when you say bipartition, are you assuming there's no edges between things in the same? I am not. So there can be edges between, and then I just ignore them for when I'm doing the ship firing move. So the reason that's So, the reason that's compatible with what I said here was that a chip will just be exchanged in both directions. Okay, so this is the equivalence relation, and this is analogous in a certain sense to linear equivalence of divisors on curves, alternate curves. And I'm going to draw a picture to explain why. I'll draw a picture to explain why this is meant to be analogous to this equation on curves. There's a couple different ways to think about this. I'm partial to the kind of original, the kind of OG way of specializing divisors from Baker's paper from 2008. And so that's the one I'm going to describe here. If you want to think about arbitrary metric graphs, you should think about Berkovich spaces instead. But I think the easiest thing to see first. But I think the easiest thing to see first is the picture I'm about to draw. So here's how you can connect this to Delta Gray curves. And this is, I'll describe this as Baker specialization. And here's how this looks. So I start with an honest algebraic curve, a smooth algebraic curve. Curve, similar to algebraic curve, and I went to degenerate it. And if you want to specialize to a metric graph, you degenerate it in the most dramatic way possible, which is to a totally degenerate curve like this one. So this is a totally degenerate curve, by which I mean all components are T1s. And I also want to include things like no self-intersections and a couple other conditions that I won't bother writing down. So, they won't bother writing down. But this is, in some sense, kind of the most dramatic kind of degeneration that you could do this in the curve. So, I want to arrange this into a family where, for simplicity, I'll assume that this family lives over the spectrum of a DVR. It's just the nicest situation in which to think about this. So, this totally degenerate curve lives over the special point of the DVR. And over the generic point, you have a smooth curve. The generic point, you have a smooth curve. Or I guess I should say a regular curve, something like that since it's not algebraically closed to field. Okay, so the way that you can now connect divisive theory in this curve to the graph is as follows. First of all, let me take this graph and redraw it with its dual graph. Since all of these components are P1, all of the structure of the graph is just encoded by common. Is just encoded by combinatorics. So the dual graph in this case is a pentagon. So the vertices correspond to the P1s in the totally degenerate curve, and the edges correspond to nodes, which those P1s mean. So I have a bijection between the vertices over here. So I'll label a couple of these just by way of example. These vertices are U, V, and W. These correspond to curves over here. These correspond to curves over here, which I'll call LU, Lv, and LW since they're ones. Oh, and I should say also that this should be a regular family. If you have singularities in the family, you have to think a little harder about the edge lengths than the graph. Total space is regular. What's that? Total space is regular. Okay, so this is the context in which you get a specialization map. And the specialization map works as follows. If you're given a line bundle on the general fiber, line bundle L in, let's say, pick D of the general fiber, just the curve over the generic point. Curve over the generic point. You can map this to a chip configuration on the graph as follows. You do this in a very kind of simple way. First, you extend it to the entire family. So extension to the total space. And this is not unique. I'll come back to that in a second. I'll come back to that in a second. So given a line bundle on the general fiber of a family over the DVR, noise can extend it to the entire family, but it's not unique. But it's not unique in a very controllable way. It's not unique up to twists by components on the special fiber. And then from there, I turn that into a chip configuration as follows. I map this to just the collection of. I map this to just the collection of degrees of this line bundle when restricted to the individual components. So take the line bundle, restrict it to component LU, where L equals to L V, where V is a vertex in the dual graph. This gives you a collection of integers, and this is your chip configuration on that graph. Okay, and I mentioned that this is not unique because you can twist by components of the special fiber. But the good news is that this is unique up to linear equivalence. And so, this is so, in fact, you get a well-defined map from pick to pick from this construction. Point is that the paris are the same with the two files. Yeah, exactly. And in fact, let me draw one example to illustrate why that is. So this is an example that shows why chip firing moves. Use kind of millennial grammar here to say this is an example to illustrate why chip frame rooms are the right gadget here. I can't even. What's that? I can't even. I came up with the joke, but I'm not going to say it on the reference. I'll make my corny jokes later. Some of them. What's up? Um no, I I realized recently how out of date my slang is because I made a comment to a friend about like, oh yeah, like some kid was talking about like vibing with the problem on the problem set this week and that's why I knew my slang is out of date. Like Nathan, vibing is like six years old. What are you talking about? Okay, so it's even more out of date than I realized. Okay, so I'm gonna draw a quick picture to illustrate why chip flaring roofs are the right equivalence relation here to get a map, a specialization map from the Here to get a map, a specialization map from the curve to the graft. And to illustrate this, let me just say: take the following example. Let me let the line bundle that I'm specializing just be O of my line L V. So let it be the line bundle determined by this divisor. This is a perfectly good divisor in the total space. It's just one of the components of the one of the components of the central flavor. And the point is that when you look at Is that when you look at how this specializes, namely when you restrict it to the central fiber, here's what you get. So you're basically just doing intersection theory. So you take this curve and you intersect it with all the other curves in the central fiber. And so on this curve, you get O of 1 because there's one point where this divisor meets this curve. On this curve, you get O of 1. Then you have to think a little bit more to do the self-intersection here. To do the self-intersection here, but you observe, for example, that this divisor is linearly equivalent to the union of the other four curves on the central fiber. And sorry, the negative of that. So in particular, it's O of negative 2 on that component. And then when you turn this into a chip configuration, the chip configuration that you get is negative two chips on B, one chip at both of its neighbors, which is linearly equivalent to zero, right? Linearly equivalent is zero, right? So, this is the reason why linear equivalence is defined the way it is: is that when you look at line bundles that are just given by divisors supported on the central fiber, what you see exactly are the divisors that can be chip-fired. Okay, so you've got a well-defined specialization map from To find a specialization map from line bundles on the curve to line bundles on the graph. Okay, and a couple technical remarks. So keep drop the regularity, which is that where device on metric works? Yes, that's right. So there's a couple different ways to think about it. I think the simplest way to think about it is if I started with a family that wasn't regular, I could just resolve singularities and then do this construction. And what happens if I resolve? And what happens if I resolve singularities is I might take a node and replace it with a chain of p1s, where the number of p1s in that chain is determined by the so-called width of the node. And so the effect then is in a non-regular family, you need to look at the widths of nodes and read the edge lengths off of them. Or if you're working over a valuation ring that's not a DVR, then the width of the node would be a real number and it tells you the edge length. Another technical remark that I think I won't spend too much time on, since it's not really the point right now, is you might be getting a little bit freezy that I seem to be working over a curve over a non-algebraically closed field, which isn't usually the setting where you're doing classical Brill Northern theory. But if you take a finite field extension, you can just perform a base change to this family, resolve the singularities, and what you end up doing is subdividing the nodes. The net result of that is you end up passing from the finite graph to a natural graph. So you, in fact, if you take the geometric general fiber of this family, you can get a map from its card group to the card of a metric version of this graph. So you can read about all that in Baker's paper. I'm not going to take up too much talk with it right now, thank you, unless there are any questions about that, or about the map. Okay, cool. So. Cool. So that's the sort of very short version of what this definition of a quadrupole of a graph has to do with algebraic curves. So now I want to go basically purely into combinatorics land and talk about what you're going to do with this once you have the definition. I'll go back here. I'm looking at that spot of chalkboard and thinking, like, that might be enough space where I'm about to do, but I'm going to be really sad if it's not. So back to the beginning. Incidentally, my students have determined they really prefer it when I work on an iPad instead of a chalkboard, but I really prefer a chalkboard, so I'm happy to be using my HagerMo chalk here. But I mentioned that because I have a huge stash of HagerMochalk I got before the original factory closed, and so if anyone would like some, feel free to borrow some of my. For you to borrow some of mine. What's that? When you're charging for that. No, it's in the spirit of mountain exercise. And I only got that. Did Brian Conrad know you broke into his closet? No, but I did email him to ask him if he had a hookup for Edgar and Mochaka. That hookup is what I got there. This is back in 2014. Yeah. Okay. So the next Uh the next thing that I need in order to properly do Braille Northern theory with this whole setup is a notion of rank. And the big idea here that allows a lot of the story to work is a definition called the Baker-Norian rank. And the idea here is that I want an analog of H0 of a line bundle, and an algebraic curve. And so, this is what Baker and Ariane eventually found. So, they proved a graph version of the Riemann-Rock theorem for this notion of the power group of the graph. And for that, they needed to know what the analog of the canonical divisor was and what the analog was of H naught. And I think it was actually at Banch that Matt Baker sort of told me the story of how they came up with this. And apparently, they wrote most of this paper before they had the definition of rank. They sort of understood how rank had to work, and they understood kind of. How rank had to work, and they understood kind of how it needed to fit into the story. They knew what the canonical divisor was, all that stuff. And the definition of rank was like the last piece to fall into place. So I enjoy that part of this story, but that just shows that this was a nice idea that they had. It's not perfect. I mean, anyone who studied this a lot will tell you that the Baker Marine rank is not quite the right thing, but you can compute with it. That's the big word. But here's the definition. Oh, let me actually make one small correction. Oh, let me actually make one small correction. It's really an analog of H0 minus one. That'll make it. So I just wanted to say that to avoid confusion. So here's the definition. If I have a divisor on a graph, the Baker Norian ring. In English, the way I think of this is that this is the maximum number of chips that you can cover if an adversary demands that you place chips on a specific set of points on the graph. Of points on the graph. So you can formulate this as a chip firing game where Alice has brought a divisor to school for show and tell, and Bob says, that divisor is not very flexible. You can't fire it over the graph. It's kind of stuck in place. And Alice says, oh yeah, choose any R points for me, and I'll cover those points for you. So the maximum R so that Alice can win that game is the rank. If you put that into symbols, I can write it as follows. A maximum integer R. I'll say integer even though this rank is always at least. Integer, even though this rank is always at least minus one, such that I'm going to put a line break here, I know that's kind of annoying. But such that for every effective divisor of degree R, I'm going to introduce a little notation for that. Write this here. WD is going to be my notation for the set of all effective degree D classes. So the rank is the maximum such that for any effective divisor of degree R, so any selection of points that Bob says, hey, Alice, you've got to cover these points for me, when I subtract those points from the divisor, it's still effective, which is to say it now lies in W D minus R. So, this is just me symbolically writing what I just said about the chip flyer. So, Alice chooses E. Sorry, Alice chose a divisor D, Bob can choose any E he likes, and Alice needs to be able to chip flyer to something effective after all. So this is a cool definition. You'll note, by the way, that this is a perfectly good definition of the rank of a line bundle on an algebraic curve as well. But this is a definition that actually gives a useful notion of the combinatorial side of things. So you can just example with R minus one? Yes. So an example of R minus one would be if I take a, let's say, a cycle graph and I place negative one chips at one vertex and one chip at another at a different vertex. So this would have rank minus one. And the reason for this, this is a fun exercise if you've ever done networked strip drawing. If you've never worked with chip pairing before, you can prove that on a cycle, if you add up the positions of the chips, where this is position zero, this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four. If you add up the positions of all the chips, modulo the length of the cycle, that's a chip firing invariant, and the invariant is non-zero. So this cannot be fired to an effective divisor, therefore it has ranked negative. Oh, and by the way, I said that this graph, even though I wrote our Even though I wrote all R and Z here, the reason this is always at least negative one is because there are no effective divisors of rank negative one, so every divisor vacuously has at least negative one. Okay, so this is an example of something that has rank negative one because this divisor class cannot be made effective. Maybe I should write at least one example of a more interesting Rank as well. Of a more interesting rank as well. Oh, zero, thank you. Maybe let me write at least one example of a higher rank. And I'll write a chain of loops, because those are the best. Well, I mean, they're the best for some purposes. So, this chain of loops will have a special property, which is that it's hyper elliptic. Which is that it's hyper elliptic. And if I place one chip here and one chip here, so at the far left end of the graph, I claim that this divider has rank one. And here is kind of a proof by picture, or proof by, yeah, kind of a proof by picture, is I'm just going to show you what happens when you chip fire this device. Happens when you chip fire this divisor a couple times. First, let me do a chip firing where I take my bipartition to be these two vertices compared to the rest of the graph. If I fire along that set, I fire one chip to the right, both those directions, and I end up with the visor in yellow, which is two chips here. I can do the same sort of thing here. If I now do a firing along all of these vertices in the first cycle, I move both those chips over to the next cycle. I move both those chips over to the next cycle. Now, if I fire all of these vertices here, I can fire it to one chip on the top and the bottom of this next cycle. That again, I get two chips at this end. I can fire it again. I'll start reusing files now to get two chips at this end. I can do it one more time to get two chips at the far right end. So the effect of this is I just showed you a family, if you like a rank one linear series of divisors, starting with two chips at the left end and progressing to two chips at the right end. Progressing to two chips at the right end. This was made possible by the fact that I had equal edge lengths in top and bottom, so things kind of land at the right side of the cycles at the exact same moment. And that shows its rank one, because along the way I covered all the vertices in my graphs. Okay, any questions about this example? Oh, that's a great, yes, thank you. That's a great point. Yes, so, well, yes, that's a good question. No, I have not shown it. Yeah, so you do need to make a separate argument. The simplest way to argue that this does not have rank two is if Bob asks for you to leave a chip here and a chip here, you can't do it. And one way to see that is when you have graphs like this, there are chains of smaller graphs. You get a map from Picard of a whole. You get a map from a part of the whole thing to part of the individual pieces. It's one of the things that makes chains great. And you basically just collapse all the chips on this end onto this vertex. And you would get a chip here and negative chip here. And then for the same sort of reasons as here, it's not effective. Yeah, so you're right. So that's actually harder. Showing that the rank is not two is actually harder than showing that the rank is at least one. Yeah. I guess you can also use Clifford's theorem or something to get a cheap. Clifford's theorem, or sometimes you get a cheap proof that it's that it's not ranked two. But yeah, that's the engineer explicitly. It's just exhibit. Bob wins if you choose this as T. Okay, so now that we have a notion of a vapor northeye, we can use this. Of a Baker-Nordian rank, we can use this to define Brill Northern loci. And I'll call these Brill Northern loci rather than Brill Northern varieties because I don't want to fuss too much about their structure as tropical varieties. I just want to think of them as sets. And I'll use the same notation as in Isbel's talks, which is that WRD of a graph G is the set of all degree D divisor classes of rank at least R. Okay, so now once you have the definition, now you're off to the races because you can now go look in your favorite book about when your series on algebraic curves, pick a few of random, and then ask the exact same question. And then ask the exact same question for a graph instead of a curve and see if you get a fail. So, this is what people did, myself included, to much profit and fun, at least in my opinion. So, I want to show you a few examples of this. And the first one, I'm going to talk about this that I really, really like, is that you can see the custom logos count as super explicible. So, you can use this to make. So, you can use this to make Castelnobos count by ejection. And this was done by Pools, Jason, Payne, and Robaba. And I want to say 2012 was. 2012 was the year for that, but I think maybe the archive post date was 2010 or something like that. Or write the journal version there, but somewhere around there. And this is one of the, so this was an early success of tropical curves because it showed a situation where you could really do very explicit computations with this tropical version of Bill Nerder-Loci, and in fact, proof theorems. So we get a new proof of the algebraic Bill Nerder theorem. Belmer theorem. So I want to focus just on the rhythm zero situation for a moment. And the graphs that we consider are these great graphs called chain of loops. So consider a chain of G loops. And to make the notation a little bit simpler and something I'll write later, I'm going to consider a special type of chain of loops, where I always attach the two points on the chain. Put two points on the chain at adjacent vertices. This will just make things a little bit nicer. Now maybe I'll draw a chain of for loops. So each one of these is a cycle graph, some length. We'll try to make these equidistant, just draw some vertices on there. Draw some adversities on there. I like to draw antennae on my chain of loops. You don't have to because it doesn't affect the divisor theory. But it's handy to be able to distinguish this vertex from this vertex sometimes. So this is the chain of loops, and I want to let the loop lengths be so the cycle lengths be x1 through xg. I think I wrote one paper where I called this the chain of cycles and then immediately realized that no one wants to call this the chain of cycles, it's the chain of loops. I think at the time I was confused, like, isn't all loop like a self-edge, an edge that goes from brick edge to a self? That may be true, but this is a chain of loops. So I've learned my lesson. That's what I will call it from now on. But yeah, cycle lengths or loop lengths is X1 through XG. So this is a great graph. This is my understanding, and Sam, I'm sure, could tell the story. And Sam, I'm sure, could tell this story in its full glory, but my understanding is that this graph was found after much sweat and much computation and struggle. And then it's a comment that I saw Mike Hopkins give in a topology talk once where he's like, you know, the best kind of material is when you're trying to build a material that's strong and durable, then you finally construct it and realize it's also invisible. And that's kind of what happened with the chain of loops. They wanted something that's satisfied with real nerd theorem. Wanted something that's satisfied with the real-ner theorem, and then realized I can also do the use of Hatchery theorem and invite Herbert's, invent Hervitz-Brill-Nerley theory, and all this other stuff with this graph. But I like this graph a lot, and one of the things that it does for you is it allows you to make the Castle of a country by ejection in a very explicit way. And so, let me just tell you what this bijection is. Oh, let me add one genericity condition here. So, with the following genericity condition, I'm going to write kind of the, this isn't the strongest generic, the weakest genericity condition that makes the theorem true, but it's the easiest one to write down. I'm going to assume that all the cycle lengths are at least half the genus plus one. What this means is simply that the cycle length is at least the expected gonality of a genus G. So, with this genericity condition, this graph starts to resemble a general curve of genus G. If you take all the cycling equal to a smaller number k, you get a graph that resembles a general curve of gunality k. And as well, said a few words about that, but I think I'll leave it for today. So, this is the genericity condition I want to put on the cycle, and now I can tell you the following bijection. So, it turns out that if you look So it turns out that if you look at the Picard of this Picard group of this graph in any particular degree, it's isomorphic in a pretty natural way to just the product of the cycles in this graph. And as a group, what I mean is just Z modulo Xi Z. The product from I equals 1 to G. So this is one of the reasons that the change. So, this is one of the reasons that the chain of loops is such an easy graph to work with, is that you can factor it. It allows you to make a lot of computations much easier. And this bijection is super explicit. So, the bijection is as follows: given a divisor D. You can always rewrite it in a certain nice form, which is you can use what's called this break representative. So it's always linearly equivalent to a sum of one chip on each cycle plus a little correction. Let me label the rightmost vertex here, I've got R, R from right, plus D minus G times the right. Plus d minus g times the rightmost voice. So in this formula, a divisor that has a single chip on each cycle, this is an example of a concept called a brake divisor. Roughly speaking, brake divisors are divisors where you choose a spanning tree for the graph and put one chip at some end of each each edge that you cut out to get your spanning tree. Edge that you cut out to get your spanning tree. Thence you break the graph until it becomes a tree, and then you put chips where you broke it. That's called a break divisor. So there's a theorem, I think originally proved by Mepulkin and Zarkov, that every degree G class has a unique break representative, and then you just do a little degree correction. So you you're not allowing yourself to put the chip the single chip on the rope on the on the low? Chip on a rope on the low one on the antenna. Correct, yeah, exactly. So that's part of the choice that I'm making here: is that if I had a chip on one of these wires, I can chip fire back onto one of the cycles. Not on the antenna, but. Oh, so these vertices are okay, but I don't put a chip here, for example. I would fire it over to the other, over to one site where it's the other one's like. And you can see this for the chain of leaves, you can see this bijection very explicitly. Basically, what you do is start with any old divisor, and if you ever have more than one chip on a cycle, you sort of rearrange them until you get all chips but one on one of these wires, and then fire them to the next cycle. And then you just sort of do that from one end of the chain to the other until you have one chip on each cycle, and then you have some leftover chips on the far right. And under this bijection, you get a nice A nice formula, which is given a standard Young tableau on my partition lambda. I'm going to redraw lambda and add some labeling to it really quickly. So here's lambda, and I want to label the diagonals of lambda like so. So this diagonal I'll label as diagonal 0, this diagonal is diagonal. Diagonal 0. This diagonal is diagonal negative 1. This one is negative 2. The other direction, this is diagonal 1, so on. And the construction is as follows. So place a chip on the ith cycle. At the position, which would be traditionally known as Zn, so Zn, and you can think of this as an element of Z modulo XIZ, that's the way I'm identifying the cycle, given by the diagonal that the label appears in. So the diagonal. So the diagonal where n appears in the table. Okay, so that's a lot of words. Let me write an example. This is one of these constructions that is very clear to see once you look at a single example of it. So an example in genus 4 is I could take this. I could take this standard Young tableau on a 2x2 rectangle. So it has four symbols in it. The genus of the graph is four. And the positions where I place these chips are then the number one occurs in diagonal zero. And that means that I place a chip on position zero when I need to label my chip positions here. Hold on. Here's one of my cycles. I label my positions 0, negative 1, negative 2. Negative 1, negative 2, 1, 2, etc. in this fashion. So because 1 occurs on diagonal 0, I place a chip on position 0 of the first cycle. Then I look and I see that the number 2 occurs on diagonal negative 1, so I place a chip on position negative 1 of cycle number 2. Similarly, on cycle 3, I place a chip at position 1, and on cycle 4, I place a chip at position 0. So, oh, and maybe I should say that this tableau corresponds to counting points on w13 of G. So if you want a point that actually is in W13, you want it to be degree 3, not degree 4. So I add a little correction where I subtract a chip here, where there is most end. This is one of the reasons I like the antennae is now I can tell my correction chips from my actual break depisal chips. Actual rank divisor checks. Okay, so fun exercise is to check that this divisor has rank one. And if ser dual is what you get if you take the transpose of the tableau, and that gives you a second divisor that also has rank one. So this is how the construction works. Divisors with sort of like nice and positive rank, in this case they can never sort of stray too much deep into the cycle. The indigenous things of the cycles? So that's not so much the issue. The issue is that. Oh, I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. Yes, that's right. So, yes, if you have a cycle of length a million, for example, and you're working in genus 100, you pretty much will stay near the coastline or near the antennae. The electrical network is better there. So, yeah, so I can tell you kind of the informal reason why. The way that this construction works, at least the way that I like to think about it, is that The way they like to think about it is that what this tableau is trying to do is each row of the tableau is telling you where you should place chips if you want to place some number of chips at the leftmost antennae and R minus that number of chips on the rightmost antennae. So that's a special case of Bob giving you a move that he wants you to satisfy. And now, if he sends you that challenge and you have a brake device like this, what you'll find is that as you try to fire the chips across the chain, As you try to fire the chips across the chain, whenever you hit a new cycle, you have a chip sitting on that cycle, and that chip can just sort of spin around the cycle and go wherever it needs to go so you can get all your chips across the cycle and sail to the other side. But if you want an abnormally high rank, you want to do better than spinning your helper chip around before you sail to the next cycle, you would really like all the chips to land at the rightmost end and all sail together to the next cycle. There's exactly one chip position that will allow you to do that. There's exactly one place you could. You can do that. This is actually one place you could place a chip on the cycle that'll allow it to go to the other side if you send a given number of chips in from the left. And what the Tableau does is it computes for you what that position should be. Computes where should this chip be if it can sail with all the chips that come into it to the other side of the cycle. That'll stay near the coastline because unless you're bringing in a million chips from this end, you're not doing a whole lot, you're not going to move this chip very far around when you're doing your chip bucket. Checkpoint. That's roughly what's going on. So, yeah, so thank you for that question because that also allows me to give a very hand-wavy account of where this construction comes from. But this is the way that I think about it: the different rows in the Tableau are telling you kind of how many chips are coming in from the side. And then this construction of where is the diagonal is just computing where exactly you need to place it to be able to evacuate the circle as you fire across it. So, okay, so this is. So, okay, so this is the effect of this is you get this beautiful bijection. And what I like about this, especially, is that you can see the Young Tableau. This isn't just like, oh, this is equal to a super calculus problem that happens to equal the number of standard Young Tableau. Like, no, no, no, you actually can take a Young Tableau and put chips there. Like, don't have to confuse anything to be able to do it. So, talk this bijection a lot. The other reason I like it, I think I have just enough time to say a few words about this and then wave my hands if I write on this panel one more time, is that it actually. One more time is that it actually generalizes pretty well in a way that shows you these two souped-up versions of Castel Nolovo's company, so far, what tropical curriculums have done for us is they provided a laboratory where we can see its enumerative computation in a very explicit way. And I claim we can also do it for higher rho. So, for positive values of rho, here's how you can generalize this a little bit. So, now what we see instead, let me put it this way, the same parameterization works. But you only have to prescribe on row cycles. Or, sorry, you only prescribe You only prescribe not row cycles, but size of lambda chip positions. So another way to think about this is that here is a way to build all points of WRD you can You can choose row points on distinct cycles freely. This corresponds to essentially choosing a any degree row effective divisor. So there's a theorem of Flarbaud and Andreas Gross and Andreas Gross and Lila Tosh. Say it again? Together. Together, thank you. That shows that every effective class of the Bro can be represented in this way. This is called a semi-brake divisor. So you choose a semi-brake divisor, which is to say, choose some cycles where you're not planning to prescribe with a tableau and place a chip anywhere you like in those cycles. That gives row degrees of freedom in some sense. And then, after you choose that, you choose a standard. And then, after you choose that, you choose a standard Young tableau and place chips on the other cycles using that tableau. So place chips on the other cycles exactly as before. So this, I claim, and you can deduce this essentially from the constructions in Pool Story Sun Pays and Rebeva, that you actually see all of W or V this point. You actually see all of WRD this way. So every single point in WRD can be obtained by first choosing a semi-brake divisor for your row, and then choosing a standard YAM tableau on your partition, and then just forgetting that those other row cycles were there. Or the way I like to think about it, because semi-graphic divisors are about clipping a graph to make its genus smaller. Choose your row divisors and actually clip the graph down so that now it has a genus equal to the size of lambda instead of genus G. And then do the old construction on that smaller genus graph. On that smaller gene description. This parameters all the points. And so I'm at time, so I think I will just end with one last comment here, which is that it says something which in my mind is very suggestive, and again, illustrates the power of the tropical laboratory to see algebraic statements kind of through a looking glass. One thing you can deduce from this is that if you count the points on WRD, it's approximately equal to the number of standard young tableau. The number of standard young tableau in this partition multiplied by the number of effective classes of degree one. And the point is that this is exactly analogous to the formula for the Chao class of the Brill Nart variety in their classical situation. So what I've written on the right-hand side here, I'm just going to wave my hands at it for a second, and I'm happy to tell you more about it. It's a problem session over here elsewhere, is what you get if you sort of take this line of thinking to its logical conclusion. Of thinking to its logical conclusion, which is I did a parameterization here, it's surjective, but it's not injective, but you can do a little inclusion-exclusion calculation, and you end up seeing set-value young tableau of various contents between row and between the size of lampat and rho. And so what's involved in this formula are numbers of semi-break divisors of various degrees, numbers of set-ele and young tableau of various contents, and the inclusion-exclusion predicts for you the number of points. Predicts for you the number of points. And I guess I'll say one last thing, which is that I like this formula a lot because I think it should tell us something about kind of the number of points W or D wants to have on any graph of genus G, whether a chain of loops or not. And I have one piece of evidence for this so far, which is that there's an old theorem of chip piring called Marino's theorem, which, if you interpret it correctly, says that this is exactly correct if r is equal to zero. So if you're just counting effective classes, this does in fact give you the right number of. This does, in fact, give you the right number of it tells you how to compute the number of effective classes by counting semi-break device, which is one way to say it. So I'm hoping that it has something to say about the general case as well. Okay, so I should stop there. Thank you very much, Nathan. Are there any questions? So, this is for NGRAD, yeah? For the conjecture room. So, so conjecture. Uh where so conjecture so I know that's not literally true for any graph because there are no other special graphs and so my uh I guess I don't have a precise statement yet, but my the a stab at a precise statement is that there should be some way to assign multiplicities to the points of the Brill Narther locus in such a way that those multiplicities are kind of stable as you vary the edge lengths in the graph, and those multiplicities should sum to this expression. That's my that would be. Expression. That would be my hope. I think that's maybe a little too ambitious to literally be true, but that's no hoping. But for example, I have some evidence in genus 2 where you can, some real nonetheless there you can compute by intersecting theta divisors. And if you take the stable intersection instead of the set-theoretic intersection, you get the right count in some cases. That's my evidence for. Yeah. Probably the same question. Is it true for hydration? Yes, this is exactly right for a generic chain of loops. And in fact, this is the right generic chain. Oh, and if you take a k-onal chain of loops, replace Tableau with K-core Tableau, and it's the same formula works very smooth. So there's a Hervis for another version of this, which I should apologize. My abstract claimed I would get to the affine symmetric group, and I did not. But I'm happy to tell anyone about how that comes into play. The last line on the right side is that for all or Oh, this one here? This line here? Yes, this is true for all graphs. This is essentially a this isn't the language they used because obviously we hadn't invented semi-brake divisors yet, but this is essentially marinas for the one. I can show you my draft if you want to see kind of how that works. So for this alternating sum, I'm just sure, like you said, it came from inclusion, exclusion. Like you said they came from inclusion exclusion. Is there a sum without minus signs? Not that I found so far. So I think if there is such a sum, my expectation would be what you should do is somehow count the kind of strict points of WRD, so the things that have rank exactly R, and also are not ramified at some collection of marked points or something like that. Yeah, so. Yeah, so if there is an effective formula, then I think that would be the idea you would have to use. But at this time, I don't know how to make it not alternative. The drill nether special graphs, do we know what they look like? For example, do you have a family? Can you give me one explicitly knowledge for a genus? Yes, yeah. So an example of a drill nether special graph in any genus is the chain of loops where all the loops have length. All the loops have length two. So, this is brilliantly special because you have a degree two divisor on it that has rank one. So it's a hyper elliptic graph. That's the simplest example I can think of. A lot of other nice graphs of real nether special, complete graphs, complete bipartites. Yeah, there's lots of examples. It's relatively hard to come up with real nether general graphs, unfortunately. Oh, I'm glad you asked that question. No. Well, partly because I assume there's more good ones, and there are people who are better experts than I can tell you. But I can tell you my current favorite because it allows me to plug work with my students. Noah Solomon and I wrote a paper recently where if you consider graphics, Recently, where if you consider graphs that intermingle thetas with loops, these are also Brillnars are general. We put certain restraints on the graphs. And the way we do this is to each link in this chain, you can associate a tropical matrix, and you can interpret the condition, I am real another general, just or you can interpret the construction of L or D as a tropical matrix factorization problem, so min plus multiplication. And we basically figure out how to write down the matrices on. And we basically figure out how to write down the matrices on the thetas. So, yeah, so these are maybe my current favorites because now we finally know how to do some of them and show that they're going out of their channel. Yeah, I hope to have more favorites too. Lopsided thetas, right? Oh, yes, sorry, yeah, yes. These are lopsided thetas. So I guess these are Deathly Hollows graphs or something. No, no, that would have a triangle version. So easier than. So is there some geometric question that would justify the use of these graphs as opposed to true of these? I don't have one currently. This is mainly kind of a combinatorial curiosity. I think David Jensen might have an idea, an application in mind for graphs like this, but it's been a while since I talked to him about it. But no, this is mainly a curiosity. Oh, okay. Yeah, this is mainly a curiosity, and by the way, I should have. And by the way, I should have my students' name. This is Berkeley Noah Solomon, myself. I'm starting at Georgia Tech to do a PhD next year. You mentioned a couple of analogies. The holomorphic curve of writing with apology fellow characteristics. Is this just an analogy, or does it follow from non-white media and stuff like that? I believe it's just an analogy. just an analogy. I hesitate to, I'm not an expert on this sort of thing, so I hesitate to say more than that, but I believe it's just an. I think for the chain of loops, it's kind of a coincidence because a cycle has the property that it both has topological Euler characteristic zero and is the tropical version of elliptic curve, which has holomorphic Euler characteristic zero. So yeah, I don't know if there's a more general fact on that, but yeah. Fact on that. There's one slightly funny fact, which is that holomorphic weather characteristic you have to, you can't compute by cut and paste. But the specialization map is anti-continuous. These two facts play together to give some additivity. So it it doesn't follow by projection to the now. No. So there are combinatorial types for which no choice of edge lengths yield for another general graphs. Those are constructed by that one in your papers, Sam? Oh, what was it? I think you cannot do it in both. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry I'm forgetting the. Yeah, I'm sorry I'm forgetting the name. The entire pattern. Oh, yeah, that logo. Yeah, so unfortunately, yeah, so in other words, the other way to put this is that there are entire... Okay. Yeah, so there are entire top-dimensional cells of the tropical moduli space where none of them are grown or other general. There are no more questions, then thanks again. more questions but thanks again
