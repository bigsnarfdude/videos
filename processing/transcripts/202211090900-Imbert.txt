Anyway, welcome. Um very glad to see you all here this morning. And our first speaker today is Cyril Almer from École Normal Superior. And he will speak to us on local regularity for the Landau-Coulomb equation. Okay, thank you very much Russell for the introduction. Thank you Russell, Nestor, Maria and for the kind invitation and very Kind invitation. I'm very happy to be here in Benz for the third time. It's such a beautiful place, and it's a very nice conference, so I enjoy it very much. So thank you again, really, for organizing things. I know that it's quite a lot of work, so thank you for that. And uh so what I would like to talk about today is uh joint work with Oswald Goods and Alexi. François Goetz and Alexi Lasser. And it's kind of the follow-up of a previous work we did also with Maria. And I will talk about it afterwards. So the new fragment is about very soft potential in general, but today I will focus on the London-Poulon equation. Okay, so Chris almost wrote it yesterday. Wrote it yesterday. So let me start by wrote something like okay, so you can think of the Franzeau-Plan equation as an equation that looks a little bit like this. So here we are in the homogeneous setting, which means that Setting, which means that the function does not depend on x, right? So it's a function of the t variable and the t. Okay? But this is the so the precise form, let me write it now, is so use uh Um dvj plus f square. Okay, it's also it's still in non-divergence form and the precise definition of this guy is like z to the gamma v to the sorry it's a convolution. Uh sorry, it's a convolution. Sorry about that. It's the integral of my notation. So let me put a bar here. A i j of z f i j of v minus w. I j of d minus w f of w d w okay and these quantities equal d minus w to the gamma plus two and then no gamma d minus to the w etij minus d i D I D ch Something like that. Okay, so I A and oh no, sorry, so now it's minus 3 So it looks a little bit disc looks a little bit like 1 over V to the minus so precisely you've got a projection matrix to go. Okay, so it's worth I wanted to make a link with uh what I wanted to make a link with what Chris told us yesterday. But now let me erase this and write it the way I think about it. So that was unexpected. So, the way I think of this equation is this way. Okay, so I think about it in a divergence form. And it turns out that there is a constellation, and you can, if you differentiate, you've got this. And this is the form I wrote before. But the way I think about it, it's not in, it's in the divergence form of the. In the divergence form of the equation. Why do I think about it this way? Because I want to use integration by parts. So energy methods. Okay, I want to multiply the equation by something and integrate by part. So it's very convenient to write it in this divergence form. Okay? And so this guy is indeed the convolution in the V with some Some function a and this a of z is precisely so now I put the h by so that it's really f square if you develop it okay and this guy is the projection okay so this is really the the way I think about it so perhaps we About it, so perhaps we want to keep it here so that we can remember what this means. Okay, and also A equals O Okay, so let's keep it here. And so, what I would like to explain today, I just want to explain this theorem. Okay, so with Okay, if the initial data has finite mass, energy, and entropy. Okay. Okay, uh and okay any axisymmetric okay solution, so it has to be a suitable weak solution, but I will come back to that. Uh is smooth away from the symmetry axis. So, this is really what I I would like to explain uh today. So, axis symmetric, it means that uh you've got an axe. You put an X somewhere, one direction, okay, and your solution looks like this. Okay, so you see the idea is that it has a 2D structure, okay, but it has a 2D structure. Okay, but it has a 2D structure away from the axis. Okay, it's not true that it has a 2D structure around the axis. It's really away from the axis. So this is the kind of thing I would like to explain to you today. And so I talked about finite mass and energy and entropy, okay, because You know that this is constant. I mean, okay, and you also know that the entropy is under control, right? Okay? So that's why we are So that's why we assume that initially those quantities are finite, and if they are finite, they are finite and under control for all times. So that's the piece of information you want to use. So what should I say? So first, this matrix A A has Has eigenvalues bounded from below. Okay? So this is the first important thing. So you have some kind of ellipticity. Okay? And so perhaps I can give the outline of my talk first. So let me put it here. So let me put it here. So first I would like to say more about the equation. Okay. And then I want to present to you the local truncated entropy estimate. Estimates okay, then explain the De George dilemma and finally explain how to use the axis symmetry. Okay, so now. So now I start with this London-Claude equation, and I want to discuss first the eliticity of A. So it's quite nice because A you can bound all the eigenvalues from below. So this is a well-known fact, but a way to see it is that those conditions, those controls, okay, they imply that the imply that the function f in a bowl of radius R0, okay, you will have the function f that is bounded from below by a constant lambda naught, okay, on a set in the set A that is contained in B. Contained in BR0, and what is important also is that the measure of this set is positive. So, here what is important is that those quantities, those parameters here, only depends on the initial mass, energy and entropy that you have at the beginning. Okay, so what is good is now you are able to to get a bound from below. To get a bound from below. And if you think about A as the convolution of F with one over Z, you can imagine that you can easily get rule bounds. You only need to integrate, keep only this information that is located close to the regime. And this is basically the ID to get ellipticity. Ellipticity. So this was known, but the way to see it, this is due to Luis Sybest in 2017. Okay? And this is a very useful point of view from my point of view. The bad news, and this is why, so you see, that's a super nice problem, right? Because you can, it's very easy to state, okay? It's a parabolic equation, you have a diffusion matrix, you have. You have a diffusion matrix. You have a lower order term. Of course, if you develop, you have F square, so it's complicated. So you don't know if LTCT will win or F square will win. That's the whole goal of the point that you need to clarify. But that's really a simple equation to study. What was I saying? Yes, I was talking about. So, the difficulty is that for me, the main difficulty is that you cannot control eigenvalues from above. So, I should say no good control of eigenvalues from the From above. So, what do I mean by this? So, you just so you can let me do something. So, you see, you compute what you can get, and you take psi in R3 and you look at what happens to this quantity, and you can remember. You can remember the definition, so I can write it. This is the integral of 1 over 8 pi, integral of v minus w. I've got a pi of v minus w sine psi that appears here, and f of t w d w, so I just forget about this. And so this is one rupee. And F convoluted with this guy. Okay, and this is precisely this quantity. Okay, and this with the piece of information you have at hand, it's not possible to bound this quantity. Okay? Okay, so that's the difficulty of this equation: is that you need to live with the fact that Eigen values are not bounded from above. So everybody says, okay, that's good news. More diffusion, more regularity. So we all think this. Okay, stupid. Okay. So perhaps it's time to give reference about this equation. So uh so this equation was derived in uh 1936 by Londa because the Boltzmann equation does not make sense if the interaction between particles is of Coulomb type. Okay, it does not make sense. So you need to come up with a new equation. So the good equation is uh is this is this equation. Is this equation? Okay, so from a mathematical point of view, so I'm going to stick to give references about the London-Claude equation, because there is a huge, since this equation is very difficult to study, you can study a variant of it, okay, where here you put the z gamma plus one, okay, with some range to where Well plus two, let me say, probably. Well, I'm not going to think about it. A little bit. It's okay. It's a different power. It ranges between the okay. There is a variant that I don't want to discuss now, but which is important for a mathematical study, but for For a mathematical study, but for a physical point of view, the important one is the Coulomb one. Okay? Daniel Villani in 1988, he constructed both for the Rondeau-Colo equation and for the Boltzmann equation, he constructed very rich solutions that he called H solutions. And he took advantage of the fact that Of the fact that the entropy decreases, and he used the entropy dissipation term that I did not write here. Okay? And so then David Lett in 2015 came up with a very nice estimate for the entropy dissipation that I will discuss afterwards. And with that, And with that, he was able to prove that those solutions were not that weak, and he obtained many nice results, many important results for this equation. So then there is the paper by Maria and Nestor in 2016, and basically they prove. And basically they proved that if the solution is radically symmetric, then they come up with conditions ensuring the regularity. Okay? And then Silvestre in 2007, just he in particular removed the radially symmetry condition. radially symmetry condition and obtain also another uh conditional uh conditional regularity uh result. Uh what else should I mention? So and this is in this paper that Luis understood this way you can think of the ellipticity for this for this equation. So there lines for the So, the paper by Mr Mayhan. So, in 2019, so there was another conditional regularity result in the Landeaux Coulomb case, but they also have results for the modernity subpotential. For the modern tree subpotential case, right? And what else? And then there is another one, a more recent one, where they study a variant of this equation, typically by replacing this guy by this one. And they were able to get nice results for this variant of the equation. And finally, the paper I will. The paper I want to mention. Well, two more. This is a preprint, so I can write 2002, but it's not published yet. And in this paper, they come up with the new Yapunov functional. And in particular, they can prove that for large times, the solution is going to be smooth. So that's nice. That's an important question. That's an important hazard too. And as I mentioned, also this is also, right, it will appear in Adelaide Scientific de l'économie supaières, but in this paper we studied partial regularity, which means that, so I mentioned that there are a bunch. That there are a bunch of conditional regularity results, and it's important to be able to, since it's a difficult problem, if you cannot solve it, can you come up with minimal conditions to ensure regularity? But you can also try to take for granted that perhaps there are some singular points and try to measure how much there are. Okay, so it is in the spirit of those partial regularity results, for instance. Regularity results, for instance, in free mechanics for the Levi-Stokes equations. Okay, with starting with Lorre, but then with the work of Schaeffer and Quinn 18 in the paper by Kefaricod and Niander. But so in this paper, we got results for time, singular times, so times around which you are not regular. Okay, and here today, I want to localize in I want to localize in space, in the velocity variable. So that's why here it's a local regularity in T and V. Okay, so I think I'm done with references. So as you can see, okay, there have been a lot of work done in order to try to understand what happens. What happens with this equation? And so now I can. Okay, I did not mention the fact. So here, okay, you're missing an axis, but if you are radially symmetric, you are axisymmetric around any axis pass uh going through the origin, so you are smooth apart from at the origin. Apart from at the origin. Okay, so an important corollary of this theorem is that for radially symmetric solutions, solutions are smooth apart from at the origin point. Okay. So probably the most... Yeah. Could you please, from a point of view of application, explain what radial symmetry means uh in the model? I have difficulties to understand w w what what that um what that is doing. What is given us to me? From the point of view of application, I don't. Well, you mean. So, for example, if you are symmetric around the zero, if you have blue up, it means that your system shuts down. But this is x's around the zero. No, this is V. This is the velocity. This is the velocity. It's not the X variable. So V is symmetric around the X's, but you meant enough. So assume then you are symmetric around the zero, right? The zero, right? You have blow up some finite timing means then you'll see what it means. Because I did not say yet that proving regularity boils down to proving a local boundedness. Okay, because uh when you are locally bounded, of course you can transfer this point it but I mean no worries. I think I think I'm asking like in the I think you're asking, like, in the full, like, especially in homogeneous, right? What is that more like you're asking for the actual plastic? Yes, exactly. I don't know any, but I feel like all this is part of the quest to first figure out the homogeneous case. Yeah, yeah. And then hopefully from there, go to the homogeneous. But I think for applications, it's always homogeneous, right? For the I mean, it's considered, for instance, Alexander Bobilev has some papers also, numerical papers, studying. Also, numerical papers studying the Radier-Swatti case. But since physically, f counts the number of particles that have velocity v at point t and x. So it's homogeneous. So around any x, it's the same distribution of velocity. But why? What does it mean that around each point the description velocity is radially symmetric? I cannot give any good physical interpretation of that. It's really about mathematics. Oh, I guess you have like a beam, right? And then everything is kind of like this, and then the velocity, everybody is homogeneous. The whizzer is incompatible with, especially homogeneous, right? So perhaps I should write this down precisely. Okay, so I want to so I can finish. Want to, so I can finish the first part by mentioning this, okay? Regularity holds, so I should say local regularity holds as soon as F is locally bounded. Okay, so what you want to prove is that your solution is locally bound. I did not mention in the references that there is also a nice survey by Louis about open problems in the in the in about kinetic equations and there he mentions also a conjecture about this equation but I don't have time to to go through that. go through that. So what I would like to do, because I I am re is I would like to explain to you what kind of local located entropy inequality you can get. So, okay, if you think of the If you want to prove some local regularity, you need the local estimates. And here, the local estimates that are available, the best ones, are the ones that are associated with the entropy. Okay, so I mentioned before that you can prove something like this. So this is the entropy dissipation. I'm not going to write it down. Okay. Write it down. Okay, and what is important is that it is a positive quantity, so you need to think about it as the equivalent for the heat equation to okay, so and this controlling this gives you a lot of information about the solution of any uniform parabolic equation, for instance. And so the equivalence here is. And uh so the the equivalence here is this one for the for the London-Loman equation. And here we want to apply a De Giorgi method. Okay, so we want to apply a DeGi RG method. This means that we want to we want to truncate the solution. So the idea of De Gergy, you've got your solution F you truncate at a level You truncate at a level kappa, okay, and then you let kappa increase. Okay, and you hope that if you wait long enough, so you will have a limit truncature. And your hope is that after some iteration, you will be able to prove, for instance, that f is smaller than kappa infinity. So, in order to prove that, than kappa infinity. So in order to prove that, for instance, you can prove that f minus kappa infinity plus square is zero. Okay? So you need to truncate in order to apply the Georgi method. So what you are going to consider here, so we already considered them in the previous work with Maria. So you are going to, so you are going to let me start with this one. First, I don't want to Start with this one. First, I don't truncate. I truncate by one at level one. Okay? So what do I take? I take this quantity. So if you compute this, you can see that the derivative of this guy is nothing but is uh nothing uh but one perf okay truncated at the level one and then you can do that at at uh any level so the way so you consider H capital plus out F L for kappa, so that's a difficult definition, but we can just write it this way. Okay, and this, the second derivative of this guy, now, if you have a kappa here, it's only you truncate f at the level kappa. Okay, so Okay, so put F here and I con truncate at a level kappa and I just see what happens from above. Okay, so now you want to consider this and see what happens. So what we proved with Maria and Paswa and Alexi. That's what and Alexi in the first paper is that if you don't localize in space, the kind of thing you obtain is something like this. Okay, so you have something, but you pay a price. There is still a a ta term that remains here, but you can you can handle it. So so and because you see you you you Because you see, you you you you multiply um the this uh this nonlinearity, this first term is depleted, is not as strong as this one, okay. Yes, yes, those are convex and their derivatives, yeah. So you see uh when you differentiate When you differentiate once, I mean, yeah. Well, that makes sense. I just wasn't sure. I was surprised that you need the second. But because you need complex functions. Yeah. But you see, because you are going, since you, I can explain that because it's better. So what you are going to have is H kappa plus prime of F dTF. Okay, so you multiply the sequence. So, you will you multiply this equation by H prime and you integrate by parts. So, that's the second element that you need to extra. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so here now I write it down. It's a pain. I'm sorry about that, but we need to write it correctly. So we are not going to have something that is as nice as this. I did not try to. As nice as this, I did not write anything here. What we can prove is the following. So you consider two cylinders that are inside each other. So you've got the QR of T0 V0 and you've got a V cylinder QR of T0 V naught. Okay, and you try to write down something in this. So what you get is that the Is that the essential supremum of T T minus S squared T naught, you've got H kappa plus of F of T V d V plus so you've got the constant So here you integrate inside the small cylinder. So you can think of it as the equivalent for the heat equation of d-ogodity okay, so this first part is the equivalent of d ougodity of the heat equation of F squared. heat equation of x squared plus grad of x square. Okay? And then what do you have on the other side? So remember before it was something that was relatively nice like this and here it's more complicated. So if you are of T node node so let me take my notes. So you've got the Take my notes. So you've got the cap R. You pay the price to go from small R to cat capital R. So let me, yes. The difference of the radius is delta and you got this guy. Okay, so let the this guy show that. Okay, we are done. So these are the entropy estimates, the local truncated entropy estimates. Okay? It's local because it is in cylinders. Okay, it's truncated because it's truncated at the level kappa and it is related to entropy in an obvious way. Okay, so basically what you are going to work with are those families of inequalities. And this is what we need to do. Uh okay, so can you this inequality by testing your equation? Yeah, you you multiply the equation by the derivative of H capacity prime times a test function. Yeah, and then And then, what is difficult is that there are many terms and you have many options for integration bypart and everything, and you need to figure out the one you can get. Okay? So, what I claim is that you can get this. So, you see, perhaps I should comment on this, even if so, this. So this is the entropy dissipation somehow, the local one. Okay, and this is very much related to the entropy dissipation. I mean, it's a local version of the entropy dissipation by dividend. And this gives you a lot of local estimates that are known already, but it's very important. It's very important. Like, if you do like k equal to zero, right? Which is a little weird in the derivatives, but like if you take k equal to zero, right, then it's just the entropy production, right? No, k equals zero, it's you see, you cannot form anything before you take the derivative. Oh, after you take the derivative. Oh, okay. Which is kind of like why this is like a very hopeful actual approach, right? It's like what L do for the heat equation. Yeah. Yeah, I don't see r really what you want to what do you mean? No, right, like like the inequa the inequality you have here, this inequality, right? Yeah. If there is a these killing in there, if k were to equal to zero, if the entropy production better, of course, right, right, better. But but better, but uh, since we localized, you still have terms. You have some terms, and you probably have those. And you probably have those terms too. I didn't do the computation, but I would say so. But here, so the two important things in those equations is that you have this term that gives you a lot of local regularity, but you need to control this quantity. And there is no way to control this quantity. Okay? And so as you know, if you want to do the Gergy method, I told you about the truncation procedure, but you also know that You also know that what you want to do is to localize around very small cylinders. So you need to see what happens when you zoom in, right? What happens when you're zooming in? So you're asking yourself what kind of scaling leaves the equation invariant, and it is not. Invariant, and it is known that this can be written like this for any lambda. But now, if you want to preserve this quantity, so I'm not talking about the equation, I'm talking about preserving the local entropy estimates. In that case, you need lambda equals to preserve local entropy. Entropy estimates. Okay, but the problem is that when you zoom in, this guy is going to look like one over epsilon. So when you zoom in, So when you zoom in a singular term appears. Okay? So the idea of the De Georgie Lema, so I will not have time to do even the local orthophyte De Georges Lema. But the De Georges Lemaire, I'm gonna perhaps I can. Zero, you can take a few extra minutes. No, no, but no, no, that's okay. The German layman, no one understands how that works anyway. You don't see where you win. It's a very black magic that only a few people in Austin understand. Maybe Paris. I've been told. Okay, so let me so I'm not going to state it precisely in that case, if you put it this way, but let me let me let me Let me put like lemma star. I don't know, someone put the realm star. This was you lemma star. So the idea is to say if so you zoom in somewhere, okay, you still have your family of inequation, and if la plus minus one f is smaller than z. Is smaller than z epsilon, so you need a control. So you zoomed in, so it's this guy. So if you can control this guy by z epsilon, and you can also control so f minus L affinity in time L one in V in a cylinder Q1 Q1 and also dissipation in the cylinder Q1 after zooming in, right? So if this one is small enough, smaller than the small parameter, that you need to divide by z epsilon to the three half. Okay. Then f epsilon is F epsilon is bounded in Q one half. Okay, so De George Lema tells you if I can control this term which naturally blows up and if the local so it's not exactly the entropy it's more convenient to work directly uh with this guy. So you replace uh uh this difficult quantity just by F minus kappa plus. Just by F minus kappa plus. If this is small enough, in that case you're bounded. So this is the lemma. And the lemma consists in, so you control this, and then this is pretty standard. So since the bell rang already, I can just explain why axisymmetry helps you. It helps you. It helps you for two things. First, it helps you to prove that this guy indeed is bounded. Okay? And exactly only with the quantity you have initially. So this is going to be true with z epsilon equals a universal constant. And then you need to make sure that uh the local mass and the local entropy dissipation are small. Entropy dissipation are smaller. And this is going to be true because you are going to use this. And see here, this is like f to the power 1 plus epsilon. You lose something because of the load. But 1 plus epsilon, you can take, you can bound it by f2. Okay? And F2 is very good because in a 2D setting it is critical. So the L2 norm So the L2 norm of f etc l in the cylinder q1 basically is the L2 norm of the unscaled function in the very small cylinder Q epsilon. And of course, an F in that case is L2 because you've got extra integrability because of the 2D structure. And it allows you to prove that the L2 norm goes to zero, that the right-hand side goes to zero, and in that case, that the To zero, and in that case, that's the smoothness assumption. Okay, sorry for those two minutes that I still to you. Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions? In order to run the Detroit In order to run the DiGiorgi lemma, you pointed out that you need the assumptions to show that the first term is bound by z epsilon. Do you need all three assumptions? I mean, you need the axisymmetry, okay, that's crucial, you said. But what else do you need, maybe, in order to show this? So I just need axisymmetry and finite mass, energy, and entropy at the initial condition. All the three. All the three, yeah. Well, you you already Well, but you always have this. I mean, the condition or the initial condition, you cannot. If you want your equation to be elliptic, you need them. That's reasonable. I mean... I was just wondering for this particular... For this particular lemma? No, here you don't use the axisymmetry. You use the axis symmetry to control this guy. But in the lemma, you don't use axis symmetry. Forget about the lemma, just this assumption. You use axisymmetry and all three. You use exosymmetry and all three assumptions. To control this? Yes. No, all three. Probably we need the entropy the crucial way. I mean, it's very sharp. When you try to do it, you need to use some, you know, you need to use those for a convex function that you have h of star plus h star of g. This Legend Finnish inequality, okay, that you use to define Ard space. You need that, and you really need the entropy to control this gap. This is one of the big metric points in the paper principle, yeah. Wait, sorry, can I just Moritz is speaking so fast, I'm not even catching every word he's saying. Are you explaining right now why Z epsilon in the radially symmetric or axially symmetric case, Z epsilon isn't bound to? Case C epsilon is bound within the epsilon. Exactly. Okay, good, because that was my question. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. What is it very exciting about? I can give more details afterwards, but so the axial symmetric plays a major role there, right? I was going to say it's not obvious why the clash. That's what I said from the beginning. I mean, the 2D structure is. And I did not have time to explain that there are a lot. Have time to explain that there are a lot of similarities with the Navier-Stokes equation. Here, somehow, the square root of f is a bit like the velocity field in Navier-Stokes. And you can see because you start with basically so here it's the entropy, but uh you see that very very quickly we just look more like the L affinity L two normal view. L2 norm ovum. So there are a lot of similarities with the study of the Mali-Stokes equation. Okay, so then it's not obvious why the inverse equation is independent of epsilon. No, it's not obvious, but it's a two-page. I was a two-page computation. Okay. Are there any uh oh well settle down mastery? Let's go to the uh kindly seed money. So I understand that. The uh sorry, I I understand the estimates are quite sharp. At the same time you're saying the function blows up, there should be more diffusion fine. So do you know where your estimate is maybe not sharp? Or is it just that controlling the entropy doesn't give you the result ever? No, I mean in the if you are not in the if you don't have this symmetry assumption I mean under the symmetry under the symmetry assumption you cannot do better than what ah yeah, you mean correct? Better than ah yeah, you mean uh removing the singularity along the axis? I mean you kind of know where the function has to blow up, right? At the axis, right? Yes, so and you're saying that your estimates are sharp, so does that mean that you cannot really get anything from that blow-up when you control the entropy dissipation? Is there a blow? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you cannot, yes, you cannot control what happens around the axis because you once again in this In this estimate, so let me do a rough picture. You try to see that this is bounded around the point T0, V0. And so you have a structure like this, and a part of the proof consists of thinking to putting it in a 2D structure. Okay, so it degenerates very quickly when you go to zero. I can elaborate on what happens at the origin, but. Well, there's lots of questions, so maybe we'll see how. We'll just go from right to left, I guess. Sorry, Stan. It looks like you immediately cross out the diffusion operator, the annex object in it, and you just kind of, like at the beginning, you kind of say, okay, if I ignore the projection inside of the integral, I'm just like the inversal evolution. And in your computations here, it looks like you kind of do this. So, do you use the anisotropy at all? No, I don't. No, no, we don't use it. I mean, we handle it in the sense that we use those estimates a la dévilette. But we don't really use that. As a matter of fact, when you, I mean, once again, this is an idea that it's very difficult to make it work. Difficult to make it work rigorously, but the projection should not be a major problem because you integrate in many directions, and so there is an average that tells you that somehow it should be comparable to this one. But okay, Mr. and I tried very much. I think Maria has a comment. So because everyone is So because everyone is going to the same, converging, maybe without realizing, to the same point about the diffusion. And so what you said at the very beginning when you said the problem is that we have no good control on the upper bound of the eigenvalue. But so I have to say that we have no good control on the lower bound value, and we always end up using the polynomial weight. What do you mean by lower bound? The lower bound that we use for the capital A. The one that far from the mass in the one that you mentioned by... And for you, the problem comes from below. Because we always end up in the semi-linear framework of the PDE. And we know that we cannot get global boundaries because in the semi-linear world, the semi-linear heat equation blows up, right? Loss up, right? Ah, you mean with F squared? Exactly. So the problem is that we don't have good control of how the lower bound depends on F. So if F tries to blow up, you don't get that the lower bound also goes up to the only hope of proving global welfareness is that we keep the quasi-linearity alive. And by using the lower bound, we kill that. Okay, I agree. We tried that very much too. Yeah. To get something from below, and if it blows up, you can try. And some ideas disappear in the Catholic Cognanda paper, but we are not able to elaborate.
