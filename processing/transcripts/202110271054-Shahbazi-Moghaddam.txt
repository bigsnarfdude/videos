Nice talk so far. So, today I will be telling you about this paper that I wrote with Netta Engelhardt and Jeff Pennington. So, the general topic of this talk is going to be about the complexity of bulk reconstruction behind black hole horizons. But specifically, I'm going to be interested in discussing the complexity of reconstructing outgoing modes just behind the horizon. So, these are the kind of modes I'm talking about. Are the kind of modes I'm talking about? Here's a large AD Penlow's diagram of a large ADS black hole, and it's the horizon, and the modes just behind them. So these modes are kind of mysterious in some ways. They pop up in firewall-related questions, and that's partly what gave me the motivation to care about them. But there's a lot that's already been said about this, the whole story of complexity and geometry and behind black hole horizons. Behind Black Hole Horizons. So, before getting into that, I'll just give you some quick background. And an important part of that background is going to be the overview of the more recent Python's lunch conjecture, which adds to that connection of complexity and geometry significantly, I would say. Then I'll get to the story of the interior outgoing modes. Okay, so probably the simplest case study in this whole business of complexity and geometry. Complexity and geometry behind black holes is probably the following example. Consider a large ADS black hole formed by the collapse of some stuff at some time. And at time t equals zero, throw in a qubit into the black hole. And at some later time t, you can ask what the state psi was, and you could ask what the complexity of learning the state psi. The complexity of learning the state side is. So these are two questions you can ask just on the CFT side, but in the bulk, they manifest themselves as bulk reconstruction behind Black Hole Horizon and the complexity of that reconstruction. But let's stick on the CFT side for now. So on the CFT, there's a simple task I can do to learn psi at time t, which is to simply time evolve back until psi presents itself. Itself. So the complexity of this task cannot be more than the complexity of Hamiltonian time evolution. Now, for the purpose of this talk, fine definition of complexity is just say complexity of a task on some set of qubits is just the minimum number of two qubit gates required to perform that task. And here, the effective number of qubits involved in making up this black hole state is governed by the coarse grain entropy of the black. Governed by the coarse grain entropy of the black hole, or roughly the area of the black hole divided by the 4G by 4G. And these qubits are at each time step coupled together with polynomially many gates, polynomial in the coarse-grained entropy. And these gates pile up on top of each other as time goes by. So that results in a linear growth of complexity with a coefficient that's polynomial in coarse gradient entropy. Okay, now. Okay, now this might be a familiar story, and an exciting thing about it when it comes to connections to geometry is that the work of many people who basically started this whole field of complexity and geometry has led to this realization that maybe this linear growth in complexity geometrizes in the bulk as the linear growth of the black hole interior. Of the black hole interior. More specifically, I mean the linear growth in volume of the maximal volume slice anchored to each boundary time. So here's an example of that slice. And here's the spatial. Here's another picture. So this connection is usually made by analogizing this geometry to a tensor network that's supposed to be sitting at each moment, you know, on this slice at each moment, you know, at any corresponding. You know, at any corresponding boundary time and outputting a boundary time which embeds the state psi into the boundary. So, and you know, by analogy, the number of gates in this tensor network is governed by the volume of this geometry. So that sort of geometrizes this linear growth and complexity. So that's a kind of a nice story, probably from your So that's a kind of a nice story, probably from your story, but it has an interesting limitation. Note that this picture suggests that small black hole interiors correspond to small complexity. And here by small, I mean polynomial in the coarse-grained entropies involved. It's to be contrasted with exponential complexity. Okay, but this hasn't a challenge, and you can arrive at a challenge by thinking about evaporating black holes, for example. Toy models suggest. Toy models suggest that reconstructing, for example, the black hole interior, say, around the page time is a task that is exponentially complex in the coarse-grade entropies involved. But the interior of a black hole around the page time doesn't have to be that large. It certainly doesn't have to be exponentially large. So, how do we understand it from the geometry point of view? And that's exactly where the Python's launch proposal comes in. Lunch proposal comes in and beautifully geometrizes this notion of exponential complexity despite a small interior. And it looks like this picture. This is another black hole interior. And the main feature that I want to point you to is this bulge and throat pattern in the geometry of the spatial slice. So to be contrasted with the geometry that looks like this. Now, for example, Now, for example, you can imagine this kind of drop in the area in the spatial slice as being the result of black hole losing area in time due to evaporation. But this kind of solution exists even in classical gravity. So if you want, you could forget that this is the connection to evaporating black holes if you want. This is a more general sort of shape that the geometry could have. And the conjecture is that complexity, complexity of any Complexity, complexity of anything in the bulk that's beyond this point, complexity of reconstructing that on the boundary gets an exponential enhancement that's governed by the drop in the area from the bulge to the throat. Now, I'll be more precise about the definition of Python's launch in a minute, but as a big part of that paper was an argument for why this is true. And here, I'll just give you a sketch of it just for intuition. So, again, it involves. Intuition. So again, it involves tensor networks. And, you know, to draw a tensor network that looks like that geometry, I need to draw a tensor network like before. Except on the way out, I need to create this constriction. I can do that by projecting, basically post-selecting some qubits into some definite state. Now, why does post-selection involve complexity? Imagine trying to implement this tensor. So we'd start from here. So we start from here. We have some state psi, we have some additional qubits forming up the coarse-grained entropy, and we evolve them with this unit theory. And when it comes to this post-selection bits, we do a measurement. We hope for the best to get the outcome zero so that the state comes out right here. Well, that's an exponentially suppressed probability to get the exact outcome we want. So to get a good, to get a, to get this outcome with a good. To get this outcome with a good probability, we need to repeat this, run this volume Wolfer gates exponentially many times, where the exponential is governed by the exponent is given by the number of these qubits. And the number of these qubits, as the picture suggests, has to do with this drop in the area. Okay, so that's the roughly the intuition. Okay, but one of the attractive features of this Python's life proposal is actually that it actually involves the precise It's actually involves the precise definition involves quantum extremal surfaces, and quantum extremal surfaces seem to play kind of a sharper role in holography, at least it has so far compared to like, let's say, maximal volume slices and so on. So here, so just for completeness, probably you are familiar with quantum external surfaces, but I just mean a co-dimension to space-like surface anchored to in the bulk that's anchored to my boundary. In the bulk, that's anchored to my boundary region of choice, which extremizes this generalized entropy under its local deformation. And generalized entropy is this particular combination, basically this particular combination of the area of the surface and the bulk entropy outside of it. Okay, so let's again for simplicity assume, these are not crucial assumptions, but this is for simplicity, that I'm only interested in one whole boundary and that my geometry is such that everything is in. My geometry is such that everything is encoded in that one boundary. So basically, the minimum S-gen quantum extremal surface is the empty surface with this homology slice. Then in this geometry, if there is any other quantum extremal surface, there is a lunge. Now, where does the lunge begin? Obviously, in analogy with this picture, you would want to say that the lunge begins at the outermost quantum extremal surface. It's actually not completely obvious that an outermost quantum external surface needs to exist. This is something we managed to prove. The reason it's not obvious is because you can imagine two quantum extremal surfaces competing to be outermost. That would, for example, happen if they're time-like separated from each other. But there is always a unique outermost quantum external surface. And from there, by running a variant of the maximum argument, Of the maximum argument in this interior region. As outlined in this paper, you can find another quantum extremal surface, which is the Balsch quantum extremal surface. This could be over here, for example. And then the complexity proposal is that anything in this region has a complexity that gets this exponential enhancement, where I've written, you know, previously I wrote down the area formula, but the Previously, I wrote down the area formula, but the upgraded formulas with the generalized entropy, the drop from bulge to out. Okay. So now let me get to finally the story of this interior outgoing mode. So what do I exactly mean by this by this question? Again, imagine forming a black hole from collapse at some time t equals zero and have the black hole. Time t equals zero and have the black hole settle down. Then I want to ask about the state of this interior mode. Well, oh, by the way, for simplicity, assume everything. We have spherical symmetry and I have some free scalar in the bulk and I'm looking at the S wave sector. Just for simplicity, I don't think it matters much. Okay, so after the black hole settled down, scrambling time in the future, say. Future, say. I want to ask about the state of this mode. Well, in the state that I just described, the state of this mode is the vacuum state. This mode is entangled with its partner in a state that forms up the vacuum state like that for all given frequencies. But that's, of course, not the only state that they can have. You can imagine all sorts of states instead of this. You can make a subspace of those states if you want, a code subspace. If you want a code subspace, and then the question is really what the you know, what is the complexity of a boundary unit theory that would take you from, let's say, this state to any arbitrary state in that subspace? Or equivalently, let's say someone went in there at the horizon and changed the state from the vacuum to one of those other states in the code subspace, and then you're given the task of determining on the boundary what the state is. Now, here it might be tempting to run the algorithm from before of just simply time evolving back. Of just simply time evolving back until this thing presents itself, and of course, this fatiguously fails because of the trans-Plankian problem. Basically, if after scrambling time after the backwell has settled down, any state but the vacuum here, time evolves back to a white hole singularity and a past horizon that actually protects the thing from coming out. Okay, so this seems like just. Okay, so this seems like just a technical difficulty in running a simple time evolution backwards method. But is there actually exponential complexity involved in this? Now, the geometry in this state could correspond to a small interior with no Python's launches. But the key point is that when discussing a code subspace for the relevant quantum extremal services to show up, Quantum extremal surfaces to show up, you need to consider a mixed state of that code subspace. For those familiar with tensor networks, that's a little bit like having bulk-dangling legs, where they sort of look like they're contributing an entropy there. So the natural mixed state for these modes and for the coat subspace that I'm interested in is the maximum or thermally mixed state of these interior and outgoing, interior and exterior modes, outgoing modes near the horizon. Outgoing modes near the horizon. And point is that in this state, in this mixed state row, you can show that there exists a lunch at the horizon, which is the beginning of the, sorry, there is a quantum extremal service at the horizon, which marks the beginning of the lunch where this mode psi comes from. Now, I'm going to give you a sketch of the argument for this, but the intuition is similar to the Similar to the intuition of these quantum extremal surfaces existing for evaporating black holes, basically has to do with the blue shift of entropy gradients associated to these modes, which stabilizes area variations in this direction. I'll give you a little bit of a sketch of this of an argument and give you about the characteristics of the lunch, tell you actually what the amount of complexity that they Actually, what amount of complexity that they predict, okay? All right, okay. So, of course, we can be using exact windler modes. They're singular at the horizon. So, imagine this is space-time from before, and I have some v and u crisical coordinates. V runs along the horizon, u is zero at the horizon and runs this way. So, I can pick a ramp. I can regulate the way my wavepack is from the horizon by picking some delta R1 and delta R2. And delta R2 finding a range in U basically determined by delta R1 and delta R2, where delta R is just the area radius difference from the horizon between these spheres or those spheres. And by taking a nice limit of these delta Rs and zooming in frequency space to some band, I can identify H many sort of nice wave packets. Now, the total entropy, but then I will consider this state, where I have these h modes instead of the infinitely many modes from before. The total entropy of this state is just simply 2h times this function as thermal omega naught, where this is just simply the entropy of the harmonic oscillator at temperature 1 over 2 pi. Now, because of a boost symmetry in this range of u, in the entropy, Range of U in the entropy gradient, the logarithmic derivative of S bulk is approximately constant within that range of U. And that, together with the knowledge of the total entropy, gives us an estimate of du of s bulk. Okay, now what do we do with this? Well, clearly, what we care about is actually the gradient of the generalized entropy of spheres in this picture. So, for example, this blue sphere. So, here I've written down the V and U derivatives of generalized entropy, separating the area contribution from the bulk entropy contribution. Okay, now let's take a sphere that's within this range of view and sometime in the past. Okay, so and let's consider dv of s gen. So, if this sphere, you know, this sphere is deep enough behind the horizon that the area variation. behind the horizon that the area variation in this direction is very, the area decrease is very large, large and negative. So, I mean, the area change is large and negative. And the contribution to this is very large because it gets larger because there's this one over G factor, with G small. And the state would have disentangled these outgoing modes, these V movers, D V of S bulk is not expected. Movers, dv of s bulk is not expected to be very large. Therefore, this blue sphere satisfies this sign of dv of sg. Now, what about the u of s gen? The u of sn also has a larger negative term here associated to area decrease in this direction. But that diminishes as v gets smaller. Something that's not true of the u of s bulk. The u of s bulk doesn't care about v. Love and spot doesn't care about V. So that means that at small enough V, more precisely, around a scrambling time in the past of V naught, where these modes were the state was defined. There's a transition where in the sign where this term beats this term and the U of S chem becomes positive. Okay, now why does this matter? So these signs, this is just some. So, these signs, these are just some signs that the blue sphere satisfies. But these signs simply mean that by deforming, if I take the sphere and deform it in any outgoing direction, the generalized entropy decreases. And since we know that eventually as we approach the boundary, the generalized entropy has to get to increase and become really, really, really large. It's very intuitive that there would be an extremum somewhere in the middle. Now, Now, this is actually not hard to make very sharp. We just did it as a little part of something we were doing with Rafael. There's probably different arguments for this, but so the more precise argument involves running a restricted maximum search within this region, for those of you familiar with maximum. So, maximum, if you restrict the region where maximum is being applied, there's always this danger. Apply, there's always this danger that the surface might get stuck at the boundaries of the region. And then the maximum condition wouldn't imply quantum extremality. But these signs, you know, as a sort of intuitive, these signs precisely are sufficient to ensure that that won't happen. The surface will not get stuck. So if this is the wedge, the surface will not get stuck here. It will not get stuck here or here. So the maximum surface will be in the interior of. The interior of would sort of be in the meat of this region, and therefore we have to be kind of extreme. So, all this together implies that for a so this blue sphere having these signs implies indirectly the existence of a quantum extremal surface scrambling time to the past near the horizon. Okay, so now that's the big, that's again the beginning of the lunch. The beginning of the lunch, recall the appetizer surface in the paper, and yeah, so we know it exists indirectly. Okay, so but to fully characterize the lunge, I need to tell you about the bulge surface. Again, we know from general argument that given this, the existence of this throat, a bulge surface needs to exist somewhere in the interior. But here we just want to Here we just want to guess its location. Since the bulge is also a quantum extremal surface, quantum extremality in the V D, the D V of Sgen being zero requires that the area variation is small in this direction. And the only place deep in the interior where that's true is inside the matter forming the black hole, or more precisely, inside the last thing. Inside the last thing that fell into the black hole. So that narrows down its location somewhere here on the sort of near the classical apparent horizon. And the other direction, the U of S shim being zero, since we for that, as before, we need to use the blue shift associated to these disentangled modes as we enter these range of view. These two conditions. These two conditions together sort of narrow down the location of the pulse to where I drew it. So then we can approximate and simply approximate the drop in the generalized entropy from the bulge to the outsurface by integrating formulas from before through this range of view. The answer we get is something like this. It's basically the total entropy that was stored in these modes. So the complexity predicted is this. But the complexity predicted is this. Now, note that the interesting thing about this complexity is that, or one interesting thing about it, is that the complexity has an exponential enhancement, but it's not an exponential enhancement in one over G. The exponent is in one over G. It's just some, it has to do with the number of these modes. Okay. Now, I just wanted to say I just wanted to say one thing. So, this is a short talk, so I'm focused mostly on the complexity issue, but I think there is something interesting here about the fact that these quantum extremal surfaces that we first saw in the context of the page curve are actually very generic. In a sense, they don't care about evaporation directly. There's a generic set of states where they exist near the horizon. And for example, you can show that any state with reduced mutual You can show that any state with reduced mutual information between the interior and exterior wave packets will have a connective stream of surface, like the one I discussed discussed here. And also, since spherical symmetry doesn't seem to be fundamental for the reasons we expect the conviction of surface to exist, it's possible that that could also be relaxed. So it would be nice to have some sort of a more general argument for the existence of the quantum external surface. The quantum external surface in these variety of states. Now, of course, this idea of using a blue sphere that's indirectly would imply the existence of the quantum external services on the right track, but even that becomes sort of intractable when you lose spherical symmetry. All right. So, how much time do I have? 10 10 minutes. Okay. Okay, I'll five. Okay, that's good. I just wanted to basically end with a connection between these quantum external surfaces and some implications about complexity in ADS-CFT that was presented in these papers. Now, here, so these are computer scientists that wrote a paper about ADS-CFT. That wrote a paper about ADS-CFD and complexity. And I'll just tell you the implications of their papers and for complexity in ADS-CFD dictionary and tell you the role of these quantum extremal surfaces in geometrizing that. Okay. So these guys consider an ensemble of states that they construct in the following way. Imagine going to a very high Going to a very high energy state of the CFD. For example, the state could be dual to a black hole formed by collapse in a state psi. And starting from that CFD state, they evolve by scrambling time and act with a random, with a poly operator drawn at random. And they do this n many times, scrambling time, poly, scrambling time, poly. And after n times, you get a, depending on which chain of polys you apply, you get a whole set of states. Get a whole set of states. And here, oh, by the way, it helps to understand what this poly is doing in the bulk. It helps to just focus on some free fermions in the bulk and imagine that the polys are just acting near the boundary on the occupation Hilbert space of typical Hawking quanta in the thermal atmosphere. So that's basically the boundary or the bulk dual of the boundary operation. So now you get this set. So now you get this set of states. By doing a C, basically, a CFD analysis, they conclude that if you're given one of these many states at random and you don't know the pattern of the unit there is, it must be exponentially complex, exponentially in n, exponentially complex to determine the state psi, for example. So interior reconstruction is exponentially complex without Constructions exponentially complex without knowing the pattern of the unitaries. But you know, this is again kind of the territory where our kind of idea of the quantum external service needs to come in, because this geometry in any given pattern of the unitaries, this geometry doesn't have, it has a small interior, it doesn't have a Python's lunch. So now I'm going to, there are multiple ways to explain why the economic streams of this come in, but I have a favorite way. Most of this comes in, but I have a favorite way which I think kind of might connect a little bit with what Henry was talking about yesterday. So, one way we can implement this idea of not knowing which unitaries were applied is to bring in a separate quantum mechanical system and act on this joint exterior mode. Oh, by the way, one thing I think I wanted to emphasize here is that this idea that this interior becomes That this interior reconstruction is complex is actually kind of, there's an intuitive reason behind it in the bulk, which is that, you know, imagine again trying to do the time evolution backward method. Of course, since these modes evolve back near the horizon to become the exterior partner of these interior modes we were discussing, if in your time evolution backwards, you don't know the pattern of the unitaries and you don't undo the unitaries, then the Don't undo the unitaries, then the horizon will go out of the state of the vacuum. And this psi wouldn't come out again. You, you know, you remove this horizon, you made the horizon not be in the vacuum state, so you get a past singularity, and so it won't show up. And to if you don't know the pattern of unit theories, what you can do is to apply any pattern of unit theories, every possible one, until you finally get it right, but that will take exponentially many tries. So that's uh. Eyes. So that's, I forgot to tell you that intuition for this. Okay. So, where do quantum external services come in? To do this unitary without knowing the pattern of the unit theories, you can bring in a separate quantum mechanical system and act on the joint exterior mode quantum mechanical system, like quantum mechanics degree of freedom, which you know, I'm Degree of freedom, which I'm choosing it to be some Q kids, for example. And depending on which state this Q kids have, we could act with that poly, the corresponding poly. So after I do this N many times, if I take away the reference, if you have the reference system, you can just measure the reference system, and depending on what you saw, act with the corresponding unit theory to undo it. But if I take away the reference system, I'll leave the bulk in a fundamentally mixed state where these interior Where these interior and exterior modes are now mixed instead of forming up the vacuum. And this is exactly the state where we saw our con extremal surfaces. Except since we're doing this n many times, you actually get sort of a chain of extremal surfaces, of throats and bulges. And the complexity predicted by that would be exponential in n. Now, the connection, I thought, was Was uh the connection this had with what Henny was saying is that if you, you know, if you keep so this reference system, you can imagine this is sort of like changing the boundary Hamiltonian with a way that depends a little bit on the reference system. And this, I think this is what Henry told the journal. And if you keep doing this too many times, at one point you become so entangled with the black hole that these quantum extremal surfaces that were just these outermost convexes actually become the dominant quantum. Surface actually becomes the dominant quantum external surface, become the RT surface, and you completely lose the interior on the boundary side. The interior would be encoded on the reference system. Okay, actually, I think I'll stop here and wait for questions. Thanks. Do we have any questions for him from the in-person audience? Any questions from online? Can I ask a question? So, for example, in this last one, the bulb, so is that meant to describe the geometry of your extremal surface? So, bulge means So bulge means fat, fruit means thin, it's meant to become thinner. Is that a geometric extremal surface that has this behavior? Yeah. It's meant to do in generalized entropy, it's meant to do something like this. Is that the area smoking? No, it's not the area. It's the generalized entropy. So the drop is due to the bulk entropy being lost. Yeah, what does the area do? I think the area might just... Yeah, what does the area do? I think the area might just only slightly grow. Yeah, so this is a this. How would you expect the geometry of that surface to look? Like almost like a cylinder, or you would expect it more like a dumbbell that gets fat, gets thin, gets fat, gets thin. Oh, the actual geometry, I think the just the metric. I think the metric would look like it's slowly increasing, actually. Increasing actually, just because every time you act with this unitary, what you're doing is that you're adding a tiny bit, you can make that very small, but you're adding a little bit to the area of the black hole. But what makes this a bulging throat pattern is really the fact that if you add the area and the entropy, then you and draw that sort of, you get a picture like this, you know. But, you know, so Bulge and Throat are defined with generalized entropy, but if you're asking only about the classical geometry, I think it's just slowly. I think it's just a slowly enlarged, you know, expanding cylinder or something in 3D. Expanding towards the CS, towards the boundary or expanding as you go? Expanding in what direction? So if this, or roughly the penalties diagram, it will, you know, it just keeps the area keeps growing a little bit and like, you know, it goes up. And if I, you know, if I And like you know it goes up and if I you know if I come from go to so the area of the sections because you're tracking the event horizon area the area of the section should grow up is that what you're saying I think that's what you're saying uh yeah well this is not this might not be exactly where the event horizon is but uh yeah okay all right thank you Any other questions for our If not, let's thank him again.
