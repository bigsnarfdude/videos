A unique connecting geodesic segment. And for the unicity on the sphere, we also assume that X and Y are not antipodal. Diam is the diameter. V is the notation for the Lebesgue measure in these spaces, and for the closed ball centered attacks of radius R. Center at x of radius r, I use this notation b of x and r, while delta is the Hausdorff measure, Hausdorff distance, sorry, in MN. Also, for the hyperbolic space, I want to introduce this bilinear, symmetric bilinear form B. So for pair of points X and Y from Rn plus one. one um we assign this value ts minus the scalar product of x0 y0 where um so e denotes the apex of the hyperboloid and uh so x0 y0 are from uh y0 are from e per and uh so x is x0 plus d e similarly y is y0 plus se um so with this bilinear form This bilinear form, we can easily describe either the hyperbolic metric, as you can see, or the tangent space T sub Z at point Z. So the notion of convexity can be naturally extended to these spaces. Instead of just taking the connecting segment, we We think of the connecting geodesic segment. So X is convex if for any pair of points the connecting unique geodesic segment is contained in the set. And again, for the unicity, we exclude antipodal points on the sphere. The easiest way is that we assume that the set is already contained in an open hemisphere. And the So, as I will talk about problems related to the width function in these spaces or some width function in these spaces, sets of constant width will become important. So, for that, I introduce the concept of diametrical completeness as well. So, a bounded set X is So, a bounded set X is complete when by adding any extra point, the diameter would strictly increase. And these are already convex sets in the Euclidean and hyperbolic space. But on the sphere, we have this weird counterexample. So, we have a finite set of m plus two points on the sphere. points on the sphere Sn in this case these points are the vertices of a regular simplex and this forms a complete set of diameter n plus cosine of minus one over m plus one. Now if the diameter of the set is less than this number then the set is contained in some Some closed ball of radius surface cosine of one over n plus one, which also means that if we assume that the diameter is less than pi half, then the set is contained in an open hemisphere. So in many cases, we'll do this assumption. And well, so in the hyperbolic space, I will introduce different notions. Different notions for with, and because of that, I need to introduce horribles and hyperbolic. So you can algebraically describe horribles with this function B as well, but if you probably it's easier to think of it when you're looking at on the Poincar√© disk moda. So these are balls touched. These are balls touching the unit ball at some ideal point. These are the horoballs, and its boundaries are called horospheres or in dimension two horror cycles. And similarly, well, so hyperbols are, well, I call hyperbol parallel domain of hyperbola. Parallel domain of hyperplane. So just union of by parallel domain, I mean the union of close was of a certain radius centered at the points of our set. Well, hyperbol has two boundary components. Each of these are called hyperspheres. Uh, hyperspheres and hypercycles in case of dimension two. So, uh, well, probably uh, you're all very familiar with the Euclidean width function, which is just the distance between the two parallel supporting hyperspheres, hyperplanes in a certain direction. And we extend this idea on other spaces of. On other spaces of content, very sure. So, for the spherical width, we stick with LASSAC's definition with supporting loons. Loon is the intersection of two different but not opposite hemispheres. And we call a loon a supporting loon when the convex body is contained within, but both of the boundary parts have common. Boundary parts have common points with its boundary. And the breadth of the loon is just the angle of the two hyperplanes defining the loon. So if we fix one supporting hyperplane, H, to the convex body K, then we can take the minimal breadth of all the supporting loans such that H is one of the defining hyperplanes of the loon. Defining hyperplanes of the loon. And so that will be our spherical width function w of k and h. And I will just refer to the w of k will refer to the minimal width, which I also call thickness from now on. So yes, so that's that's also. That's that's also continuous. The maximum is the diameter, just as in the Eukian case, and these properties will also be shared among the hyperbolic width functions. The first of them will be is a centralized width function. So in this case, we have our convex body k, z is a boundary point, h is a supporting hyperplane at z, and At Z. And so we take the line L, which goes through Z and is orthogonal to H. And then there's another supporting hyperplane to K, which is also orthogonal to this line L, and their distance will be the so-called sample lobby. So So there's one issue with this width function. So it is not, unfortunately, it is not monotonic. As you can see in the figure, there's our convex body with the thick boundary. It contains a disk and the minimal width of this larger body is smaller in this case than the Case than the width of the thickness of the disk within. So when we want to talk about reducedness on the hyperboloid, then it is not a decent choice, but for several reasons, we will still use this notion of width later on. Another width function was defined by Fillmore. Defined by Fillmore. In this case, we define the width with respect to ideal points. So, for an ideal point, there are two supporting horospheres to the convex body, and their distance will be the so-called film or width. But for a line segment, it has a positive minimal width, and yes, so probably. Yes, so probably we don't, but for this reason, we don't really like this choice now either. Then there's the width function by likewise. We fix an inner point of the convex body K, let's call it P, and we take any hyperplane containing P, and this hyperplane defines Hyperplane defines two supporting hyperspheres to the convex body, both parallel to H, and their distance will be the life-wise feed. However, the minimum value of this feed function, it depends on the choice of P. So, what we did a couple of months ago, we defined a new Months ago, we defined a new notion of width. We call it the extended lengthwise width, because in this case, we don't fix any inner point, we actually take any hyperplane intersecting the convex body k. And this can be also supporting hyperplane. So, this hyperplane defines two supporting horospheres parallel to it in. To it in the case of a supporting hyperplane. So, the general case is when one of the supporting hyperspheres is actually just the hyperplane. So, the distance of the two hyperspheres is the width function then. And yeah, so this is monotonic. It has all the almost all the. All the almost all the nice properties we want it to have. So when it comes to reduceness, which I will talk about later, it makes sense to choose this definition of width function. But maybe two or three weeks ago, LASAC defined a new notion of width. And this is much more natural than Is much more natural than ours. So what Lasag did, he chose some supporting hyperplane H. And then we just take among the ultra-parallel hyperplanes one at maximum distance from this hyperplane H and their distance is. And their distance is the less likely. And okay, but actually, actually, this width function is the same as the extended life by swift restricted to the hypertension. But it is a I think it's a lot easier and much more beautiful to look at it this way. At it this way, with hyperplanes and hyperspheres. So, yeah, I want to talk about bodies of constant with, I will use Dexter's definition. So, a convex body is of constant with D, if its diameter is D, and for any boundary point X and any outer normal unit vector V, we have diametrical chords pointing along these. Pointing along this direction from X. And so this is the same as complete sets. So let me recall the definition. So set is complete by adding any extra point, the diameter would slip into increase. So if we are, so on the sphere, if we So, on the sphere, if we have a diameter less than pi half, then these are equivalent there as well. And also, this is equivalent with this nice ball intersection property that k equals the intersection of balls center that the convex body and of radius d. But so this is also equivalent to the fact that the width function is a constant. The fact that the width function is a constant function with value d on both on the Euclidean Euclidean spaces and spherical spaces. And recently we showed that it's also equivalent with, well, the Santaloo width is constant, Pylmov width or Leifpice width or the extended Life Pipe width is also with Last Axe with function. I didn't talk about other I didn't talk about other with functions. There are at least two more of them. But for the gay orbit with, for example, this statement is not true. So yeah, the first inequality I want to mention is the so-called Blaschkellebergweiss inequality. So it says, well, on the Euclidean plane, Blaschke Lebeg proved. Lebesgue proved this nice inequality that among bodies of constant fit, the rural triangle has the minimal area. And then Arauco and Leichtweis, they extended this result to planes of constant curvature with some restrictions with respect to the boundary of K. Then generally Basdeck. And generally, Besdek proved it on the sphere. And based on his ideas, we extended it to the hyperbole. And we also have the stability result that if the area is slightly larger than the minimizer, the reload triangle UD denotes the reload triangle diameter. The Relault triangle diameter D here. So by a factor one plus epsilon, then there is some nicely positioned Relault triangle U with a small Hausdorff distance from K. By small, I mean some constant times epsilon. And so with respect to the order of magnitude, this is also an optimal estimation. And so the first thing I want to So, the first thing I want to mention here is that the three-dimensional case is rather hard. So, it's open for quite some time now. The best result I'm aware of is by Campi, Colesanti and Brunchi from 1996. So they considered bodies of revolution. So, well, if you rotate, so if the So if the body of constant width has some axis of symmetry and you rotate the body around it, then it's a three-dimensional body of constant width. And among these, the rotation of the rural triangle has the smallest volume. But this is not the best we can do in the general case. There are two types of so-called Meissner bodies, one of them you can see on the picture below. Um, so but the conjecture is that that these so-called messenger bodies have the smallest volume in R3. Um, and now I want to talk about reduced bodies. So this notion of reduceness is, well, you can think of it as a sort of a dual to completeness. In the case of completeness, what you did is you added something to the convex body, and then the metal. To the convex body, and then the maximum width increased. In this case, you take away something, so you take a smaller convex body and the minimal decreases. So, if a convex body has this property that by having anything smaller within the minimal is strictly smaller, then we call this convex body reduced. Reduced and um well, while I said that this is some sort of a dual notion, it's not completely true because all bodies of constant width are also reduced. So this is a broader family. But if the reduced body is smooth, then it is of constant width. So and okay, so if the reduced convex body is essentially symmetric, it can only be when the convex body Only be when the convex value is a ball. So these properties are true in all three types of spaces of constant curvature, and also that on the plane, regular outcomes are reduced. And yes, so we know due to Horace Martini, Sonipo and Venza, that Advanced that there are no reduced simplices in higher dimensions. And a few weeks ago, in the same paper, Lazak showed that in H3, there's no reduced tetrahedron. So, and on the sphere, this is also by LaSlack. If the thickness is at least by half, then it is the same, so reduceness and Same so reduceness and completeness are the same. Um, yes, so I want to show you a well, a similar statement to the Blush-Kellerberg inequality, but in this case we fix the thickness of a convex body and we are looking for the minimal volume or area on the plane. So, PAL shows in Uh, showed in 1921 that among convex bodies with a fixed thickness, the regular triangle has the smallest area. And Carol Besbeck and Blickerman in 1999, they extended this result onto the sphere. Well, in the case where the thickness is less than or equal to pi half. And also the spherical Also, the hyperbolic version is true, but in this case, we use the Santalovic function. Unfortunately, some points of the proof would fail if you pick the light vice or the extended light device or the last active. And also, And also on the sphere with the thickness between pi half and pi, we have a different result. So in this case, as I mentioned earlier, reduceness and completeness are the same. And it is quite clear that this inequality is optimized by something reduced. And okay, so in this case, the pulse. So, in this case, the Paul inequality and the Blush-Kellebeg inequality become identical. And so, the body with the minimal area here is the polar of a roulette triangle. And we also have the following stability result that for a convex body of some thickness w, on the spherical case, we are again restricted to the case where w is less than or equal to pi. Where w is less than or equal to pi/half. So if the area is just slightly larger by a factor of one plus epsilon, then again, the convex body has to be at most some constant times epsilon from about well-placed regular triangle. And this is again an optimal Stability results, such as the next one for the sphere where the thickness is between pi half and pi. In this case, the convex body is close to that polar of some row triangle of the same thickness. So here, So here the three-dimensional case is open as well. And the best result, at least the best result I know, is by Campi, Colesanti and Gronci. In the same paper, they prove that among bodies of revolution, the rotation of the regular triangle among its attitude is of smallest volume. Is of smallest volume. But the conjecture suggests that in R3 the body with the smallest volume is the so-called HL body, which is, well, it's some reduction of the regular test ahedron, or at least it seems to be a reduction because it's not really. Because it's not really published that health body is actually reduced. But, okay, so this is the conjecture. So the key of the proof, well, one of the key parts is Blashke's lemma. It says that the in radius is minimized for a fixed thickness by the regular triangle. And this also holds. And this also holds on the sphere and on the hyperboloid as well. Again, we use the centerlovid for this. And we also use the following area formula for triangles on the sphere and on the hyperboloid. So if we know two sides of our triangle and the angle enclosed, then In closed, then we have these very similar-looking area formulas both on the hyperboloid and on the sphere, and it will be quite useful to calculate these formulas. So I want to sketch the proof of pass inequality. So what we do here, we define this so-called cap domain, CW. called cap domain CW of rho. Rho in this case is the radius of this disk. So we have a regular triangle of vertices V1, V2, V3. V is its in-center and we take a larger disk and we have this point Q1 tilde on the half-line from P through V bam. So So the distance of Q1 tilde and V1 is the same as the difference of rho and the radius of the regular triangle. And from Q1 tilde, we draw the two tangent lines to the circle, and we do the same at the other two vertices. So then we have this cap domain. So the circle and these three little mountains. Mountains. And if we define M1 as the midpoint of the circular arc between the tangent points, then we obtain a hexagon contained in the cap domain. And okay, so how is it helpful? So we have our convex body K of fixed thickness double. Uh of fixed thickness w we have we know that we have uh well two or three uh contact points with with the in circle or not the in circle but one of the in circles of of the convex body and such that the center is in the relative interior of of the convex halo of these contexts. Have of these contact points. Well, if we only have two of these, then we by reduceness we have that the convex body is the disk. So we can assume that we have three contact points. In this case, we can find some gap domain within K, which might not be the same rate. Same weight, so it's not that symmetric as you as on the picture, but it has the same area because it's just some rearrangement of this cap domain. And in this cap domain, we have this hexagon. And it's enough to show that the hexagon has a greater area. And it can be done with this area formula I showed earlier. Earlier. So, yes, and the case of equality is also quite clear from that. Do I have a few minutes to talk a bit about the stability as well? You have nine minutes. Oh, okay. I'm a bit fast. Okay, so about the stability, well, what we Well, what we do, we do sort of a step-by-step estimation. So we, okay, well, we can, of course, we can assume that the convex body is different from the ball and also from the optimal irregular triangle. So we want to find an evaluation. We want to find an a bad-based regular triangle which will be near the convex body in the Hausdorff sense. So we fix one of the inscribed one of the in circles of k and we want the regular triangle to share the incenter with K. with k and also we pick well we we determine one of the vertices of the regular triangle in a way that it's on the same half line that well so as I mentioned we have a kept domain inside of okay which was a rearrangement of the symmetric one and And so we have one of the peaks of this cap domain, and we want it to be on the same half-line as one of the vertices of the regular triangle. So we place the triangle like this, and then we can show that it is near the convex body. And what, so how we do it is. So, step by step, we see that okay, the triangle is close to the hexagon, and then the hexagon is close to the regular cap domain, which is again close to the cap domain contained in K. And that cap domain is close to K. And so, here eta is the difference between Is the difference between the in radius of k and the in radius of the regular triangle, and that can be also estimated by some constant times epsilon. So well, that's the sketch of the stability. And in the case where we are on the sphere and we have an obtuse thickness, then Thickness, then, well, the minimizer, this polar of the ruler triangle, which I know denoted by P, is of constant width. And then we can use this area formula, which is derived from the paper of Leifweiss related to the spherical version of Barbie's. Version of Barbie's theorem. So we have that this equality holds. Again, U is the rural triangle of diameter pi minus W. And also we use Schneider's lemma from Schneider's new book about convex cons, he stated that if we're on the sphere, Well, if we're on the sphere and have two convex bodies A and B with a small Hausdorff distance, it's less than pi half, then the distance of the polars is the same. And then we use the stability theorem of the Blush-Kellebeck inequality and it concludes the proof and also it shows that shows the optimality. Okay, so An LLP. Okay, so that's all I wanted to share now. Thank you for the attention. Thank you for this presentation. First, those who are present here, I'm asking if you have any question. Hello, Adam. Have you studied the cat? Have you studied CAT spaces, CAT spaces, that where you have a comparison of any? So you consider intrinsic metric, so the metric between the point coincides with the distance of the shortest path between the points. So if you have the cut space is the space where you have a point, then there exists a unique geodesic between them. And then if you compare it with the corresponding Surface constant curvature, then you decrease the distances between the points. And so it seems to me that you can define all these notions for these metric spaces and then get the result. So why it's so special for just a form of constant uh curvature or of states of constant curvature, but not a comp Of constant curvature, but not the component, okay. Uh, well, I have not studied this uh problem in a more general setting. That's a fair point because here, so these width functions are all somewhat different. So, um, well, this idea about the cat domains. This idea about the cap domains is, of course, so it works in a unified way, but in many cases we use the properties of the geometry. So either the hyperbolic or spherical. I'm not, I cannot say anything in more generous. In a more general setting, but it would be interesting to think about it. Anybody else? Okay, and those who are online, so online participants, any question? So just speak up. Okay, thank you then. Okay, thank you then. I thank again the presenter. Okay, so and we continue at 11. We have a coffee break now.
