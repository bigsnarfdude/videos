To the organizers for setting up this very nice meeting and giving me the opportunity to present this work. So, today I'd like to talk about a model-free, so a robust approach to certain aspects of portfolio theory. And in order to do so, we want like to use rough path integration theory in order to have this pathwise framework to deal with question from portfolio theory. So, before I forget to mention it, So, before I forget to mention it, so this is based on joint work with Andrew Allen, Christa Cupiero, and Chong Leo, who I think I don't need to further introduce because at some point they will give a talk, or I have already given a talk at this conference as well. All right. So, Krista already introduced some aspects of portfolio theory. So, let me give you still some quick introduction to it. So, generally speaking, portfolio theory aims to find good or optimal To find good or optimal investment strategies on a financial market. And this was originally initiated by Markowitz in the early 50s. And since then, I mean, it's spread in different directions and still a very active research area because it's a question which drives a lot of bots and investors. And so, why do you want to have a robust approach to this or approach which allows to include somehow model uncertainty in this framework? And I think two bit more. I think two big motivations for this are here in green. So the first one is essentially: okay, if you usually want to set up an optimal or well-performing portfolio, what will be required to have access to unobservable quantities. So like the volatility of the financial market or the trend in it. And then you immediately have to take your data and estimate these quantities. And if you do so, you will end up with an estimation error. And this means also. Estimation error. And this means also by taking bashing your optimal portfolio, and this will have some error terms that you have misspecified or not the optimal portfolio. And the other thing, which is also well observed in the classical literature, is actually, if you derive your optimal portfolio, which is in theory the best possible portfolio in a certain model of a financial market, the moment you misspecify your model parameter, so you perturb your model model. So, you perturb your model model parameter slightly, the optimal portfolio might jump ahead. So, there might be a lot of sensitivity with respect to model parameters if you look at the optimal portfolio as well. This is, I mean, it's the question of model risk. So, in order to treat these two issues, what we like to do is we want to develop a very extreme point of view, namely model-free portfolios theory, which means we do not want to Theory, which means we do not want to assume any underlying probabilistic model. And what we want to do is today is in continuous time. So please forgive me that I do not mention any discrete time works which might be related, but this is for time constraints here. All right. Of course, this question of model risk or to deal with model risk in portfolio theory is not new at all. And I think there are two, at least two major approaches which somehow already try to take care of it. Already try to take care of these model risk aspects in portfolio theory. The first one is a universal portfolio used by Thomas Covin, who asked the question, okay, without modeling any preferences, I just want to have set up some universal portfolio, which performs well in the long run. And the other one is what you have seen in Christa's talk like a few minutes ago, is Jurassic Portfolio by Rob Fairnos, who tried to again try to Who try to again try to find portfolios or outperforming at least the market portfolios or somehow outperforming the market without relying on unobservable market quantity? So just take prices as input and then finding well-performing portfolios. But like theoretically, if you analyze or set up these portfolios, you usually construct them in a probabilistic setting so with respect to a specific probability space in order to analyze and define them. Order to analyze and define them. And only recently, I mean, there was first like pointing out this purely pathwise nature, actually, of these two theories. There was a initiated a pathwise treatment of this, or at least a certain aspect of these two theories. First work is by Alexander Sheet and co-authors, and the other one is by Christia Cupiero and co-authors, who try to now set up these above theories in a fairly, I mean, a really entirely Fairly, I mean, really entirely pathwise framework. And the moment you want to develop some portfolio in a pathwise framework, it requires pathwise integration theory. Because if you think about continuous time at time trading, the capital process you generate by trading in continuous time is usually modeled or is given by a pathwise integral band. So you need to have a strong notion of integration in order to define the pathwise framework this portfolio. Framework these portfolios. And what these two works might do is they rely on what's called film integration, which you also have seen last hour, in the last hour. So what it does, okay, you take a sequence of partition, which corresponds to going from like continuous time to discrete time to continuous time. And then what you assume is that your underlying price path, the price path you're willing to consider are pairs, S. So S is a continuous path. Um, continuous path, so no probability measure involved from the real 9 to RT. So there are d-risky assets which are willingly to trade, and this is our price part. And now what you assume additionally is that the quadratic variation, so this bracket process here of S, exists in the sense that if you look at the increments of the path and multiply them with each other, so this is a D times D dimensional matrix. So these square increments here converge along a C. Increments here converge along a sequence of partition, which were just fixed. So, if you have just a one-dimensional path, this is exactly the quadratic variation you might know from Brownie motion and so on. So, you just have here the square of the income. And the point why this is a reasonable assumption is that the sample path of all classical models of mathematical finance possess such quadratic variation. So, the moment you work under this assumption, all you do will hold under all reasonable mathematical, I mean, of all models in mathematical. Of all models in mathematical finance, at least classically used. Okay, and why is this a useful assumption? It's because this is an observation due to Hans Fermi, originally due to Hans Fermi, and then develop a pathwise integration theory as long as you're happy to integrate gradients of functions f, which are in C2. Then your integral is given as left-point Riemann sum. So you have the natural interpretation as capital process and finance, where you put your decision in the market and then In the market, and then the capital is generated by the price movements on the underlying market. And you should be happy with this. I mean, you can use this theory to develop certain aspects of universal and juristic portfolio theory in a purely pathways setting, as long as you are happy with gradient-type strategies, which was done by Alexander Sheed and co-authors and Christophe Giero and co-authors. Of course, I mean, you can extend it a bit further. I mean, there's a pathwise-dependent. There's a pathwise-dependent strategies as well, but you have always to have such a gradient-type structure. Just a side remark here: as long as you're thinking of hatching of financial derivatives, then the gradients are much, I mean, more than sufficient because this corresponds to delta hatching. That's fine. But what I would like to convince you now is if you talk about portfolio theory, this is not sufficient, or I think there's a good reason why you want to go further now. And for this, let me kind of. And for this, let me come to an example of the portfolio. I mean, this is also what you have seen already today. So, let's set up a model just to take an example of the market portfolio. So, this is the relative capitalization of our D companies relative to the overall market capitalization. And then you describe it by an E2 diffusion. So, everything is driven by a Browning motion. If you fix your parameters C and lambda in a suitable way, of course, this takes. This suitable way, of course, this takes values to the positive simplex, and you have to make it nice in order to avoid a certain notion of arbitrage, which is here the notion of no unbounded profit with bounded risk. I mean, this is necessary to make this portfolio optimization problems reasonable, otherwise everything would just degenerate. Okay, and now we assume we have a trader who has the utility function, so preferences are modeled by utility function and then References are modeled by utility function, and then I want to find the log optimal utility here. So the optimal portfolio maximizing the logarithm of my terminal relative, well, so relative with respect to the market portfolio, but this is all equivalent. So you just want to maximize your expected utility generated by trading with respect to the portfolio in the market. And the point is: okay, you can do here the calculus explicitly, and you end up with this blue term, which is the block of. With this blue term, which is the block optimal portfolio, which just optimizes it. But what, um, okay, the one thing we want to observe here is: okay, you see, immediately this depends on the model parameter. So the moment you perturb your model parameter, you perturb the log optimal training strategy. And the other observation we want to make is that this is not generated by a gradient of a function. So this log optimal portfolio, which is a classically well-studied optimal portfolio, is not. Optimal portfolio is not of gradient type. So it's not covered in a pathway series, rely on gradient type function. And this is, I mean, you can even play around. So as long as you just play with log optimal, sorry, as long as you restrict your trading to gradient type strategies, you really can, I mean, outperform them with general portfolios, so where you have a non-gradient type structure. Gradient type structure. And here, this picture just shows you one example where one can, I mean, how the log optimal portfolio somehow outperforms all the gradient type portfolios. And of course, this is numerically, so we restrict it a bit more, but essentially you can make this rigorous in a pathways setting. All right, so we want to have general portfolios. So go from these gradient type ones to general ones. And in order to do so, we need a stronger assumption than the existence of prolitic variation. Of quadic variation. And this is what we call a stunfree. So, what we do here very much in the spirit of Fermi integration or the previous work is we say we want to consider price paths, which are pairs. So, the path S is again a continuous function taking values in Rt. But now we want to have this extra information as bold, which will correspond somewhat to rough path. And we want that this assumption fulfilled, which says if we approximate our path. We approximate our path s by piecewise constant ones, sn, then we can, of course, define the left hand. Here integrating again, this is a d dive matrix where we integrate each component against each other. And we want that this is converges uniformly if we send our mass size of the partition to zero. And additionally, we want to have some control about the regularity. So we want to have some p-value. So, we want to have some p-variation essentially of the process itself. And along this sequence of partition, we want to have control of the p-half variation. And this is just to control a bit the regularity. Of course, I mean, this is a heavy assumption at the first look, but I mean, I want to convince you that this is a rather natural one because, like, all the sample parts of classical financial models satisfy this property rate. So, you can verify, for example, For example, along this duadic type of partitions, you can verify that the sample path of semi-martingales, which is the most standard class of models in finance, this property is fulfilled. But you can also look for more general one like young semi-martingales, where you add the term of finite q variation for q strictly less than two, or you can make a verify this in a robust financial setting in order to where you show the typical price path. You show that typical price marked a certain sense fulfilled this property rate. So, I mean, as for the exemption of quadratic variation, I think it's a fair assumption to make it. And if you can prove this in this set, something in this setting, it will hold in all classical models and findings as well. Okay, so what is the gain of making this assumption re? Well, the first thing is, okay, if you assume re, you have actually a canonical rough path lift, which, if you're aware of rough path theory, this corresponds to the eto lift. So this is actually the right. Left. So, this is actually the right integral you want to have in mathematical finance to use. The other thing is if you now look at a control path, so this is the maybe most general class of path you can integrate with respect to s. And if the standard assumption we want to keep in mind for a control path is a function g applied to s. So, where g is a function in c2, and then this derivative y prime is just the derivative g applied to s. This is essentially the talk. This is sufficient to consider. This is sufficient to consider. So, this is my control path. And what we can then show is that the rough path of y against s, or transformation of s is given as left point Riemann sums along this sequence of partition. So this gives you a financial interpretation of the rough path integral. And if you don't care about rough path integral, you can also just forget that this is the rough path integral and read only the right-hand side, which tells you: okay, if I assume Re, then Okay, if I assume re, then this approximation of my pathwise integral, which corresponds to the capital process, converges uniformly in time. Okay, so what are the consequences? The consequences is first we have now a pathwise integral which is defined for non-gradient type of integrals. So we can consider non-gradient type of trading strategies as this is possible by rough path theory. But we also have the financial interpretation of the rough path integral, which is usually given by compensation. Which is usually given by compensated Riemann sums, but here we covered it as natural left-point Riemann sums, which you can understand as an approximation of a capital process. And in this sense, somehow the rough path integral is shown to be a generalization of thermal integration. But on the other side, as I told you, it's still the rough path integral, which we covered there. You have all the access to all the stability results and pathways E2 formula. So all the results develop in rough path. Develop in rough path theory, they're still like accessible in this framework. Okay, so this is some of the foundation on which we want to develop now portfolio theory. And here we would like to focus for time reasons on universal portfolios. So as I said, I mean, we are now willing to consider all continuous paths which satisfy READ. So you have this additional information of S-bolt along a sequence of partition. And now portfolio is just a And now, portfolio is just, I mean, the most general thing we can consider as a control path. But we have, I mean, the portfolio corresponds to the proportion of our capital we invest in each firm. So this is normalized to add up to one. So it takes values into the unit cell. And then if this portfolio corresponds to proportion invested in each company, well, you can derive the formula for the wealth process if you invest accordingly. Invest according to this pi. And then it's just a linear equation. So a linear, usually storacic differential equation, but here's a rough differential equation, which can be solved explicitly by the rough exponential. So what you have to see, I mean, this is some of robust formulas which hold then in every specific model you like to consider. All right. So what are the standard examples of control path or admissible portfolios in our sense? Admissible portfolios in our sense. Well, the first thing is the standard one in interesting portfolio, the functionally controlled one where you have this structure in order to have exactly taking the values in the unit simplex. But I think the most natural further step is to look at functionally controlled one, which is the name we came up with. So if you have a better one, you're invited to tell us. It's which way you essentially give up the gradient type structure. Gradient type structure of the functionally generated portfolios. And why is this a natural class? Because this is the class of portfolios where the log optimal portfolio is included. So this is, I mean, so if you work with the functionally controlled one, you can treat of log optimal portfolios as well. But of course, you can look for much more general portfolios like everything which is somewhat generated by a control differential equation with respect to the market portfolio. To the market portfolio, so just to have some examples in mind, all right. So, let us look now at the universal portfolio theory, um, in order, well, to have some application of this awfully general setting. So, universal portfolio, I mean, the idea is of Thomas Covered is to find a portfolio which, in the long run, at least, performs asymptotically, I mean, it performs well. So, there's no picturing of optimality in the sense that you have preferences, but In the sense that you have preferences, but I just want to set up a well-performing portfolio. And the idea is to take some average strategy. So you fix two things. The first thing is A, which is a set of admissible portfolios, which are in principle all the portfolios you're willing to consider. And then you take a probability measure on this set A, which is the probability measure which respects your average. So essentially, you try. So essentially, you try to follow a trading strategy generated by the average of all admissible trading strategies. This is here in the screen done. Of course, I mean, in order to get this done, you have to now show that this is a control draft path as well, but this is possible. So this is a well-defined object in this pathwise setting. Another question is: how well does it perform in the long run? And for this, let us restrict this let us restrict um i mean you can take consider different kinds of portfolios as well but let me restrict to the functionally controlled one because this is the the first step further um compared to the existing literature right okay the universal covenants universal portfolio read then we're just plugging in this set a k alpha so there depends on certain parameters which are fixed and what we want to do now is you want to compare it to the best retrospectively shows Best retrospectively shows the portfolio. This is a portfolio which is way too good to be realistic. So, what you do here is, for example, at time T, so say at the end of the day, you look back, ask yourself, what would have been the smartest way to invest in the financial market to optimize or maximize your capital? So, this is a super unrealistic anticipating portfolio, which cannot be implemented in reality. But now we want. In reality, but now we want to compare the universals portfolio with respect to this best retrospectively chosen one. And the result we get here is, okay, the first thing is somehow a condition that your market is never dying, right? Because there's no long run if you stop the market at some point. So here you have some condition depending on the p-variations of the involved market. But as long as this goes to infinity, so if there's always Long as this goes to infinity, so if there's always an active market which is somehow rough enough, then you get this asymptotic bounds. If you compare the logarithm of the optimal universal portfolio with respect to the best bridge respectively chosen one, David, just to let you know, you have about five minutes including questions. So if you go over, then you don't have questions. So if you can wrap up in the next couple of minutes, you could have a couple of questions. The next couple of minutes, you could have a couple of more questions. Thank you, thank you. I'm Amos. So, I mean, okay, I mean, this is a rather wide bounds, right? So, if you look at this, I mean, they're rather fat, right? But they're somehow tied in a pathway setting. So, we are doing here worst-case analysis about the performance of the pathwise universal portfolio. So, you can really show that these balance are sharp. At least in a pathwise setting, not and of course, you can take different classes of admissible portfolio. You can take different classes of admissible portfolios to get different balance if you like to. All right, so let me let me come to an end. So, we enveloped here like a general rough path-based framework for financial modeling, which we hope that it will have also have further applications in at least the portfolio theory. The moment you want to work somewhere in a model-free setting. And as an application, I discussed the half-model-free version of carbon's. Model-free version of Carmen's universal portfolio with general non-gradient type strategies. And if you're interested, I mean, there are also like applications to the master formula in Fernand's Jurassic Portfolio Theory, which we have included in the paper, but I couldn't include it in the twerk to time constraints. All right, so thank you very much. We have time for some questions. Time for a few questions. Anyone online? Okay, thank you, David. So next speaker. Hello. Hi. Let me share my screen. Yes, if you could share your screen. Do you see my screen? Yes. Should I stop and hit the recording or not? I should stop and see how it works. Sorry, you can see my screen, right? Yes. Oh, lovely. Okay.
