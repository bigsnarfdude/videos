Uh, great for making um helping the discussion on this workshop. Just to want to say that I was looking today about uh his publication record and I counted that he has papers spanning six decades, which is well very impressive. So, Abajastekari is a pleasure to have you here and please go ahead. Great, thank you very much. So, the organizers asked me to speak. The organizers asked me to speak at the very end because this talk is going to draw on results that we discussed, quite a few, and it will touch on all the themes that were talked about during this workshop. So this has to do with imaging the horizon dynamics via gravitational wave tomography. And this is a work that is based on many, many people, results from many, many people. And I've listed And I've listed many of them here, but I apologize if I inadvertently left out someone. Okay, so the plan of the talk and the main message is going to be the following. So, what I would like to tell you about is first of all, quasi-local horizons. And this is something that was pushed upon by many people. Freshed upon by many people. But on the other hand, I think that the audience is sufficiently diverse that there are many people here probably who don't know about the Coasilocal horizons. So I'll spend just a couple of minutes on event horizons and Coasy Local Horizons in the beginning. But basically what happens is that as yesterday, Daniel Pukot told us that in these numerical simulations, you find these marginally trapped tubes and doubt. Tubes and the outermost of them, so say in a binary black hole collision, for example, the outermost of them is going to be depicted up here by H. And these are the dotted lines are the marginally trapped surfaces up here. And we've got this, so this is the in the in the this is really a dynamical horizon. This is the outer most one, exactly the same that the idea was talked about. And then it asymptotes, the event horizon. Symptotes of the event horizon of the Ramna. In this region up here, the dynamical horizon is really very dynamical, it is growing. And then it settles down and asymptotes reaches a certain isolation. So it becomes more and more an isolated horizon because the incoming radiation here is quite strong, whereas here, the incoming radiation weakens. So we'll talk about that and then the And then the key point is that in order to do this tomography, we are going to introduce a canonical isolated horizontal structure on this dynamical horizon. And the point is that what you would like to do is to make a contact with the quasi-normal mode regime, but that requires certain background metric. And what we want to do say is: how do we introduce such a background metric, at least to the extent that we can talk about quasi-normal modes? Normal modes. And that requires some structure, the dynamical horizon. So, physically, what we have is just this, and we're going to introduce some structure on it. And that structure will enable us to make contact with the event horizon, the final RAM length. And then we'll talk about that approach to equilibrium and tomography. So, the main messages, just to summarize again what I said, after a gravitational collapse or a black hole binary merger. Or a black hole binary merger, there is a common dynamical horizon that is formed whose evolution is invariantly coded in a set of geometrical multipoles. So this evolution of the horizon can be then talked about in a covary manner about we can study how these multiples change. On the isolated horizon, these multiples don't change. They just tell you what the horizon is geometry is, and or here, however, they change. And in the assembly Chip and in the asymptotic future, the dynamical horizons approaches the event horizon of the final remnant and becomes isolated. Now, under suitable assumptions on this limit, one can introduce a canonical isolated horizon structure on this entire manifold, including the dynamical region up here that we got. So it's not just the not just in the symptotic region, but on this entire manifold up here. And then the day. Manifold up here. And then the deviations of the dynamic of the dynamical horizon geometry from the fiduciated horizon geometry measures how dynamical, how time-changing the horizon geometry is in full GI. And Einstein's equations allow us to identify a regime in which the dynamical horizon is slowly varying in a precise sense. And then what we assume is that the final remnant is a curved black hole and in a slowly varying regime, the exact dynamics. Regime: the exact dynamics is well described by the quasi-normal modes of the linear theory of the curved black background. Then one can express the evolution of the multiples on the dynamical horizon here in that regime with directly with the waveforms at infinity. So null infinity is here. Here you've got some waveforms. Here the multiple moments are changing, and we are really saying how these change. And because of this, we have got this gravitational wave tomography. We have got this gravitational wave tomography in the sense that we cannot really see the observers in this region cannot really see the horizon, but we can deduce some important facts about that horizon by just looking at what happens to the waveforms out at infinity. And now the important thing is this is to make contact with what Luis was asking us and also what Colin was asking for theoretical input. It also provides a criterion as to when the numerical evolution. Evolution enters the quasi-normal regime. Basically, if the horizon multiples are here, are changing in a way which really has to do with non-linearities of the theory, then this change, these dynamics will not be captured by the cause of normal ringing, and therefore one will be able to distinguish between the two. So, that's the idea. Now, just as a very quick, quick introduction, let me say about a few basic. Let me say about a few basic facts about the quasi-local horizons. So, everybody knows about the event horizon. It really you take the manifold and then you take the past you look at the manifold M up here and then you look at the past of SkyPlus and then you subtract this then you get the black hole region and the boundary here is the event horizon and this is what is sort of you typically And this is what is sort of typically used in various black hole theorems and so on. However, not in numerical relativity because this event horizon is very theological. So you need to know the whole simulation before we can really construct it. So to know if space-time admits an event horizon, we need to know its entire future because it's the past of future and then infinity. That is what we need to know. And the role of sky, therefore, is very global. It is very different from just. Global, it is very different from just giving as boundary conditions for gravitating waves. You really need to know what the past of this is in a very global way. And there is teleology. In particular, an event horizon might be forming in the room that you are sitting in in anticipation of a collapse which will take place 10 billion years from today, and you don't know anything about it. And this is illustrated here by the Vaidya collapse. This is a thick shell, thick null fluid which is falling in from infinity. Null fluid which is falling in from infinity. In this region, space-time is just flat. And then this, this falls in, and then a dynamical horizon is formed. And this dynamical horizon, when the infall stops, becomes isolated and then becomes this, this, the event, joins onto the event horizon. But if I look at the past of null infinity, it goes all into the flat space-time itself. So even the flat space-time, there is an event horizon, but there is no dynamical horizon. But there is no dynamical horizon. There are no marginate trap surfaces which lie entirely in this, in this, to the past of this, in the flat region up here. So the quasi-normal horizon, the basic ideas, we want to get away from the event horizon. So the basic idea was really that what we look for is these marginally trapped surfaces. So in this region, the statement is that the Um, the the null so here I have what I've drawn is really dynamical horizon up here, and then uh I got this outgoing one and the ingoing one, and then what we're looking for is the expansion of the outgoing normal is equal to zero, and the causal local horizons are really by stacking two surfaces which are marginally trapped surfaces along these lines up here. Flies up here. So, for example, again, in this white deck collapse that I just talked about, here is a null fluid which is falling in. This horizon forms, and when the null fluid stops, then it joins onto this up here. So, therefore, the edge is space-like for the progenitors of the final, as well as for the final marginal trap surfaces. So, progenitor, the trap surface. So, progenitor, the trap surfaces that the marginal trap tubes are social to the progenitors as well as the final one. For them, it is space-like, as we heard from Daniel yesterday. And then the flux, the flux is falling into the horizon. Energy is falling into the horizon, it's positive, and its area is increasing. And that is what is happening in this dynamic region up here, that the area is increasing. If the flux is zero, which is what is happening up here, then we have the horizontal. Then we have the horizon is null and this area is constant, and that represents the black hole in equilibrium. And if it is, in fact, in the black hole evaporation where things are leaking out, in fact, the H is time-like and the flux is outward, so it's negative and the area is actually decreasing. So in these two cases, the area is changing, so it's called dynamical. Sometimes this is called space-like dynamical and time-like dynamical. In the third case, it is called non-expanding. In the third case, it is called non-expanding because the area is not changed. I want to emphasize that these notions are quite general. For example, the non-expanding horizon is much more general than the killing horizons of the non-expanding. Sorry, every killing horizon is a non-expanding horizon, but these are much more general. For example, the multi-black hole caster trash solutions, they don't have killing horizons, but they have non-expanding horizons. And similarly, the Robinson Troutman solutions have no. Robinson and Troutman solutions have non-expanding horizons. Now, let me just talk about the dynamical horizons, which are here. So, let me talk about that first. A dynamical horizon H is a space-like three-dimensional sub-manifold, possibly the boundary of space-time, that is foliated by closed two surfaces S, such that the two expansions satisfy that the outward expansion is zero and the inward normal expansion is negative, and energy condition holds. And energy condition holds. This is a quasi-normal notion, and there is no dynamical horizon in sitting in the room that you are actually sitting. The local existence was given by Anderson, Mars, Medicker, Simon, and Simon, and uniqueness was discussed with Galloway. Perhaps the most striking property of the event horizon is the Hawking's result, that the area of cross-section never decreases if the energy conditions hold. But one cannot hope to relate. But one cannot hope to relate the increase in area to the physical process because it is why the example. In this case, the event horizon area is increasing. Nothing is here because this is flat space. Still, the event horizon area is actually increasing. In the case of a dynamical horizon, which we have a much better situation in which the change in the aerial radius of the dynamical horizon is directly related to the matter in flux through the dynamical horizon and gravitational energy influx through the dynamic horizon. Energy and flux through the dynamical horizon. Both are positively definite if the matter satisfies energy condition and therefore the area increases. And furthermore, there is a generalized angular momentum balance law. And that generalized balance law tells us how the angular momentum changes. And the angular momentum, also the two cross-section, it changes with the fluxes up here. And so you can associate, you can interpret these terms also, like the matter and the gravitational flux. Now, as we saw in the white da example, when the incoming thing radiation falls, stops, it becomes the horizon, it becomes isolated or not expanding rather. And so, what are non-expanding horizons? And these were studied by many, many people. A non-expanding horizon is a null three-dimensional sub-manifold delta, possibly with a boundary. So, it can start at some finite time, if you like, as for example, in the white. As, for example, in the white example, it had a pass boundary such that the expansion of the outward null normal is zero as before. But this is now true for any outward null, sorry, for any normal to the surface. This is a null surface, but an L is really the normal to that surface. And so you can choose any normal, and this will be zero up here. And then energy condition holds. And therefore, on the holds and therefore on the on the on the dynamical horizon what we saw was the this is space like so the metric has signature plus plus plus and on the non-expanding horizon the metric has signature zero plus plus so the metric is intrinsic metric there is degenerate and the two-dimensional objects will carry a tilde up here so this really should also be a tilde here so the and this was what was discussed in zureklavodowski's talk that Zurek Lavandovsky's talk that on a non-expanding horizon, the metric doesn't change, and in particular, not only is this expansion zero, but the shear of this null normal is also zero. There should be tilled up here. Maybe I can just put it right now. Okay, good. Hence, oops, sorry. Okay, hence, it turns out that as a consequence of these properties, here it's zero expansion is zero, and the lead derivative of the metric is zero up here. So as a consequence of those properties, the space-time connection induces a unique connection, delta, such that if I take this null normal and take its derivative, both this is tangential to the surface, this is a derivative operator in. A derivative operator intrinsically the surface that this is proportional to some one form times L, and this one form, as Lewandowski mentioned, is called the rotational one form. It has information about the angular momentum of this non-expanding horizon. And this is, in fact, a potential for the, as you can see from this equation, for the imaginary part of psi 2. And as we know, imaginary part of psi 2 on the horizons captures the angular momentum information. So here is an example. So, here is an example. This is a scalar collapse, and then after a while, other shell also collapses. For simplicity, just spherically symmetric. And then, the statement is that, and this could happen a billion years later, then you will have a non-expanding horizon here, and you'll have the final non-expanding horizon here. But then, if I look at the event horizon, the event horizon would be like that, and then go down up here. It will be outside this non-expanding horizon. On the right-hand side up here is a On the right-hand side up here is what is happening with the Lambda bigger than zero case. That is to say, with the quads or constant. And in this case, script-like, scribe plus is space-like. And then we got here the black hole singularity. Again, this is a white dark collapse up here. Null fluid is falling in this particular pane. And then the statement is that we've got the non-expanding horizon here, and we've got a non-expanding horizon here. In this region, the space-time is. Here. In this region, the space-time is the city, and therefore, there is also a non-expanding horizon up here. So, these are the examples. And now, there are two important subclasses of non-expanding horizons. These are obtained by asking more conditions. So, the first subclass is that this is said to be weakly isolated if, in fact, this one form that we have is actually lead-dragged along this L. So, along the non-expanding horizon. L. So along the non-expanding horizon, for example, here or here, what we want is that this one form up here is lead dragged by the LA. And then the statement is that if so you can use you have to find a null normal such that this is a lead dragged. But if you're given a non-expanding horizon, I can always find null normals such that this is true. So you can always choose a non-expand weakly isolated horizon structure on a non-expanding horizon. non-expanding horizon so therefore the weakly isolated geometry is called as is just denoted by the the manifold the the null normal l then the metric and this one form up here i use this notation because it turns out that there is a we can always rescale the null normals just by constant and that freedom has to be kept as yurek lavodowski explained yesterday that is what gave rise to enlargement of the dms group by one dimension on By one dimension on the non-expanding horizons. And then the horizon is called isolated if a stronger condition holds that the entire derivative operator is lead-dragged along the non-expand. So it is entire, this D has to be lead dragged along the non-expanding horizon. Then it is said to be isolated. So in this case, the omega does not have to be lead dragged. In this case, it is lead dragged. And in this case, not only is omega lead dragged, but also the derivative. Is omega Li drag, but also the full derivative operator is Li drag. And on a non-expand, on the weakly isolated horizon, and therefore also on the isolated horizon, the surface gravity is a constant, which is a zeroth law of black hole mechanics. And the most of the talk, I will assume that surface gravity is not equal to zero. So I'm not looking at extremal situations. Now, as I said, the geometry of these horizons is really captured by multiple moments. Given any non-expanding horizon delta, we can all Non-expanding horizon delta, we can always choose non-normal L to endow it with a weakly isolated horizon structure, as I just explained. On the other hand, the isolated horizon structure is genuine restriction. A given non-expanding horizon may not admit any L, which will lead drag the whole derivative operator. Even, but of course, the curve, for example, any killing horizon in particular has this nice property. There's no problem with the With the curve horizon or any killing horizon is in fact an isolated horizon. So, but nonetheless, so one would think that that means that this is more restrictive up here. But nonetheless, the multiple moments, the isolated horizon geometry, just like this geometry of the non-expires, of the weakly isolated horizons, they actually is completely characterized by these multiple moments. And this is a little bit surprising. And this is a little bit surprising, but it turns out that although this is more restrictive, basically on the weekly isolated horizon, we've got a fewer fields. We just had this omega and Q. And it turns out that to get the derivative operator, we need more fields. We have more information. But it turns out that, in fact, the derivative operator is lead-dragged by L, then that extra information can be reconstructed just from this pair up here. And that is why the multiple moments are both non-expanding. multiple moments of both non-expanding horizons and the expand and the sorry multiple moments of both the weakly isolated horizons and the isolated horizons are captured by the just by knowing they capture this pair up here and so how do you do it well there are several definitions of multiple moments but the simplest for tomography assumes that the two metric on the on the weekly isolate horizon on the is actually accurate Horizon or that is actually axisymmetric. Now, given an axisymmetric metric Q on any two-sphere, so that you've got an axial killing vector field up here, one can show that there is a canonical round metric that you can construct just from the geometry, just from this given Q tilde, the two metric, and the killing vector field up here. And basically, you can always write the basic metric in this particular form: R is the aerial radius, and then I get this. And then I get this, this is the phi coordinates, and I introduce another coordinate zeta. And this coordinate is just constructed invariantly, starting from the killing vector field and the two metric up here. And then this function f is just given by the norm, the killing vector field r squared. And then the round metric is just obtained by replacing f by f naught, and f naught is one minus zeta squared. On a round metric, zeta just cos zeta, so this just becomes sine squared. Cos theta, so this just becomes sine squared theta, and we get the familiar form of here. And now, the idea up here is that if you're given an axisymmetric metric, you construct this round metric, and then just use the y lms of this round metric. And then using this, you can define the shape and the rotational multipoles. The shape of the horizon is, of course, encoded in a metric, but the invariant information is then encoded in the Richie tensor. And so, and the rich tensor is completely determined by the Ricci scalar. So, the invariant information is in the Ricci scalar up here. And then the rotational information is contained in the curve of this omega. And so you can, which is really the imaginary part of psi 2. So you really look at these two, this combination, which turns out to be exactly the real and the imaginary part of psi 2. If I put an I here, then that will be exactly real and imaginary part of psi 2. And therefore, the Therefore, the multiple moments are just defined by taking this field phi, which is really psi two on a weakly isolated horizon, multiplying it by y lms and taking the integral up here. So these are, and one can because these are dimensionless, but one can construct the dimensionful ones, the area, the ones which correspond to the mass and angular momentum by just appropriate rescaling them with the mass and the basic. The mass and the basically the radius of this horizon up here in some standard way, and this is all well motivated and tell um tell okay so this is all well motivated and tell us how this rescaling should be done now the multiple moments of a dynamical horizon this is what i would like to tell you a little bit about now for the multiple moments of dynamical horizon the idea is simply Of dynamical horizon, the idea is simply that if, in fact, the idea up here is that assumed that the dynamical horizon in the distant future is actually becoming axisymmetric. And then, therefore, you got YLMs in the distant future, and you can just lead drag those YLMs in the down up here by an invariant procedure. This invariant procedure is a little bit tricky. You need to introduce a certain vector field, which will lead drag this down. Which will lead this down, but there are some natural conditions on these vector fields that fixes it uniquely. And that is what is used to get the coming down up here. In this picture, what I've shown is really a genuinely dynamical horizon joining on to an isolated horizon at a finite time, as like in my Vaida cases. And this transition up here is something that one sees in numerical relativity, because to within numerical relativity accuracy, accuracy of the core. Accuracy of the course. After a few cycles, after the merger, the area doesn't change. And what happens up here is that you really just get the curve isolated horizon. And that is why I draw this picture up here. In reality, of course, there is some weak radiation still backscattering going in. And therefore, in real mathematical terms, it is never becoming an isolated horizon. It's only in the limiting case as the time point at V, if you like, goes to infinity. If you like goes to infinity, that it would become the it would become tangential to the isolated horizon. So, the idea up here is to lead drag this violence, and then on each of this marginally trapped surface of the dynamical horizon, you just instantaneously, you just look at what is the what is the scalar that I wrote down up here, this scalar up here, and just you introduce the do the integration. So, the multiple moments now will change as. Multiple moments now will change as I change this cross section. So the formula is the same, but they now depend on the cross-section, therefore, they are time-dependent. And now, even though the final, the physical metric itself is not round, and therefore the multiple moments are generically non-zero for all L and M. And the spin direction of the angular momentum dipole can also change. If the remnant in a black hole binary coalescence is curved, then the multiple moments. Then the multiple moments settle down, the curve isolated horizon multiple in the distant future. And so the evolution of multiples tells us how the dynamics of this geometry appear. And these multiples are used in many simulations. I just give a short list here, but it's really many, many simulations to track how the horizon geometry is changing in time. So this is the quasi-local horizon, and now I would like. Horizon and now I would like to do is to consider a case in which you have got a dynamical horizon and then it approaches in the distant future an isolated horizon which is becomes tangential. And that isolated horizon in the distant future is the same as the event horizon. Of course, in this region, event horizon is changing, it's area changing, it's not isolated, but in the distant future, it should be, or in the limit, it would be an isolated horizon. So this is the mathematical generality diagram because here is going to be some backstat. Diagram because here is going to be some backscattering. So the isolate, the dynamical horizon is dynamical throughout. And this is the numerical relativity picture that I told you about, where within numerical accuracy, after some time, it becomes isolated. So what are the various vectors up here? I'm sorry that you may not be able to see everything. Let me just explain what these vectors are. So here is a marginal trapped surface. Here is another marginal trapped surface on the dynamic. Another marginal chart surface on the dynamical horizon, and now what we have here is these two vectors L and N, which are the two null vectors. The expansion of this vector is zero. But now, since this is a space-like surface, it also has a time-like normal and unit time-like normal is called tau hat. And it has also a space-like normal within the dynamical horizon, which is called as R hat. So, that's what we have up here. And so, what on the on this dynamical horizon, we've got a metric. dynamical horizon where I got a metric of signature plus plus plus there's a two-sphere metric of the of the marginally trapped surfaces and then this metric in the orthogonal direction so what I do is I introduce a coordinate v so that v equals constant are the marginally trapped surfaces and therefore the physical metric can always be written like that where this b which is a function of v theta phi of all the of all the very all the coordinates up here that is really capturing the norm Capturing the norm of this vector field, of the vector field V up here. If V goes to zero, then the metric will just be this, and that will be, will be here, that will be a non-expanding horizon up here. So in the limit, as these surfaces go to infinity, B goes to zero, or in this simulation, B will become zero here and here, then the horizon is become not. Here it is space-like, and here it is. Now, here it is space-like, and here it is become null. This transition is studied carefully in a paper with Miguel Campigli and Samir Sham a few years ago. So, this is what we are happening. But now, as we approach this or in the distant future or here, the vector fields we are talked about are hat and tau hat blow up because this is becoming null. And tau hat, it's unique time-like vector field. So, the norm is always for tau hat, the norm is actually equal to always equal to one. The metric. Actually, equal to always equal to one. The metric is smooth everywhere. The space-time metric is smooth everywhere. And therefore, that can. But on the other hand, the geometry is becoming null. So tau hat blows up. R hat similarly blows up because it is unit up here. And there are hat, tau hat, and l, they all coincide and they become the null normal up here. But it turns out that we can under so l diverges, tau hat and r hat diverge, but n. Had diverged, but and the other vector field up here that actually goes to zero. And this vector field V that I wrote down, that is, of course, completely well-behaved because by construction, it was just tangential to this V equal to constant, I'm sorry, normal to this V equal to constant surfaces. So therefore, it is completely well behaved. That vector field. And that vector field is just given by, is given, sorry, that vector field has this factor of B here. As this factor of B here, which tames the bad behavior of R hat. And now, what I can do is to just rescale the null vector fields by appropriate factors of D so that they are all well behaved. And then the vector field V can be written in terms of these well-behaved Melnorma vector fields up here. So, in this region up here, V just equal to L because B is zero completely. Now, on the dynamical horizon, Now, on the dynamical horizon, where I know the surface gravity is defined in this particular way: the acceleration dotted with the other null normal. And of course, on the isolated horizon, this is what we talk about as normal surface gravity or in the killing horizon. And there's also rotational one form, which becomes a rotational one form on the isolated horizon. But also, we have the shears associated with the tunal normals. And I'm now going to be talking always about this. Now, going to be talking always about these null normals, which are well-behaved throughout every variable in numerical relativity, as I mentioned, you can join on smoothly the corresponding vector fields, assuming that the metric is smooth. It's only the manifold which is becoming null up here. And then, and also, just for concreteness, what one can do is to eliminate this freedom of pre-scaling this V, this affine parameter. For example, by asking that the lead derivative of V. That the lead derivative of v by of theta sub n bar is equal to zero. This eliminates the freedom completely up to constant rescaling, and that is what we just keep. So, constant rescaling, we cannot eliminate, we just keep it. Okay, oops, sorry. Now, let's talk about approach to equilibrium. So, what you are again I'm talking about is really in this picture, I'm approaching equilibrium in this direction or in this picture. Equilibrium in this direction, or in this picture, I'm approaching equilibrium at some finite time here. Now, the assumption, the mathematical generality picture that we have to make is that all these fields, which the geometrical fields on the dynamical horizons, they tell us about shears and the expansions and this rotational one form in the surface gravity. These fields actually admit smooth limits. As these two spheres go to infinity, the limits are smooth. Infinity, the limits are smooth. In this case, we already know that the limits are smooth because the four-dimensional space-time geometry is assumed to be smooth, and that this sub-manifold is itself smooth. It's just that it becomes null in some region. So we assume that these are all admits with limits. And we also assume that B, of course, goes to zero because that is becoming isolated. And then the lead derivative, the time derivatives of the Q tilde and omega. Q tilde and omega, they both vanish. And this is the idea that because we have the horizon is approaching equilibrium, so the time derivatives of the basic fields should vanish. And then in the numerical relativity picture, of course, the conditions are all satisfied because the metric is poor. Then the field equations actually imply that the shear of the L-bar, the outward normal, is equal to zero. And that is not surprising because. To zero, and that is not surprising because the shear of this is already zero on the non-expanding horizon. Here it's approaching non-expanding horizon, so therefore, the shear is equal to zero. And that is what Einstein's equations imply. And they also tell us that kappa ultimately becomes the surface gravity becomes constant. So a priori, it could be a function on the two-sphere up here, at any given finite two-sphere up here. But as you approach here, it becomes constant, or as you go up here, it becomes constant. Becomes constant. Okay. Now we're going to set up limiting fields. So these are the fields. The field B, which is really the field which tells us how much dynamical we are. This field says that is really measures how much space-like the dynamical horizon is and therefore how much, how far from the equilibrium we are up here. So this field B, of course, goes to zero. Then the metric here has a limit. And then similarly, all these fields, the surface gravity, omega. The surface gravity, omega, and the two shears and one expansion. The other expansion of this is of L-bar is just zero everywhere on the dynamical horizon. So its limit is, of course, zero. And these quantities then admit these limits up here. And it turns out, this is the beautiful thing that happens. It turns out that this is precisely the free data that is needed to endow the entire three-manifold H. Three manifold H together with this vector field V with a weakly isolated horizon structure. So, what I'm saying is that as I go to infinity, I get some fields, and those fields are exactly the ones which is the free data, which will endow this surface with a weakly isolated horizon structure. Or if you like, or here, the data I obtain up here, it's not surprising. The future is, of course, even isolated to the future, certainly uniquely isolated. But the interesting thing. Weakly isolated. But the interesting thing is that I can now drag these weakly isolated horizon structures down up here. In the physical space-time, this is a dynamical horizon, but I am just intrinsically giving it the structure of a weakly isolated horizon. So sorry. So, this is something that you can do. That is to say, assuming Einstein's equation, one can Equation, one can transport these fields along the integral curves of VA on all of H and construct perimeter derivative operator such that this object is really an intrinsically defined isolated horizon. So Li V of omega naught is equal to zero. So this will lead right, this is a lead drag. And then the fiducial weakly astronomical structure is defined just intrinsically within the three manifold by dragging down the limiting fields. By dragging down the limiting fields, as I just explained. And now, what we want to do is to identify this weakly isolated horizon. That's the idea. We want to identify this weakly isolated horizon with the event horizon or the background metric G G naught that is associated with the remote because we had literally dragged it down. Over here, I got really the metric in the numerical relativity. This will be the metric, I weakly, this will be the isolated horizon of the curve. And I'm literally dragging down this. Literally dragging down this structure up here. And therefore, the statement is that the weekly isolated horizon that I get in this particular way, we would like to think of this, identify it with the event horizon with the background curve metric associated with the event, associated with the remnant. So this is not the physical metric, physical metric, that event horizon is not static, but the G naught, the background curve metric that we will introduce, its event horizon will be. If the event horizon will be time-independent, and then starting from a few cycles after the merger, we are this metric, and therefore, the statement is that we are just dragging it down. And we want to regard the evolution of the multiples, so the physical dynamic of horizon induced by the quasi-normal modes of the G-naught. And we want to regard this evolution as giving, you know, as telling us how it will tell us, for example, this causal. It will tell us, for example, this quasi-normal modes will change the multiple moments, but these quasi-normal modes are also given at infinity. And therefore, we can look at the relate the induced multiple moment evolution with the causinormal waveform at scry plus. So that is the idea. So, however, there's one important step that we have to do. Unfortunately, it's not quite right so far, because the event horizon, the third horizon, is an Horizon by third horizon is an isolated horizon, while our streamlined procedure gives us only a weekly isolated horizon, which is in general it is not an isolated horizon. So the thing is that we do have, and my V is such that I do have this condition, but I do not have this condition up here. D naught is given to me, but V need not redrag this D naught up here. But our assumption tells us that the physical dynamics. That the physical dynamical horizon approaches the curve isolated horizon in the distant future. And then this guarantees us that all we have to do is to rescale this v. V goes to v bar with some function. This is an arbitrary certain specified function that we have to choose times one plus e to the minus kappa times v. So this is a we had to rescale v by this particular function. And this transformation preserves the surface gravity. And interestingly, His gravity, and interestingly, if this lead-dragged omega, then in fact, v-bar would also lead this omega. So, this transformation preserves the weakly isolated horizontal structure. But the point is that this V may not lead the D naught operator, but we can find a suitable, we are guaranteed to find a suitable operator such that the V bar obtained in this particular way will re-drag this thing. This out this thing. So we do that. And then the further required rescaling is unique. And this isolated horizon is then isomorphic with the isolated horizon, which is provided by the event horizon of the Kerr remnant. And in particular, it has the same multiples of the curve one. So to use the quasi-normal modes of the curve remnant, we also need a preferred affine parameter because we want to relate things on ScryPlus with the things on the horizon. With the things on the horizon, and therefore we need not only the analog of the killing vector field, the analog of the killing vector field is this V bar, not V, but this V bar. If you like the vector field on the Kerr case, the horizon, the killing horizon, and that killing vector field, it is really encoded in this V bar. But there's also a preferred affine parameter that we use coming from Boyl-Lincoln's coordinates or that analog of the Eddington's Finkelstein coordinates. Finkelstein coordinates, and we need this in order to compare with what is happening at scry. And now it turns out that there is a supertranslation freedom in this choice of this v-bar, just like at scry, because if you know the vector field, I don't know what the affine parameter is. I need to choose a cross-section and say the affine parameter is zero on that cross-section, and then just drag that by asking that v bar a grad A, this little v bar is equal to one. So there is a supertransition freedom which. So, there is a supertranslation freedom in this choice up here. But the interesting thing is that the technology of isolated horizon tells us that this can be eliminated by the fact that every non-extremal isolated horizon admits a canonical foliation by good cuts. So we can just choose this canonical foliation, and this canonical foliation in the Kerr case will give us the standard affine parameter. And thus, on the entire horizon edge, including the full dynamical horizon. Including the full dynamical horizon portion, where I've introduced a fiducially isolated horizon structure with the null normal V-bar and the preferred affine parameter V-band, and to enable us to identify this entire edge with the event horizon of the curve remnant equipped with this killing vector field. So, this is this, and then its affine parameter is V bar P. So, with this technology in hand, we're done because now what we can do is to relate. Can do is to relate if you go to the quasi-normal regime, we can then relate the multiple moments with the waveforms. So, the idea up here is really as saying up here. Here, I got this dynamical horizon. It is asymptotically become isolated up here. Here is cryop. So, what I were doing is we are using this hyperboloid that was introduced, for example, in the talk by Rodrigo and other people, which was first done by. People, which are which was first done by Ansork and then Rodrigo and also Jaramillo. And then what we're looking at a hyperboloid slice like that, and we're looking to its future only. And we're going to assume that in this future region, the physical metric is approximated by a background curve metric of the remnant plus quasi-normal mode. So let me just be more precise now. Uh, precise now. And I'm going to just implement this idea for the Schwarzschild remnant because of time. In the physical space-time representing the black binary black hole coalescence, choose a hyperboloid slice going from the dynamical horizontal to scry plus and consider the region M0 to its future. So we are considering this region up here. This is the region M0 up here. In this region, introduce a background Schoischill metric G ma. And there are only two, but important constraints on that. Two but important constraints on that: namely, that this short-shield metric should be compatible with our fiducially isolated horizon structure of edge and with the short-shield metric constructed from the remnant near scry plus. So if you do that, in between there is some freedom, but doesn't matter. And we are going to, however, we are going to assume that in between region also, that the G and G naught AB are related by G A B's. Are related by GAB is approximately G0AB plus HAB. So this is a good approximation where HAB is a linear perturbation. And furthermore, we're going to assume that this perturbation is given by a linear combination of the quasi-normal modes. Then in terms of the gauge invariant functions for the even parity given by Cunningham, Price and Moncriffe, and for the R parity given by Zeridian Montcriff, that what we can take these functions and then in terms of this function. And then, in terms of these functions, we can have a very simple expression of the perturbed horizon multiples. So, for the Schwartzhill background horizon, the only multiple that is not zero is a mass. But on the perturbed case, I get all perturbed multiples. And then they are related. These are the perturbed multiples. They are just given by the value by the LM components of this gauge invariant functions. This gauge invariant functions evaluate on the horizon. And this, of course, is a function of d-bar, and therefore, this is a function of d-bar. And that tells us how the horizon geometry evolves. So the horizon geometry evolves. Its invariant characterization is given by this, and it is completely given to us by these functions. On the other hand, because we are, so this doesn't assume any quasi-normal modes, this result is true for any metric perturbation, but for quasi-normal modes, we can take this. For quasi-normal modes, we can take this gauge invariant function and expand them out in terms of quasi-normal modes. And these quasi-normal modes are written down explicitly here, except that there is an amplitude. So these are the Bohr functions, and these are the amplitudes. Plus, minus is just even and odd. N is the overtone, and LMN and L and M are the angular Y L M labels. And then we also have a waveform at Stripe. This waveform can also be expanded. This waveform can also be expanded in terms of the quasi-normal modes, with in terms of the quasi-normal modes of oops. I forgot here. I'm sorry, I forgot here the angular dependence. No, no, no, no, this correct. Sorry. So I'm looking at the LM component of the waveform. They can also be, they just depend now on U, and that U dependence will be given by that. I already taken the spectral harmonic part out of here. So I just have these amplitudes. And then the statement is that. Then the statement is that these amplitudes are also just given by the gauge invariant functions, but now evaluate as scry plus. So the gauge invariant functions determine this. The gauge invariant function and scry plus also determine the waveform up here. But in general, I cannot relate the two, the gauge invariant functions here and the gauge invariant functions here. But if they're given by the quasi-normal modes, then the statement is that they are just given by this amplitude. That they are just given by these amplitudes, and these amplitudes are just related by constants which are known numerically. Thus, we can read off the change in the dynamical horizon multiple moments, starting with a waveform. So, let me just summarize the outlook. So, horizons that emerge in the bilinear black hole coalitions are invisible to outside observers, right? Because this horizon is this, there is no causal signal coming from this horizon. Cause a signal coming from this horizon to the outside observers. Sorry, I'm a problem with my charts. You can just take care of that first. Okay, so but nonetheless, the statement is that under the assumption that the physical metric at late times in Weyla project curve together with first-order perturbations, which are superpositions by causing normal modes, one can hope to relate the horizon dynamics. Horizon dynamics, the waveforms, the horizon dynamics, the waveforms at sky plus, because both are going to be determined by the causing normal modes. This is the tomography in the sense that thanks to Einstein's equation, an observer in the asymptotic region can actually deduce the horizon dynamics, which is inaccessible to them directly. And that is taking place in a strong field regime. Now, the key difficulty is that of setting. key difficulty is that of setting up rigid correspondence between u theta phi ski plus and suitable via v bar theta phi of the dynamical horizon this dynamical horizon is embedded in the physical space-time and we don't have that and this step was carried out by introducing a canonical fiducial isolated horizon structure on the dynamical horizon by looking at what is happening in the limit and then pulling back that structure. And we are a fiduciary isolated horizon structure now everywhere, including the strongly dynamic. Including the strongly dynamical part up here. So, this step was carried out by introducing a canonical fiducial isolated horizon structure, and that is isomorphic with the event horizon of the final curve raminator. This enables us to describe the evolution of the dynamical horizon multiples in terms of the amplitudes of the quasi-normal modes. And these amplitudes of the horizon can be determined from those of the waveformat at Scriplus. And for and I want to emphasize that for each. And I want to emphasize that for equal mass non-spinning binaries, and in this case, as Louis Lehner reminded us, the remnant is therefore a curved black hole with about, oops, this was supposed to be 68 and became sorry, 0.68. With A is about 0.68 for this one. The first part of the program, that is to say, the construction of the isolated horizon structure. The isolated horizon structure on this entire region up here, that part of the program is actually completed on this entire structure that has been completed. Now, we still have to see the last part of the program, which is really obtaining the multiple moments here, starting with the waveforms appear. And this is not my work, this is the work that is done by SSX, some people in the SSX collaboration.
