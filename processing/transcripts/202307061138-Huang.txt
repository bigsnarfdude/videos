10 has very nice introduction on the data structures. So, there are a lot of scientific questions we can ask on spatial transmutomics data, including cell type decommission, early and toxin, or single-cell segmentation. And here, we are going to focus on a particular topic on spatial domain detection that Melisa also starts to talk about. And so, there are multiple methods that have been already developed to do those spatial domain segmentation, which is try to characterize the spatial organizations of those companies. Spatial organization of those complex tissues into different functional domains. And so those common methods include SPAR GCN, base space, and many, many different others. But there are several important limitations of those current methods. So for example, first majority of those methods, they try to analyze one tissue slice at a time. Instead of analyzing multiple slides jointly, but almost all those fatal transmutations methodologies or studies, they collect multiple tissue sections. Multiple tissue sections. So it would be helpful if we are able to analyze multiple sites jointly because they do contain a lot of additional information, allowing you to do more accurate spatial domain detection. And secondly is that when we first started the analysis and the project, we actually on the wheel found that there's a huge room for improvement in terms of performance. And in fact, you can achieve quite large performance with even simpler models compared with some of those complicated and deep learning-based approaches. And finally, Approaches. And finally, all those methods, I think they are not yet scalable for very large data sets. And with this recent anti-exiting technologies or six-scope technologies, nowadays it's easy to collect 100,000 spatial locations. So it would be nice to develop some methods that can be really actually scalable to very large data sets. So for that, we developed a new method called an RS or integrated and reference-informed data. And the reference-informed domain detection for spatial transcriptomics. And it has two keywords over there: one is integrative, the other is reference-informed. So the reference-informed is basically we try to incorporate single-cell reference data in order to substantially improve the performance for spatial detection. Because intuitively, the single-cell reference data contains very variable information in terms of cell types, in terms of cell type-specific marker gene expressions. So if you are able to incorporate that, You are able to incorporate that, that can substantially improve your performance. The second word over there is integrative. So, in terms of integrative, our method is try to incorporate multiple tissue sections, model system jointly in order to improve the performance. And finally, it is computationally very, very efficient. It's applicable to very large-scale spatial transform status. And in terms of the modeling assumptions, we basically make two biological assumptions over here. So, the first Over here. So, the first is that we want to ask what is really a spatial domain, what characterizes a spatial domain on the tissue. And we have written that a key component of the spatial domain is really the cell type composition. So each spatial domain, we assume that it's characterized by a unique combination of cell type compositions that makes it distinct from each of the other spatial domains of the tissue. A second biological assumption we make is that in order to model the Make is that in order to model those multiple tissue sizes, and we assume that every spatial domain, if it's the same spatial domain on different tissue sizes, it's going to have the similar unique cell type compositions. So the domain cell type, so the spatial domain A and tissue size 1, 2, or 3, they are all going to have very similar cell type compositions. So that's the two biological assumptions we make. In terms of model, this is our model based on a panelization framework. It basically Framework, it basically contains three different compositions. So the first composition is the main objective function. So the X here is the gene expression matrix, B is the reference basis matrix you can extract from single cell reference data. So this part is how you incorporate single cell reference into there. And the V here is basically the cell type composition of the T sites. So the first part is basically express the gene expression in terms of cell type specific composition and the cell type specification. Specific composition and the cell type specific expression measures. And the second component here is to try to do certain regularization to encourage the cell type composition similarity across the spatial locations. So intuitively, if you have two neighborhood locations close to each other, then you are going to expect it to have somewhat similar cell type compositions. And this first two terms essentially try to translate the gene expression level into cell type compositions. And because the cell type composition is really our key to characterize. Is really our key to characterize spatial domains. So, therefore, the third party essentially tries to model to link the cell type compositions into the spatial domains. It basically says that for each cell type spatial domain, you have a unique composition. And they have certain variations across different tissue sizes, but they all have a mean centered around mu. That's essentially the domain-specific cell-type compositions. So, these are the three different compositions. You can see they are relatively. Compositions, you can see they are relatively straightforward. And the optimization is relatively also straightforward to do. And because the simplicity of this function, it allows us to really scale very extremely large scale special interest conformance data types. So that's basically the main idea of our model. So we'll skip over those slides. We'll just directly go into some of the data sets we look at. So the first data set we look at is the commonly used benchmarking data. So that's human DR. Benchmarking data so that human DLTFC can exhibit in data. We use this data because this data is you have histologists have already annotated this tissue into multiple cell type compositions. So it's relatively easy to compare with a different analysis. And in fact, this is data almost every methods paper uses to compare their performance. And so for this data, we also extracted a pen reference data. So there's a single nuclear RNA sequencing data to perform. Sequencing data to perform spatial domain detection. So, here are the results. So, this is the busy slides. So, we're showing here on each log is basically different tissue sections. So, we have four different tissue sections over here. And the first column is the ground tube. So, sort of annotation obtained by histologists. And then each different column, a different method. Our method is the last one. And on each plot, we also choose the domain, the detected spatial domain label along with the AI. Spatial domain label along with the ARI, which measures how accurate that is, reproducing the ground choice results. And so we are comparing with the SPAR GCM and base space and also three different cell type deconvolution methods because as we mentioned, we try to use a cell type deconvolution. So an idea we might expect to do is perhaps just use a CADA or CTD to do a cell type deconvolution, obtain a cell type composition, detail means. Turns out that doesn't really work well with that strategy. Really work well that strategy. This is a simulation? This is a real data. If it's real data, then how do you know a spatial domain? If you guys like a pathologist, yeah, pathologists, this pathologist, they label those domains. I think this is cortex data, so you can actually look at it at e slides based on the morphology you can form. Yeah, so and you can see that for the base SPART-CM, for example, base bases commonly wants a rich ARI value of 0.25, 0.4 to 5. 0.4 to 0.5, which is consistent with their own papers. And for our method risk, it actually reached a pretty high number, 0.7, so we haven't really seen such a high number in any of those recent spatial domain detention methods. And the high accuracy is quite consistent whether you analyze, how you analyze those different tissues. So sometimes you can use four different tissue sizes from the same donor or on the right. From the same donor, or on the right-hand side, you can analyze each tiger size for each of the three different donors. So the results look somewhat consistent. And you can also change the number of spatial domains, which is a hyperparameter on the x-axis. And you can see that the RRI is somewhat consistent regardless of what numbers you use. And you can, besides using the ARI, you can use also the marker gene enrichment to measure the performance. So intuitively, the marker genes would be highly enriched in one of the Be highly enriched in one of the spatial domains compared with others. So, by doing the marketing enrichment, you can look at their photo change, you can basically also give you another way to measure how good that is, even you do not know the qualities. So, the bottom basically shows the seven different marker genes. So, our method works pretty well compatible with a range of different methods. So, that's that benchmarking data everyone uses. Another data we look at is the mouse. Another data we look at is the mouse spermatoamgenesis-style sieve data. So, we use this data because, even though we do not have a ground tube in this data, the biology in this data is very well characterized in the sense that we already sort of roughly know what type of structure you expect to detect. In particular, this is a mouse testis tissue. And this mouse testis tissue consists of multiposus and semiferous and tubulous. So, you are going to see those tubular structures. So, if a man Structures. So if a method works well on the teacher's slides, hopefully you are going to see all those tubular structures available. So here shows the results. So we don't have a ground choose over here, and we're just looking for the tubular structure. So you can see that the iris works pretty well in detecting all those tubular structures. On the top are the white type mice, so you can see that the tubular structures are well organized 'cause they're all intact. At the bottom low shows the diabetes MOS, so it's more disintegrated for those cells. More disintegrate for those structures. So you can also again look at particular cell types, and you can see that the cell types are clearly very well organized in these tubular structures, including elongating cells that are run the spermatilla and the spermatocytes, and they are all very well structurally organized in these tubular structures. And again, you can use a market gene enrichment. So, without the wrong choice, you can use a market gene sort of to tell whether that's. Marketing sort of detail whether the structures we detect do make sense. And across the five different markets, our method works reasonably well compared with the other ones as well. So the next example we look at is the stereo-seq data. We look at this example, because this is stereo-sig, it's a new technique. It's a very large-scale technique. It measures about 20,000 genes across 100,000 locations. And I believe a number of other methods are really scalable to this type of data. And this is our factory. Data. And this is olfactory bulb data, so you have very well-known structures. So here shows the two tissue sections obtained the spatial domain labels obtained from iris. We didn't show the other methods because they're not really that scalable to this data. And you can see that S1 and S2, those two tissue sections, the spatial domain labels we get, looks very much similar to what you would expect for a mouse alphabet bomb. And you can do certain pathways. I'll skip this slide. And so for the last data example, And so, for the last data example, we looked at is the 10x zillion data that's just posted online last October-ish. And for this data, this is also extremely large-scale data. So you cover over 100,000 locations, depends on which tissue section you look at. And it measures relatively smaller number of genes compared with this scope technique. And so, this is 10-zinning data, and so this is a spatial domain detected by. Domain detected by arrows. So we have two tissue sections: the left-sided tissue section, the right-hand side section. And we have 16 different spatial domains over here. And so first, by just looking at those two tissue slides, you will see that these two tissue slides look somewhat similar to each other because they are actually adjacent sort of neighborhood tissues. And so the tissues, the spatial domain, for example, decayed over here in this region. And this is in fact this just basically. Just basically. So, the main region over here on this tissue side is specially the main region here. Essentially, the replicate tube is, you can think of just moving the replica once downwards. And so you can see that when we apply our methods, you get very consistent results on those tissue sections. And on this tissue slides, you also have unique structures detected at the cancer domains. Specifically, you have a domain number eight. Cover domain number eight and also domain number 16. So, domain number 16 are those red regions, and domain number 8 are those sort of white-ish regions. So, those representing two different sub-regions of the cancer: one is more aggressive cancer, more progressive cancer, the other more initial stage of cancer. And you can also look at this, one is called DCIS, the other is called IDC. And so you can use the DCIS marker genes to look at this and also all IDC. And also all ITC market genes you look at us, and indeed you can see that this DCIS market genes tend to be enriched in the domain number five, number eight in this part of regions, and also the IDC, number 16 in this part of the regions. And you can perform possible analysis looking at those regions. You can see that they are all relevant detected by IRS and some market gene enrichment. Some market gene enrichment. I'll probably skip due to the time. And finally, I just show you the computational efficiency for this method. So for the first three data sets, well, first two data sets, I skipped the one data set, I think. For the three small data sets, you can see that we are recording the computation come versus all those different methods. You can see that our method, ARIS, gives you really very low computation time to finish the analysis very fast. You to finish it analysis very fast. In the last two, can exiling data and the stereotypic data, those are very large data, and only our data, our method is applicable, and we can actually finish them and finish the analysis in about less than 30 minutes and uses the reasonable memory, 7 GB or 96, I mean GB. So, as a summary, we basically choose the IRIS, which is a highly scalable method for integrative. Scalable method for integrative and reference-informed spatial domain detection for spatial transcriptomics. And it is able to model multiple tissue sites jointly, produce highly accurate results, and is computatively efficient. And in the benchmarking data, IRIS correctly captured the layered structure in both the baseline and or more challenging settings. I will verify the accuracy. So finally, I just want to mention that acknowledge that all the work is really. Acknowledge that all the work is really done by one talented graduate student, Imma, who is now studying her own lab at Brown University. And the software is available on our lab website. So that's all I have. Happy to answer any questions. Thank you for the amazing talk. I really enjoyed what you have. I just uh have one question. Uh do you think this is also app applicable to uh situations where we have all Situations where we have multiple different subjects with different spices because for us to study the IPFs, usually we get slices from multiple different teachers and then we have different subjects. So I don't know whether the assumption of the, because you have two major assumptions, right? So the subject of the composition should be pretty complex across the sciences. But I'm not sure whether this is also easy to consider the natural. to consider the potential variation a little bit. Yeah, that's a good point. So in one of the slides analysis we showed that we actually obtained the slides from three separate donors for the data. So I think it works pretty well. And the reason is because in the target function, we assume that we penalize basically assume that the mean of the cell type composition is similar. And there are certain still certain variabilities you can sort of adapt counter for in the model. Conflict in the model itself. So, thanks for the great talk. One of my favourite kind of sayings is: if you class them, you find classes. So, you had this illustrative example where you showed your method did a great job of finding those tubular structures. So, I guess my question is twofold. What structures were the other methods finding? And can your method be tuned to find the same structures? So let's look at the slides. It's probably much easier to look at them here. So you can see that it's very hard to tell, right? So I mean, SEDR, that method, some works okay. Find certain tubular structures, generally. They're all just clusters, so it's doing okay to find tubular structures. In your method, each tubular is find the same thing as the SPARGCN. So between the SPARGCN, Uh so between the sparge and sea and well it's sort of starting looking at quite random patterns over there. We do not really sure how you relate this to the biology of the tissue. Right. So we did not look at a particular cell type because it's all completely disorganized. It's not related to any biology under this tissue. So we do not really know what's going on here. And we certainly look at a certain market cell enrichment for different Cell enrichment for different methods. So, for example, we can look at one particular market gene on the red color spatial domain versus others to see how highly enriched that is because intuitively, if we do detect biological relevant one, you have to see high enrichment. So, we do see a low enrichment for the other patients. So, it's harder, I guess, to in this particular structure, I mean, the early cortex data, you might still be able to see. You might still be able to see, you know, might be able to make more sense of it. I guess let's try to cut one layer into sort of two pieces, which does not make biological sense because the cortex is sort of continuous region. So it's very hard to interpret at this stage. I can add a pressure on this slide. So if you look at your method, the yellow, I don't know if those are cell types, but the yellow band is a lot thicker than the thicker as a cell choose. Yeah, I was curious what is going on here. So, over here, so if you looked at the compare, I guess the yellow somewhat expanded into the black region. It's almost sounds like. And so, it's likely it's this part of this layer, it has a hard time to decide whether it belongs to black or the yellow. And in our particular case, it decides to assign it to the yellow band. So, does that mean that if you have like a probabilistic assignment, it would be like more like gray, so it would be more. Like, more like ways, so it would be more obvious that those are borders. Yeah, that's a very good point. So, potentially, yeah, yeah. So, we do not know in this case, but I think if you are able to visualize a probabilistic assignment, I think that would be very answered. So, the pathologist was from. Yes, so I was going to follow up on the pathologist's question. So, some pathologists, I'm not saying more confident or less confident because I work with pathologists. Let's say some of them are more patient, some of them are less patient. So, how do we benchmark the So how do we benchmark the truth? Can we perhaps use the HE data to see whether what the voucher is saying can actually be identified based on the HE state? Yeah, I think that's a great point. So for cortex data, there's probably less ambiguity because I did all those cortex standing before a long time ago as a PhD student. So I know the layer structure are relatively clear. So if you look at a microscope, you usually can tell those layer structures, but I think for like Layer structure, but I think for like cancer regions, it's super hard to tell whether this is a cancer region, whether it's a larger one, whether it's part of that. So, I think if you with the HE standing image, I think you contain a lot more information that could potentially be the complement to the historicist or even like, you know, doing a better job that historically, hopefully, in the future. Let's thank Shan for a beautiful talk and lots of interesting questions.
