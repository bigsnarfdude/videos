Welcome to our first speaker of this Wednesday morning session. We are pleased to have Nilovoj Lugic, who will tell us about universality limits by equal systems. Thank you, and thank you to the organizers. It's wonderful to be here. So I'll tell you about a new approach to universality limits that has been fruitful. And it's about joint work with Benjamin Eihinger, Brand Simonek and Karl Voratik. So initially, the setting is going to be the following: let's have a probability measure μ on the real line with all finite moments. And let's assume that μ has infinite support in the sense of cardinality, so it doesn't just consist of finitely many atoms. Already in that case, one can define in the standard way in L2 of R d mu, observe the monomials, see if you want one, see. Polynomials, z, 1, z, z squared, and so on, and apply the Gramschmidt process and get orthonormal polynomials. This is a familiar setting. Here, and we will also assume that mu is uniquely determined by its moment, so that it corresponds to the determinate moment problem, equivalently that the corresponding Jacobi matrix is in the limit point case at infinity. So, this certainly contains all compact. Contains all compactly supported measures. And in fact, it's sufficient, for example, to have exponential decay of the weight in the following sense, for some epsilon to have this. Sufficient, not necessary, but anyway, so this is an extra assumption that will be used. Okay, and then for such a measure, for such polynomials, one observes the Christoffel-Derboux kernel, which is the following sum. You will see different. See different conventions in the literature, whether this is sum of the summed up to n or n minus 1, where one puts the complex conjugate. Those things, of course, don't really matter. But the Christoffen-Lerbouk kernel is a reproducing kernel for this following subspace of polynomials of degree at most n minus 1 in this L2 space. And it really has a lot of uses. It's a central object in orthogonal polynomials. Polynomials. And so one of the questions of study for this Christoffel-Derby kernel are the local scaling behavior of the kernels around some point C. So you look at, you fix a point C on the real line, you kind of, well, you center around C and you uh oh. Uh oh. When sigh, I predicted it. Oh, now it's working. Okay. So, okay. So I might need the other one. So okay. So you have the kernels, you scale them around C, and well, you also scale, so you scale in this terms of C and W, and let's switch. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So you scale the kernels on the outside. Otherwise, you can just look at the value at kn of c is going to grow. And you scale on the inside by some scaling sequence tau n. And you're interested in these functions of zw, complex variables, and you're interested in their convergence. And so these are often the And so these are often described in the literature as universality limits because the limiting behavior is somehow expected to be common or universal for many systems, whether you like the terminology universality limits or not. The sentiment is that this kind of scaling behaviors are often studied in random matrix theory, in orthogonal polynomials, and in other fields, often one gets some kind of scaling. Often one gets some kind of scaling of kernels to, for example, the sine kernel. And convergence to the sine kernel is described as bulk universality. And so. Kn is the Christoffelder who kernel. So it's this kind of sum of pj of z, pj of w. So you can uh one way to motivate is it is to say our orthogonal polynomials, orthonormal polymer. Orthonormal polynomials. So, one way to motivate this Christopher-Liberal kernel is to say: if I'm interested in polynomials of degree n minus one, and at most n minus one, and I want to write down orthogonal projection to those, that's going to be precisely the kernel for that projection. Thank you. And so, and these kernels, they encode a lot of, they encode a lot about the polynomials themselves and so on. So, one motivation to study this in order. To study this in orthogonal polynomials, one motivation to study this kind of limiting behavior is that it gives a statement about local zero spacing of polynomials. So if you look at the polynomial Pn and you label and you count from a point C, so Pn has all real zeros, all real simple zeros, and you label them starting from the point C to the right as C0. To the right as C0, C1, and so on, and to the left, C minus 1, C minus 2, then if you have bulk universality, by the Fourier 11 theorem, it implies that asymptotically the spacing between the J plus first and the J 0 and Z, but it's a finite list, right? So it's just. How do you define it? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Sorry. So the statement, absolutely. So for any fixed N. Absolutely. So, for any fixed n, you only have finitely many of these, but then in this limit, if you interpret it as for large enough n, something will happen. So, each fixed j, you will have a large enough. Right, yes, this is true. This is sloppy. Only have it for certain j. Yeah. So, asymptotically, the behavior, the distance between the j plus first and the jth will be of order one over tau m. 1 over tau n. xi n are zeros of the nth polynomial. are zeros of the nth polynomial, and j is their index. Yes, on the along the real line, yes. Yes. And so, I mean, the proof of this is a clever application of Corbett's theorem. If you have analytic functions, their convergence, then you say something about the zeros, and so applied in a clever way. And so applied in a clever way. That's how this is obtained. Okay, and so there's a history of studying this. There's a long history of studying universality limits and bulk universality. And it originates with random matrix ensembles. And in some sense, this idea that different systems should have the same local behavior, this dates back to Wigner in some sense. In the context of orthogonal polynomials, Of orthogonal polynomials, if you're interested in the Gaussian measure, then this just follows from properties of Hermite polynomials. And more generally, if you're interested in measures with exponential weights like this, so e to the minus V times Lebesgue measure, these were studied with some strong conditions on V by a series of authors, by Castell Sherbino, Leger Hits, Texkritier Bauer McLaughlin, and Aquita Jejou. It was common in these Common in these works to assume that maybe V is a polynomial, or maybe V is analytic with fast enough, with suitable decay at infinity. And in particular, analyticity is an assumption there. And for example, that Krieger-Bauer-McLaughlin and Akides Ju use Riemann-Hilbert techniques, and so analyticity is really part of that from the start. From the start, there was a breakthrough in 2009 by Lubinsky that uses the measures supported on an interval which are staltotic regular. And in a neighborhood of the point C, the measure is absolutely continuous, and the weight is positive and continuous. And this was extended by Lubinsky himself, Findlay, Simon, and Totic. So, this was an important development. I do Development. I do want to point out that in all of these results, one uses either analyticity and some kind of global structure of the measure, or here there's staltotic regularity, which is still a global condition. So one way to define staltotic regularity is that quasi-everywhere you have sub-exponential growth of your stalcoman moments. That would be a quick way, of course, so it's a global condition, and even though the sentiment is that something Though the sentiment is that something like sine kernel asymptotics, because you're scaling in towards a point X C, that perhaps it's a local property of the point X C, and perhaps it is somehow governed by the local behavior of the match. So can you say something about how they did this? Loginski did this? They don't use Riemann Hilbert, I guess. No, no, Riemann Hilbert. He uses a clever sort of comparison techniques between different measures. I can't Between different measures. I can't, yeah. It's a clever proof. It requires a kind of clever comparison. In particular, I mean, all of these proofs are involved. Yeah. So open problems remained. There was a conjecture stated by Abila last time that, in fact, if you have an arbitrary That in fact, if you have an arbitrary measure, that if you look at the AC part, that almost everywhere, the back almost everywhere on the essential support of the absolutely continuous part of the measure, one should have bulk universality. And in fact, they proved this in the special case when μ corresponds to an ergodic Jacobian matrix. A and B ans are determined ergodically. And another problem. And another problem that explicitly asks about this locality is Lubenski saying: assume that the measure mu has an interval in the support, and on that interval, you have almost everywhere a positive density with respect to Lebesgue measure. Do you then have bulk universality almost everywhere on the interval? And as Lubinsky pointed out, this was not known even in the special case if mu is local. Known even in the special case, if mu is locally equal to Lebesgue measure. If you have an interval where mu is just equal to Lebesgue measure and outside you have something arbitrary, it's not known whether you have bulk universality inside. So this is something that really points at this question of locality. Okay, and so here we have a statement. So first I just want to define a piecewise linear interpolation of Christopher kernels. So between n and n plus So between n and n plus 1, so you define the Christophen-Lerbook kernel now as a function of a continuous parameter k. So it's a continuous parameter L, and so you just define it piecewise linearly, you know, plus one. This kind of piecewise linear interpolation is familiar, for example, from subordinacy theory, and I'll get back to that connection later. Okay, and now the statement is the following: you have a probability measure. You have a probability measure with the assumptions I stated before. And if you have, you consider the Weyl function for this measure. And if you have a non-tangential limit of the imaginary part of the m function at a point, call that your density at the point, then you have bulk universality. So if you so if the so there's a few diff uh there's a few equivalent ways to characterize this. But so if I have the Weyl function corresponding to the to the measure, and if I if I look at the imaginary part of the m function, and if that has a non-tangential limit at the point c, for some angle alpha, the angle alpha actually doesn't matter, but if that has a non-tangential limit, which lies in zero infinity. Which lies in zero infinity, which is strictly positive and finite, then that's sufficient to have bulk universality at the point. Pointwise criterion. This, of course, is, well, I like the connection with while functions, but the imaginary part of the M function, this is, of course, just the Poisson kernel applied to the match. Just the Poisson kernel on the half plane. And so, in particular, so remarks about that condition, that non-tangent. Condition, that non-tangential limit that I wrote down exists for Lebesgue almost every xi, and in particular, point-wise it exists at every Lebesgue point of the measure, and it recovers the absolutely continuous part of the measure. These are standard facts. So, in particular, this result solves the Avila-Lastheim conjecture. You have bulk universality almost everywhere, and it solves Lubinsky's problem, because it's a purely local condition. Because it's a purely local condition at point C. So bulk universality calls Lebesgue almost everywhere on the AC spectrum. Yes? Can I ask one question about this linear information? What's the purpose of it? Yeah, so far it's not clear. So far I'm just stating it to set up for what... So at some point I'm going to go in the opposite direction. Yes, so far it's not really clear. I just wanted to state things this way from the start. Yes. Yes. Okay. So another remark I want to make is that some of the prior literature is stated at an explicit polynomial scale. In particular, if you have e to the minus q dx with polynomial q, then k n of xc behaves as a polynomial of n, or as a power of n, power between 0 and 1. And also under certain conditions on a compactly supported measure that is. So, on a compactly supported measure that is staltotic regular and has some local properties at a point C, it is known that Kn of C behaves as M. This is the study of Christoffel functions. And so this was first done by Matineva-Totic for certain essential spectrum and generalized by Totic. And in particular, it makes sense intuitively that the growth of Kn here depends, is not a local property, right? If you're going to think in terms of this. Right, if you if you're going to think in terms of this local scaling, if you want the zeros to be you know one over the scale apart, if you're compactly supported, the zeros are confined in the same compact interval for all n. And if it's not, if it's like this, then the zeros are slowly spreading up, right? So the growth rate of kn is definitely not a local property. Sorry. So, like the first statement, for example. So, this is true for almost every C and the support. The uh support. Yes. In fact, this one would be true. So this is square with subordinacy theory, right? So this really means that you have a really decaying solution, and then probably the other one is not decaying, and so why is it not subordinate? So it doesn't mean this because so this k n c really is the local L2 normal interval of length n, right? So if we're bounded, it would grow like n in the second item. So if it grows more slowly, the solution really is. Or slowly, the solution really is the gain of our region. I have to think about this. I don't have, I didn't, I didn't ask myself this exact question. It's um it looks to me like the first condition implies subordinacy of the solution, which really cannot be this kn growing. First condition. This k n growing like n to the alpha alpha less than 1. So if you have bounded solutions, alpha would be 1, but alpha is less than 1, the solution is became bounded. But if you have bounded solutions, but this is a measure that's not bounded, right? It's not compactly supported. So if you have bounded solutions... Yeah, exactly. Okay, I don't want to stop for too long, but I'm really puzzled. But is it is it obvious? So if you if you have if you're if you're in thinking the statement, if you have so you have you have this, but you also have the Ronskian is preserved. But in the Ronskian, you have A n, but the A n's are now unbound. Oh, I see. Right? Okay, that's why. So that's why. Yes, very thankful. So I guess that's okay. Just also a small question concerning the relation between these. Concerning the relation between these two points, yeah. Alpha equals one is excluded in the first example. So this means if I measure mu is totally irregular, whatever time. You know what it means? This excludes the first case. Yes, stal-totic regular is always compactly supported. Ah. Staltotic regular is a kind of a property with respect to infinity in a certain way. It's um staltotic regular measures are always compactly supported. So yeah. Yeah, these are really two different regimes. Yeah, these are really two different regimes. Thank you. Okay, so the point is that this result is stated at some scaling that follows KL in a certain way, follows KL of Zigc, and that really only that kind of scaling is a local property as we see. One does not one does not have a s an explicit polynomial scaling in terms of L as a as a parameter. L as a parameter, as a local problem. And in fact, these two things were often kind of studied in tandem, and we now see that they're two really decoupled questions. Okay, so having said this, I want to talk about another result, which involves the second-kind polynomials. So you look at the Jacobi recursion for the orthogonal polynomials. You look at the second-kind polynomials, Q and Second-kind polynomials Qn, which also satisfy this recursion with different initial conditions. And then you can study the matrix version of the Christoffer-Derby kernel, which is the same kind of sums of PJ, PJ, but now you also have QJ, PJ, and so on. You populate a 2x2 matrix kernel this way. And then you can, and then what we do is we relate that to boundary values of the M function. So if the M function, if the Weyl function, has a normal limit at C, at a point C. Limit at C, at a point C and R, then the possible values of that are values in the closure of the upper half plane, in the Riemann sphere, right? So C plus or R or infinity. You can also use eta, taking those values as a parameter, to write down all the trace one positive real symmetric two by two matrices. And you can write down And you can write down a certain kernel in terms of these h eta. This looks more mysterious than it really is. It's something explicit that can be written down with sines and cosines. That formula. Okay, so we then have the following result. If you're interested, if you're looking at the scaling, now scaling by the trace of the matrix kernel, then the following are. kernel, then the following are equivalent. The Weyl function has a normal limit at x, or the matrix kernel normalized by its trace converges as n goes to infinity. Or for some or the matrix kernel rescaled by the scaling, by the trace in this way, has a limit as n goes to infinity. As n goes to infinity. And in that case, all the three limits at the h and k are related as on the previous slide. So about this, so I want to remark that, well, there's an immediate connection here to subordinacy theory, where if you look at what Kn of ZigC is, then you can apply Cauchy-Schwartz to see that Kn of Zigc normalized by its trace goes to 0001. Trace goes to 0, 0, 0, 1 if and only if this diagonal entry divided by this one goes to 0. And so that's precisely if the pj's are subordinate. And so in particular, what you have is a special case when eta is infinity, when this goes to 0, 0, 0, 1. So 1 equivalent to 2 is really kind of subordinacy theory, at least for x. Kind of subordinacy theory, at least for eta on the real line or equal to infinity. Reason it be that no, no, no. Meaning, so H, so H has to be the same H, H has to be determined by eta. H and eta have to be linked, and they're linked by this point. So the special case of eta infinity is 0 to the 0. And part three is And part three is completely new, and this is telling you, again, scaling limits, but now of the matrix curve. Okay. And so sure, sure, sure, sure. I mean, so the Jurkineska lasted on Supon CP relates the two limits in a quantitative way. Do you get that? Not with this approach. I think we can. It wasn't a priority so far, but I think. Priority so far, but I think something can be said in that direction. But in fact, our proofs are really here based on a homeomorphism. And so in some sense, we don't have to control it in a quantitative way, precisely. So the proofs are really just they use the embedding of Jacobi matrices as canonical systems, which is Which is a standard trick in the field. So that, you know, when you have Jacobi matrices, there's vile disks that shrink to a point. And basically, any system that has two by two transfer matrices and has vile disks that shrink to a point can be embedded into a canonical system, to a DeBranch canonical system, which is this kind of initial value problem where h of x is the parameters of the canonical system and h Of the canonical system, and H of X are real positive symmetric matrices that, without loss of generality, can be assumed to have trace 1. And so there's a deep theory of canonical systems due to the branch. And in particular, there's a homeomorphism between all possible canonical systems of the form that I said and all possible Weyl functions, all possible Hurblatz functions. And so that homeomorphism. And so that homeomorphism gets used. And in particular, the limiting object, if you think about universality, one reason that it's a difficult subject is that if you're interested in zooming in at the local properties, and if you have your measure mu, and if you're now scaling things, as you're scaling things, things become unbounded, right? Even if you start with a compactly supported measure. And so, in fact, And the limiting object is not a Jacobi matrix. You don't have a bunch of Jacobi matrices converting to a Jacobi matrix. But if you're working in this larger space, then you have a limiting object that's a constant coefficient canonical system. This also explains why you get the sine kernel. The sine kernel just arises out of solving a constant coefficient canonical system, and the kernel is derived from there. If you solve a constant coefficient system, If you solve a constant coefficient system, you'll get some exponentials, or rather, sines, cosines, however you put it. And the sine kernel really comes from there, in a sense. And so the Divranche homeomorphism is really well suited, especially for this equivalence at the matrix kernel love. Okay, another quick remark is that these results hold also for half-line Schrodinger operators, half-line Dirac operators, orthogonal polynomials in the unit circle. Basically, all systems that can. Basically, all systems that can be reduced to canonical systems. So, this happens automatically. And so, the reason that I state the results this way is because there was a big theory in orthogonal polynomials for universality limits, whereas, for example, for Schrodinger operators, almost nothing was known before. Okay, now, however, with this, having said all this, if we can get equivalence for the matrix kernel, Equivalence for the matrix kernel, but I only stated an implication for the original Christoff-Holderbook kernel. Now we can ask, can there be an equivalence also for the scalar kernel? And so we prove this together with Eitir and Voracek. So the statement is as follows: For any eta, any constant, the following are equivalent. This is again just the. Equivalent, this is again just this imaginary part of the bile function converging at a point. Or you can formulate this also in terms of distribution functions, in terms of the measure on intervals. So this is very explicitly telling you if and only if the measure, kind of as you scale, looks like Lebesgue measure in some sense. The measure on some intervals of length epsilon around the C should be roughly epsilon times et. And it's equivalent to having the following bulk universality. Having the following bulk universality limit. So we have a necessary and sufficient condition for this kind of limiting behavior. And this was not previously even posed in the literature because it didn't seem like there wasn't something that one would hope for. Okay, the proof of this uses a different correspondence between, which goes just Which goes just between the measures and with chains of the brown spaces. So I'm not going to get to talk about the proofs, but it's a different homeomorphism from before. If you want an equivalence, you want to be able to go back and forth directly at the level of measures and scalar kernels. And so working directly with the Debranch homeomorphism really is not the right way to go. And so this paper really uses a different approach there. A different approach there. And intuitively, we can say bulk universality corresponds to locally looking like Lebesgue measure in this sense. That's my final message from there, but it's not really the end of the story. So, okay, so one, I have a quick remark. The quick remark is that often bulk universality is compared to the spectral type of the measure, right? It's often everything I said so far associates it. I said so far associates it with AC spectrum. However, so a quick observation is that, of course, so it's now very easy to see that if you want just bulk universality at one point, you can get that with a pure point measure, right? Because you can write down a pure point measure whose, this is the graph of its distribution function. So the measure on intervals is step-like, and if you take these steps sort of finer and finer, you'll make it so that you have bulk university. Make it so that you have bulk universality at the point. Okay, but that's just one point. What if you're interested in a bigger set? I'll rather pose another question first. So there was a paper of Breuer where he proves bulk universality in the following sense. So notice the explicit N inside. Proves bulk universality for very sparse potentials with a purely continuous singular continuous measure. So you have a So, you have a when you have sparse Jacobi matrices, it is completely understood how the size of the pumps determines whether it's AC or SC. And so, in particular, one can be singular continuous, and still if the potential is very sparse, Royer obtains this. And so, in that regime, Kn does not go asymptotically as N. So, this is not covered by our previous results. Covered by our previous results, and it can't be covered because it corresponds to a singular continuous measure, and we link it as an if and only if with the AC part of the measure. Okay, however, for sparse potentials, Kn is n times a slowly varying function of n, which I'll define on the next slide. And so the question really at this point can be, can one study bulk universality more systematically with more general scale? With more general scale. And so, for that, I have to introduce some terminology. So, one is regularly varying functions. So, if you have a function on the positive real line, it's said to be regularly varying with some index row if when you take f of lambda x over f of x, that converges as x goes to infinity to a power of lambda. That power of lambda is. That power of lambda is said to be the index. And you can consider regularly varying functions at infinity or at zero. And so the first example, of course, is powers, if f is just a power of x. The second example is a power times a log. So you can think of it as something like powers, but where you can sneak in additional logarithmic type corrections. But this is really the precise general notion that we want to work with. With and in particular, slowly varying means regularly varying with index zero. And kind of one can go between the two, one can kind of factor out the index. And the remaining fact I need about these is that if you have a regularly varying function of positive index, then it has an asymptotic inverse. There's another regularly varying g such that which is its asymptotic inverse in this sense. So regularly varying functions were. So, regularly varying functions were invented in the 1930s, and they seem to be used in particular in probability. And well, here they turn out to be a natural notion. Another notion that I need is that of a tangent measure at a point. So, this originates from geometric measure theory. If you have a measure mu, you are interested in its local behavior at c, and one way to kind of express And one way to kind of express that local behavior is to kind of take some sequence of epsilon n's and to study μ of c plus a epsilon n, b epsilon n. So you're centering at c and you're scaling by epsilon n. And then you multiply that by cn to make it not just vanish. And you look at limits of that as n goes to infinity. So if you have so You have so if you can find some epsilon n's going to zero and some Cn such that mu n goes to mu, then you say nu is a tangent measure at the point C. So there might be multiple tangent measures. There are going to be multiple. In fact, if nu is a tangent measure, then c times nu will always be a tangent. It's a completely different. But there could be a completely different, exactly. And so in particular, and it's very easy to actually construct this if you just kind of modulate it if you This, if you just kind of modulate it in some kind of geometric progression, you take one and zero as a rate or something like this. Yes? And so you can denote the set of all tangent measures at c by tan of mu xi. And this is always a cone and not always a one-dimensional. But if it is one-dimensional, we say the tangent measure is unique. Really unique up to multiple, right? Up to a multiplicative constant. But one says that this is a tangent. One says that this is the tangent measure, is unique in this case. Okay, so then we have a statement about bulk universality with regularly varying scaling, which uses these two pieces of terminology. So one is that there exists a regularly varying function g such that mu of c plus minus epsilon behaves as g of epsilon. Right? So before, this would have been just a constant times epsilon. This would have been just a constant times epsilon. Now it's a regularly variant function. That's equivalent to Lebesgue measure being the unique tangent measure at C, and it's equivalent to having a bulk universality limit with a regularly varying scaling as a function of KL. So this generalizes the previous, and you can see how this version of the result is not tied with A C. tied with AC spectrum because if you just think of g of epsilon being maybe something like epsilon log epsilon or over log epsilon but you get the point if it's not if it's not you know if it's not precisely epsilon here it's not going to correspond exactly to kind of differentiation with respect to Lebesgue measure so it's not going to correspond to AC spectrum and so in particular this result does include Breuer's Groyer's example, Groyer's class of examples, and so it includes all previously known cases. Okay. Last comment about does it include more explicit examples? Not more explicit examples. It is interesting to look at measures which are so there. Okay, so there are these measures we have not really Measures, we have not really investigated this yet sufficiently, but there are measures that are uniformly, locally uniform, in the sense that they precisely will everywhere have some kind of scaling, but that can be singular continuous. So separately from spectral theory, people have studied measures that have Lebesgue measure as the unique tangent measure at every point, but are singular continuous. And so So but we haven't really explored how this relates to any. But Boyer proves three in his examples and one or two weren't known and can now be write for his veterans. Sorry, that one or two. So this statement one was that known and Boyer said no. I, you know, so there's, so when it comes to sparse Jacobi matrices, I am not So I suspect that this was known, but I'm not aware of anywhere where this is in. It's a bit stronger than what was known, right? So basically, we knew it was of constant spectral dimensions than the spectrum that was known, but this is far away. So whereas examples are really your examples? You said that. Right, but it looks like in this case, for example, continuous motion. Is uh for simple continuous measures of dimension should still be large. Yes, yes, yes. So, in fact, so precisely, if you have bulk universality with regularly varying scaling on some set A, then mu is one-dimensional. This is now an easy consequence of the previous because you have scaling, you have your scaling is of with index one. And so this still is roughly an epsilon. So the prime example is this sparse potential. Yes. And David was asking if there is another item. No, of course not we can make construct measures. I'd be very curious to hear about other explicit examples, yes. Yes. So H is the aspect inverse of G. What's the meaning of it? Oh, it just because right, sorry, yes. So the meaning of this is just that G is regularly varying at zero because you write this with epsilon. So the one over just switches. So Kl of C goes to infinity, K L of C goes to infinity. So H is regularly varying at infinity, whereas G is regularly varying at zero. Regularly varying at zero. And that doesn't really go with this asymptotic inverse terminology. Here, x should go to infinity or to zero. They should both be at the same endpoint. So this one over is really just fixing up that. We probably could have written this, you know, we could have written this with like one over r and r going to infinity, and we would have looked a little more out there. Thank you. Okay, let me just quickly say. Quickly say what happens beyond the sine kernel. So, the sine kernel asymptotics has been the most studied, but there's a great body of work with other kernels, both in orthogonal polynomials and outside. I'm not going to review all of this, but if you have some other, but if you're interested in convergence to some other kernel, it corresponds to different local properties of the measure μ. But of course, previous results on this. But of course, previous results on this were not. I can finish in a minute. Just, yes, thank you. So, previous results on that were not purely local, but Quilausvan-Lessen had a result with basically a weight that goes as a power law approaching a point, and then the limiting kernel given by Bessel functions. There's a step-like family of examples by Fouchia, Moreno, Martinez-Finkelstein, and Souza. Soza. And there's also a very general result of Danka, which again uses philototic regularity, again a global condition, but again some kind of power law approach of the weight at the point, and again gets Bessel functions. And what I want to say is that these are situations where the unique tangent measure is no longer a Lebesgue measure. These are situations where locally your measure doesn't look like a Lebesgue measure, but it looks like something of this type. Of this type. Looks like a power law on one side and on the other side, at least one of these sigma plus minus should be strictly positive. And in fact, these are the only possible, if there is a unique tangent measure at a point, then that unique tangent measure must be of this form, or the arc delta, which I'm going to find. It's just kind of an outlier here. And then there's a general theorem that includes all these. So regularly scary, regularly varying with certain index positive and unique tangent measure being some other measure that I just wrote down, and the kernel being some kernel corresponding to a homogeneous Debranch space, which includes the special cases, Bessel kernels, and these hypergeometric kernels written down before. And so this really gives. And so this really is still based on a new homeomorphism between now power-bounded measures because your sigma plus mine, because now your tangent measure is no longer Poisson finite. It's just power bounded. And so it really relies on a different statement and a different homeomorphism. And so that's really it. Thank you. So are there any questions for Robot? First I want to say they're interested in debug. I want to ask whether this argument can be used for caching the site. Yes, yes, precisely. So this is, so they can be used. So here, at least one of these should be non-zero. Otherwise, you have, otherwise, it really just means you're looking at the Otherwise, it really just means you're looking at the wrong scaling. But it's absolutely true. Sigma minus could be zero, or sigma plus could be zero, right? So this theorem says you can scale by some regularly varying scaling g, so that mu from the left and mu from the right scale with that, with some sigma minus, sigma plus, which are constants, and at least one of those should be non-zero. But the case where sigma minus is zero is included here. So yes, so edge universality is. So, yes, so edge universality is included. Yeah, the kernel will be, in that case, a Bessel kernel. The kernel will be a Bessel kernel if sigma minus is 0, or sigma plus is 0, or sigma minus equals sigma plus. Otherwise, it will be some hypergeometric curve. I do have a question, uh, although it might be a silly question. Although it might be a silly question. At some point, early on, you mentioned some results that worked as long as you could for systems that you could embed into a canonical system. So is there something that you can say just about canonical systems or do you need some additional structure? So no, so all this could have absolutely been formulated as a result about I have a canonical system, I write down kernels. A canonical system, I write down kernels for that canonical system, and I do some rescaling there. And I want to know how, and I want to know how the kernels of the canonical system behave locally. So, in fact, that is what's happening after the float. But the reason the talk is formulated this way in the paper is to tie in with all the previous literature. But, yes, absolutely, the result is in fact just the result about universality limits for canonical. Universality limits for canonical systems. Yes. This is a big definitely a single question. So what's the open reaction? Oh. Well, an open question would be this. So. So you have already a very general result. Yeah. So what do you want to know after that? So the theme so far has been that the more we try to extend this to This to kind of viewing this through canonical systems, the more general the canonical systems we have to study. And so, one, okay, so sorry, let me say it this way. So, bulk universality is studied a lot in random matrix theory, and one setting for that would be random matrix ensembles, which are Which have a unitary invariance, right? So, which are given in terms of like e to the minus trace of some function of the matrix. When those universality limits are, so those can be reduced to a statement about orthogonal polynomials and Christoffel-Derboux kernels, but then they are Christoffeld-Derboux kernels of what's called sometimes varying measure limits because you're not no longer. Measure limits because you're not no longer interested in the scaling behavior of Kn for measure μ. There's naturally this extra n parameter that appears explicitly. And so you have a really like a sequence of measures mu n. So you're interested in the scaling behavior of Kn for measure mu n. And so that is not out of reach with these methods because they're based on homeomorphisms. And so if you can understand, if you can work with those, you know. Well enough, then you can obtain something. But so far, the results we have for variant measures are not really in a generality that we'd like. So that's one. Is there any hope to obtain something for silver than usual? I think the I so um so um So well I think I think really one so I think it's really I mean in some sense Breuer obtains this. I don't think there would be I mean okay there wouldn't be anything general in terms of singular continuous spectrum implies something because singular continuous spectrum can just be very irregular. So we need this kind of we need unique tangent measures. So we need certain kind of finer Kind of finer scaling properties of the unique tangent measures seems like a good condition. So, this seems like a good condition. So, certainly be very curious to see more examples where this can be controlled, where the spectral measures of certain operators perhaps are controlled enough that one has this kind of scaling behavior once. So, this can be an open problem. But it's certainly not. But it's certainly not, I think this would be more like another result that feeds into this theorem rather than a part of our work. But this theorem, it could be applied. Yes, exactly. So now, so this most general, so I stated this in progressively greater generality. This potentially could be applied. Looked at these sparse examples. So, well, I mean, in some sense, the sparse example is already known, but ah, but right, but like one can, so this is true. So, for example, Breuer's result requires a very sparse potential. So, the position of the nth bump is placed at some. Which forces I mentioned more? Yes. And no, so for example, it's open whether what happens for an arbitrary. Whether what happens for an arbitrary sparse Jacobi matrix, right? Like this idea. Or just in line of so we have this example with this last exact causal damage, which probably seems almost like this anti-measure store. Yeah, it seems related. It seems related. I don't know of anything that exactly ties in, but we also haven't looked at that. We're currently working on finishing this preponderance. So and then I'll but this would be very interesting and uh we'll pick up in ten minutes at the top of the hour with our uh next speaker. Uh Next speaker is Thomas Fexbury.
