Yurikish is speaking to us about first bioregular graphs and finite geometries. Thank you, Marianne. My talk will be divided into two parts because the main organizer asked me that it would be useful to give a short introduction to projective geometries and generalized polygons. In most of the previous talks, these structures. Course, these factors were mentioned several times. And I also think that it's very useful to know some basic things about their geometric properties because it helps of very often helps for constructing graphs and solving problems coming from graph theory. So let's start with this short introduction. So this is the axiomatic definition of a. This is the axiomatic definition of a general polygon. We start with point-line incidence geometry, which is triple consisting of two sets, and then incidence relation. The elements of the first set is called points, the elements of the second is lines, and there is a relation on equals L. In this structure, you can define chains. A chain is a set of compared incidence elements, and this And they say that the length of this chain starting at x0 and ends at xh is h. So remember that the chain of length h consists of h plus 1 atoms. And our structure is a generalized n1. It will satisfy the following axioms. The first one, if you pick up any two elements from the set of the union of the points and the lines, then their distance. Points and the lines, then their distance is at most n. If the distance is less than n, strictly less than n, then uniquely exists the chain joining x and y. And for all x, there exists y side that distance that exactly. And we don't like maybe a structure sense, we assume that each line is instrumental with at least three points and each point is instant at least three lines. First and sure question is that uh no the Uh no. The first theorem is about uh the formula and the properties. If we have a six generalized polygon, then each one is instant in the same number of points, and each point is instant in the same number of lines. And if these numbers are S plus one and T plus one respectively, then the order is S T. Remember, if the order is S T, then these numbers are S plus one and T plus one. The reason is that if we are working in projective geometries of order. Projective geometries of order q, then these numbers are q plus 1. What can we say about the existence of the general polygons? Famous theorem of fade in Hilma scales that finite C generite n-bons exist if and only if n is 2, 3, 4, 6, 4, 8. So it's a very limited number. Let's go through these numbers. First, if If I should mention the radiograph, for instance, we have such a structure. If you have pointed using an algeometry, then there is a natural variation with bipartisan graphs. So bipartisan sets correspond to the points and lines, and there is an edge joining two vertices if only if the corresponding point is on the line. And it's an easy observation that the Lagrangian graph of the generalized N1 is a connected bipartisan graph of diameter n and goes to n. It's very important. And yours to n. It's very important that endbonds diameter n and yours to n. Here is a hand-made figure of the Radiograph. This is the final plane, and it's the Lady Graph that is the equal graph with 14 bytes. Let's go through on the small values. When n equals 2, the structure is trivial to the regression bipartite. When n equals 3, then we get. When n equals 3, then we get the projective planes. And when n equals 4, then we get the generalized quadrangles. So I would like to say some words about these generalized quadrangles because I hope that everybody knows something about the projecting planes. What can we say about the generalized quadrangles? Here is an example. This is the smallest thick generalized quadrangle. Its order is 2, 2. Remember that this means that there are three points on each line, and there are three lines. On each line, and there are three lines for each point, and all together we have 15 points and 15 lines. Robert said that projective geometry is algebra. Of course, it's not true. Projective geometry is much more and much more beautiful than algebra. But this is my gift, Robert. And I would like to define. So, and I would like to define the project, the n-dimensional projective geometry. I will give you the algebraic definition because the algebraic definition is much simpler than the original, a more beautiful geometric definition. So, how can we imagine a projective n-dimensional projective geometry? We take n plus 1-dimensional vector space over a field. For me, a field is a commutative field, and the n-dimensional projective space is nothing else than the geometrical scale-dimensional subspace is the k-pass and dimensional subs. Spaces are the papers and dimensional subspaces of the underlying vector space. So we have points, lines, k-dimensional subspace up to hyperplanes, and we can coordinate these by homogeneous coordinates, blue coordinates for the lines, current coordinates for the planes, and also homogeneous coordinates for the hyperplanes. And the point hyperplanes in that situation can be expressed in a very simple way, namely the dot product of the corresponding coordinate vectors equals CO. equals zero. In projective geometry, very important thing is the principle of duality. If you have a projective space, then we can define this dual space. The dual space is nothing else. Then the space was k-dimensional subspaces are the n minus k-minimal subspaces of the original space. At the first glance, it's a bit strange that the dual of a k-space is an n minus k minus one-dimensional subspace, but remember that a k-dimensional project. Remember that a k-dimensional projective subspace is a k-plus one-dimensional vector subspace in an n-plus one-dimensional vector space. And in the vector space duality, this dual is an n plus one minus k minus one, that is n minus k vector space dimensional subspace, and projective dimension will be n minus k minus one. And if we have this dual space, if we map from the principle of duality, so if you have a theorem stated in terms of subspaces and the incidence. Stated in terms of subspaces and incidence, then ULCRM is also true. The basic communicator properties can be listed for finite projective spaces. Previously, I wrote PG and K, where K stands for the field. If I write PG and Q, then Q stands for the finite field of Q elements. And this Q nominal coefficient gives us the number of points and And number of high-dimensional subspaces, and the number of given di-dimensional subspaces through a given another dimensional subspace. These are all Reynolds numbers. In particular, in a screen space, we have qq plus q squared plus q plus one point, the same number of planes. The number of lines is q squared plus q plus one times u squared plus one, and we also know the number of lines through a point, the nine number of planes through a fifth point and planes. Planes through a feature plane and planes through adding online. An important notion is the coordination. If you have two, not necessarily distinct projective spaces, then a coordination is nothing else than a bijection. It holds that any three points of the first space are collinear if and only if their image are collinear in the separate space. It will be used that if you have a collinear front, then it maps the UK dimensional subspace of the first. And it maps on the kidding of a subspace on the first space, interk diagnosed on the second space. Using the vector space structure, it's easy to give some examples of coordinations. The simplest one is the linear transformation. If we have a non-singular matrix and plus one times n plus one non-singular matrix, then the mapping x maps x times a. X times A, it's obviously a coordination. Maybe the lack of time goes fast. In our transformations, because another important notion is the polarity. Remember that the coordination was defined from a space to another space. So we can do it: take our space and take the dual space and consider a coordination from the space to the dual space. Space. If we consider such a coordination, then it could happen that if we pick up a point from the first place, it goes to a point of the dual space, but the point of the dual space is hyperplane in the first place. And hyperplanes of the first place are also hyperplanes of the dual space, but the hyperplanes of the dual are points of the original. So it would happen that if we apply a so-called correlation twice, then we get. Twice, then we get back the point itself. And if it happens for all the points of the space, then we get the polarities. And these polarities are very important when we are considering the general quadrangles. Because using the so-called self-conjugate points and hyper planes and lines and other k-dimensional subspaces, we can give examples. Give examples of polarities. There is a complete list of polarities. There are three basic types of them. The first is the so-called ordinary polarity. In this case, the polarity is defined by multiplying by an n plus one times n plus one non-singular symmetric matrix. The important thing is that the matrix is symmetric. If you multiply by a symmetric matrix and take And take the coordination from the space to the dual space, then we get an ordinary polarity. And the self-conjugate points of the ordinary polarity form a quadric, having equation x times a times x transpose equals zero, where remember that x is a non-singular symmetric matrix. In this representation, we assume that the characteristic of the base group is not two, but it's not very important. That's very important. Another type of polarity is a so-called null polarity when we take an m plus one times m plus one anti-symmetric matrix and again apply this x goes to x times a. In this case, x, if you apply it twice, we get that x goes to minus x. Hence, this polarity exists if and only design mechanism is old. is odd. And if, for example, if the smallest odd dimension m equals 3, then the self-conjugate lines form some interesting structure we will see within two minutes. And the third type of polarities are the so-called Hermitian polarities. When we take a Hermitian matrix, Hermione matrix means that A sigma equals A A sigma equals A transpose. And in this case, self-conjugate points satisfy this equation x times A times X to the Q transpose equals zero. And this is the equation of the focal Hermitian curve in the planar case and Hermitian variety in higher dimensions. And it's using the fundamental theorem of projective geometry, one can show that there are no more types of polarities, so there are only these. Types of polarities. So there are only these three types of polarities. And each of these types, there are generalized quadrangles associated with these polarities. For generalized quadrangles, so these are generalized polygons for n equals 4. There is another definition, normal definition, now it's state as a theorem. So if you have a generalized quadrangle, six generalized quadriangle of order S T, then the total number of points and the total number of lines. Number of points and the total number of lines can be calculated easily. And the most important property is that if you have a non-incident point line pair, then you need another point-line pair, such that the first point is incident with the second line, second-line incident with the second point, and the second point is incident with the first line. And using the polarities and these properties of generalized quadrangles, we can give a short list of the topological classical. This particular so-called classical genite quantum, there are three of them. The first one is WQ. This is nothing else than take a three-dimensional protective space and take a multi-party and the points of the three space and the self-conjugate lines of the null polarity in the inherited incidence for the generalized quadrangle of order q. So this means that when q is a power of a prime, then you always have generalized quadrangle of order q. generalized quadrangle of order q and you'll see again this figure because this generalized quadrangle is nothing else than w q so this means that this writing from a three line having a projective space over a liquid of two elements it has 15 points and in this mood polarity there are 15 self-conjugate lines we get this unique structure another class of the classical generalized quadrangles Of the classical generalized quadrangles come from ordinary polarities. If we have an ordinary polarity and n equals 3, 4, or 5, and we take the so-called hyperbolic quadratures, then we get 10 right quadrangles in these orders, t equals 1, that's this bilateral structure, t equals 2 or t equals 2 square. So here s and t are the same. Here, S and P are the same, but in the five-time micronutrient case, P is much greater than Q. Of course, if you have a generalized quadrangle, then QL is also a generalized quadrangle. So if you have a quadrangle with order S equals Q and T equals Q squared, then we also have a quadrangle S equals Q squared and T equals Q. And the third type of classical increase comes from Hermitian varieties. When the dimension is three or four, then the point of the Hermitian variable. 4, then the points of the Hermitian variety and the lines contained in the Hermitian variety or the general quadrangle, whether Q squared and Q or Q square and Q. So these are the classical GQs. And it's not mentioned in the slides, but I should say that there are only one more possible pair of parameters where we know the existence of generalized paradigms that it's q minus one, q plus one, where q is a power of a prime idea. Where q is a four-value of a prime idea. So again, we have a very limited number of possible parameters for generalized quadrants. For higher end, in the case of generalized hexagons, we also can find examples coming from polarities, namely from an ordinary polarity in a six-dimensional space, where the field of few elements, the self-conjugate points, and some lines, not all lines, on the surface form. Surface for general taxonomy. So, this was the introduction to project if you're not sure. I think that I used 20 minutes or only 15. You have 25 in total, and then you still have 10. 10. Okay. So, these are the ordinal pages, as Robert mentioned, so we can go through the ordinal pages very quickly. We can go through the original kg very fast kg cage wore bound overbound again kg graphic remover graphic graphics are removed this is a cage it's not a handmade one it's a copied one and this is I learned the word 20 minutes ago so this is a BB cage so how can we DB gate. So, how can we define the dB gate? We have a bipartite biregular graph, even girls, having degrees at M and then and satisfy the additional properties that the vertices have seen by partition at the same degree. And M and G, bipartite biregular, bipartite biregular, and n g graph of minimum order. For shortly, this will be called the GKH. What can we say about this? What can we say about this? Digital case was it was also mentioned by Fabriada that we know the Moorbound. I will call it bi-moorbound. So this is a bipartite Moorbound. And it was proved by Philippos, Kira, Sugara, and Robert. This is nothing else than the counting the vertices of the moor tree, but there are several cases. cases so I wrote here only the C plus version when m plus one and n plus one are the orders now because remember that if we have a generalized polygon of order mn then the Navy graph has orders m plus one and n plus one so in some sense it's the geometric point of view is more natural to write the parameters m plus one and m plus one and the other important thing is that the formula is much simpler when I use m plus one Much simpler. When I use m plus one and m plus one otherwise, I should write m minus one, n minus one, and so on. So this is the Moore bound in this bi-moor bound usually denoted by capital B in the parameters, and I gave it only when R equal. Whereas here, the exponent is I minus 1 over 2, or something like that. And an important observation. An important observation that the Lady graph of the generalized argon of order Mn is exactly as many vertices as this one, and it is a theorem that a BBK is even R is different only if we have a generalized R1 of order Mn. An important property of these biomolecrafts are that each edge of them is containing the same number of graphs. Is containing the same number of girl cycles. And this led, we can calculate these numbers, and this led to the natural definition of edge-girl cycular graphs. That's given by Provert and me five years ago. So, if we have a regular graph of order D11 CQ1 verse G, then it is edge verse regular with any edge of comma. I assume exactly. Come on. I assume exactly Lamberger cycles. And as I mentioned, these overgraphs are edge graphs for the Guard graphs. Here is a small example. Thanks to Robert again. You made this figurizing. I remember you. It was five years ago. Yeah. Later on, photography can be valid. Waterfrink and Vitaly gave a further generalization of this edge-girls regularity. They call it about edge, and said that consider a graph, simple, connected, finite, for each edge, the number of curve cycles containing that edge. For a vertex, you can assign a set of, a k-element set, type that E1, E1 denotes or E1 equals and E1, E2, NE2, and so on. And this non-decreasing sequence is called the signature of the So for each vertex we have its signature and the graph is irregular and has the same length. And we say that the graph is worse regular if all of its vertices have the same signature. Later on, we have COVID. Uh, instead of COVID, we further generalize this notation and introduce the bired biologized case, namely the signature, you don't need to say bipartition, constant. So we know, of course, that the signatures of the two bipartitions are different ones, but given by partition, the signature of all the. Given by partition, the signature of all vertices are the same. And there were some inequalities about the largest value of the signature. And it's very similar to the bound that we have seen on the number of what happens on the number of Earth cycles containing a given edge in the Moor graph. So it's natural that these are very close, connect, closely connected, related to the Moore graphs. And if you have an upper bound and a graph parameter, then it's natural to ask what happens if we are close to that upper bound. These are so-called stability type results. And we proved some stability results with FEFCO and TAMAF. Namely, we proved that if the Namely, we proved that if the largest element of the signature is close to the upper bound, close means that epsilon is smaller than k minus 1, then epsilon must be 0. And if epsilon is 0, then we get that incidental graph of the finite generalized B1 of this order graph. And we were able to do this example showing that these bounds are tight, in some cases, escape now. I skip now and we prove this similar result for those bilateral graphs and we were also able to characterize the extremal cases as unfortunately only in the case when the girls is divisible by four. So if the girls is congruent to two mod four and the situation is much more complicated, we have some results. In that case also, we were able to characterize air fine planes. If you're able to characterize the affine planes, controversies congruent to two uh four. These are fine planes can be considered, so this is the characterization, these are fine affine planes, can be considered Rtteiner systems, so it has to be topics mentioned by Magniela, and we prove something about the Rtainer systems, namely, we proved that. That the existence of a 2K refiner system is the existence of a bipartite biregular k B minus 1 over K minus 16K and vice versa. And some more results also about biregular cages. So these are cages, biregular cages of 3 and 6, and this size is 2 plus 2 and 2 plus 2 times. And it's nothing else than the incident graph for final system on 2n plus 3 points, one point, and all the triples through that point are deleted. It's very similar to product and its quarter's construction. Some more results about bipartite biregular cages. It's a beautiful construction for Q plus 1, 8 biregular. 8 by regular cages. This order is 2 times q plus 1 times q minus 1, q square minus 1. And in particular, for q equals 3, we proved that this is a cage. So in this case, it has 56 vertices, and this is a 3 quarter cage. In this case, the bi-mull bound gives us 49. So this is the next natural graph, and we prove that this is a cage. prove that this is a cage. And I think that my time is almost over. So if you are interested in a more detailed introduction to these objects, I can suggest you a very good book. Thanks for your attention.
