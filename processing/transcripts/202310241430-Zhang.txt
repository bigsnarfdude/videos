So, I'll talk about this boundary Lagrangian formalism or integrable quotes equation. So, this formalism or the content is more close to the original development of this Lagonde modiform. This means that you have this Lagondian formalism for this. This integrable integrable variational principle for Gold graph system for 3D consistent system. So the plan of the talk, so I will first give a background, which is integral growth systems. So various speakers have mentioned this system previously, but I will also talk about it and emphasize some. Talk about it and emphasize some important aspects of this system. And then I will introduce this GOD graph system with integrable boundary. So that's kind of a new feature for this GOAT graph system. And also, I'll talk about certain properties of this system. And in the third part, I will give this Lagrangian formalism for. Lagrangian formalism for this integrable system with the boundary, and in the end, some perspectives. So, first, I will give a very basic review on why we have integral systems on discrete integral system on graphs on a quadrilateral. So, the basic model is KDV equation. So, when you have the double dressing transformation and you have this I can't see it's neither. So you have this difference, difference, differential difference equation, and you have a shift which is donated by this tilde, which is associated with a parameter alpha. And when you do it in two direction, well, you can end and taking account of this compatibility condition, and you can end up with two equations. And you can end up with two equations, two good equations, which named according to ABS classification, named as H1 and H2. So that's what's classical. And the key idea is that you have this double back home transformation, and you have this bionic commutativity property. And here I just create this two direction, but ideally, you can create in any direction which will. Direction which will give us its multi-dimensional consistency property. So, here is a very simple equation, which is the H1 equation or discrete potential KD equation. This equation is important. This form is quite simple, but it's important. For instance, you have this property that if you compute this limit of this continuum limit of this equation, you will recover the whole hierarchy of the KD equation. So, one single discrete equation contains basically. Contains basically the whole information of a continuous hierarchy. And of course, we can introduce more directions, not only in these two directions. So the notion here is the three-dimensional consistency, which basically means that on a cube, you can put on each phase, you have an equation and you have an over-determined system. Overall, over-determined system, but the consistency means that when you have an initial value problem, you have a well, you have the initial data here, and the final results remain the same. So this picture is kind of simple, and we will consider this three-dimensional consistency as a defining criterion for discrete interoperability in our setting. And this picture is actually the natural discrete analog of the. A natural discrete analog of the infinite committing flows for integral hierarchy, hierarchy of integral PDEs. And there's a very natural derivation of discrete zero covati conditions based on this 3D dimensional consistency. That's the basic things. And you can, of course, you can create in higher dimensions. So that's an instance where you have this four-dimensional consistency on a hyper Q. Okay, so. Okay, so the generalization is actually so we have the Gauti equation naturally can define on this Z2 graph. The generalization is to define on an arbitrary graph composed of quadrilaterals. So this called this Good graph. So basically this Good graph can be easily obtained when you do this kind of Good graph discretization. So you have the black dots at The you have the black dot as the original graph, and then you have the white dot as a dual graph. And when you have the black and the white dots, you just connect this adjacent black dot with the white dots, and you end up with a good graph. So, this is also very simple construction. So, when you have an arbitrary graph, you do the good graph disparitization, you end up with a good graph, and together with this three-dimensional. And together with this three-dimensional consistency, this gives the notion of integral graph systems. So, some important results in this direction is the classification result done by Adobe Bobenko series and this Lagrangian multiform theory or Polivery Lagrangian theory. And this Goldwarf system, this 3D consistent equations, they are also in connection to discrete complex. Also, in connection to discrete complex analytic functions, discrete complex analytic functions and discrete Riemann surface theory. Right. Here is the list of equations that I will barely consider. So in the classification, so the classification was based on some technique in projective multivariate polynomials. There are not many equations, there are only There are not many equations. There are only nine equations here. There are only H1 to H3, so three equations, which are the basic model and Q1 to Q4, another four equations important. Some of these equations are new. For instance, we have this H3, which have a constant delta term appearing, and also certain equations with a delta term. So with this delta term, this equation was kind of. Delta term, this equation was kind of new, and this top equation is discrete analog of the three-check-novikov equation. This form written in terms of this Jacobi functions due to its range. Right. Okay, so there's one aspect in connection to the discrete analytic functions is we have the simple Q0 model. Q0 model, which is basically the cross ratio, right? So if you consider this equation, it is 3D consistent. And now, if you think you have a map Z from whatever system, but now we just consider Z2 system, and you map to a new system, a new field. So this is the image of your map Z. And if they satisfy. If they satisfy this, this called the lunar decomposition. So basically, you have two cycles that intersect with the black dots, while the white dots are the center of the two cycles. And by some easy computations, very elementary computations in context, then you can show that the cross ratio of the image of this map will equals to the exponential of this angle. So that is a quite promising. That is a quite promising feature. Means that once you have this cross-ratio, which is PGL2 or SL2 environment, right? So we have the, if we add a new PGL2 on this cross-ratial system, we have the angle which is preserved. So we have this cross-racial preserving map, which can be seen as this discrete holomorphic mapping. So here you have an example, see the you have a Deluna. Um, you have a Deluna decomposition. So, um, each each circle have a have a center which is belong to the, for instance, white dot and the intersection of the black dot. And you map, you add a collective PGL2 duction, you will map this surface to this surface. So in other words, we have an angle preserving map, which is the key feature. map which is the key feature of the conformal mapping that's why we have this cost ratio which presents as a discrete analytic function so um the lagrangian formalist for this uh equation that was explained by frank at the beginning so i will give a down to the earth uh very elementary um description of this lagrangian formal list so you have this consider the idea Have this consider the ids equation, so you have an equation in this form. So now your x executive x part x p the hearts are just vertices of this square, this quadrilateral, and you also have these parameters, alpha and beta sitting on the edge. So this equation admits three-like representation means that you have another function phi, phi equals psi, this phi are attached to this h. To this edge, and this phi attached to this edge, and you have the psi, which is the diagonal attached to diagonal. So, this tree-like form will help us to formulate very naturally formulate Lagrangian formalism for this Gaut graph system. So, now we just build this Lagrangian in terms of C, C, and V. Well, your C is kind of the primitive of your phi function. Of your phi function, right? So if I do the derivative with respect to x, I got phi. Again, I put for the other c, I got this phi. Again, and this v is the primitive of this psi. The graphically, it just means that if I the red part is the C and the V, so for a Lagrangian, I will call this C as kinetic part and V as the potential part. parts but if you do the derivative of uh c you will end up with uh leg phi which which gives you which is part of the equation and similarly if you do the derivative with respect to other points of this c you will end up with a phi which is also part of this equation and if you do the diagonal derivative will end up with psi which is the inverse implication of the previous Inverse computation of the previous use. So graphically, we have these things. So now this all the Lagrange equations, you put all this Lagrangian together on a given surface. So now we only consider this Z2 surface, which is the sum of all the Lagrangian. And the other Lagrange equations, which just means that the variation equals zero, will give you a derivative with your original Lagrangian with. With shifts with the back shift in two directions, so the sum of this term will be zero. So, graphically, it just means that if we have a Lagondian here, right, defined as this red part, that picture is the way how we define this, visualize this Lagrangian as a Lagrangian form, as a different form. So, you have an orientation, you have all these. So, you have the orientation, you have all this red part attached to this bot. And now, if you do the olal Lagrange equation, you have this L, which sitting on this plot, and you have the back shift in one direction and the back shift back shift in the other direction. So, when you derive, make the derivative with respect to the center, which is the black dot here, so exactly like what it's doing here. Exactly, like what it's doing here. So, what we end up, so you use the rules there, right? As this C C V, this potential functions that actually the primitive of this leg form. And you will end up at two leg forms. And means that if you do the set of Ola Lagon equation, this precise Ola Lagon equation will give you two copies of a both equation. So, that's a very So that's that's a very pictorial explanation of why it works. So this formalism for this particular model, this ids model, is based on the length representation. But in reality, the way to compute this C and V is highly non-trivial because you will have you are involved with elliptic integral picture and it's it's it's very complicated to compute with C and V. To compute the C and V. Okay, so the closure relation by Frank, the mistakes, but here must be plus. So you make not only the variation with respect to the field, but also variation with respect to surface. You want your all Lagrangians on the pop-up surface equal to equitable. So I got this equal zero. So you can assign the similar rules as what. Assign the similar rules as what I did previously. So, you assign this Lagrangian on this cube on each phase. I think Frank showed a similar picture in the first phase. So, you end up with this closure relation and you require it to be zero. And this closure relation, which is zero, can be actually reformulated thanks to another very interesting relation of the ABS equation. So basically, this Lagrangian, this Lagrangian form, if you attach on this part in this way, it's similar to this way, up to certain constants. So if you have this relation between these two ways to assign this Lagrangian, actually you can put this above assignment of the Lagrangian in this form. So you can basically see that this different These different arrows will cancel on the edge, and on the diagonals, you have the remaining Laguni in three different colors. And on these up Lagungians, you use these rules, right? You make this orientation of the Lagungian in another way. You will have this diagonal Lagrangian in three different colors equals the other way. So if you put on the planar graph, it's just this dark triangle relation. That triangle relation, which so what equation with this consideration with this construction of Lagrangian will give you solutions of the star triangle relation in this form. So basically you have a triangle and you pop up and you create a new point and these two Bagongians are saying. So I put kind of not completely equal, but this equality is after a certain function. Okay, so that's the story with the boat graph systems and treating instead of consistent system. So the boundary for goodwar systems comes from if you add a boundary in your description. So we have this arbitrary planar surface which consists of black dots with the ages. Thoughts with the edges, we have the dual graph which connected by this white thought. And when you do the graph, good graph disputization, so basically you connect this dual dots with the nearby black dot, you will end up with a good graph system. So as promised, on the bottom, you have this good graph system, and on the boundary, what is remaining are the triangle configurations. Kamgo configurations. We call this a photograph with a boundary. And you can the next thing is to add equations on this system. So if we have equations on the good graph, we take the system equations. So the remaining things are this triangle equation, you have an equation defined on a triangle. So the board line represents the boundary. It's an equation. boundary uh it's an equation defined on on tree on the on the triangle and possibly also on the also on the on the parameter and we call this triangle a discrete discrete analog of the boundary conditions uh in in in in the secret of the boundary condition for continuous PDE simple right okay so here is an example of a very simple initial boundary value problem Initial boundary value problem on the photograph with two boundaries on the screen. So, your initial condition are the black dots. So, this black dot don't have the same meaning as what I had previously. They only denote, they only means the initial data. So, now you can propagate if your equation are well formulated. So, the next thing is to look at what kind of triangle equations we are. What kind of triangle equations will keep the integrability of your system? So, the integrity of this triangle equation is formulated as a consistency on this object, which is half of a rhombic hedon, which means that you have a 12-phase object. So, each phase is the rhombi. Each face is the rhombic, it's rhombic. And so, why this object this object is actually in connection to the reflection equation that was introduced previously by Neva-son. And when you have the consistency on this object, it really means that when you have an initial value problem, so let's take x, u, and y, and you have three ways to compute this z bar. So, if they remain the same. So if they remain the same, the result remains the same, they are consistent. You can project this object to a planner graph. So that's the planner representation of this object. You have the four boundary conditions and the four broad equations. They should be consistent. And we call this boundary consistency. No data general boundary consistency because we also require that the parameters That the parameters, when they are sitting on the two edges of the boundary equation, they are connected by a revolution particular. So that's what I said. So this object is half of Long Beach Hotakahego. So some advances in this direction for graph with system. For graph with systems. So we actually obtained a very efficient method to classify boundary triangle equations, the boundary equations that satisfy the boundary consistency in the context of ABS classification. And there also, we also have other integral properties like relaxed representation, the scattering transform scheme, what integral problem. So what I will focus So, what I will focus in the rest of the talk is to set up a Lagrangian formalism for this triangle equation. So, you have a graph system with a boundary and you want these boundary equations that are integral. And we want to set up this Lagrangian theory for this system and give the set of all the Lagrange equations involving this Karen equation, like what system, and also a systematic way to derive this. Way to derive this, um, what we will introduce as the boundary Lagrangian, which of Lagrangian represents this tangle equation and possibly an integrable variational principle involving boundaries here. So, this work is based on serious papers from Artwin's interpretation, which presents this, which will contain these Lagrangian formalities. Okay, so um. Okay, so the restriction on this good equation, so we give a definition of what we will call a boundary equation, which is precisely this relation involving the three vortices, x, u, and y. So the requirement is that this equation, so the bone line is represents the boundary. So we require that this equation is a bilinear with respect to this x and y. To this x and the y, so in that sense, if you have an x u as the initial data on your triangle, you can uniquely solve your y. And we also want this expression, this we will call it little q as a polynomial. It's a multivariable polynomial, so it's going to be depends on this x u y as a polynomial and a bin linear with respect to x and y. And there are also certain, yeah. Yeah, only it's not we only have this, we also have this symmetry, meaning that if we flip this triangle, we end up with the same equation as a parity. One of the key property is that you have a consistency with this capital Q and this little Q, meaning that if you have this little Q and you combine them together. You combine them together on a capital Q, you have a companion equation which is called P. So, in other words, you have this triangle equation P and this triangle equation Q and this triangle equation P and the capital Q, they sitting consistently together on a single quad. And the classification idea is really to cut this. Cut this rhombic dotted into half, and I will skip that. So, here is classification results. I present one class. So, there are three classes of integral boundary equations. I represent one class. So, to understand this relations, you have a P which connects to this x, y. So, this is your single quote, which will connect this x, y. So, this p will only involve x, y. only involve xy and in xy there and you can represent this y as a function of x uniquely right and your q will be denoted denoted by this v x u x v in this form so basically you you forward this square by matching this y and x and we'll represent as a q by taking this y as fx and the beta as a sigma alpha. And the beta as a sigma alpha. So here I forgot to mention that your beta is related to alpha via evolution, which is minus alpha plus arbitrary constant mu. Right. And the important construction for this class is that you will have a two-legged form for this little Q means that this arrow, this arrow, which is the leg of the capital Q equation, remains the same here, but this Poseidon. But your this psi will fault into a chi here by using this function. This should be fx and then this fx, right? Okay. And you have this two-legged representation of this little q, and our construction of the Lagrangian boundary Lagrangian will rely on this representation, like what we did for the quote-quote equation. And the boundary Lagrangian, what we proposed is. What we proposed is form depends on this u and x, so one on one side, and this u and v, the h connect u and v as the boundary. So it will represent in this form. So you have a c which is the same c as the primitive of the light representation, and you have a capital H. So the rules is you have the derivative of C, which will be your phi, the light representation. Your phi, the leg representation of your equation. And if you have the derivative of h, which will correspond to your chi, right? And so now you have this representation and the set of all the Lagrange equation, you can just put the Lagrangians on this simple local graph with a boundary, and you do the variation. For instance, if you do the variation, you will end up with. Variation: You end up with three different configurations. This line was the last picture, it was missing, but it's nothing, it's the same as for the God equation. And for this one, if I do the derivative with respect to x0, I will go back to q0 because it's just using the rule of the graphics, you'll go back to the q0. But for this configuration, if you make the derivative with respect to Make the derivative with respect to the middle point, this one, you will end up with a q little q plus capital q. Well, if you mod this capital q, you will end up with this little q. And all these rules will be valid because of this late representation of your little q. How many minutes are I? Run off. Run off. Okay, let's you have three slides. So now you have this boundary closure, which means that on the boundary, you can pop up a surface like this one, and you have the closure, which means that your log engine assign on this pop-up surface is going to be zero. And this can also be easily proved using the leg representation of this quad equation and triangle equation. Triangle equation. So yeah, I just make the graphic graphic move. So, what's in the end you need to prove is something like this, like this quad equation. So, and we can interpret this last piece, this line, this circle as a H equation as a potential signal of the point. So, you can integrate this last line actually as a move. Line actually as a move from this piece to this piece. So, this move is quite similar to the star triangle relation for Gaudi equation. So now you basically have a move from this piece and you split, you go to another shape, it's equivalent. Right, this is the last slide. So when you do the whole And when you do the whole configuration on the boundary consistency on this picture, and you will end up with a set of five Lagrange equations, and the claim is that only three of them are important and the two actually consequence of them. And if you require the closure, the set of all the Lagrange equations that is derived previously, when you're using the variation with respect to the dependent. The dependent variable is also a consequence of this configuration of this set of allological equations. So consequently, you have the bulk and the boundary equations. That's the end. So the perspective is a situation where you need a boundary. So please consider this kind of approach. Thank you very much.
