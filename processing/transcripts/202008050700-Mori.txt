First of all, I will show you the equation which we consider today. We consider the spreading patterns of this reaction diffusion system. In this system, these two terms, F and C, have a competition relationship. On the other hand, these two terms, F plus C, predator, and H is prey. Roughly speaking, we can say this system three-component competition predator prey system. Our goal is to determine the spreading patterns for various parameter ranges. This complexion predata play system is interesting not only in mathematical point of view, but also in archaeological point of view. This system describes the spread of early farming in neodric era. F is initial farmer, C. is initial farmer, C is combated farmer from hunter-gatherer, and H is a hunter-gatherer. Before going into the precise details, we will show you outline of my talk. My talk divided into three parts. First, I will introduce the archaeological background of Archaeological background of our problem. Second, I will show you our main results and the idea of the proof. Lastly, I will conclude with a summary and future work. Now, let me start to talk about the archaeological background of our problem. More than More than 11,000 years ago, all people in the world lived as hunter-gatherers. They were hunting wild animals, gathering fruits and eggs of birds in the forest. With the end of the Ice Age, the climatic conditions fundamentally changed in many regions of the world. Many regions of the world. Temperature changed, distribution of vegetation changed, distribution of animals changed. Then, new lifestyle, agriculture, occurred in several regions of the world and gradually spread all over the world. It is known that the origin of agriculture in Europe. The majority of agriculture in Europe is Middle East. That is, agriculture spread into Europe from the Middle East. In Europe, many early Neolithic sites have been dated by radiocarbon dating. Those archaeological data and regression analysis show that the spreading speed of The spreading speed of agriculture is approximately constant speed. Then, Amaman and Kavali-Sfott introduced Fischer-KPP equation to describe this constant speed spreading. They conjectured that the spreading may have been produced by damage diffusion, not by. not by cultural diffusion. Here, demic diffusion means the migration of farmers into new regions and migration of initial farmers spread the agriculture. On the other hand, cultural diffusion means cultural transmission, that is, hunter-gatherer learning agriculture from farmers. Farmers and converting to farmers. And farming techniques are passed from one local group to the next, and agriculture spread. Which played the principal role, demic or culture? Amama and Kavaris Fota suggested that both diffusions could be important. Be important. This has been a long subject among archaeologists. In 1996, Aoki Shidashigesada introduced a unifying model which is based on reaction diffusion system. Here, F is the initial farmer, pioneer of agriculture. Of agriculture. C is on. And first equation of the system represents migration of initial pharma. C is converted pharma from hunter-gatherer and H is hunter-gatherer. Second and third equation represents cultural transmission and corresponding. And correspond to cultural diffusion. By the way, in 2015, Fort obtained the detailed speed map of neural spreading, and he concluded which diffusion was dominant varies from region to region. However, However, this reoxygen diffusion system is not order-preserving, and it is difficult to study the spreading speed. So, Aokishida Sigesada conjectured the spreading speed is equal to the minimal traveling wave speed, and they studied the minimal traveling wave speed. And they And they observed the minimal traveling wave speed is this value by formal linearization argument. Their numerical simulation shows that the behavior of the solution can be categorized into four typical patterns. If the parameter small a greater than one plus s, then initial forma f is the spreading front here and here. This corresponds to damage diffusion. If small a smaller than one process, then Then, converted pharma leads the spreading front, and this corresponds to cultural diffusion. Furthermore, if small g here, small g is greater than or equal to 1, that is high rate of conversion from hunter-gatherer to farmer. Then, in this case, hunter-gatherer Hunter-gatherer completely converts to farmer here. If small g smaller than one, this means low rate of conversion from hunter-gatherer to farmer. In this case, hunter-gatherer remain and And the initial pharma eventually extinct. These observations were done by former analysis, not spreading speed, but minimal traveling wave speed. Spreading patterns were observed by numerical simulation. However, However, there was no mathematically rigorous analysis of spreading phenomena of this system, so we mathematically analyze the spreading ground of the system. Here is the sketch of our result. First, we consider the upper bound of the spreading speed of F plus C. speed of f plus c. This is a relatively easy part of our analysis. By constructing a comparison function, we get the upper bound. Second, we consider the lower bound of the spreading speed. This is the most difficult part of our analysis. We use the idea of a proof of the logarithmic phase drift. The logarithmic phase drift of feature KPP spreading front. Third, we consider the behavior of F. Lastly, we consider the behavior of the solution behind the spreading front in the case that low combustion rate theorem one is about upper bound of the spreading. Upper bound of the spreading front. Spreading speed of A. Spreading speed of F is not faster than two times of square root of A. And spreading speed of C is not faster than C star. This C star is the predicted. This system is the predicted minimal traveling wave speed by Aokishida Shigesada. Here is the idea of the proof. From the first equation, we see that f satisfies this linear inequality and we obtain the upper bound of the spreading speed of. Spreading speed of f. From system, if we put small h equal 1 minus h, then we see that f, c, and small h is a sub-solution of this of this cooperation linear system. And we can easily construct a comparison function and obtain the above. And obtain the upper bound of the spreading speed of C. This completes the proof. Next, theorem 2 is about lower bound of the spreading speed and asymptotic estimate of F plus C and or H. As I mentioned before, this was the most difficult part of our analysis. We improved the idea. We improve the idea of a proof of the logarithmic phase drift of the Fisher-KPP splitting front. Here, we only consider the case A greater than one process. One of the key points is this lower estimate of F in the leading rates. From this lower estimate of F in the leading edge, we obtain uniform positivity of G behind the spreading front, where G is F plus C. And proof by contradiction and a limiting argument implies the conclusion of the theory. Of the theorem. Third, theorem three is about behavior of f if the parameter a smaller than one plus s, then f do not spread at all. This corresponds to character diffusion. If a greater than one process, then If exist at least in the front of the spread Yeah Is the idea of the proof? In the case S smaller than 1 plus S, he estimate is this lower bound of Z, Z is F plus C. From this lower bound of Z, we obtain this upper bound of F, and we see that F tends to zero as T tends to infinity. tends to infinity. In the case A greater than 1 plus S, we prove by contradiction if F extinct in the leading front, spreading front, and if we put C tilde equal C minus alpha F, where alpha is satisfying this equation. Equation, then C tilde satisfied this linear equality, linear inequality. From this linear inequality, we see that C child spreading speed of C child is smaller than C star. Then we see that We see that F plus C spreading speed of F plus C is smaller than C star. This contradicts the theorem 2 under the proof completes. Finally, theorem 4 is about the behavior of the solution behind the front. Theorem Theorem concludes that f goes to zero behind the front and c uniformly greater than one and h uniformly positive. Moreover, if small d equals one, here small d is diffusion coefficient of Hunter. Then C and H converges to this certain constant. Here, we only consider the case that g is smaller than g star. g star is this value, this value. In this case, we get this lower bound of h. Lower bound of H. From this lower bound of H, we can easily see that this condition is a sufficient condition for uniform positivity of H. This uniform positivity of H implies this lower bound of G behind the front. And from this lower bound, And from this lower bound, we obtain the conclusion of the theorem. In the end of the proof, we consider the case d equal to 1. We use a similar argument to that for pre-predata system. We use this non-negative convex function. If we put w If we put W like this, then W satisfies this inequality. And the contradiction argument and limiting argument implies this result. Finally, we summarize our result. We prove that spreading speed is equal to C star. Here, C star is the predicted Is the predicted minimal traveling wave speed by Aoki Shida Shigesoda? We also rigorously confirm the following spreading patterns. Future work is to consider spatially heterogeneous coefficient scales. This is the end of my talk. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. That's perfect timing, actually. All right, so are there questions or comments? Probably the best way is you just start speaking, then I can see you. Any questions? Hi, I have a question. This is Jim Nolan. Go ahead, Jim. Thank you for a very nice talk. Thank you for a very nice talk. I just wanted to clarify: did you have a result about the case where D is less than one? How is that different? This was on the slide, I think maybe one slide ago or two slides ago. One more slide back, I think. Or the D is the coefficient for the hunter. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And we can also get the same result when D is smaller than one. But here we assume that hunter-gatherer more hunter-gatherer diffusion coefficient greater than former former more sedentary. Form accidentally, we assume. So in the case D less than one, it would behave like the case D equal one. C and H would converge to some positive limit. This is only D equal to one ki result. Result. We do not know if D not equal one, this is true or not. Thank you. Any other question? I want to ask you: the original system is The original system is not cooperative, right? But sometimes you can use the cooperativity of a reduced system for comparison principles. Is that correct? Yes. Now, apparently, you had to do a lot of work for your results. Can you extract some general ideas that Ideas that would apply to systems of some specific structure, or is this just suited precisely for this particular system? I think our result can be generalized. Sorry, we don't consider generalization yet, but I think our results can be generalized. It's probably hard to single out some particular structure of the system, right? But possibly could lead to some generalizations. Okay, if there are no other questions, we have 15. Questions, we have fifteen minutes break.
