Okay, so what I'm going to talk about is well closedness of the waterway clock. So, okay, so I guess we have seen enough of what's going on, right? So this is the general picture, the setup of the problem. So we normally assume the air density is zero and the water density is one. And there's a free interface. I would call it sigma t and the domain is omega t. And the domain is omega t. And the fluid is subject to a constant gravity, g. So here, this is, I put a negative g here, so that means this little g is positive. Okay, so the assumption is the air density is zero, the fluid density is one, and the gravity is zero minus g, and the fluid is inviscid and incompressible. Okay, so if we write down the equation, So, if we write down the equation, and the first is Euler and divergence zero, right? And normally there's a surface tension, so the pressure is constant multiplied by the mean curvature. And we assume that fluid particle on the interface stay on the interface for all time. Okay, so to clarify the notation, so I just follow the normal, usual More usual way to describe. So, this is like, you know, in the literature, usually this is called free surface incompressible oil equations. Okay, so even the water wave problem definitely can have roticity. Okay, so now another, so when we say we are looking at gravity water wave problem, gravity water wave equation, so the surface tension will be assumed zero and the fluid is assumed irrotation. Fluid is assumed irrotational. So now, if the fruit is irrotational, but surface tension is not zero, that would be called capillary gravity. So, this is just some notation, so I don't have to come back to it later on. Okay, so it's well known that if there's no surface tension, then the motion can be subject to the so-called Taylor sign condition. So, what did the Taylor sign condition say? It says, So, okay, so this N. Okay, so this n, as I draw here, so n is always outward normal. So this is outward normal to the interface. So the negative dp dn has to be greater than equal to zero. Because otherwise, the fluid can be subject to some instability. Because you know, the pressure, we know that, so this is the bulk of fluid, and the pressure is, say, suppose there's no substantial pressure zero on the bulk. Tensions of the pressure zero on the boundary. So the pressure has to be increasing inward. Okay, this is what it says. So if it's decreasing, then there's a bubble can form, and then that can be instability. So this condition was first proposed by G.I. Taylor in 1949. And Abbin in 1987 showed that if the Taylor sound condition fails, the water wave equation can be ill-poised. And now I want to distinguish between greater. And now I want to distinguish between greater than or equal to zero and greater than a positive constant. So this one is called strong Taylor sign condition, and this is the usual Taylor sign condition. Okay, so now let's just look at the gravity water wave problem. And I want to say first, let's see how do we look at the Taylor sound condition, right? How does it come in in the water wave problem and why it's so important for the well-posedness? So, here I'm going to start with the most simple system. So, in other words, I will neglect surface tension and I will also neglect the vorticity. So, this is just gravity-water wave equation. And we know that it's defined on a moving domain. It's difficult to solve directly. So, the usual strategy is just to work on the free surface. So, we have seen so far that there's a lot of work. Work okay, so and we have seen this: like you know, we can just for the potential flow, like it's incompressed, irrotational, we can just work look at the Bernoulli equation and use Saharov-Craig-Sulein system, right, to work on that. This is one way of doing it, but what I'm going to describe is another way, okay. So now we just look at the 2D case, and then I will, the same idea works for 3D. The same idea works for 3D. So the advantage of working on 2D is it has complex analysis tools available. So it will just easier to look at. So here is like, so I'm going to work on the interface. So this means that we will try to write down the Euler equation on the interface. Okay, so we identify the xy with its complex version x plus iy, and we x plus iy, and we assume that the interface is given by z equal to z alpha t. This alpha is a Lagrangian coordinate. So this means that if I take derivative to t, so this is sub means derivative to t, I will get velocity. If I take two derivative, I get acceleration. Okay, so this have, we have written down the acceleration. Now the gravity in complex variable is vector Ti. Now because pressure is zero on the interface, so the gradient P will So, the gradient P will point in the normal direction. Okay, so now negative gradient P can be just decomposed, just be written as like negative dpdm multiplied the normal direction. And I just use a notation like IAZ alpha. So, because you know, we have, so the interface is z equal to z alpha. So, if I take derivative, and the z alpha is a tangent vector, and i z alpha is And Iz alpha is the normal vector. So we have to, this m is a unit normal, so we have to divide by its mass, and a is just negative n divided by the length of the alpha. Now this, so this, we have written down the acceleration and the gravity on the interface. Now we know that divergence-free, curl-free means that the velocity bar is holomorphic. Okay, so now we are ready to write down the interface equation on the interface. Okay, so this is like the acceleration and the forced gravity move to the left and then this negative gradient P, right? So this is Euler equation, the momentum equation. And then this, we have this like compressor irrotational. That means that Zt bar holomorphic, so it should satisfy the Causi integral, right? The Causian integral, right? So you let the Causi integral pass to the boundary, you will get this relation. So here, H is a Hilbert transform, and this is a principal value. Okay, so of course, this is a full nonlinear equation, right? It's still difficult to the second line of 5. It should be Z, not CT on the right-hand side, but on the little function. It's Ct bar. You've got CT bar on both sides. Yeah, Zt bar equal to H C T bar. C T bar. So, okay, that's a good question. So, in other words, okay, so we have like V bar equals to the Causi integral of V bar, right? That's what we got. Is that right? Okay, so that's the Causi integral I write down is 1 over 2 pi i. And like, you know, if this variable is called Possi, maybe Z. Okay, it's Possibi minus C and Possibly minus C and V bar Posine D Posi. So that's the Causi integral on the interface. On the interface. Now if I pass to the limit, I will get actually this. One half of V bar Z. So now if I let Z goes to, say, some Z0 on the interface. So it's not like straightforwardly, I just plug in Z0. I just plug in Z0. That will not work. It's like I have this term and plus the principal value of the same thing of the integral. Okay, so here is I write like an opposite because this is normally it's a counterclockwise. Counterclockwise. So this is like the orientation should be like this when I write it this way. So here we are already writing this one. We are already writing this way, so that means I would put z in front, okay, z minus z. So this is like, okay, so this is, so in other words, the limit should be i plus h of v. So now if I let the both side v z 0, so if I let both sides equal, so I get v z 0 equal to h v z 0. So in other words, if I take the limit, it should be like v bar z 0 equal to i. equal to I plus H of P plus 0. Okay, so if I just, you know, the identity part, I make it equal to the I got the second equation. Okay. Okay, so this is, I mean, so in other words, the second equation will measure how holomorphic it is. Okay, if it's equal, then it's holomorphic. Otherwise, it will have some residuals. Okay, okay. Okay, so now for this equation. Okay, so now for this equation, of course, it's not easy to understand, right, because it's still fully nonlinear. Now, it turns out, okay, so this I will explain in further detail a little bit later, but just take it for granted now is that just by, so we just by take, we find that just by taking a derivative to t, in other words, now everything is in Lagrangian coordinate. So that means if I take So that means if I take a material derivative, choose a conjugate of the first equation, we will get this equation, right? So this is just straightforward. So you just take a conjugate and then you take the derivative to t again, and I move the one of the terms to the left-hand side. You know, take derivative to t to the right-hand side, I will get minus i Atz alpha bar plus a minus IAZ alpha bar. Okay, AZT alpha bar. Bar, AZT alpha bar. But I move this one of the turns to the left, I get the first equation and then the second equation. It turns out that the first equation is a quasi-linear equation with the right-hand side, the lower orbital. So here I give a brief explanation why this is a quasi-linear equation. Or in other words, the main part of the equation is the left-hand side, the right-hand side is a lower order term. So if I ignore the, so if I look at the left-hand side, So, if I look at the left-hand side, this is basically derivative to zt bar. So, we can write the left-hand side as zt squared plus iadr phi zt bar. Now, zt bar is holomorphic. So, zt bar is holomorphic, so taking derivative it make it not holomorphic anymore, but it's almost holomorphic. Okay, so this means that the left-hand side is something that's almost holomorphic, but the right-hand side, if I ignore But the right hand side, if I ignore the bar, so otherwise I take the bar away, the right hand side is IATZ alpha. And this one, so remember, A is real valued. Okay, if I go back, so A, oh, A is here. So A is real valued, right? A is really just an active DPDN divided by 1 over Z alpha. That's real value. So the right-hand side only points in the normal direction, the tangential direction. So we know that if the function is That if the function, a function is a holomorphic function, has zero tangential value on the boundary, then the normal component has to be a constant as well. So the whole thing has to be constant. But now the left-hand side, of course, is not holomorphic, but it's almost holomorphic. So in other words, so you can measure that there's a commutator comes in and the measure, the commutator is a lower order term. So that's why the right-hand side is the lower order term. So in other words, because this only points So in other words, because this only points in the normal direction, therefore, the right-hand side is a lower order term. The left-hand side is the main part of the equation. Okay, so now let's try to understand this equation a little further. So remember, what is A? A is negative dpdn over 1 over z alpha. And now for it's easy to check, right? So we know z alpha is a tangential direction and i z alpha as a normal direction. And now for a holomorphic function, And now, for a holomorphic function, if you take derivative d alpha, that's a tangential derivative, but I d alpha exactly is a normal derivative. So I d alpha applied to a holomorphic function gives a normal derivative and divide by its length. That's really just a normal, you know, n is a unit normal, right? It's a direct to normal operator. So in other words, you're given the boundary value zt and you try to find the normal. Normal derivative of Zt bar because we know velocity satisfies the Laplace equation, like Laplace V equals 0. So this is exactly the Diracian normal operator, and we know Dirichlet normal operator is a positive operator. And now, so the equation, so if I write u equal to zt bar, so this equation I can write like this. Okay, so left-hand side is just that. And the right-hand side, as I explained a little earlier, that because As I explained a little earlier, that because of the holomorphicity of the t-bar, so the right-hand side and the only point in the normal direction. So it's a lower order term. I just write like F that depends on U and the UT only. Okay, so this is the basic type of the equation we have to deal with. So we know that, well, this equation is of the hyperbolic type if the sign is positive. Because remember, the most typical hyperbolic equation is. Hypermodic equation is d t square minus the most basic one is dt square minus Laplace, right? Minus Laplacian is a positive operator. So of course if we have dt squared plus Laplacian, and that's an elliptic equation, right? So if we want to solve initial value problem, then we need this sign to be positive, right? But if it's an elliptic problem, we cannot solve initial value problem, we can only solve boundary value problem. Okay, so this is so now this explains the importance of the Taylor-Sun condition, right? Because if the Taylor-Sun condition fails, we are dealing with an elliptic problem and there's a Kelvin-Colmus type of instability. Okay, okay, so this is so this, okay, so now, okay, so this was the approach we used in our earliest work. And of course, I mean here in reality, what we In reality, what we did was really we just work on the whole equation in the Riemann mapping variable. Because in 2D, you know, the Riemann mapping variable will allow us to write the Hilbert transform in a nicer way. Okay, that I will explain at the end of the talk. But for the moment, we just take it for granted. And now we also, but for 3D, there's no Riemann mapping, but it turns out. No remote mapping, but it turns out the whole setup can still be moved to 3D using cliffhold analysis, which we are not going to talk about. But now I'm going to look at, let's look at a second, oh no, not yet, okay. So now let me just mention that for the, so what if, so, so I just say that this approach applies to both 2D and the 3D, right? Because in 3D, there's a parallel on everything, okay? Okay, so now this. Okay. Okay, so now this actually also works for capillary gravity equation, right? So if the pressure is a constant, is not zero on the interface, then you can just, instead of writing the gradient P as the only normal component, it also has a tangential component, right? So this is a tangential component. Remember, Z alpha is a tangent vector, and you do the projection on the tangential component, that's exactly what you get. Exactly what you get. And we can write it like this. So this is just a notation. Here, d bar is 1 over z alpha d alpha. And absolute value d bar is this. Now that we can write down the Euler equation, so the pressure will have two terms, the normal component and the tangential component. And you do the same thing. You take one more derivative to t, you get a quasi-linear equation. And here, notice this a becomes a1. I just don't want to write. Becomes A1, I just don't want to write the detail. So this A1 is something like exactly the same if there's no surface tension, okay, as A. Okay, so this is like, you can write it like this, and we can see that, you know, if there's a surface tension, there's an X term like this come out, and this term is, you can check that's positive. Okay, so in other words, if there's a surface tension, then the gravity term becomes less important in terms of the Important in terms of the well-posedness, right? So automatically, we would have a hyperbolic type equation and it's well-posed. So if there's a surface tension, then we don't need to worry about negative medium to be positive or not. But otherwise, we need, okay, if there's no wisdom. Okay, so now let's just look at another approach. So now, so once we know that what's really the main terms of the equation, or what's really the quasi-linear equation, we don't Really, the quasi-linear equation, we don't have to work on the boundary, right? We can, because working on the boundary is kind of awkward in some way, right? So we have to deal with something Causi integral and it defines a curve and it's just like awkward to work on, right? The curve is moving, okay. And it's also not local. So instead, well, we just translate the whole thing to the Euler equation, okay? So remember by taking one derivative to the momenta. One derivative to the momenta equation, we get a quasi-linear equation. Okay, so we just take one material derivative, right? So one derivative to t is really one material derivative, okay, here. So taking one material derivative to the momentum equation, we just get this. So why do I write like this? Okay, so it's like, you know, remember the momentum equation is a dtb. So dtb. Plus gradient p equals to 0. Okay, so you take one more derivative, we plus, so this is like u plus dt v, dt gradient p equal to 0, right? So we write dt gradient s dt gradient plus gradient dt. Okay, that's a computation. Okay. And move the one of the terms to the right hand side. So why this term gets to the right hand side? This term gets to the right-hand side. Okay. So why does this term get to the right-hand side? Because we know pressure is zero on the interface. So if you, because particle on the interface stay on the interface, so you take a material data to the pressure, it's still zero on the interface. DTP is still zero on the interface, right? So gradient DTP would point in the normal direction on the interface. So this would exactly correspond to this term. Exactly corresponds to this term, right? Because this term points to the normal direction, right? If we ignore the bound, it points to the normal direction. So that means this term was corresponding to the commutator. So if we just take a look at this, so it's easy to compute the commutator, it's just that, right? And you write it down. So here, so in fact, this approach, and you can see that it will apply to just, it doesn't have to require V2V irrotation down. Have to require V to be irrotation now. But for the comparison to the previous case approach, I just use the irrotation now. So we can just write switch K with the I's component. We can just write this term as negative gradient P dot gradient V. But otherwise, it's not completed like this. There will be a vorticity to come out. And the vorticity we can move to the right hand side because vorticity trend is transported along the particle trajectory. Along the particle trajectory. So the initial vorticity, the regularity of the initial vorticity will determine the regularity of the term. So it's an all-order term. So we can write like this. So this computer term is exactly this. And we remember the pressure is zero. So we are working on the gravity water wave equation. So the pressure is zero on the interface, so negative gradient P is exactly that. Now this equation can be written like this. written like this. So this exactly recovers the quasi-linear equation. So it's on the interface, it's dt square v minus the dpdn times the normal derivative of v equal to this. So now we know the pressure, the velocity we have, we are working on potential flow, so Laplace V equals zero, right? So this will be the couple system we have to work with. Now to work out what is the coefficient. What is the coefficient on this right-hand side? We have to work on the Laplace equation, right? So we can derive from the equation the Laplace equation for P and the Laplace equation for dtp. Laplace operate for P, Laplace for dtp. And it's easy to check exactly satisfy this relationship. And you can see that, so now pressure zero on the interface and dtp zero on the interface. Now we can use elliptic estimate. So remember the elliptic estimate. So remember, the estimate for the Poisson equation with boundary value equals zero is that we gain two derivatives from the right-hand side. So otherwise, so Laplace P will have the same regularity as one derivative of V, and Laplace DTP will have the same derivative as one derivative of V and the one derivative dtv. So now if we just work on the gradient of dtp, then it will behave like v and dtv. And dTB, okay, because you know, in terms of regularity. So, this is another way of seeing that this is a low-water term. And f the dpdn will depend on v. The regularity will be like a v, not greater than a v. So this is a second way of seeing this is a quasi-linear equation with the right hand left-hand side and the hyper-order type. Okay, so now in fact, so by writing like this, So, by writing like this, and you can see that this approach will have a wider application, right? So, in fact, say we don't have to have zero, the vorticity equals zero. So, in fact, vorticity not zero, the first approach also works for the case when the vorticity is not zero. Okay, so because you will have extra terms when you write down the velocity. So, instead of velocity equals to the constant integral of the velocity, you have some extra. The cosine integral of the velocity, you have some extra time in terms of the vorticity. So, this is still fine. But this approach certainly looked like more clean, right? So, even though directly working on this, I mean, it's hard to figure out why these are the main terms, right? If I didn't tell you in advance. Okay, so now, so I just say that this works for fluids with now zero vorticity, and just to say, to see how the vorticity involves. See how the vorticity involves in the whole equation. So, I write instead of Laplace P as gradient V square minus curve of V. Okay, so this is how the vorticity comes in with in the Poisson equation for P. Okay, okay, so now of course if the curve of V equals zero, we will have Laplace P less than or equal to zero, then we can just use the maximum principle, right? So remember, and the pressure is also zero on the interface, okay. Zero on the interface. So we are looking at such a situation, right? It's zero on the interface, and then of course, and that's Laplace P is less than or equal to zero, so it's concava. Then we have like the normal derivative is greater than or equal to zero. Okay, so it's a half maximum principle. And of course, if the curl is not zero, then we would have, then we know. Then we know it may not be true. And then you can compute what is negative DPDN if the curve is not zero. So, in fact, this approach was first used in Christopher Rimberg in 2000 paper, where they worked on the free boundary incompressible oil. So, in other words, they allow the voltage to be not zero, but in a bounded domain. So, in that case, the gravity is not involved. Involved. And so, of course, as I said, many things actually, you know, both approach, either approach works for many cases and depend on your preference, right? So whether you are more comfortable to work with this and that. But for this approach, there are advantages of this work. So this approach has been used on many other rebounded problems. So like NHD inventory. In between. And in this work with Shang Miao, Sora, Shash Hani, and we actually can use this approach to prove local well-positeness for free boundary problem with a relativistic background. So now many states that the both approach works, but for this one, I think that it's important just to use this approach. Just to use this approach, right? Because otherwise it will be difficult to. We have to solve the, instead of Laplace V equals zero, we have to deal with a hyperbolic equation. And I don't know how to write everything on the boundary. Okay, so and as we have seen on Monday, right, it has also been used in this recent work on Hadamard, well, local world postness of the same problem. Of the same problem, like free boundary, income factor, or even in a bounded domain. Okay. Okay, so now there are, of course, many other approaches, right? So everybody has their own favorite way of writing equation and then work on it. Okay. So let me just give a brief history of the local well-positions in solvent spaces. So I'm going to just not mention local well-positors in analytic class. Analytic class. Before solvent space, there are many results on analytic class, local well-positeness, on analytic class. So for the local well-posedness, in solved space, the first work was given by Nadimov for small data in the 2D case of infinite depths. And Yoshihara works on finite depths. So there's a button that doesn't interact with the interface. And Watergrave is also finite depths. Is also finite depths, and there they will show that for the 2D water wave and for data small enough, you can solve for finite time for short time. Okay, so now in this work I mentioned earlier, so we show that in fact for so the Taylor sign condition always holds, right, because we are working on infinite depths and the water wave problem, gravity, and with no surface tension, and we are able to obtain. We are able to obtain local verposeness for arbitrary data in solvent spaces. So, here the smoothness is like, so we're not trying to get anything too rough. So, as long as the index s is greater than equal to 4, we have no cobalt closeness. And in fact, I want to mention that this is proof that the Heiler sign condition always holds. So, always greater than or equal to 0. It's always greater than or equal to zero, but if the interface is C1 gamma for some gamma positive, then it has a positive lower bound. Okay, the strong favorite convention hold. And Chris Guder-Limbra in this work of 2000, and they obtained the energy estimate for the 3D free boundary incompressible fluid in a boundary domain. So there they have to assume the Taylor-Sun condition holds because it doesn't hold automatically. There's a vorticity there. And Lindebray. There. And Lindebra in 2007 were able to show that the existence of the solutions for the incompressible free boundary Euler problem in a bounded domain via Nash-Moser iteration. So there's some kind of loss of derivative. And then he closed the argument using Nash-Moser. So here I just want to mention that in this work of Chin Tang Su, This work of Qing Tang Su, and a formula for necked EPDN was given for waterway with point vertices. And he also gave an example of a transaction from stable to unstable for fluids with point vertices. So in other words, for certain pair of point vertices, it will travel upwards. So once it gets close enough to the interface, it will break the Teger-Sign condition. So if it's deep enough, it doesn't affect the Tech-Star. It's deep enough, it doesn't affect the Taylor sign, so negative depending positive. When it gets close to the top, it will fail. Okay, so there's an example there. And now David Lan in 2005 proved the local well-posedness for fun and depth gravity water wave problem. And so here he has a button, arbitrary button, but it also doesn't interact with the interface. And there he proved, he obtained a form. Proved, he obtained a formula for negative dpn. And that formula you can see that if the curvature of the button is small enough, then the Taylor sign condition always holds. So here is the first instance of using the Zacharov-Craig-Sudent formulation to study the well-coseness of the waterway problem, dynamic problem. And then in Ambrose-Masmudi, And in Ambrose Masmudi, they look at the capillary gravity water waves and prove the local warposeness, and they're also able to pass the limit, zero surface tension limit. And there they used Berkeley-Rod formulation. That's a similar formulation like he talked about yesterday. So, and the Coten Scholar, Ping Jang, so Coten Scholar used also the Used also the Eulerian formulation like crystal lingra in the whole domain, but he tried to fix domain using Lagrangian coordinates. So this is the work. And he studied the capillary incompressible oil problem with free boundary. And Ping Zhang and Tsufei Zhang used the cliff analysis, other words, boundary layer. Boundary layer method to study the 3D waterway with non-zero vorticity. And Xia Tajen developed another approach, right, geometric approach. They turned the geometric approach. So all these work obtain local well-posedness for capillary incompressible fluoridal spree boundary. So they all have to assume the Taylor sound condition. So now, since we have a hard amount. So now, since we have a Hanama well-postness, so I have to clarify what these well-positeness results are about, right? So we also talk about well-postness there. So in all this work, we have proved for arbitrary given data, in solvative space, smooth enough solvative space, there exists a unique solution. And also that there's an analog dependence in the sense that, so suppose your solution exists in the solar space. Exists in the software space Hs, and then you measure the difference between two solutions. You can only measure the difference in H minus, S minus something, right? So say, so Hs minus one half or H minus S, H S minus. So in other words, it's in a weaker topology than the solution exists. So the analytic dependence in a weaker topology than the existence of the other where the solution sits, okay. Where the solution sits, okay. In order that I can translate the solution. Okay. Okay, so I have to go fast, it looks like. Okay, so now we also have a lot of work on low regularity software space, local web posts in low regularity subspace. So the first work was given by the group of Alazai Berg Suridi. And it's, you know, it's It looks very sharp to me. Okay, so they got local well closeness in the regular class of like C3 half. Okay, so roughly the interface in C3 half. And in fact, it can still go lower, right? So by the group of iflin Kataru, and they are able to push the regularity class even lower. And I guess Mihaila will explain a little bit later. A little bit later. Okay, so I will not elaborate into it. Okay, so in all this work, they used the Harlov-Craig-Sudan formulation. So the difference between the Alaza-Berg-Suri and the Ifrent Tataru group is that Ifrent Tataru further used the Riemann mapping coordinate, conformal coordinates. So because the Riemann mapping allow us to understand the structure of the equation much better. So where their work is in two dimensions. In two dimensions, okay? And they, in fact, can push the valuability class below and go on. Okay, so now let me also mention this is also besides Hanama's sense of local workplaceness, this is also low regularity class, okay, the resulting low regular class. Okay, so now we move to the global behavior for small. So the natural question is: what happens? So, the natural question is: what happens at this time goes to infinity? So, we don't have a lot of, you know, all the results obtained so far are proved in regularity class much higher than the conservation of the manager, right? So, the only tool is just use, you know, you hope that your equation is close enough to a linear equation. Then you say, oh, for a linear equation, we can solve for all time. Then, if the non-linearity is small enough, if the Linearity is small enough, if the data is small enough, if the nonlinearity is weak enough, then we can also push the existence to more time. Okay, so now, so the result, well, we start with this work in 2009 and 2011. We proved that for data of size epsilon for 2D, and then we can solve the equation for e to the 1 over epsilon. So this is called almost global. And global is. Almost global, and global is for data of size epsilon, then we can solve for all the time. So, in all this work, and then this, of course, the almost global, and then German Masmudi Shata, you also proved global well-poseness in 3D and with scattering. You can use a method of space-time resonance. And this almost global well-poseness was pushed further to global by UNESCO Psatari and Arazader independently and by further. And by further using modified scattering. Okay. And Ifrin Tataru and I, Ifrin Tataru, obtained global well-closeness and modified scattering for 2D gravity water waves in low regularity class. So here, all these work concerns the problem of gravity water wave equations. So there's no surface tension and there's infinite x. So the main idea, yes? Yes. So when you use the word existence, is that the word existence, do you use it as the equivalent of well-poseness? Or do you mean different things? Do you say global existence? Global distance, yeah. So because you have already local well-posedness, right? So you just want to make sure that your energy estimate, you know, it controls the solution for all time. That's the main difference, right? So local web pod, you have, like, you can just push the equation. Like you can just push the equation, the solution further down at the time. Okay. Okay. Okay, so this, all these, so there's a crucial feature of the gravity water wave equation, okay, is that, in fact, after a suitable change of coordinates and variables, the water wave equation has no quadratic nonlinear terms. So in other words, it's closer to the linear equation. It's closer to the linear equation than we would imagine. So normally you have a nonlinear equation, you have a linear term, and you have a quadratic nonlinear term, you have a cubic nonlinear term, and then go on. But after a suitable change of coordinates and variables, in fact, the quadratic non-ethnic can just completely remove. And of course, in all these, almost global and global, there's another feature used is dispersification. Is dispersive. So, in other words, your data has to decay fast enough at infinity. That's a dispersion. Okay. Yes? How can you make the comment that it's closer to because the scattering is not as small? Okay, so I say you were explaining this, right? So let me just, you know, I have named it's more. Okay. So no, it's still non-menia. So no, it's no, actually, you're it's So, no, it's no, actually, it's a good point. Okay, it's still non-linear. Yeah, it's a good point. But I say closer to linear when you read it in appropriate way. Okay, so it's still non-linear, okay, but I will explain in the next transparency, okay? But it will be, so let me just continue. Okay, so the main idea is after change of coordinates and variables, the waterway equations have no quadrant algorithm. So in fact, it's really just dependent on. So, in fact, it's really just depends on how you view this. So, now, so if we just work on data of size epsilon, because there's no quadrant number, then if you don't require decay, then you would have existential time epsilon to minus 2. Okay, so here I let me finish my last sentence. So, when you have data that decays fast enough at spatial infinity, you would have dispersive decay. So, for 2D, there's a dispersed. There's a dispersion dispersion gives us decay rate as 1 over square root t. That's why, like, without using modified scattering, we can only get 1 over square root. And for 3D, the decay rate is 1 over t. So you can actually, without doing further, you can just get global resistance. So here I'm going to show you how do you remove the quadratic and non-linear term? Okay. So yeah, thank you for the remark. You for the remark. So, I think I wanted to just skip this part, okay? But let me just explain further. So, now this is, so it turns out, so like I mentioned earlier, everything we are dealing with are holomorphic in the fluid domain, right? Velocity is holomorphic in the fluid domain, velocity bar. But on the other hand, if we just look at, so we let psi to be the velocity potential restriction on the in. Potential restriction on the trace of the velocity potential on the interface. Now, if you do a projection of the velocity potential to the space of holomorphic function in the air domain, okay, so it's an i minus h. Remember, here I just mentioned i plus h, half i plus h is a projection to the space of holomorphic function, right? So here we just project to the space of holomorphic function in the air region, and z minus z bar is the height of the. C bar is the height of the wave, right? Project to the space of Holomo function in the air region, then you will get, you will find that these quantities satisfy such a relation, right? The main operator is dt squared plus IA d alpha, right? Remember? So here I, because we're dealing with holomorphic in the air region, so I just use minus. And this applied to and this applied to Isn't it equivalent to the Creamer transformation to remove the cubic term in the aminger transformation? Yes, sir. Um yes and no, I think. Y yes, it's related. It's related. Because this is a nonlinear it it's you know, it's it's related, okay. So because this H is very nonlinear. But it turns out this is just a structure of the water wave equation. It's related to this transformation is not Henopagen. And you can make it polymorphic. So you find kappa in this way, and this coordinate change will remove the quadratic nonlinearity of the left-hand side. So here, the equation will turn into like this. It's not negative IA d alpha. It turns like dt squared minus ia i d alpha. So it looks really like linear. So it looks really like linear product equal to cubic. But it's not completely linear, like Mihala just mentioned. Because dt square minus i d alpha still contains some nonlinear terms. Why? Because you know this kappa satisfy, because you cannot just think this is id alpha. This is holomorphic in the air region, right? So id alpha we have to understand. So, ideal, we have to understand this as a derivative to normal operator. So, as a derivative to normal operators, it's non-linear. But this formal way of thinking actually is enough. Because if this guy is not holomorphic, this is an ill-posed problem. It's like Schrodinger on the sideboard. But you do need this quantity to be holomorphic to make it well-posed. So, in other words, I mean, there's an NHMS. Words, I mean, there's an energy amps estimate, you have to design a protein tree. So, here, this normal transformation can find in this work. Okay, so now just some further work done this direction. Okay, so of course, after a change of coordinates and change of variable, you can remove the quadratic nonlinearity. So, what about the cubic non-linearity? Can you remove that? And this, so we know that due to the work. So we know that due to the work of Diachemko Zaharov, there's no non-trivial four-wave resonances, but they are trivial four-way resonances. So using dynamical system tools, Bertie, Fiora, Poseteri were able to show for data, periodic data of size Ipsum, the solution exists to time Ypson to the minus 3. So if you can remove quadratic nonlinearity, then you have solution exists. You have solution exists for epsilon minus 2. So, of course, if there's a quadrant non-linearity, the solution exists for epsilon minus 1. So, if you further remove the cubic non-negative is epsilon minus 3. So, here, you don't, it's not completely removed, but you can, because there's no non-trivial four-wave resonances, so they can prove epsilon to minus 3. So, here we use, give a different approach using just study the Using just study the energy, we are able to show that this energy identities are explicit and you can read off some long-time existent results like epsilon minus 3 lifespan for more general small data. And then your next couposateri give another result in the same direction with smooth, small, smooth data. So essentially for data of size ipsum, you can solve for ipson minus 3. Okay, so this is here. Minus 3. Okay, so here the data do not have to be localized. So it's like it works for periodic data. And now we also have on a full, so definitely the gravity water wave equation has, without bottom has a very special feature, right? So what if you add capillarity? So if you add capillarity, there are resonances, but the resonance is of codimension. So in other words, if you deal with three. In other words, if you deal with 3D, and you, so in this work, they use a partial, mass construct a partial normal form, okay, and they are able to show for data of small, smooth, and localized. In 3D, you can solve for global time. In Bertie, Fura, Franco, and they deal with periodic data. So there's no dispersion involved. And they can get Ypsil to the minus 2 lifespan. Ipsil to the minus 2 lifespan because in the 2D case, the resonance is just a few points. Okay, so that we can do. Okay, so now we, so here I'm not going to, so because, and you can imagine that, you know, with any additional feature, there could be resonances involved, right? So there's a results, like we have also seen the work of Ikrin Tatar and studied 2D gravity waves, that's infinite depths. Waves that's infinite depths, right, with constant vorticity, and they can get a lifespan of x or minus 2. And in this work of Qing Tang Su, and this, of course, if you add arbitrary vorticity, you are not expected to solve for a long time. But for a certain pair of point vertices, if you have certain initial data, the point vertices will move downwards. If it moves downwards away from the boundary, so then you will not see it for a long time. Long time, so this means that you can also get a longer life spectrum. Okay, so here the wave doesn't have to decay at infinity as well. Okay, so now let me just move fast. Okay, so now, so of course in all this work, you know, we're dealing with interface that's C1 gamma. So that means the Taylor sign condition is either assumed or it can be proved to be greater than the gamma. Or it can be proved to be greater than a positive constant. Okay. Okay. Okay, so now the question is: so now we want to deal with interface with singularity. So what can we say about interface with singularity? So with this singularity, we think that should be just, you know, is the gravity water wave equation like have enough physics to capture something like non-C1 interfaces? Okay, is the gravity water wave equation? Okay, is the gravity-water wave equation well posed in any class that includes class C1 interfaces? Okay, so now here we again, so this is actually was this, this, all the, all the work, I mean the framework has been established in this early work in 97. Okay, so we just use it. So I just describe, so equivalently, everything can be in 2D, can be, we can use conformal mapping to describe everything. So we use conformal mapping. So we use conformal mapping, maps the low half plane to the fluidomain. So the interface is given by the capital Z. So in conformal mapping, my notation is just capital. Capital Z is this interface, capital Z T is the velocity on the interface, capital Z T T is acceleration on the interface, and capital D T is a material derivative, so etc. And the change of variable from Lagrangian to human mapping is given. To human mapping is given by H. Okay, so we can still write down the Eul equation on the interface, right? So the momentum equation. And then we incompressible irrotational Z bar. Zt bar is velocity composed with velocity bar composed evaluated on the interface in the conformal variable, right? So this is a conformal mapping per site. And then now the human. And then now the Hilbert transform is much nicer. So we don't have to deal with the unknown in the denominator. So in this setting, everything can be computed explicitly and nicely. The formula, I'm just going to show you the formula for the negative P here. This is just a notation. So we get A1 just to be A times this positive quantity. That's the Jacobian of the. The Jacobian of the Riemann mapping square. And we find this A1 is always positive. So A1 equals G, G is positive, the gravity, and plus this one. And this is a positive quantity. So that means A1 is always greater than or equal to constant. So negative dpdn is A1 divided by Z alpha square. So automatically it's greater than or equal to 0, right? It will be greater than or equal to constant if the interface is C1 gamma. Because the Jacobian can be 0. Okay, because the Jacobian can be zero if we deal with interface with singularity, but otherwise it's always positive. Okay, and the quasi-linear equation, you can just figure out everything in detail. And the right-hand side is commutator. That's a low other term. And I have to move fast. I don't have a lot of time left. Okay. So now, this is a, we already go through this explanation some time ago, right? So the main difficulty with So the main difficulty with water wave with angle crust is that 1 over z alpha equals to 0 if the interior angle is less than pi. So let me explain this here. Okay, so this is a remote mapping. Say, suppose you have an angle that's mu pi, right? So then that's like. Right? So then that's like you take zero to this, and then this Riemann mapping Possi, T would be to the mu. Okay. So if I take derivatives of Possi, alpha, T would be alpha to the mu. Okay, so this is a probability. So if I take one derivative to alpha, that's our z alpha. That's like it's like equivalent to almost like alpha mu minus one. So if mu is less than one, So if mu is less than 1, then z alpha is infinity at 0. z alpha 0 is infinity, so 1 over z alpha is 0. So why I deal with this not mu greater than pi? So we will see in next transparency. So in other words, the Taylor sign condition will degenerate to zero at the singularity. So now the interior angle has to be less than pi. Angle has to be less than pi is really due to the momentum equation. Okay, so this is like just rearrange momentum equation. So if we, the observe our observation is the acceleration is finite, right? So if it's finite and we know A1, I should be greater than or equal to Z. Okay, so here I just normalize the gravity as 1. So the right hand side can, if, so if the right hand side, so we know the right hand side is less than infinity, right? Less than infinity, right? So if it's less than infinity, so it can only be zero, right? We get a similar idea. Because if angle is greater than pi, then mu is greater than one, then zt has to be infinite. So in other words, if we are observing the wave like this, then the angle has to be, observing wave with finite acceleration, then the angle has to be the same time. Okay. Okay, so now I just describe the result. Describe the result I get. Okay, we got some time ago. So basically, this is the energy, this is a functional class we're dealing with. So every time you take a derivative, you have to take a weighted derivative. So here, you have to, so I think, can I borrow a few more minutes? Okay, okay. Okay. So now I don't have to rush. Okay. Because I need to explain this. Okay. So this is the energy class with. So, this is the energy class we deal with. So, in other words, you can take derivative to alpha in the Riemann mapping variable, but if you want to take more derivative, you have to take d alpha. What is d alpha squared? So d alpha square is a weighted derivative, right? d alpha square is like 1 over z alpha d alpha 1 over z alpha d. So if you want to take further derivative, you have to put some For the derivative, you have to put some weight. And remember, the weight is exactly zero at the singularity. So that means it's fine. So in other words, this weight kills the singularity. So this is a class in which we can show that we first we find the energy estimate with my student Rafe Kinsey and then we show that in fact the water the gravity water wave equations well posed in this class. Class. Okay, so in other words, we have existence, uniqueness for data in this class, and we also prove the stability, like the analytic dependence, also for a weighted norm that's half regularity less than one. I show you. So I'm not going to show you the detail. Okay, so now there's a remark about this class. Okay, so you can see that, so of course, this class includes. So so of course this class includes all the smooth uh data, right? Because it only requires if you require this is in soft space, it's finite, it allows all smooth solution, but it also allows one over the alpha equal to zero, right? Because one over the alpha equal to zero is completely fine, it can also be solved in solving space, right? So allows, that means it also allows water wave with angle crest. Okay, so in particular, it only allows It only allows interior angle less than pi over 2. So if we deal with Stokes wave with maximum height, it will have infinite energy. So it's not included in this class. And Sidan proved exist well positions for capillary graduate with water wave in a region consistent with this and then also passed to the zero surface tension limit. With zero surface tension limit. Okay. So here, now this is a remark. So, first, this is observed by Grave Kinsey and the proof rigorous by Sidang Agrawal, that in fact the angle doesn't change. So, in other words, if we have a data of angle, mu pi, x will stay like mu pi for all later time. Why that? This is because at the cross point, we need the derivative. We need the derivative equal to zero. So why this? So you can see that this is really because of the norm we used. So we need a little bit constrained. So it's really because of the norm we used. Okay, so let me just not go through the details. Okay, so we find that in fact the angle cannot change for this energy rigid glass. So a natural question is: well, then does the water wave equation actually admit angle class waves of changing angles? So this problem has been addressed by a recent work of Coldbar and CISO and Rubik. And they were able to show that the gravity-water wave equation admits periodic solution in a class that allows In a class that allows angle changing, but the angle is acute angle. So, in other words, you do have inter data that has angle, but it can change, but this angle has to be less than pi over 2. So, now what about angle bigger than pi over 2? So, can we do that? So, of course, this requires to really understand their work a little better. So, this is like, you know, as you know, as usual, like, I Know, I, as usual, like I so, we, this is my understanding of their work, okay. So, I think this is not how they present it, but let me just show you what I see, okay, and then of course this is all hinted in their work, okay. It's just not explicit. So, we find by looking at their work carefully, we find there's a this this water wave, gravity water wave equation, in fact, has a very special class of solution. So, how does this special class solution? So, how does this special class of solution look like? So, this special class of solution really just, you know, it doesn't look physical at all, right? So, it's just like you have a straight line here, you have a straight line here. And this angle is okay. So, okay, so I I have to probably five more minutes, it's okay. Okay, yeah, okay. I mean, these are the most important part of this talk, right? So Part of this talk, right? So you have to listen. So, so, so you know, this is the wave region is bounded by two stray lines and with an angle in the middle. And the velocity is this linear function. So remember that the key point of non-changing angle is like the first derivative of the velocity is zero, right? So now it's crucial that B1 cannot be zero, okay, if you want it to change. So you just plug in this and thus, and you find if you And does, and you find if you just take pressure like this, and mu is like mu plus mu minus, right? This is mu plus mu minus pi. Okay, so this between mu. And you find that v1 p1 actually solved the gravity-water wave equation in this region. So in other words, you have a special solution just doing something like this. Okay? And provided all these parameters involved satisfy this ODE, okay? And this is. Okay, this is okay. So this is so now so their work is essentially a perturbation of this particular solution, right? So in other words, so you do a perturbation of this and you get their work, okay? But of course, I mean, that's, as far as I can, that's not something I see in their paper they describe as a perturbation of this, but I think it's a perturbation of this. Perturbation of this, okay, because this is a faster solution. So, of course, if you want to do a perturbation of this, this solution has to be a dominant one, right? So, now we want to check, but if you check carefully, this doesn't require the angle to be less than pi over 2. It can applies to any angle. This mu pi can be arbitrary. So, what really makes we require n over this m pi over 2? Okay, so we look at in two point of view. Look at in two points of view. So we calculate an active DPDN. So we know it's very important, right, for water wave physical phenomena, nectar DPDN has positive. So we calculate the nectar DPDN. We find if mean pi is greater than pi over 2, it's less than zero. So the Taylor sign condition fails. In other words, that's the instability. So you cannot perturb something that's not physical to get something physical, right? So that's one reason you cannot use it to do the greater than pi over two. Greater than pi over 2. Another reason is you compute this quantity A1. A1 is earlier in the formula. And you find that if alpha equals to 0, so here alpha equals 0 denote the crest. So if mu is less than pi over 2, this is infinity, so A1 dominates. If mu is greater than pi over half, 1 half, that means the angle is greater than pi over 2, this is 0. So the separation solution. So the special solution is dominating only if the endosystem is empowered. So of course it's not dominating. Other things become important. You just don't get perturbation. It's out. Okay, so now I want to mention that we were in the same workshop and Eric, in fact, came up with a blow-up solution for this equation. So in other words, this special solution can just, for certain initial data, For certain initial data can just doesn't have to exist for all time. And based on this work, and then NCISO, the Codeba and CISO Grubik, were able to show their solution also blow up, right? Because you just perturb around a blow-up solution, you get something blow-up. So, of course, if we want to deal with angle greater than pi over two, we need a new idea. And I think yesterday we heard talk of Bernard, and then you know. Of Bernard, and then you know, for Stokes wave, it's uh unstable, so I don't know how this all relates to each other. So I think
