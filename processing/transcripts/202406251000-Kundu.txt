All Noetherian rings, this will hold true, and the homotopy theory, which is defined by some pointwise limit, they will match up for all regular Noetherian rings. So the way to prove this, so first of all, notice that this is some sort of like an algebraic statement. It talks about projective modules over this ring, projective resolutions, and stuff like that. Although the proof will involve The proof will involve some geometry, some P1 geometry. So, first of all, depending on what you like, the Visage or Purity, it tells us that if we look at the morphism from K-theory of the P1 of this ring and we look at the affine space, we restrict to that the fiber of this. Of this. So these are perfect complexes which are supported at the infinite one. And in fact, there is a push forward for K-theory. When we are in the regular setting, we can push forward along any finite or amplitude morphisms and proper finite or morphisms, which the infinite section is. So this actually gives a fiber sequence for K-theory. So this is the first step. We use regular here, and then the next. Here. And then the next step, what we want to realize if this push forward is actually part of a direct sum of the K-theory. So this one, so what we will write, so from direct sum of k-theory two times to k of p1r because if we look at perfect complexes over p1 there is a semi-orthogonal decomposition which is split so actually we can do We can do if we take pi to be the usual map, the structure morphism of P1, we actually get an equivalence over there. And this is called the so-called projective line formula for K-theory. And since this push forward is a direct summand, we notice using these two, this one actually holds for any ring, the projective bundle formula. The projective bundle formula. So, because of these two properties, we get what we wanted. So, even though we started, we wanted to prove some statement about homological algebra, if we use some geometry, we deduce this. So, that will be the theme of this talk. Yes? Somehow, the second line seems like the most experienced. This one that's like the. That's like the concept of the in fact, that will be because we maybe it was somehow not underlined in the motivic homology. We always enforced that our motivic spectra have this property, this projective bundle formula. This is somehow it encapsulates all the things we want in a motivic spectrum, like in a homology theory. And K-theory does. I don't want to speak more about that. It comes from the semi-orthogonal decomposition of the category over here. Of the category over here. And it's split, like we get a split per dia sequence, it's an additive invariant, and we get this. So, anyway, regularity was important at this step. We could, we possibly are, one way to look at it is we are using the theorem of the heart. So, the first statement can be phrased in terms of any stable infinity, presentable stable infinity category. But the proof will not go through because we need this notion of regularity, so which means it needs to have a bounded T structure. Means it needs to have a bounded T structure that only holds when the ring is regular. So, we need to do that. So, anyway, there's some geometry at play. And so, what I want to say is, as we noticed, the fact that it is Noetherian played no role. Regularity did, but Noetherian didn't. So, we are going to try to remove this hypothesis as much as possible. And so, in fact, So in fact this this isomorphism holds for any I'm gonna explain what they mean in a second, but I'm gonna throw in a bunch of words simply coherent ring. So these rings are highly Are highly non-Newherian. So, what does it mean? First of all, so weakly regular should be thought of in some way as regular in the sense of quillence. So, any coherent module has a finite projective resolution. So, and we want weakly regular. We want to enforce that the length be at most the flat dimension of the ring. So, there is a bound. So, projective dimension of any module is bounded uniformly. Regular rings are weakly regular, hence the name. Coherent means that the R as a module over itself is coherent. And stably means that so a ring is coherent if it is a module, coherent module over itself. So stably means we can take any polynomial algebras, they will still land in the coherent. They will still land in the coherent world. So, we want this property to be stable because in this property, we want all of them to be coherent in some sense so that the proof passes through. So, that's exactly what we need. And for any coherent module, finitely finite presentation. Actually, yeah. For any modular finite presentation. So, for example, regular rings are here. For example, regular rings are here, but also there's another class of rings which are valuation rings. These are rings with some valuation induced on it, not necessarily discrete. And the only case when these rings are noetherian are when they are discrete. So these rings, nevertheless, they are weakly regular, stably coherent. Stably coherent. That is because one of the cool properties of these rings is if you take any finitely generated ideal, they are principal. So it's either an ideal is infinitely generated, like the maximal ideal. If the maximal ideal is finitely generated, it's principal, hence it's a discrete valuation ring. So either ideals are infinitely generated, possibly uncountable basis, or they are just principles. So that is because if we have a finite number of elements, If we have a finite number of elements in the generators, by using the relation of valuation, which gives a partial order, we get one generator. We can just shrink to one thing. So, this actually forces that if we have any torsion-free module over a valuation ring, it's actually flat. So, the disparity between them, it actually vanishes. So, it kind of makes sense to do computative algebra over valuation rings, even when it's not Noetherian anymore. Sorry, it's a do you mean versus? Do you mean versions of finite rank? No, I mean anything. But you're right. In order to have a uniform bound, we need finite rank. Yeah. Because we want this bound. Yeah, sure. So we can talk about, it makes sense to talk about smooth algebras of valuation rings. They form in this class. Valuation rings they form in this class. So, we will be working with these kinds of rings. In fact, we'll be doing algebraic geometry over them. I'll try to convince you that it's okay to do that. And third fact that maybe you are thinking what happens. So, this class of rings, I want to make sure just to tell you, we have not, this is not some crazy notion. Because recalling what I think Elden spoke about yesterday, if R is the thing. Noetherian excellent bring over a field then if the Kn, so Kn is I think dimension of the ring plus one, let's say finite dimension, yeah, neither n yeah, essential finite dimension. Yeah, essential finite dimension. If this thing, so one homotopy group of the one K group is the same for all n, then R is regular. So this is the so-called VOST conjecture. Now it's a theorem. So there is the authors perfect view. The authors, I think, over a field, so it always contains a perfect field, right? Because I think it's okay, as stated. We don't need finite type, we don't need that. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Plus some epsilon. No, I think it's true when the residue field satisfies this is finite for all X in spec R. So anyway, this plus some. So, anyway, this plus some epsilon hypothesis. So, we don't need perfect field finite type anymore. This, in the case where it contains rational numbers, is a theorem due to Cortinius, Hassemeyer, and Weibel. This was generalized by Kerrstrunk and Tama. But the way they prove it, they start with some Neuterian excellent ring and then they leave the world. They go into the world of valuation rings and they come back and they prove this conjecture. So, this is just to tell you: if even if we are interested in Even if we are interested in a smaller class of Noetherian rings, it makes sense sometimes, in fact, it's beneficial to go to the class of valuation rings. And the way, one way to do that is if we start with some surface of dimension two, we can subsequently blow up at every point. If we continue this process infinitely many times, we land in the world of valuation rings. In fact, I think we need to make a choice. I see, but we can make a choice where we get a valuation ring, right? Yeah, so I see, I see. Sure, no, I'm just gonna do that. So let's take this opportunity to mention the following conjecture: ancient conjecture. Conjecture, ancient conjecture of Zariski. Any evaluation ring is intregular. So it's a filtered collimate of regular local rings. This is the conjecture. And so the idea, this is called the Zariski's uniformization conjecture. This sort of like the local version of resolution of singularities. Resolution of singularities. His idea, how to solve it before Hirunaka did it, was to solve this locally for everything and then patch it up somehow to get a resolution. That's not how Hirunaka did it, I think. But anyway, so this conjecture remains widely open beyond the cases where we know resolution of singularities. So known cases is if we know resolution of singularities this is weaker than the result. This is weaker than the risk in. I see. I see. I see. Yeah. Thanks for that point. Could you repeat the comment? I can't hear anything that's said by anything other than you, by anybody other than you. They can only hear what the speaker says. Could you confirm if you hear so? I can repeat. So, this is weaker than the Zariski uniformization conjecture, where the rings that appear in this in the That appear in this system, they have to be sub-algebras of the valuation ring, which I do not enforce in this statement that I write over here. Is that okay? That was the comment. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. So, okay, cool. So, anyway, coming back in characteristic zero, we know this conjecture holds true. But in characteristic P, we don't know this conjecture yet. It remains one. Lecture yet. It remains wide open in mixed characteristic. It's even worse. We don't know if this is, but it makes sense in the mixed characteristic. If we know this, do we get resolution of singularities? Yes, it is just says no. So Anyway, if we believe this conjecture, then if we have any property that we expect to be true for regular rings, then it just passes to a property over valuation rings over smooth over valuation rings just by some inductive argument. Just by some inductive argument. So, the property we will be talking about is Gersten's injectivity. I'll mention precisely what I mean by that, but in general, any sort of injectivity of Comology theories, etc., if it's supposed to be true for regular local rings by limit argument, they just pass. If we believe this conjecture to be true, so because we know in mixed. Because we know in mixed characteristic, we don't know the status of this conjecture, it's interesting to bypass this and prove it nonetheless. Okay, so another cool fact. So, this is something, so the CDS topology got spoken about quite a bit of times, and I am afraid nobody mentioned what it is. So, I'm just gonna take one minute what it is. So, it's some growthhendic topology where the pre-topology. Authentic topology, where the pre-topology is generated by two kinds of coverings. So, the Nisnevich ones, we admit Nisnevich local statement, and the so-called abstract blow-up squares. So, the things where it looks like a blow-up square. We blow up at a point at a regular locus, so some closed sub-scheme, and then at the complement, this is an isomorphism. So, these are abstract blow-up squares. So, we let, so CTS topology is generated by that. So, the nice thing about this topology is. So, the nice thing about this topology is when resolution of singularities is true, if we believe that to be true, then anything in this topology, there is a cover by a smooth theme because we can take the modification. And so, any CDH sheaf can be calculated just by looking at its values at the non-singular skins, the smooth ones. At least if we believe this to be true. At least if resolution of singularities is true. Solution of singularities is true. But what happens? Valuation rings appear as maybe I should mention Hencelian, Hencelian valuation ring appear as the local rings in the CDH topology. This is This is sort of intuitively because we let successive blow-ups. So, even if we start with some noetherian situation, we end up in a situation where we are non-noetherian. The local rings are non-noisying. All right. Okay. So far, so good. This is the background. All. So, what has been done? Just to recap. Just to recap about all the filtrations that we saw yesterday in the two talks, this KH has a motivic filtration from the slices. So KH is something represented by a spectrum in SH, this stable homotopy category. There's the tate motif. By you tensoring with the tate motif, we get a filtration of the whole category. A filtration of the whole category. There are right adjoints, anyways. It gives us a canonical filtration on the whole category. They are called the slices. And KH has a nice slice filtration, which is canonical. And it's not like some postnikov filtration or something. So the graded pieces of this filtration AH are LA1. Which is also L A1 is the homotopy K theory. So we take K theory and we take the co limit over all the polynomial algebras over it, and then we take the geometric realization. So we just force K theory to be a one invariant. H stands for homotopy. Yeah, so Sorry, yeah, sorry, I forgot. So, anyway, this KH, this has a motivic filtration given by the slices Poibotsky conjectured, proved by Mark Levin of the existence. Anyway, there is a filtration on this. This is part one. Okay, maybe I should mention, even though conjecturally. I should mention: even though conjecturally there was an existence of this thing, it was not clear that the negative parts of the filtration vanishes, which we kind of expected from to start with. This was conjectures due to Wybotsky. We needed the work of Bachmann, Eldin, and Matthew Morrow to solve this so that the negative pieces actually vanished. So now, at the present day, we understand what the filtration looks like, but it was complicated at the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Can you just remind me what the LA1 symbol means? Yeah. So I'll try to do a good job. So we have, so let's say I do it. So let's say I do it for a K and this is going to be whole limit over the simplest shell. Over the simplest as some sort of simplicis given by the simplicial structure with the diagrams, etcetera. We take the collimate point wise for any ring and we end up in this, and this is called. End up in this, and this is called the Kh of R by definition. That's what that symbol means. Right. So yeah, we can put it in any spectrum. So we get this. Yeah. Thanks for that question. So there is a filtration. Okay. So if the second point on the motivic side, not on the A1 invariant motivic, but the motivic. Not on the A1 invariant motivic, but the motivic side, there is a filtration as S mentioned yesterday by and even Elden did by this algebraic higher algebraic cycle. So there are the cycle complexes. Let's say this is a Dedekind domain and we are smooth over a Redekin domain. So for these kind of things, so first of all, because we are in the smooth setting, the K of X and K of X and the Kh of X, as I show, I show it for rings, but let's say this is affine. So there is an isomorphism like this. There is the slice filtration on Kh. There is the cycle complex. So some shapes of the cycle complex gives a filtration on K of X as Log defined and studied by Mart Levin. So in fact, this isomorphism upgrades to an isomorphism of Upgrades to an isomorphism of filtered complexes. So, I want to write that whatever I said upgrades to an isomorphism of filtered complexes. The higher calculus are the homotopic groups, but now one of the chow degree. Yes, so yes. So from this upgradation of filtered complexes, what I want to point out is there is the interaction between algebraic cycles, the world of algebraic cycles as seen by the filtered pieces of K of X and the stable A1 homotopy category of the X. A1 homotopy category of the X. So there's an interaction showing there's something deep going on. So at this generality, so far, so good. So what, just to give a recap of what Jess spoke about yesterday, this filtration, so this cycle complexes, actually, they are not co-homological in some sense. They are more, they seem more homological. So in fact, they gave a filtration on G theory. Secretly, G and K theory are the same thing. So it doesn't matter for smooth. Same thing. So it doesn't matter for smooth things, but for non-smooth quasi-compact, quasi-separated in that context, we don't get a filtration as we expect. We don't have the functor reality. So we need to define filtration in some other way. That's what was done. And there is this filtration now. And we are going to call, I mean, I wrote the mode before, but because, yeah, just some little cheating going on. So these are the filtered pieces, the graded pieces. Graded pieces, graded J of K theory are this motivic complexes. So there's now some different filtrations that have been defined by and we are trying to understand this. Okay, sorry, so you've got the stable version, unstable version. Yeah. But this this definition is very new. Like it's a Is very new. Like it's this year. It's some unstable thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's, it's when we are in the smooth case, it's the one that that was found by block. So it's extending to the whole thing. So the reason I'm doing this is, as I told you, I'm working in the scope of rings which are not necessarily regular Noetherian. So they are non-Noetherian. So I need to get away from that world in order to talk about all the filtration. In order to talk about all the filtration. So I am going to ask this question. Let's take if R is such that K of R is the same as K H of R. As k h of r. As we saw, there this weakly regular stably coherent rings form an plus where there is an isomorphism like this. Then does star upgrade to a filtered isomorphism. Does it respect filtration on each side? Does it respect filtration on each side? So now we can ask this question because this one has been defined. Previously, we could not even ask this question as in this generality. Now, at this level, we have filtration on both sides. So, once again, I want to point out this one is some homological algebra. We expect the homological algebra to somehow influence the geometry, or maybe the geometry to invoke the other way. So, this is not some crazy thing. What happens? Crazy thing. What happens is this. If we are over Q schemes, this motivic filtration they actually split because they are eigenspaces of the atoms operations. Because they split, these are all split graded pieces. They're direct sums. So this holds true if and only if the filtrations at the level of graded things, there's an isomorphism. So over Q schemes, these two statements are equivalent. Does it make sense? So we want to do. So, we want to do in characteristic, yeah. So, you're saying that these atoms operations are clearly preserved by whatever the hell it is that's going on here. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Scheme is over Q, as far as I know. We don't. Tensor with Q. Tensor with I. The first one, how about the filtered ones? Filtered one also modulo P we can do that. I see. Ah, okay. Cool. Yeah, okay schemes. Is that fine? Okay, thank you. So what I I want I was hesitating whether to mention this, who to attribute this question to, definitely didn't come to me first. Definitely didn't come to me first. So, let me say in the paper, I saw a version of this context. So, in this paper, they asked a special case of this question where R is smooth algebra over a perfect smooth over a perfect FP algebra. So, in that case, they ask the following question, which I generalize. The following question, which I generalize because now we have a better hold of all this motivic homology thanks to tests in the mix characteristic per se. So, I'm asking this broader question, but I am to attribute it to them. So, what is known of this question? So, first of all, I give you some answers. So, answers first part is In the paper with Matthew, Elden showed that they indeed upgrade to a filtered equivalence. The graded pieces match up for smooth over a field. Equi-characteristic case when we are Noiderian, this is okay, that has been verified. In fact, this one, I think. In fact, this one, I think this one is kind of a, I think this one is quite deep already. It sort of evokes a lot of A1 homotopy and all this syntomic homology and it boils down to showing something, if I understand correctly. If we look at the differential forms of the ring R and the differential forms of A1 of R, they are very different. The only way these two are the same if the thing is zero. Like if we take this. Is zero like if we take this L A1 of the differential forms and we do it, it becomes zero. So it boils down to some fact like that. So anyway, just a fun fact. So this case has been done. And the second case, I want to mention the authors themselves. They prove it for R smooth over perfect. Perfect valuation ring of characteristic peak. So, this is an opportunity to talk about some other known cases of this conjecture. If you want me to- I have a question. I'm sorry. So, in what sense are you like K is a thing that you can apply to any ring? In what sense do these filtrations just exist on K? Exist on k or kh independently of the ring. Is this what you're trying to get at overall with this whole picture? So there's a functorial filtration. So for any ring, if we so. Now you've got this map. You've got this. Oh, this star only exists for certain input rings. And now you're trying to check. You've got the K and the KH. These are two things that are defined. You can only compare them sometimes. You can always compare them, but it's not always an isomorphism. But we don't know that that map is filtration preserving. Map is filtration preserving, except in special cases. Oh, that doesn't work. The whole thing is. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, thank you for that question. I didn't mention. So they prove this for smooth over perfect valuation ring in characteristic P. So how does the proof go? So I lied here that the only known case is in characteristic 0. Case is in characteristic zero. There's a part two which is not very broad. So instead of using resolution of singularities, we can use De Yong's alterations, namely the Temkin's P alterations. If the fraction field of the valuation ring is, let's say, if the valuation ring V is perfect, its fraction field does not have any non-trivial P power covers. In that case, if we use P alterations, where P is the residue characteristic, can be mixed, then Then this conjecture actually is verified. So, because this conjecture is true, any perfect valuation ring is int regular, int smooth. So, we can use this, we can reduce to this case. So, the two implies one. Sorry, one implies two because of the conjecture, because of the known case of the conjecture. But, like I said, in general, we don't know if valuation rings are int regular. int regular. So it widely this question even for smooth algebras over valuation ring this is widely open and that's what we want to focus on today. So I'm going to write down the theorem that we have So, if this is this one, is I should say work in progress. So, this might not be the best way, this might not be the optimal hypothesis, and it's probably not. N is probably not, but I want, I don't want to make mistakes, so I want to be careful in what I state. So, hopefully, this is true in this generality as I state. Valuation ring with n infinite residue field possibly mix characteristic could be characteristic as well. We have a smooth scheme over the spectrum. We suppose that Zj mode, I'm gonna write and I'm going to explain L A1 ZJ mode of V prime holds true for For any valuation ring z prime then z j mod of my scheme x is the same as the other one. Yes, yes, because it's known for regular things. Yeah, yes, definitely. Definitely. And I want, maybe I will mention some comments at the end. We think we know how to prove this. So this is not a conditional statement. This is actually, we can remove this. It should be true. So anyway, but for the meantime, what we want to focus on is this conditional state. This conditional statement right now. And to help you read, this one are the filtered, the graded pieces of the K side. The other one, LA1, is the KH side. And there should be an equivalence like this. That's what it's saying. So the question was about some rings where could have singularities, could have something. But because I'm doing algebraic geometry, it's hard to do algebraic geometry. Geometry is hard to do algebraic geometry over a perfect ring or anything. As I said, valuation rings are very reasonable. We can do algebraic geometry over them. And therefore, we have this theorem. So, in fact, I'm going to use some sort of a tool that many of us, some of us know here, is sort of a tubular neighborhood kind of a statement, some presentation lemma, which helps us reduce problems from the smooth over some base case to just squeeze the thing into the base thing. Squeeze the thing into the base thing. So it's sort of like if you know Gilly-Levin statement of the Gustan injectivity, it's sort of like that, or that's how it works over growth and dictator conjecture as well. Yes, you've worked on that. Yeah. So this one is because I am being careful. So I think we don't need infinite residue field. The current proof that I have of the presentation lemma. Of the presentation lemma, you will see I bootstrap it from the Gabers presentation lemma, and Gaber's presentation lemma is a statement about infinite residue fields. But there are things in the literature which could be used as a replacement. So I will talk about this in more detail later, but it's just me being pedantic, being very careful. So we are working on this to remove that hypothesis. Okay, so this. Okay, so this is the theorem. And as I told you, we are going to do some geometry to prove this. So first, I will mention the key things that are required to prove this. I have 20 minutes. The key steps, the key ingredients in the proof. So, what we are going to do is define this n of x to be the fiber of. Of CJ mode to E L A one We take this, we hope this is zero. So now any reasonable sort of motivic homology theory, so to speak, has the following properties. So we know that first of all, n of x commutes with limits of schemes or co-limits of rings as you prefer. This always, so these kind of things will help us reduce to the local case something like that helps us use limit limit arguments in our proof. n of x is this name is sheaf. Name it sheaf. That is because each of the things here are, and we are just taking the fiber. So these kind of things will help us reduce to the case of tensileization of the local ring of X, stuff like that. That's how it used. And the most important point is this has the P1 bundle formula. This is the formula. This is the formula that the n of p1 will be a direct sum of n of x, direct sum n of x, so two copies of n of x. Something that let us that I presented at the beginning, which helped us prove in the regular case this isomorphism. So these are very, all of these properties are very reasonable to ask and they do satisfy this. So using one and And to it suffices to establish that n of OXXH is equal to 0. So, the Hensalization for any point over here. So, the key idea is: I come back, is the gust. Back is the gust and injectivity. As I promised, I will speak about it. So, basic idea is the following. So, Gaussian injectivity is sort of it says that homology groups or homology sets injects inside homology sets of the fraction field. So, what it takes, like a complicated. What it takes like a complicated ring, and it says everything just is a Galois homology class or something like that. That works for G torsors. But here we are working about this N of X is a little crazy. The reason we want to do this is in the equi-characteristic case, it's known, namely for fields, it's known. So we want to reduce to the case of fields. We start with a complicated mixed characteristic ring and we want to show this is true. So that's what we want to do. What we want to do, and so we have assumed that n of v prime equals to 0 for any evaluation ring v prime. So it suffices to show that To show that h i of n of O X X H injects inside H I of N of V for some evaluation ring V prime because we expect because we have assumed that N is the zero thing so the homology group they vanish hence this will vanish as well. So that's what we reduce to the case. Well, so that's what we reduced to the case. So we will reduce to the case of valuation rings, and that's how I used. So the underlying geometry of what is happening, I am going to write it down. So we are doing geometry over valuation rings. The spectrum of valuation rings is very simple. If it's a finite rank, it's just a finite chain, totally ordered chain of prime ideals. So it's sort of, if we have a valuation ring, just Evaluation ring just looks like this, something like this. And if we look at X for me, it looks something smooth, but it has this special fiber and then generalization, and then it goes on. And then there's the generic fiber like this. Totally ordered, everything looks like this. So, something happens if we localize at any of the points generic points of the special fiber, you notice. You notice it's also a linearly ordered chain. In fact, it's a spectrum of a valuation ring. This we already know. So, what we are going to do is localize at a point like that. And this will be our claimed V prime. That's why we cannot assume it for V or something. Some V prime will be explicitly given by localization over here. So, that's why we can do algebraic geometry. In fact, doing algebraic geometry over valuation rings is sort of general. Rings is sort of generalization over there. We can use a lot of Bertini kind of slicing arguments. We can use all these things. And these are the things that makes lets us do all the techniques that I'm using right now. So we wanted to show some sort of injectivity like this. We are going to use limiting arguments to show to reduce to the case by spreading out. By spreading out, it suffices to show that if Z belongs to Hi of N of X, where X could be our thing or it could be some localization of our scheme. If we have a class over here which vanishes away from some closed subscheme, we can assume it's like a relative Cartier divisor. It's like a relative Cartier divisor in some cases. So if this vanishes, then v equals to zero to start with. So now we have reduced to a geometric statement about vanishing of some class, etc. So this is the main theorem. And I have to mention This is the heart and core of this project. It is the following. So I'm writing, it's called a lemma because I guess Gaber called it so, or maybe Quillen called it so, but it's really a theorem in algebraic geometry. It's like the heartache called bread and butter of my life. So that's actually true. So presentation lemma. So when Quillen wanted to show the Gustan injectivity for K-theory, he realized he needs some sort of a geometric statement like that. And then it was generalized by Gaber in the famous presentation Lemma. And then I have to mention a lot of names. I just don't know how many people. I just don't know how many people I should mention. Let's say dot dot dot. And then I have to mention Castothesis Ward, who wrote down a presentation lemma in the mixed characteristic over discrete valuation rings. And then, so I generalized that over valuation rings. And then here, we are going to use similar arguments. If not, we derive. If not, if not, we derive from this result. So, this is my thesis. So, what happens? What did we actually prove? And so, here I will not give you all the statements. I'll give you the statement that's relevant for us. We are only interested in Nisnevich local. We're not interested in Zariski local if you know what I'm talking about. So, I'll give you the Nisnevich local statement. So, given, so X is as follows: X is as what we did, V. V V as same but finite rank. By a limit argument, we reduce to the case of finite rank. So for stating this, I need finite rank infinite residue field. Given a point X in X, Nisnevich locally Nisnevich locally around X, there exist so-called geometric presentations. So bear with me, it's a little technical statement, rather technical statement A D minus one I smooth relative dimension one Such that when I restrict to the close Z, this one is finite. So, some of you will know that this finiteness is extremely important. So, this plus one more, this one is much less hard than the ensuring that it is finite. Yeah, I mean, I mean finite over the image. I mean finite over the image of this map. Yeah? Sure, sure, sure. I mean, technically speaking, I should be taking an S, some open inside there, and then I mention the statement. But this morphism, actually, the reason I write this because this one is given by hyperplane sections of the whole scheme. So the map makes sense. It's just, it's not as we expect. It's just not as we expect because we need to localize Zariski locally when we write everything. So we'll have an S over there, okay? So it's the same S A1. This is given by Psi and theta. This one will be taught and such that when I restrict psi n theta to Z we get closed embedding. Closed embedding. So, in particular, what this produces to us is Annishnevit square. So, I am going to erase. So if x is not in z, we can take the complement of z. And then the statement, this one is blank, right? So the interesting point is when x lies in z. But does it make sense? If you want, yes, yes, that's the interesting case. Yes. So, okay, in particular. There exists Nisnevit square. So basically, this Nibish locally on the source, we can On the source, we can produce a Nisnevich square. So, there is this Z will be embedded inside A. So, since what we wanted to show is some sort of vanishing of the class, etc., and we have Nisnevich descent, by using the presentation lemma, we will reduce. Sorry, I should say A1 of S. So, if we have an inclusion like this, we need one more step, I guess. Inclusion like this, we need one more step, I guess. So, because we have Nisnevich descent, by using the trivial torsor on the complement of this thing, by using the trivial class on the complement of this, we can glue together and we get a class over the A1. That's how. Maybe it's confusing like this. Here's a pullback square. Of pullbacks per yes. So, this is how the whole game goes. So, I want to mention a few remarks. So, you should think of Nisnevich, this sort of a presentation lemma as a simultaneous neuter normalization, where we do it for x and z at the same time. Or we could also think of this as some sort of tubular neighborhood kind of a thing. So, even though z is possibly singular. Though Z is possibly singular, we eta locally, there is a t-buller neighborhood where we can embed it inside this. And so we can play with the game with the affine line, et cetera, over there. But then we really need some projective bundle formula to push through. So that is where that last step is used. But otherwise, we haven't used projective bundle formulas so far. And all right. So, any questions regarding the theorem or the basics? Regarding the theorem or the basic structure of the proof, do I have a few minutes? I have a few minutes. So you're reducing to affine space. Is that the point? Is that the point? Well, actually, we go to P1. The idea is to go to P1 by using the projected bundle formula. The same way as we did. The same way as we did in the proof of the A1 invariance for K theory and Kh. Like we will glue with some trivial class on the complement of the fine line and then we produce some P1. So that sort of, if you are interested, Kesutis has some really nice articles about this when he focuses on G torsors. So my thesis was on G torsus, so I keep on saying torsors, but you can play the game with But you can play the game with abelian objects like this motivic uh humotopy kind of stuff as well. We explained this earlier. The P1 bundle formula is basically equivalent to saying that the K1 value is the same as the K1. It's not equivalent. It's not because we use the theorem of the heart over there and we use regularity over there, right? So in general, we don't have that step. So here we are. So, here we are proving A1 invariance using the projected bundle formula. Like typically, in this Gersten kind of thing, sometimes people use A1 invariance to show Gersten or something. So, we have reversed the game and we are doing this. In fact, this sort of a thing is written down in Kolyothelin, Hubler, Khan, where they show the whole gust and complex is exact by using the presentation lemma of Gaber and the idea. Lemma of Gaber and the idea, so it works. So that is the Blochogas problem. The Kuzan complex is exact. So the underlying thing is the presentation lemma. This one. So now we have Gaber's presentation lemma over finite fields. We have a lot of versions. So there is a canonical one in the equi-characteristic. This one is assuming over a field. And then some people have worked in the mixed characteristic, notably Kesthetis did. And so I generalized to valuation rings. Generalize to valuation rings. So that was my contribution. So since we have a few minutes, let me mention, like maybe in a relaxed fashion, what happens in valuation rings. So what I tried to do is with Elden today morning, being motivated by Max, tried to compute some examples and I horribly failed. Like try to convince you in a hands-off fashion why this K and Kh. This K and Kh, the filtered thing should the motivic one and the maybe for J equal to one or something like that. So the reason I failed is this following funny quote from Friedlander, where he says that Wullen played a nasty trick on us. This is his quote. I'm not saying this. Because he produced very interesting invariants with which we fail to make even the most basic calculations. And thankfully, because we have developed this whole thing. Because we have developed this whole theory of K business, because they are so hard to compute. Hopefully, motivic complexes are more easier to compute. In fact, these motivic things, there's some relationship with arithmetic, right? There's until some value, there is some ethal cohomology. So we should expect them to be more computable. And anyways, so for the valuation rings, so if we restrict to Henselian valuation rings, as I mentioned, they are local for the CD. As I mentioned, they are local for the CDH topology. So, if we are looking at the CDH complex, localized complex, this we don't need to C55 over there. And the result that the motivic one and the LA1 motivic just sort of follows. But for general valuation rings, we need to use some sort of excision, some sort of Nisnevich excision, which we can do in our case to prove for all valuation rings. So, that's our that's what we can say. That's what we can say to make this unconditional. But there is one subtlety that I didn't mention: this concept of F smoothness that Tess spoke about. In equal characteristic, everything is F smooth. But in mixed characteristic, the F smoothness is not the same as conjecturally. F smoothness is the same. It should all the valuation ring should be F smooth. This is implied by Zariski's uniformization conjecture, but see. But since we don't know, we don't know whether it's true or not. So we need to ensure that the valuation rings with which we are playing the game is sort of F smooth. I like to call this the schemes need to be CDH locally F smooth. So in the CDH topology, the local rings are Hinselian valuation rings. They should be F smooth. And then we can show everything just makes sense. So we are playing with this. I wanted to mention this. And yeah, that's all I wanted. Yeah, that's what I wanted to speak about. Thank you for your attention. Any questions? Does it matter if you do it only the same? So still then I think it's not going to work right we need to so the point is like you you know that the whole point is we are going to use Bertini kind of argument that holds for projective schemes because every time and here we are working in a in a sort of In a sort of fiber. So, what we will do is we want to bootstrap from the special fiber where we know Gabber's presentation lemma. So, every time we need to ensure that there is a projective compactification that is okay, Zariski locally. But what we need is some sort of projective compactification, but we need the special fiber of this X to be dense in the special fiber of the compactification, which is not automatic because this is not a flat-based chain. Because this is not a flat-based change. So there is some subtlety there. If we knew this, we'll have a very good presentation lemma in mixed characteristics, right? So, but we don't have that. We can do that Nisnevich locally. That's the idea of Watarukai's moving lemma, and that's what used by Schmidt, Strunk, and your paper as well. So I guess, yes. But maybe we can, we don't need to. Sure. Sounds good.
