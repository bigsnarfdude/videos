And in addition, there's even a chance that these bacteria can find themselves in an aquatic environment. So, bacteria are really, you know, they need to collect information about all of these different niches in order to adapt appropriately. And even the conditions within one niche can fluctuate quite dramatically. So, here I've kind of depicted the change between drought and the flooding, which could arrive next day. So, they also need to collect. So they also need to collect information not only about the niche but also about the environmental conditions. So how do bacteria kind of adapt? Well, you all know that they will change their state, and they can do this by changing gene expression, depending on the kind of adaptive response that they show. It might be just kind of turning on one gene or a couple of genes, but there can also be more dramatic changes where these bacteria are undergoing cell differentiation. Bacteria are undergoing cell differentiation, for example, from a sestile cell to a motile cell, or in the case of sporulation, when the conditions are really bad, these bacteria also have the ability to form these dormant little endospores.  In the child genius, you find these more complex systems, which are called two-component systems, and are comprised of a histidine kinase, which is typically found in the membrane. And it will autophosphorylate in response to a signal, and then it will transfer this phosphate to the response regulator, which again then is undergoing some changes that are. Some changes that are influencing its ability to bind to in A, or in the case of the chemotaxis system, to bind to the flagella motor. Now, in addition to these classical systems, there are also a class of proteins that can interfere with these signaling systems, and I'm going to be calling them modulator proteins. And there are two types: binding modulators, which simply bind to those response regulators, and they're Regulators and then will sequester the regulator and in this way interfere with signaling. Or in the case of a two-component system, there are also enzymatic modulators for most phosphatases, which can then bind to the response regulator and disphosphorylated. And also these binding modulators in some cases are being regulated by signalling by certain queues, by certain signals. Cues by certain signals. Now, let's come to the quantum sensing systems or auto-inducer signaling. So, it turns out that there are some molecules which bacteria make themselves and which they release into the environment. And these are called auto-inducers because these molecules are made by the cells and they auto-induce the cells. And since we have all of these different kinds of architectures which can be used for sensing, Used for sensing signaling molecules. This is also true for this audio inducer signal, where we have, you know, audio-inducers which bind to the one component through transcription factors directly. This is kind of the famous Lux IR corn sensing system in LibreOfficiery, for example, that I'm sure that many of you know. But there are also other systems where we have the odd inducer binding here to the histidine kinase and then triggering a phosphorylation-based cascade. And also, there are And also, there are auto-inducer signaling molecules which are binding to these modulators. So, there's a quite rich way of sensing and detecting odd end user molecules. Now, what are these bacteria kind of sensing and using these odd-inducer signaling circuits for? Well, the common notion is that they are being used for what is called quantum sensing. So, in essence, the idea is that you have a So, in essence, the idea is that you have a cell which is producing this on-end user molecules. And as there are more cells, they're going to be more signals. And upon reaching a critical concentration limit, the audio-user molecules will then trigger a cellular response and turn on the so-called quorum response. And so, this quorum sensing, in its traditional way, is about Why is about kind of sensing cell densities and regulating population behavior in a coordinated synchronized fashion in a bacterial population? Now, this was first discovered more than 50 years ago, first actually in gram-positive bacteria, but I think the more beautiful example is this bioluminescence that is produced by some marine bacteria, including ripier fishery, which can light up the sea if these bacteria. To see if these bacterial populations are at high cell density. Now, there are also, while I guess it's not maybe so easy to rationalize of why bacteria should control bioluminescence in a cell density-dependent manner, there are also other things which are being controlled by chrome sensing, and that's foremost the production of exofactors such as antibiotics or virulence factors. So, a lot of these. So, a lot of these target genes, which are being regulated by chrome sensing, have something to do with host-microbe interactions, which is why a lot of the research in the biology field is kind of also interested in these quantum sensing systems. In addition to this, quantum sensing or audio-inducer regulatory circuits are also involved in regulating all kinds of horizontal gene transfer, conjugation, competence development. But also, in addition, cell development. But also, in addition, cell differentiation. I will talk a little bit about these spores and also in the formation of these more complex fruity biofilm-like structures that these bacteria can make. So now, why are these behaviors regulated by an audio-inducer circuit? I guess the most simplest explanation is being put forward by the production of. By the production of exofactors, where I think this is kind of very easily rationalized. So there is some cost for producing those exofactors, but the benefit that you gain from making these enzymes, since they are acting outside, right, external exo, they need to accumulate in order for them to have a benefit to the bacteria. So, if the concentration of a degradative enzyme, for example, is too little, you won't have enough. You won't have enough of the payoff from substrate being cleaved that you could consume. And if you are interested in this, there's really beautiful work by the lab of Ling Sheng Yu, who has done a lot of this in this direction. Now, for the others kind of responses, which are also being controlled by quantum sensing, it's maybe less obvious of why they should be actually regulated by cell density sensing, and I'm going to be touching on this a little bit in the second part of my talk. Bit in the second part of my talk. Now, for the first part, we're going to stay with this classical quantum sensing idea. And I want to introduce you that these kind of circuits also have, you know, for a long time applications in synthetic biology. Here are a few kind of examples in multicellular computing, in generating model systems to do synthetic ecology, or in advanced biosensors. And these are just kind of a couple examples. There are many, many more. Examples. There are many, many more, but this was kind of about the kind of interesting applications which had been forward when we were starting to work on these systems a couple of years ago. So what you notice is, or what I didn't actually point out, is that all of these circuits which are being used in these advanced biosensors are kind of of this Lux IR type of circuit, which are very simple because you're just going to have some syntase, which is making the signal. You know, some syntase which is making the signal, and then this transcription factor which is responding to the audio and user. Now, nature, however, has much more to offer, right? So I mentioned that we have two component systems as well, right? And we have modulatory proteins that are acting on two component or more complex phosphorylays. And here I'm kind of summarizing the whole zoo of different what we call quorum sensing architectures. Sensing architectures. And if you look from them, not from a biochemical point of view, they are all using different kinds of signals. So here we have homoserine lactones in these kinds of systems. In the down here, we have grown-positive bacteria, which typically use signaling peptides for mediating or induced signaling. But they differ in the type of where the receptor is. Is it inside or is it outside? And they differ in the way of how the signals are being transported. In the case of the homocero lactones, there is. The homosterin lactones, there is passive transport, whereas in the case here of this system, we have a pump which is pumping this peptide into the cell. And then also there is a difference with respect to whether these signals are produced in the way of also of how they are being sensed. This is, for example, the case in these homoserine lactone systems, which also have then a chance for short circuiting. For a short circuiting, whereas in the case of these peptide signaling systems, the peptide that is being produced internally by the cell is a pre-peptide that's then cleaved. And so the modified version, which is sensed is not the one which was actually made intracellular by the cell. So also we can distinguish between single modification, yes or no. And so this was kind of a project that my very first PhD student, Bastian, who was just doing theory. Who was just doing theory and never touched a pipette got interested in. So, how does the differences in these network structures actually affect the ability of these systems for performing, for doing quorum sensing? And so what we kind of did in trying to analyze this is that we adopted a model of view on this system. So we just kind of said, okay, if cell density is really what's important for regulating outputs, as in the For regulating outputs, as in the case, for example, of these exoenzymes, which have a cell density or accumulation-dependent fitness function, which you could probe or simulate by releasing your audient users of whether they are actually sufficient to accumulate to sufficient levels in the environment. Then it's kind of a two-step process, right? So, we encode information of cell density first in a single molecule concentration, and then this is going to be decoded by the signal transduction system. By the signal transduction system into the actual cellular response. And I should mention that there are some feedbacks between the encoding at the decoder and the encoder. However, not all chrome sensing systems do have such feedbacks, and they are actually not required for mediating cell density-dependent responses. So, I'm going to focus, or what Bastian was interested in mostly, was looking into these differences in the encoding. In the encoding. And so, how is cell density being encoded in a concentration of signaling molecules? And how does this affect and depend on the network architecture? So, what he did is then considering kind of a model where we have these basic processes of transport, of modification, and where the signals could actually be sensed. And he made all kinds of possibilities of linking. Of linking these different processes with each other, which resulted in about 116 different combinations, out of which 85% were capable of encoding information about cell density into a single molecule concentration, which basically means that single molecule concentration at the receptor will change, at least in some regime, with single molecule concentration. Now, in some follow-up work, In some follow-up work, we were then kind of interested in trying to rationalize whether there are really also some performance criteria and differences between these architectures for doing quorum sensing. And so again, we are using a very simple, simplistic framework of using these encoding relationships, which we can compute from these very simple ordinary differential equation models. Models, and then a decoding relationship, which in our case was simply a heuristic Michel Elizabethen type of transfer function. Now, the way was not then to come to ask how we could kind of define a performance criteria for quorum sensing. And so, the idea was that what these systems That's what these systems do, right, is that they need to control the target genes and switching on or off at the desired switching point. And so, in order to do this reliably, the cell should be able then to distinguish between different cell density inputs in this desired switching regime. And so, we define something which we call the resolving power, which is kind of the The ability to tell apart two different cell density inputs by having a non-overlapping output distribution of the outputs. And so this resolving power can be very simply defined as basically just being the ratio of the elasticity coefficient, which is kind of the change in the mean output, the change in the relative. The change in the relative mean output as a function of the change in the relative mean input and the noise, which is basically just the relative noise, which is the coefficient of variation. And this is kind of the only formula which I put in my talk because I realized, you know, you guys were doing so much of complicated modeling and theory, and ours is much more simplistic, but I hope from the biological point of view, still kind of interesting. Point of view still kind of interesting. And so here is the only kind of connection which I have in my talk of this resolving power to something that many of you will recognize, which is the kind of the mutual information. So it's kind of a differential measure, which tells you how well you can locally process information. Now that's kind of, if we look into these different architectures of what Bastian saw is then that they have distinct sensitivity and noise. Have distinct sensitivity and noise characteristics. So, here I'm comparing a non-modifying inside sensing system and a non-modifying external sensing systems. And what you can see in this case is that in the solid line, this is the elasticity profile, that there is that this is kind of not able to process information about very low cell density and is will also plateau at high cell densities, while the noise is kind of relatively kind of stable. And this in combination. Of stable. And this, in combination, then gives rise if we combine this into the resolving power. Is that there's going to be like one optimum at a particular cell density. Can I interrupt for a moment? There is a question from the audience. It is, is there a way to relate the resolving power criterion to survival and growth of a cell population? Is there, can you repeat the question? Yes. Is there a way to relate the results? A way to relate the resolving power criterion to survival and growth of a cell population? Can we kind of discuss this question a little later in my talk when I come to kind of connecting the model to the biological data? Then maybe I already will provide an answer to this, and otherwise we're going to be discussing it later on. Okay, so what we So, what we what we kind of so here we have these this the resolving power, which is just kind of a way of how well you can process information in this cell density locally in this cell density, how well can you actually tell apart two different cell densities in this input regime, right? Now, for an external sensing system, here you are not limited with the sensitivity at low cell densities, but Low cell densities, but the noise is going to explode. And basically, then we see the same effect that the resolving power has some optimum in a particular cell density regime. Now, now comes kind of the connection to biology on my next slide. So, I told you before that what these information processing systems do is that they control gene expression, right? And in this case, let's assume that this was a costly exoenzyme. That this was a costly exoenzyme. We want to express the enzyme only under certain conditions, namely when the fitness function is positive, right? When we have more benefit from making the exoenzyme than we have in the cost of making the exoenzyme. And so the target where you have the desired switching point of your system should depend actually on the properties of. Depend actually on the properties of your exoenzyme. So, if you have a more efficient exoenzyme, you can actually afford to switch on early on if you have a less efficient exoenzyme, right? Because it's your benefit. And this is something that we don't quantify. This something kind of assumed implicitly. Now, what we did here, now, in order to kind of then kind of switch at your desired target point, right, your sensory system must be able to kind of tell these two cell densities. Tell these two cell densities apart, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to switch if your information processing system would fail in the cell density regime. So, now what we now Bastian did next, he was kind of taking parameter values from the literature to simulate or model them these natural quorum sensing systems and compute their predicted optimum of information processing and correlating it to the observed cell density of switching on a particular target. Of switching on a particular target function. And I guess this is kind of expected, right? These are systems which work in nature. So there should be kind of a correlation between this. But what was maybe more interesting is that there seemed to be a kind of an architectural cluttering. So we have, you know, the modifying internal sensing system at a more lower cell density, followed by external sensing system. And then here we have the non-modifying internal sensing systems. And of course, all of these. And of course, all of these systems are evolution in one group or in one cluster are evolutionary related, right? So maybe this is just kind of some clustering by accident, by evolution. But on the other hand, perhaps there's also something just with respect to performance. Can I interrupt with a question from the audience? Yeah. Why does the noise decrease with the increase of density? Why does the noise decrease with the increase of density? The increase of density. Okay, you mean in this particular case? Okay, so the reason of why the noise is kind of exploding here is that as our noise model is combined of taking parameter noise, so extrinsic noise, so that there are some fluctuations to transport parameters production and so on. And the other one is that we kind of heuristically also put in some intrinsic noise, which is single molecule noise. Once you get into the regime where you have individual Where you have individuals, where you have to care about that audience users are discrete entities. And so, when you are in this regime here where you have very, very few molecules, then it is kind of this intrinsic noise which is kind of exploding. So, this is why this is kind of going up. Whereas in the case of the non-modifying internal sensing systems, because they have a basal production level and they are short-circuiting, they never, you know, you don't have that explosion. You don't have that explosion because there's always like a basal level of signaling molecules and such, and thus the noise is bounded. Does that answer the question? Yes, it does. Okay. All right. So here we have kind of this kind of interesting clustering. So now the thing that Bastian was looking into next was kind of maybe then these systems are kind of These systems are kind of being limited by their what we call encoder architectures, right? So the modifying internal sensing systems, so kind of by their, by the way of how they encode the system. And so what you can see here is now using some generic parameters of the resolving power for a modifying internal sensing system, for an external sensing system, and then for these NIST systems. And you can already see that they kind of are Are different, right? And they have different kinds of optima. And these dots here that you can see here, these are some computations of the resolving power at the observed quorum using then the parameters for individual quorum sensing system taken from the literature. Now, what we can kind of see is that the MIS is having a really good encoder for low cell densities. And then here at the higher cell densities, we kind of have We kind of have the NIS and the ES, the external sensing system being kind of more or less similar. Now, we saw that there was kind of a sequence from NIST to ESS to NIS in these clusters that we saw in the biological data. And so, when we also included the decoder, where we now basically allow the decoder to optimally tune and optimize. Optimally tune and optimize the resolving power. So basically, your receptor can evolve in order to adjust its affinity so it will optimize the overall resolving power of the overall system. Now, if we do this, then we actually do get in this very simple model to kind of a sequence where the MIS is doing best at low cell density, the ESS are doing at intermediate, and the non-modifying internal systems, they actually, in some regime, would outperform the ESS. Would outperform the ESS systems simply because, in our model, they have a simpler decoder, and thus, the noise of the simpler of the one-step versus the two-step is actually favoring the NIST system in our calculations. So, coming to the conclusion of what we, what I think what we learned from Bastian's work was, on the one hand, that there's a putative design principle that could be interesting for synthetic biologists, so that you should not. So, that you should not maybe just stick to the non-modifying internal sensing system, especially if you aim to engineer cell density sensing at low concentrations. And then you should kind of also perhaps consider that there are other architectures around in nature. Now, the other point that I would like to make is that this correlation here. So, does that actually mean that nature has optimized the quorum sensing architecture to the quorum? To the quorum. Well, perhaps, but I think that this is simply just a correlation which we see here. And you could also read this correlation the other way around. So, what I've shown you is that certain types of quorum sensing system kind of have a performance limit at the lower cell densities, right, for the NIS. So, it could also be that we see this correlation because the quantum sensing architecture constrains the Constrains the evolution of the quorum-sensing target genes. In other words, if you have a mutation which actually would call for an evil, could allow you to even switch at a lower cell density, maybe that mutation wouldn't fix because simply your encoder wouldn't be able to switch at that cell density. So that's kind of, I think, also another interesting way of thinking about this result. And then the one thing that I also personally learned about Bastian doing this project is that it's Doing this project is that it's really hard to find parameters from literature to model these quorum sensing systems. And we took a lot of work, which had been done previously by Ling Shong Yu's lab, where a lot of the parameters, and this is, I think, a caveat of our approach, that these calculations are based on guesstimates. So it's not really measured and it's sometimes estimated, but I think a lot of guessing is still also included. Now, with this, I Now, with this, I would actually kind of say that when we started with this project, and what we had kind of in mind in doing this is the traditional chrome sensing kind of research or kind of also viewpoint, right? And in this viewpoint, we are not only thinking about the bacterial population as being clonal, but they are also all homogeneous and identical in terms of their phenotypes. It's about cell density sensing. About cell density sensing, and in the classical scheme, it's also about having a synchronized quorum response. So, engineer or launching a synchronized population level response. Now, in this research on complex adaptive traits, in particular in B-cetalis, you know, here are snapshots from a culture of B-cetalis where you can see motile cells and incestile cells coexisting in a liquid culture. Here on the right, you see another example where we have divided. See another example where we have dividing cells here in red, and in green, these are sporlating cells. You can see here some white dots as being now these spores which are forming in these mother cells. Now, these kind of behaviors could be adaptive for two reasons. First, there's kind of a potential of division of labor, and there's really nice work from Jordi van Gestel on this particular example. And on the other hand, in this case, here of this correlation, this could be adaptive using. This could be adaptive using a kind of a bad hedging strategy where maladapted phenotypes for one for the current environment are still being produced because they provide a fitness advantage if the environment is changing unpredictably. So heterogeneous population distribution of different phenotypes and this is kind of the idea of that these distributions are actually a trait, a quantitative trait of these bacteria, which is something that we are actually interested. That we are actually interested now very much in my lab. And so we want to understand some of these molecular determinants that give rise to this, and in particular, of how chrome sensing is also involved, or these audient user circuits are involved in doing this. Okay, so one way of how we analyze complex adaptive trait experimentally is by the use of rust and time-lapse microscopy. And I want to show you kind of a really cool movie that was made by my PhD student, Alpa Mutlung, a couple of A couple of years ago. And what you see here is a sporulating multi-colony which is having M cherry under the control of a quorum sensing or audio inducer signaling system. RAP A is a receptor and FERA is a signaling peptide. And what you could see is that as the population was starving, that this was splitting into kind of two populations, the one which were growing and which gave rise to kind of these non-florescent, what we call early. Of these non-frescent, what we call early spores, and the other ones which were delaying sporulation and gave rise to these kinds of frescent of what we call late spores. And now, one cool thing that ALPA can also do is that we can revive these spores by applying new nutrients. And what you can see in this movie is that there's only a subpopulation of these spores which is able to successfully grow out. And these were all non-fluorescent kinds of early spores. Now, what we see here is What we see here is that there is a signaling system which is definitely not organizing a synchronized population response because sporulation is really hetero. So we have spores being made at different times. So we have to kind of go beyond this classical chrome sensing paradigm. First, the population is not homogeneous, it's heterogeneous, and we never, and in some cases, we're controlling. In some cases, we're controlling not a synchronized but a heterchronic or asynchronous population response. Now, we're looking into these communication networks in beat satellites, and one kind of particular type of systems that we are very interested in are these RAP-first signaling systems. And they basically are using what we call a pump-probe signaling system because we are having here a pump which is pumping the peptide in. Which is pumping the peptide inside the cell, and then it's detected by these modulatory proteins, which then are acting on this complex phosphorylay, which is involved in sporulation development. And although these systems are commonly referred as chrome sensing, there's actually very little evidence for a cell density dependent type of regulation. And there have been alternative ideas proposed such that the system could control the timing and kind of a delay circuit. And given now, our And given now our observation that there's also heterogeneous expression of this fur of the signaling gene in a subpopulation of cells, we kind of had the idea that maybe such system could also facilitate information processing in heterogeneous population and do something like composition sensing rather than cell density sensing. All right, so now in order to kind of see whether we can exclude any of these hypotheses, we made a model which we call the pump probe model. Which we call the pump probe model. It's again a phenomenological ODE type of model. The assumptions which we have is that we have a heterogeneous population where we have a sub-population of cells which is present at a particular frequency F, which is making the signal. However, all cells are taking up the signal. And this is expected because this pump here is an oligopeptide permease. It's basically also used by these bacteria for importing all kinds of peptides, yeah, all kinds. All kinds of peptides, yeah. All kinds of peptides are being also for nutritional purposes, so it's not specific to the signal. And we have an exponentially growing population with the same growth rate, and we are considering a well-mixed environment. And we start with different starting ODs or starting cell densities. And here also the transduction model is really simple. Signal uptake with the material is meant to pump kinetics. We have signal degradation and dilution by cell growth. And dilution by cell growth. And then the output is basically assumed that the signal transduction is fast, hence, the output is simply a function of the intracellular signal concentration using a Hill function. Now, what you find when you are doing these simulations is that indeed all of these proposed functions could basically happen. So you can have a quantum sensing regime where the output can be regulated in a response to cell density. We can have density we can have frequency dependent regulation or rastrometric composition sensing where the output will not the steady state output will not depend on the cell density but only on the fraction of signal producing cells in the population and in some cases when this the the signal import is saturated fairly quickly we can implement this kind of chronometric and astocial way of of controlling Of controlling the behavior in the population without having any reference to some density or the composition of the population. And really, the control functions depend on the parameters and the operating conditions. And as often in biologies, these things are not well, not defined, or at least not well defined. So in my lab, we then kind of said, well, maybe we can kind of also study these systems experimentally. Also, studied these systems experimentally. And we do this by using fluorescent resonance energy transfer, which is a very nice way for studying protein-protein interactions in the cell, simply because this fluorescent resonant energy transfer only occurs when these two proteins, when two proteins really interact closely with each other, so that the distance between these two fluorophores is on the order of the first a resonant for first a radius. For frost cursor radios. So, this is kind of depicting our, you know, our design of our forest recorder, which we engineered over the years. And the way of how we are detecting threat is by using so-called acceptor photobleaching experiments. So, basically, what you do is we are recording the CFP signal and then we are bleaching, we're destroying the YFP acceptor. And if you do this just to a cell which is expressing CFP and YFP separately, CFP and YFP separately, nothing happens. However, if you do this to our FRET reporter and we bleach the YFP, we will actually see that the bleaching is resulting in an increased freshness of the CFP because we're unquenching the resonance transfer, and hence we are getting a higher emission on the CFP. And so, this is kind of then this threat efficiency and how we kind of measure it. And what I'm presenting. Measure it. And what I'm presenting now are all population average measurements. Now, the hope was that when we're now applying a stimulus, just kind of this peptide, that this would perturb this interaction and we would see a change in the fret efficiency. And this is indeed what we see. So this is just to kind of convince that this system works. So here we have the fret efficiency of our negative control. This is the unstimulated reporter. Here we are implying. Reporter. Here we are applying the peptide at 10 micromola. We see a drop to about 4% drop, 4% FRED from 10 to 4%. Then we are doing the experiment using kind of a scrambled peptide, some other peptide that should not interact with the receptor, no change in FRED. And we can do some here, we can kind of delete part of this OPP transporter, very little effect, if at all. And then as an additional control, since And then, as an additional control, since this is embedded in a very complex signaling network, which is controlling SPOF, we also make mutations to these kinases to the other signaling network to see that this will actually not perturb our system. So, we made a lot of controls, and all of this is just kind of to say that our reporter specifically reports on for A, and that also we think that the conditions in which we study the systems are physiologically relevant. Systems are physiologically relevant because the signaling is active under these conditions. Now, the nice thing is now that you can do these quantitative measurements, or for example, you know, you do different extracellular simulations, you measure FRED. You can do competition experiments by having different signaling peptides. We can get information about the intracellular dynamics or how the peptides are being depleted from the supernatants. And all of this can actually then be. Can actually then be jointly fit using this very simple pump probe model. And here are kind of the parameters which we get. And you can see here the lines are the fit, and these arrow bars here kind of is our data. And you see that this is actually quite nicely. Now, if you do it in a systems biology kind of fashion, right, then you should kind of use your model also to make some prediction and in this way provide some confidence into your model. And here we now made the prediction. These are the 95% confidence. These are the 95% confidence interval from our model, and you can see that our model, that our data actually fits the prediction quite well, not perfectly, but quite well. So we have reasonable confidence into our model. So now what have we learned? Well, on the first, we see that Fourier is integrated over a relatively long time scale. So the time scale for signal integration is about 50 minutes, and it's determined kind of by both the intracellular degradation. Kind of by both the intracellular degradation and the dilution due to cell growth, roughly contributing equal to this time scale. Because we have these really long time scales, right, there's a large signal amplification going on on extra to intracellular conversion. So here you can see whether we use 10 nanomola on the outside, sorry, yeah, that we used 10 nanomola on the outside, but what we predict to be the intracellular concentration is in the micro. The intercellular concentration is in the micromolar regime, and this is kind of the EC50 in the micromolar regime. So, in addition, we kind of can use this system to prove also of whether the processing is dependent on the cell density of our consuming population, right? So, the idea is very simple, right? If you have these cells which are sucking. And these cells which are sucking up these peptides. And then you have more cells, then these signaling peptides will have to be shared. And so here you can see what if you have the same concentration, but we are increasing the cell density, then we do get as expected a decreased response. And here you see the effect of fixing the cell density and using different concentrations. Now, both of these things can then be combined into this dose, right? Took into this dose, right? And here we've chosen different kinds of doses, and you can see that they nicely, you know, with the same dose, different combinations of cell density and extracellular concentration, but the same dose that this leads to the same kind of final output. And nicely, then we can really kind of project all of our data onto the super curve and we predict that there are about 24,000 molecules per A. 4,000 molecules for A per cell, which are required to kind of lead to have maximum inhibition of the FRET signal. So that's kind of some indication that these systems could, in fact, perhaps perform some kind of ratiometric type of sensing. So in order to provide kind of some further evidence for this, we just kind of need to make sure that the system under physiologic conditions will not oversaturate. Rate and as the ability for ratio sensing is happening when the signal production, effective signal production, is actually lower than the signal uptake. And so we measured the extracellular concentration under the conditions when we have a wild type population, it's about four points, zero points for an animal. And so if you plug that in. And so, if you plug that in, it actually suggests that the system could be capable of ratio sensing. So, I think what this combined theory of experiment kind of tells you is that we have here one system, the pump probe systems, which in addition of performing quantum sensing in certain parameter regimes could also do composition sensing. And that might be beneficial if you have a phenotypically diverse populations, as we have at least transiently during. As we have at least transiently during sporulation, but it could also be beneficial in a population which is genetically diverse. And so, what's interesting is that many of these pump probe signaling systems can be found on elements which are doing horizontal gene transfer. So, interconjugative elements, for example, conjugative plasmids, but also on phagos, right, which have to make a lysos lysogeny decision. Decision. And so, I guess if you think about control function on whether you want to control a process based on cell density or based on the frequency, the distribution of different, you know, in this case, the ballroom example of different sex ratios, right? It's not so much about whether you find a dancing partner or the total number of people in the in the ballroom, but it's really the ratio of male to female of whether you might get your preferred dancing partner. Your preferred dancing partner. So there have been also some other examples where frequency-dependent investments into, for example, yeast have been reported in the literature already earlier. However, yeast is using a really elaborate system for achieving this. Now, with the pump probe, it's basically built into the architecture. And again, in some recent work from Alvaro, he's showing He's showing that conjugation in enterococcus facialis is frequency dependent. So, this is a paper on the barrier archive. And interestingly, the conjugation system in enterococcus is also using this kind of pump probe architecture. So, with this, I'm kind of at the end, just kind of say what could we do maybe in this chrome sensing line of research. One thing that we were looking into also a couple of years ago. To also a couple of years ago, was trying to better understand how the interaction of the modulator and the regulator and the signal would actually shape the signal processing. And what we found is that the signal processing was shaped both by the molecular properties of these interactions as well as the cellular factors. Now, I told you that all of the measurements which we've did so far, which are kind of nicely bringing together modeling and our experiments, have And our experiments have all been done on the population level. So, now, more recently, we've kind of started to do also some single-cell experiments using our FRED reporters using E-FRED imaging. And this is just kind of, you know, some first results which we have on single-cell FRED using now. Here you see unstimulated cells and then stimulated cells. And the first thing that was good to know for us, because this was an assumption which we had made always in our model, is that the reporter. Our model in is that the reporter response would be homogeneous, and I think this is kind of nicely matched here. So, we hope that we can kind of build on this and get also to some single-cell dynamic signal processing in the future. And then the other thing, I mentioned that molecular signal processing also depends, of course, on the molecular details of the receptor. And these RAP receptors have been quite. Receptors have been quite intensely studied, especially by the lab of Matt Nidic in the last couple of years. And he solved many of the relevant crystal structures for the receptor alone, for the receptor bound to the signal, and for the receptor bound to the response regulator. And basically, you can kind of distinguish here two kinds of domains, an N-terminal domain where you have a flexible alpha helical bundles here, and then this is called the C-termal. And then this is called the C-termal TPR domain. And what Matt basically kind of showed is that these are really allosteric receptors. So there are distinct binding interfaces and that there are some pronounced structural rearrangement that happen upon binding of the response regulator or binding of the signal. Basically, signal binding splits the interaction interface of this response regulator interactions here. And so MET has done certain And so MET has done certain mutants and studied them with in vitro biochemistry and also in vivo. And I think here I'm just kind of showing you some very early data where we've replicated some of his mutants for RAB A and to see of how they are actually affecting our threat response. And so with this, I kind of at the end. So I was kind of having a talk split in three key messages. Messages. So if we have one sensory functions that does quorum sensing and look at different architecture, the key message was that the architecture could constrain the operating regime for cell density sensing. And then we were looking into these punk probe architectures, where I was trying to argue that they could serve different sensory functions, including the ability for composition sensing and thereby mediating the possibility for frequency-dependent regulation. And last but And regulation. And last but not least, I hope I could also convince you that FRED is a powerful way to quantitatively interrogate the signal processing in these bacteria by monitoring protein-protein interactions. And so with this, I would like to acknowledge many my PhD students, Bastian, who is doing the modeling in the first part, Alpa, who's the master of time-lapse microscopy experiment, and Heikel, who pioneered the FRET study, and Pablo, who did. And Pablo, who did many of the more recent experiments on the threat. And with this, I'm really at the end, and I would like to thank you for your attention. Thank you very much for a very stimulating talk. We had a few questions. I was wondering, so there was one question that we wanted to put off to the end. I'm wondering if that was adequately handled or if the questioner would like to. If the questioner would like to pose that question again? Sure, Peter here. I guess the broad question was about the relationship between fitness, biological fitness in the sense of differential growth rates or survival rates and the presence of these kinds of quorum sensing modules in a given species or variant. Species or variant. And as I listened to the second half of the talk, I guess I got the message that it's going to depend very much on which example one's looking at because of the diversity of architectures and functions and so on. But maybe you can address, again, the question from a high level of the relevance of quorum sensing for survival in at least some examples. Right. So I guess the Right. So I guess the idea of quorum sensing or the way of how we think about sensing systems is kind of a little bit, I would say, kind of opposite of what most people do in the sense that you start thinking about the signal and how they are processed and how this regulates behavior, right? But if you are studying, if you think about the biology and where selection would act on, it's on. Selection would act on, it's on the behavior and on the behavior that is controlled by it, right? And so this has kind of changed my perspective a little bit that the fitness benefit is coming from controlling your target gene, right? And this is of, and I think the work by Ling Shong Yu's lab is kind of really making this very nice and Making this very nice and explicit, that you have, for quantum sensing, you need to have a cost function, which or a fitness function, which is cell density dependent, right? So if you have a cell density dependent fitness function and you want to optimize this, your sensory system needs to kind of be able to provide information so that you can execute the behavior and thereby optimize your fitness. And thereby optimize your fitness. Does that make sense? Right. So it comes down to what the cell density-dependent fitness function is in different systems. Right. And so then the way of how we kind of were thinking about this correlation here is that then you can also read this correlation, which we observe here the other way around, that you could kind of say, well, maybe now the sensory system, it's not optimal, right? So what Not optimal, right? So, what I was showing here is what we typically find is that for this external sensing system and for the internal sensing system, they are not tuned to the global optimum of the encoder, but rather to the low cell density end of it, okay? Which kind of is hinting at least at the possibility that it's not information processing, which is optimized per se, but rather. Per se, but rather that during the courses of evolution, we have come perhaps to kind of the limits of this architecture, right? And so in order to become better and to free the evolution, perhaps the evolution of these chrome-sensing target genes further, you would have to have a shift in the chrome sensing architecture. But that's almost, I would say, kind of impossible to evolve, right? So, in my terms of an evolutionary understanding, we had that some Um, understanding we had at some point, you know, an odd inducer which was simply detected by either a one-component response regulator or by a two-component, you know, histidine kinase, right? That just kind of happened by accident. You have to, then you could kind of think maybe these systems could be rewired in some sense, but I think that these things, these kinds of evolutionary changes would be really very, very rare. And it's much more that you're evolving parameters within one architecture, which I guess. Images within one architecture, which I guess maybe this is kind of evidence that this might actually happen also in nature. Could I ask a question of my own? So I was interested by your statement that the parameters for quorum sensing are not well known. Could you expand a little bit on that? Like, what is not known? What's the challenge? Well, you know, we just kind of spent a lot of time on measuring the parameters for the Fur A signaling system, right? And so I think the most comprehensive analysis on trying to gather all of the parameters had been pioneered by also the lab of Ling Sheng Yu. And so his student or postdoc was doing a lot of work on this. And we just Of work on this, and we just kind of followed it up a little bit. And if you go to the original literature, yeah, you can kind of make estimates, and in some cases, there's really no data. And so then you are making kind of very, you're making arguments such, okay, the synthesis of amino acids is typically happening at this rate. So this should be kind of the order of the production rate, but it has never been measured, right? So also for the Fur A, we have not been able to kind of measure the production. not been able to kind of measure the production rate yet. We can only kind of make now an upper bound for the production rate based on our based on our experimental observations. But we still don't know the production rate. And I think that this is true for many, many other systems, that when we make those models, we kind of take parameters which others have used before. And although they are based on reasonable, I wouldn't say that these are unreasonable. Reasonable. I wouldn't say that these are unreasonable, but they are still not measured, right? And you could be off. I see. So, your approach then is to try to directly measure the parameters. Right, that's what we try to do in this foray signaling system, right? To kind of use the FRAT reporter system within one experimental setup to gather all of the parameters or most of the parameters. So, this is basically, I think, what we now accomplished with the Fur A signaling system. That we don't have, because That we don't have because the other thing of having parameters is that you know many parameters depend on condition, right? And so, um, the challenge then is if you are digging different papers from the literature, person A might have measured the parameters on a very different condition than person B using another set of parameters. And then you basically just kind of bring them since you don't have any, you know, any other choice than just taking what there is in the literature. What there is in the literature. But ideally, you would have to gather all of the parameters. If you really want to be quantitative on these systems, you should kind of gather all of the parameters in under the conditions in which you are measuring your system. And that, I think, is really still a big, big, big, big challenge. I understand. Thank you. It's also very tedious to do. Yes, I'm sure. I have a question, perhaps. So I have a question about the composition. About the composition, the fraction sensing. I guess you need two antagonistic processes, two competing processes. But is it known how it works qualitatively for this system? Yeah, so I was maybe a little bit too quick on this. So here, this is kind of within the concept of our model. So what you have to, when the effective product. When the effective production rate, which is basically the fraction of signal-producing cells, times their individual production rate, right? And the competing thing is the uptake, right? They are pumping it inside, so they are taking up the signal, right? So this is the competing process. So you have production and you also have uptake and removal of the signal from the environment. Yeah. So if the effective production rate, which is simply just kind of say, okay, the Okay, the fraction of producing cells times the production rate is larger than the maximal import rate, then you will basically have a regular, you know, your concentration will increase indefinitely with the concentration of your population and you get to the chrome sensing regime because it depends on the density in this case. If, on the other hand, you have a very efficient uptake. Have a very efficient uptake, right? Then you are approaching a plateau. So, despite the fact that our population is growing here exponentially, you can see that the external concentration is approaching a steady state. It will do so in a cell density-dependent fashion, because the dynamics is still dependent on the cell density, but you are plateauing at a particular steady state, which then only depends on the fraction of your signal-producing cells. Of your signal-producing cells. And this is basically the difference between these two scenarios of why you have cell density sensing in one regime and the fraction sensing in the other regime. Does that answer your question? Yeah, okay. I have to think about it a little bit more deeply, but I think I get the gist of it. Thank you. Are there any more questions? Hearing none, that was a very interesting talk. You've summarized a lot of interesting things about quorum sensing that I didn't know before and given us all a lot to think about, I think. So thank you very much for that interesting and stimulating talk. Thank you so much for the opportunity to present. With that, The next and last item in the schedule is conclusion, poster prizes, and farewell. Peter, I don't know if you want to take over, if you want to leave me in charge here. Well, this concludes the workshop, and thank you everybody for getting together. It's been an illuminating several days. I know I've learned a tremendous amount from the talks as well as from the posters. From the talks as well as from the posters. And I think without further ado at this point, I'll turn it back over to Andrew to emcee the awarding of the poster prizes. Oops, I think I'm sharing the wrong screen there. I'm sharing the wrong screen there. You've given away the surprise. Just a moment. Let me see if I can fix this. Well, Andrew Sword said that, I'll say that we'll do everything we can to make sure that the next time we get together around these topics, we are doing so in Banff. In bands, in person. Okay, I think hopefully everyone can see just the single slide with the poster competition winners there. Yeah, let's go. So we had first, let me say we had 13 excellent posters. I was very pleased with the participation. I saw many of them. I didn't see as many of them as I would have liked, frankly. The quality of posters was very high, and there's a lot of interesting ideas. High, and there's a lot of interesting ideas exchanged. So, thank you firstly to all of the poster presenters. Thank you also to the judges. There were seven anonymous judges who went around to your posters and evaluated them and gave us some scores so that we could have a little competition and a little prize. So, thank you very much to those anonymous judges for giving. Anonymous judges for giving their time. What we decided to do ultimately was we decided to give a second prize and a first prize. And these prizes were based on the scores that the judges recorded for your posters. And then once we had actually accumulated the scores, what we realized was that there was a three-way tie for second place. So I'm going to start. So I'm going to start with the second prize winners. There are three who tied for second prize. First winner was Michael Senateli, who was awarded second prize for his poster entitled Precision of Protein Thermometry. Congratulations, Michael. Another second prize goes to Alexander Strang. Alexander Strang, who is awarded second prize for his poster entitled The Discrete Hodge-Helmos Decomposition: Linear Thermodynamics and the Weak Rotation Limit. And the final second prize goes to Alexander Moffat for his poster entitled The Fitness Value of Information with Delayed Phenotype Switching. So, for the second prize winners, I will email your certificates. Later this afternoon, most likely. For the first prize winner, as Peter noted, the first prize comes along with a, I think, what is it, a gift certificate or a voucher or something for a book from Springer. And that first prize, the judges were very effusive in their praise for this poster. For this poster, first prize goes to Teng Long Wang for his poster entitled The Price of Information Transfer in Living Cells. So, congratulations to Teng Long, congratulations to our second prize winners, and big thanks and congratulations to everyone who submitted a poster. Thank you very much. I see there's a question in the chat. Is there any way to access the posters after the workshop? We don't have a way to do that internally, but I would recommend getting in contact directly with the authors of any posters that you can find addresses from within the conference web pages if you're logged in as a participant. There's another question. When will the video? There's another question. When will the videos of the talks be posted? I see that all except Professor Bischoff's talk have already been posted. Yeah, they're put up generally 10 minutes after the talk is finished. Oh, and there's also a link in the chat window. And just a final reminder to the speakers: if you haven't already, please email your slide, a copy of your slides to To me or to help at Burrs or Burrs at Burrs.ca. And those will be linked to the recording. Help at Burrs.ca. Okay.
