Thank you to the organizers for making this happen, for Beers for hosting us, for Vance for being beautiful, and for all of you for being here. So, I am going to talk about Lagrange and Pasi cobordisms, and I think Coordinates, and I think of the three sort of parts of the talk, the most useful part is probably just the first one. I'm going to try to get us sort of updated on like what are LeGent's and Lagrange cohortisms, and that way we can have all of that going forward for the rest of the week. And then the rest of the stuff is just things that I know, which is not that many. Which is not that many things, so I'm going to talk about these things. Okay, so we saw what Legendre knots were in Kyle's talk in the morning, but let me just recap a little bit. So, a Legendre and knot is a smooth knot in a contract manifold. You know, contact manifold. That is, everywhere tangent to the contact structure. So, you can talk about Legendre and Knots in whatever contact manifold you want, but because I'm basic, But because I'm basic, I talk about them in R3. So for us, the setting is going to be the standard contact R3. So this is R3 with the contact structure given by the kernel of the one form dz minus ydx. And what do you need to know about Lagoon knots in this setting? About Legendre knots in this setting? Well, for every smooth knot, there are actually infinitely many Legendrean knots, right, which are distinct as Legendrean knots, but they all have the same smooth knot type. So that's one big difference between the smooth world, the contact world. And how can we see these knots? Well, let me draw one example. So I think Kyle showed us that we can project these knots into either. Project these knots into either the xy or the xz plane, right? So this is projected into the xz, which is what we call the front projection. And what I can do with knots here is I can perform a move called stabilization. So I can stabilize this knot, which in the front projection just looks like adding a zigzag. So I can add a zig and a zag and end up with a And end up with a Legendre in that that looks like this. Or I can add a zag and a zig and end up with a Legendre that looks like this. And these Legendreans are distinct. And how do we know that they're distinct? Well, we can use what we call classical invariants to distinguish them. So Kyle also talked about these. We have the rotation number and we have the Thurston-Bennock number. Right, so this This knot has rotation 0 and Tb minus 1. These knots have Tb minus 2 and rotation number minus 1 and 1. And I can keep stabilizing. I can keep going. So I can stabilize this way and then I keep stabilizing this way and so on and so forth. So on and so forth, and I build what's called a mountain range, very appropriate, of Legendrean knots of the same smooth knot type. All right, and so what's cool about the unknot is that it's actually fully classified by TB and rotation, meaning that if you give me a TB and a rotation number, then there's a unique Legendre knot, sorry, unique Legendre unknot that corresponds. John Dream unknot that corresponds to that Tb and rotation number. This is not true in general. And as you can see with sort of all of the mountain ranges around here, not all of them look just like this, right? So some mountain ranges might look like this, or other more complicated things. Another thing about these mountain ranges is that you can also identify transverse knots. So a transverse knot is one that's everywhere not tangent to the context structure. Everywhere not tangent to the contact structure. And if I just look at the branches going diagonally downwards this way of the mountain range, each of these corresponds to a different transverse knot. All right, so that's a little bant-flavored introduction to Legendre knots. And now let's talk about Lagrangian coordinates. Right, so I'm going to write down a definition. I'm going to write down a definition. So, a Lagrangian coordinator is going to be a relationship between Lechangrean knots or links. So we're going to let lambda minus and lambda plus be Lechangrian links. Then these links are going to live in my standard article. Links are going to live in my standard R3. And then an exact Rundian cobordism from lambda minus to lambda plus is a Lagrangian surface. I'll call it. I'll call it L in a symplectic space, which is what we call the symplectization of the contact manifold. So that's just going to be R3 cross R with the symplectic structure given by DE to the T alpha. Alpha is the one form that I'm taking a kernel of, so that's my dz minus y dx, and t is just this r. Um and t is just this r coordinate here. And so, let's see. I have a Lagrangian surface L, and I have a few things that I'm going to require L satisfy. So the first thing is that it has a cylindrical edge, which means that if I look at L on the sort of negative infinity end, that's just going to look like a similar A cylinder with cross-section y length or minus. And if I look at the positive end, that's just going to look like a cylinder with cross-section like positive naught. And then I'm also going to require this exactness condition. Condition. So this means that I have some function f from L to R such that DF is e to the T outfirst L. And the other thing that I'm going to require is that this primitive function f is constant. At each end. You can, so this is required because I'm working with links, right? So in order to be able to concatenate my Lagrangian cohortisms, I'm going to insist that the primitive have this property so that I can actually glue things together. If I don't require this, then some weird shift can happen. This, then some weird shit can happen. Then some weird stuff can happen. And there have been a couple of people who have looked at sort of what kind of strange behaviors these cohorts can have if you forget about this condition. And among those people are Shaw Train, Josh Sadiloff, Roberta Guidani, and other folks. Okay, so this is what I call an exact Lagrangian cobordism. And if you Um and if you think only in pictures like me, then what you should picture is the following. So I have, oh this had a romo yellow, too. I have, so here is a copy of R3, here is a copy of R3, my synfactization was like here, right? And I have a knot here, this is going to be my under minus, and then I have another knot. And then I have another knot here. This is my lambda plus. Between them, I have some kind of cobordism. And then I have just boring cylindrical ends on my right hand. So this is what you should be picturing. Some people draw this this way as well. And let's see, what else do I need to say? Ah, so if I have an exact Lagrangian coordinator, I'm going to write. Francian cobortism, I'm going to write lambda minus backslash correct lambda plus, right? And if L has genus zero, then it's a Lagrangian concordance. And if I need to, I'm going to denote this with the little zero here to indicate zero deals. All right. So What are the properties? What are the known properties of Lagrangian cobalts? Well, good news. It's reflexive. Reflexive. So that means that if lambda minus is isotopic, the genre being isotopic. to lambda plus. Then lambda minus is actually concordant to lambda plus. That was proofbrush on train. It's also transitive, so we can concatenate these Lejeune Legarogian cohortisms. And Um and you might know something about smooth concordance, right? And you know that this is like a nice equivalence relation on smooth knots. And then if I take this equivalence relation and I think about these knots with connect sum, then I actually get a really nice group structure on smooth knots. You might hope that something similar happens here, but unfortunately it doesn't, which is why this is not an equals e-looking sign. It's a order. So I also know that Also, know that Lagrangian cohortisms are not symmetric. This is also a result of Chantray, and he actually constructs an explicit counterexample to this. Okay, so you might then ask, okay, if it's not symmetric, is it anti-symmetric? Or, in other words, do I have a partial order on the chantry naughts? The answer is don't know. This is open. In fact, we don't even know if there exists a lambda coordinate to the Coordinate to the unout. That is the unout. Um okay stuff that we don't know, so what else is some stuff that we do know? Well, I think this is related to one of the open problems. To one of the open problems that was proposed. So, Lagrangian coordinates can be what we call decomposable. And what does decomposable mean? Well, decomposable means that we can construct them out of pieces that look like the following. So, constructed Out of so pieces that look like Ludondrian isotopy, pieces that look like index zero birth pieces, so that's going to look like a max TV unnaught on the positive end. End and then something with nothing on the negative end. And then also, index one, pinch moves. So those are going to look like sort of saddle cobordisms between arcs that look like this, where I can see a ray chord, and then if I pinch that ray chord down, I get these. And then, if I pinch that ray chord down, I get these two cusses. Right? So, what I actually know is I know that if I have two masses that are related by this relation, or if I have two links that are related by this relation, then there is a Lagrangian cobordism to be competing. Right, so I can find decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms. Natural question, this is a, if you know what a ribbon cobordism is, this is like the Legendre version of that, right? Version of that. So an open question. So what we know actually is that exact implies regular implies, oh wait, no, other waiter. Decomposable implies regular, implies exact, but open Open is the question: Are all exact Lagrangian cocorisms decomposable? All right, what was regular again? Regular means that it's tangent to the Lieuville instructor. I didn't say it out loud. Right, great. More open questions. More open questions. These are hard questions. Very hard questions. Okay, so what are some other properties that we do know? So here are some other properties that we do know. So if I have two Legendreans, lambda 1, lambda 2, and they have the same rotation number, Then they have a lower bound. So there exists some lambda minus such that lambda minus sort of is Lagrangian coordinate 2 lambda 1 and 2 lambda plus. This was shown implicitly by Miranda trainer. And they also have an upper belt. And this is shown by my collaborators. Josh Lablashay by Mike Wong. And this is going to bring us to part two. To bring us to part two. Are there any questions about part one, definitions about Legendre Nazi, Rajan Cabordum, stuff like that? You're saying you don't know any Lagrange knots that is Lagrangian, like coordinates that are all Lurangian coordinates. I don't know any knots that are coordinate to the R knots. Are coborded to the unknown. I can find Legendre knots that are coordinated from the unknot, but not this way. And this is the maximum Thurston-Beneque Legendre unknown. Although I think you can replace it with any unknown, and this is still. The fact that we don't know anything is still true. Yeah, okay. Okay, so let's talk about the branching of quasi-orgisms. If there are no other questions. Algorithms. If there are no other questions. Okay, so what's the idea here? The idea here is maybe I want to define an equivalence relation on the concrete knots. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use I'm going to use these sort of up and down pieces in order to build such a relation. Right, so I'm going to call a Legendre and join one of these pieces, right? So it's going to consist Right, so it's going to consist of an upper bound lambda plus for lambda minus lambda and lambda prime and uh the Lagrangian actually the connected Lagrangian that join that so Right, and then a Lagrangian quasicobortism is just going to be, let me take a bunch of Lagrang Lagrangian joins, Legendrean joins. Lagrangian joins, Lagrangian joins, and glue them all together, right? So, what I will form is a smooth cobordism, which is like piece-wise Lagrangian. Okay, so is from, let's call it lambda 0 to lambda n is the smooth surface, smooth surface. Surface obtained by compatinating. Oh my gosh. Um the genre joints. So it's going to look like this something like that. Okay, and then a Lagrangian quasi-concordance. is genus zero Lagrangian quasi-cobortism. And these, like Lagrangian-Poisicobordism and Lagrangian-Poisy concordance, are both going to be equivalence relations. Both going to be equivalence relations on Lagendrin knots. Okay, one thing to note is that I require the different Lagrangian components to be connected. The reason why I do that is because the following scenario. So I could have the following. So if I use my decomposable moves, Use my decomposable moves, then I can do a birth move here and add an unknot to this Legendre, right? And then I can also do a pinch move to get from this Legendre. And the problem with this is that this means that I can double stabilize as much as I want. And if I do enough stabilization, And if I do enough stabilizations, then I can replicate any smooth cobordism. So if I want quasi-cobortisms to be distinct from smooth cobordism, then I need to require this connection, this condition just to avoid this kind of cobordisms. So the first thing that you might ask is, is this actually sort of like different than Lagrangian coordinism? Can I actually find knots? So do there exist knots that are Lagrangian quasi-coordinate but not Lagrangian coordinate? The answer is yes. The answer is yes. So there exist mods which are largely quasi-co-coordinate or coordinate, if not coordinate and um And the way that we can prove this is the following, just by constructing an example. So let me show you an example. So let's consider the following two Legendre knots. So we're going to consider the Max TB mirror of the 946 and the mirror of This 12 non-alternating 7, 6, 8 knot. I think I can draw this one, but I can't draw that one. So these are two Legendrean knots, and the special thing about these knots is that they're both Lagrangian slice, meaning that they bound Lagrangian disks. So in particular, if they're both Lagrangian slice, that means that they're both coordinate from That they're both coordinate from, sorry, concordant from the unknot. So I have this, which means that they are Lagrangian quasi-concordant. Okay, but they're not Lagrangian coordinate. And I can do this by using, oh, I didn't write down this property when I was writing down properties of Lagrangian cobordisms. But an important property of Lagrangian coordinates is that all kinds of Lagrangianism. Is that all kinds of Legendrean invariants obstruct them? So, in particular, like the TB has an obstruction, rotation has an obstruction, and what we call the Chekhinov, sorry, the stable time isomorphism classes of the Chekhinov-Alyas for differential graded algebra, those also obstruct Lagrangian coordinates. And a lot of the Lagendrian invariants that we have are actually secretly proper. Have are actually secretly properties of the stable tame isomorphism classes of the Chechnya-Belioschemphy function period algebra. So we're going to use some obstructions coming from that. So it looks, so your definition of quasi-cobort is saying you have upper bounds, but over there it looks like that's a lower bound. So I'm a little confused. I can just do an isotopy here, either end, and then I'm okay, right? Yeah, actually this is like a r this is an interesting thing, right? We chose upper bounds, I think because we know that we can always construct an upper bound in any contact manifold. So this definition can go beyond R3 here. I'm not sure if the same thing is true, at least for the construction that I'm aware of, not sure if that's true for lower bounds. Roof and lower bounds. But you can ask: is it better maybe to go down than up? And that would be, I think, an interesting problem. When I talk about the metric monolith stuff, maybe I'll mention a couple of questions that I don't know the answer to, and maybe the answer is it's better if you go down. Okay, so what are some examples of things that I know about LeBronchian cohortisms? LeBranching coordinates. Well, so one fact is that if I have a Lagrangian coordinate from lambda minus to lambda plus, then I can actually take, oh sorry, concordance. This requires concordance. So if I have a concordance from lambda minus to lambda plus, then actually I can take satellites of both of these knots with the same pattern. So this is the satellite. So, this is the satellite of lambda minus with some pattern P, then this is actually going to be concordant to a satellite of lambda plus with the same pattern. This was proved by Cornwell in Zimek. And another fact that I know is one of these obstructions that come from These obstructions that come from GA sort of stuff. So if lambda minus is concordant to lambda plus, plus some extra stuff, which I'm not going to describe. It's not going to be useful or memorable. Then Uh their ruling polynomial. So the ruling polynomial is an invariant of Legendrean knots that is sort of thematically the closest to sort of these polynomial invariants of smooth knots. So you have like these skein-related Alexander polynomials and stuff like that. So the really polynomials And stuff like that. So the ruling polynomial, I think, is the closest thing that we have for Legendre nuts and that sort of invariant. And so if I have this, then their ruling polynomials have to satisfy the following relationship. So the ruling polynomial of lambda 1 evaluated on q to the 1 half minus q to the minus 1 half is has to be less than or equal to our lambda plus. r lambda plus q to the 1 half minus q to the minus 1 half, where q is the prime power. And this was approved by PAN. Alright, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at different satellites of my slice knots. Life's not. And then I'm going to use a computer to compute the ruling polynomials. I'm going to do this until I find a problem. So in particular here, if I take the TB twisted whitehead double, so I think. So, I think Kyle also showed us what a whitehead double looks like. So, I'm going to take that, plus I'm going to add TB numbers of twists, a TB number of full twists. If I take those satellites, then what I'll be able to see is that the ruling polynomial of the white head double of the mirror 946. 4, 6 evaluated at root 2 minus 1 over root 2 is less than or equal, sorry, is greater than, the Boolean polynomial of the white head double of the mirror of the 12 non-alternating 7, 6, 8 evaluated at the same thing. But if I take this evaluated Evaluated at a different prime power, then this is less than this evaluated prime power. So this gives me a proof that they're not Lagrangian concordant. So they're not Lagrangian concordant in either direction. All right, so this brings me to part three, which is part where I talk about the metric mode. So I said before that we can take the concordance group of knots in the smooth category and we can learn all kinds of interesting properties about smooth knots using that. So why don't we try to do the same thing here using this equivalence relation? And so what can we glean from trying to do this this way? Okay, so for any two Legendreans with the same rotation number, I can define. I can define this number g of lambda lambda prime, which is the minimal genus over all Lagrangian Lagrangian quasi coordinates. Coordinates. And then I can consider. Yes. Is this actually concordant or concordant? These are concordants. Not a lungian. Concordant? Yeah. And also not coordinated. So cobordisms always realize the minimal smooth genus. So if they're not concordant, then they're not coborded either. Either. Yeah, that's like another big difference between Lagrangian cobordisms and smooth cobordisms. If I have a smooth cobordism between two knots, I can attach more handles, right, and I can increase the genus. Can't do that with a Lagrangian. Okay, so, right, so I've defined this like minimal genus, and what this is actually gonna give me is a metric. Actually, going to give me is a metric on my Legendre knots. So this is a right, so this gives Gives a metric metric monoid over Lagrangian knots of the same Lagrangian fuzzy concordance class. Alright, so the objects are going to be quasi-concordance classes of Legendre knots, and the metric is given by the minimal genus. Okay, so if I have like a metric monoid, then I can ask lots of interesting questions, like what are its metric properties? What are its monoidal properties? Properties, what are its monoidal properties? I guess I can ask two kinds of questions. And so let's do a little bit of an explore and see what properties I can glean. So here are some properties. So for any lambda, there exists some lambda n. Some lambda n so that the minimal genus between lambda and lambda n is minus, right? Which means that basically I can always find, like, from any Legendre knot, I can find another knot that's distance n away from it. And how do I see that? Well, the If I consider the minimal genus between the I'm not and the following So this is going to be 2m plus 1 crossing. So this is a 2 2n plus 1 torus knot right if we're If I consider the genus here, the genus here is always going to be n. I can see this because if I do two pinches, I get two less of these bubbles, and I also get one more genus. Okay, so then what I can do is I can give in Given lambda, I can take, connect sums with these guys and produce knots that are and away from lambda. Okay, so then similar flavored theorem, so for any Lambda, there exists a sequence of lambda i's such that every lambda i is one apart from lambda, but lambda i is not L Q sorry. LQ, sorry. But they're not pairwise with rounding and quasi-coordinate. Coordinates. Concordants. But they're not pairwise with rounding and quasi-coordinates. Right? Which kind of means that if I think about it, Right, which kind of means that if I think about any Legendre not, its valence is infinite. Right? There's infinitely many different Legendre names which are applied to Harper. And how do I see this? Well, I again consider the following family. So this is the unknot. Uh this is the unknot, and this is the pretzel knot, uh minus three, minus five, and minus two one plus one, so odd number here. So if I think about This puzzle knot, then I can pinch it twice and I get down to the unknot. So the genus is one. And smoothly, they're not concordant. And I can show this using the Alexander polynomial. And if they're not smoothly concordant, then they're definitely Lagrangian, not Lagrangian quasi-concordant, because those are smooth concordances. So if I take connect sum with these guys, then I'll get my desired. These guys, then I'll get my desired notes. I guess. Why don't you choose those numbers? Like, double-pinching works for any concept, right? Yes, it's because the Alexander polynomial is easy to compute. These are, like the Seifert surface is exactly like the one that I get by coloring it this part and this part. So I can easily compute the sidehert matrix and use that to get the Alexander polymer. And use that to get the Alexander polynomial. And then I can, you know, say that they're different. Sorry, that they're not concordant. All right, so but yeah, if you take any sort of pretzel with positive crossings, then you can do this double-ditch. Okay, so Let me give you just a couple more theorems about mental polymeric properties, maybe without proving them because I have five minutes. So theorem. So this is a monoidal property. So no non-trivial. Uh antichiral Legendre not as or is two torsion. So this is a sort of difference between this monoid and the concordance group, right? Because there, if I take a knot and I take, and it's fully infachiral, Take, and it's fully antichiral, and I take its mirror and I connect some together, I get something that is concordant to the I'm not. But here, I can actually show that this isn't possible here, right? Which is, again, like there are questions that I don't know the answer to, like, are there inverses in this mono at all? Any kind of inverses or any kind of torsion? I don't know, for me. And then I can also show the following two. Show the following two theorems which are sort of inspired by work of Cochran and Harvey on smooth concordance. So, theorem: so if I have a winding number and satellite, and I think about this as an operator, then these are always bounded. Always a bounded distance apart. And in fact, if I think about only a winding number plus or minus one satellites. Then these are quasi isometries. So, those are some sort of metric monochrome properties of this thing. And And one last thing. So I can, you know, I can decorate my Lagrangian quasi-cohortism class with a lot of different decorations and ask these same questions. Right? And so here's like to explore. So I can add So I can add, I can consider Lagrangians with augmentations and think about Lagrangian quasi-coordisms of these objects instead, where I require that the augmentations be mapped to each other by the DGA maps. I can require that all of my combordisms be decomposable. I can require that all my ends be decomposable. I can require that all my ends be nots. I can think about sort of what I call lambda versus m versus w versus v, right? So is it better to go up or down? Can I get smaller genus if I go up and down versus going just up once? Or is it always the same? Right? So, um. So these are sort of other things I can add to this relation to think about it more. And I think I'm going to end there before the bell goes off. So is there some feeling that there's some kind of connection to immersion? Feeling that there's some kind of connection to immersed cobordisms, immersed regional cobordisms. Let's say like the negative end is these knots glow in your zigzag thing and then kind of go up to the maximum type or the other knots. Seems like there's some kind of connection there, but maybe you can think about it as a type of like that. Yeah, I'm not really sure. Yeah, I'm not really sure, but we could definitely add sort of. Yeah, I guess we can compare sort of these quasi-cobortisms to immersed cobordisms and see, like. I mean, you can definitely create an immersed cobordism just by kind of you take these things and so on. But then maybe it's not so relevant. But okay, but now you say you also consider augmentations that match things. Yes. So the two augmentations here match with. Do the augmentations here match with yes, exactly, yes. Then I guess the hordism is unstructured. Maybe if you have some results there, maybe it should also look here. So the relation is you get all these types of results if you take more organization to account? I think you get sort of more tools to attack it with, but we're s sort of still thinking about what kinds of results. Thinking about what kinds of results you can get. Are they all the answers? They become isomorphisms once you take control of them. So I can say what the result is, so the sorry, what the mass is. is what the maps are. So if I have sort of a lambda plus coordinate from a lambda minus, right, then what I get is a map that goes from the DGA here to the DGA here. This is the Chekhinoff Ellie Ashberg feature. So if I then think about this in terms of like quasi-cobortism, what I get are matters. Like quasi-cobortism, but I get our maps that all go down, but I can't necessarily go back up the other way. So I guess I had thought maybe positive ordinisms you're trying to invert something like a classroom. I think it doesn't quite I think it doesn't quite work that nicely, yeah. But it's true that true that when on the linearized levels, also you utilize this to an A infinity map, then it's an A infinity process more than not a DGN map, but in in the case when it's an orientation. Yeah then you might want it in the algebra. I've always taken it, I guess. I'm just very normal on the side of it.
