Yeah, we uh so I'm going to be talking about um modeling from the point of view of uh thinking about ethics um and ultimately trying to understand how much impact my own behavior really has on an epidemic in a large population. And so, one of the really key issues going on here that we've certainly seen in the pandemic here is that the benefits of an intervention. The benefits of an intervention are not always experienced by the person who's actually paying the costs. So, you know, you've got kids who are having behavior changes, and most of the kids are not really at high risk. We've got a lot of issues like that happening in the current pandemic. And that's okay, good. All right. And the benefit, though, is generally experienced by. Is generally experienced by somebody who's at high risk who may or may not be having to pay the same price. And so a question that I want to think about is what's the impact of a single behavior changing or a single individual changing behavior? And the motivation for this is that, you know, right now we've got laws about drunk driving. So, you know, if you drink a little bit too much, you have an accident, you've got a. A accident, you've got to, uh, or if you're caught uh driving a bit oddly, you have to blow into something, uh, it records some number, and you may or may not get into trouble on the basis of that. So we're accustomed to the idea that there are penalties for things like drunk driving, where my behavior, my choices put others at risk. And, you know, it's accepted in society that at least at some level there should be penalties for that. We also have things like seatbelt laws, where we do actually have penalties for people. There are, we do actually have penalties for people who don't wear seatbelts, even though that's not really affecting others, Sarah. What I didn't draw the seatbelt. Oh, yeah, the drawing, yes. Yes. The drawings are all me. I'm an amazing artist. Yeah. Very nice. Hopefully it gets the point across. But yeah, so we've got seatbelt laws. And the seatbelt law, that's to protect me. That's to protect me. You know, I get in trouble if I don't wear a seatbelt because that's putting myself at risk more so than anybody else. Now, there are, you can make some justifications for why me putting myself at risk is a problem in a society where perhaps there's some sort of a safety net where somebody else is going to be responsible for paying for my kids to continue their lives after I hit a tree at high speed. High speed. So we do kind of have the acceptance in most societies that it is okay to have penalties for these sorts of things. But one could argue that, for example, vaccine mandates, depending on what the penalties associated with those vaccine mandates are, that could, you know, you can make an argument that a lot of the penalties that I've seen are worse than the penalty for driving drunk. And, you know, And is that appropriate or not? Well, whether that's appropriate or not depends on whether the potential damage caused by somebody not getting vaccinated is worse than driving drunk. So we've got to somehow be able to think about if we're trying to make, provide some sort of ethical framework for imposing penalties and such for people's behaviors, it'd be nice to kind of calibrate it so that, you know, if my behavior really puts If my behavior really puts a lot of individuals at risk, then it's appropriate for me to have a high penalty. Whereas, if it only puts a very small number of individuals at very small risk, the penalty shouldn't be so high. So we'd like to be able to measure this. But most of our models, if I say, what's the impact of me not getting vaccinated in your deterministic model? Well, you take one person out of the vaccinated class, put them in the susceptible class, and you've made zero change to this because you're Made zero change to this because you're working in a large population limit, or even if you're in a finite model, it's still really hard to get at. So I'm trying to kind of address that kind of question here. So what are we going to do here? I'm going to consider a well-mixed population. I'm going to assume that the interventions in place are constant. So I want to think about a single wave where there's an SIR disease. There's some intervention. IR disease, there's some intervention in place. I know something about the offspring distribution. And by offspring distribution, I mean what's the probability that if I'm infected, I will cause zero new cases. What's the probability I'll cause one new case, et cetera. The average of the offspring distribution is R naught, or if you're under some sort of control, if there's some sort of intervention in place, I'm calling that RC. It's the reproductive number under whatever control measures are in place. Control measures are in place. And what I want to ask is: what's the appropriate penalty or what, well, what's the impact of a single individual, given this background, a single individual deciding whether or not I'm going to start off with thinking about if they isolate when infected. So if I somehow discover I'm infected, so I took my rat test this morning, or do you guys call them rat tests here? Rapid antigen tests. Come on, rats. It's a rat. It's a rat. Everybody knows this in Australia. You know, rats are hard to get, were hard to get for a while. Yeah. People are rat positive or PCR positive. You guys are missing out. What's that? Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. They give our daughters rats to take home from school. Yeah. But yeah, so, okay, so I took the test. It came up negative. It came up negative, so I'm here talking to you guys. If it came up positive, and I thought, well, I'd really like to give my talk in person. You know, what's the risk that I'm actually creating at the population scale? And then a secondary question or a question that is going to build on that one is, instead of if an infected individual isolating, what happens if somebody takes some measure such as getting a perfect vaccine? So right now, I So, right now, we're making very simple assumptions. So, the vaccine is assumed to be perfect. What's the impact of me getting a perfect vaccine? And that's modulated by what's the probability I'm going to get infected. So, I'll need to worry about if I wasn't going to get infected anyways, then there's no benefit from me getting the vaccine. But maybe I maybe I was going to get infected, and then there's we need to sort of account for the benefit from that. Is there a thought to think about that? Are you? How do you mean? So, is there a cost for me to take a vaccine? Are you asking in real life, like, do I have to spend money in Australia? No, but in my model, no. So, so here I'm just asking what's the benefit of me getting vaccinated. And then we can, once we know what the benefit is of me getting vaccinated, we can worry about what's the impact. So, this is not an economics model. This is what is the impact. Is the impact on others from a health point of view of my decision to get vaccinated or not? How many infections do I actually prevent by getting vaccinated? Yeah, so I'm not considering anything like the vaccine might cause me some sort of damage. That's not included in the model. I'm not considering that the vaccine might cause me some sort of emotional. Cause me some sort of emotional harm because I'm scared of getting a needle put in my shoulder. Yeah, no, I'm not worrying about that sort of thing. But those are some of the things that you would that you don't need that. You don't need to build a model for that. It's just, I'm just trying to answer the question, how many infections do I prevent by either getting a vaccine or by regularly testing? And when I test positive, isolating myself from the rest of society more so than I do already. Of society more so than I do already. All right, before I do this, I want to think about SIR diseases. There are different ways to think about how we might model an SIR disease. And so I'm going to introduce kind of three approaches. Eben, you'll appreciate this, I hope. But I want to think about three approaches to simulate an SIR disease because one of those provides a frame. One of those provides a framework that I can use to try to answer these questions. So, yeah. Oh, look, a mouse. Yeah, I forgot about that. I wrote, when I originally made this slide, we had just had a one-week power outage at my house. So I had a little, the iPad I was using to track the, you know, they kept saying it'll be up in 12 hours. Up in 12 hours. Okay. So the first algorithm that I want to think about is really the standard thing that people usually think about when you've got somebody who's just entering infectious disease modeling, doesn't know a whole lot about, say, a Gillespie algorithm or something. The approach is basically, we've got a population, we choose our initial infections, we set t equals zero, and while there's some infections present, we're going to increase time by some increment. Increase time by some increment, and then we go through each infected individual and decide who they infect during that period, whether or not they recover during that period, and then we update and then we loop through again. And we keep doing that. The problem is that the reason we don't use this in reality or in most frameworks is because there's a lot of CPU time that goes into the fact that this infected person in the next minute probably doesn't infect anybody. Probably doesn't infect anybody. So there's a lot of CPU time if you get it to really fine scale. A lot of CPU time goes into people who aren't actually transmitting. On the other hand, if you use too large of a time step, then other problems show up. But on the other hand, if you were to try a Gillespie algorithm, you've made an assumption about the duration of somebody's epidemic or somebody's infection being exponentially distributed, the time to transmit being exponentially distributed. So if you don't want to use a Gillespie algorithm, You know, if you don't want to use a Gillespie algorithm, this is actually a really common approach. You have to look at how long somebody's been infected and work off of that. An alternative is something that's a bit more efficient, still doesn't require us to make the sort of Markovian assumptions that you need for a Gillespie algorithm. We get our initial infections, and what we do is we go through our first five people who are infected. Through our first five people who are infected. And for each one of them, we decide what time that person's going to recover. And then we decide what time that person's going to transmit. We put that in something called a priority queue. And that's a data structure that is, there's an efficient way to select what's the next event. There's efficient ways to add new events to that queue so that they are in order, works better than a list because lists. Because lists, it's hard to add things to in order. You've got to do a lot of work to figure out where to put it in. Priority queue, you can do that in logarithmic time, and then you can pull out the next event in order one time in constant time. So that's great. I've got this priority queue. It tells me when people are going to transmit. I can calculate who they're going to transmit to as well when I put it in there. I can calculate what time they're going to affect. And then I just look at this priority queue. I pull off my first event. First event. And then I look: okay, is the person going to recover? If so, then I just basically have him recover and I don't worry about anything else. On the other hand, if it's the person transmitting, I go, I figure out who he's transmitting to or she's transmitting to. And then I figure out what time, or I make that person infected. I figure out that new infection, what time that person will transmit to others, what time that person will recover. I add those events to the priority queue and I continue. Those events to the priority queue, and I continue. And this actually runs pretty fast. And it's nicer than a Gillespie algorithm because I don't need to assume everything is exponentially distributed. But so this is getting closer to what I have in mind here. So the key thing to realize here is that when somebody gets infected, I can actually, when somebody gets infected, I can choose who they're going to transmit to, what time they're going to transmit to. Transmit to what time they're going to transmit to them and when they're going to recover. So I can make those choices as soon as somebody gets infected, rather than back in this version, trying to make those decisions at the moment that the event would happen. I can actually decide them in advance. When are they going to happen, as long as I choose them from the correct distribution? So let's take that idea a little bit further. I can choose when somebody's going to do something as soon as they can get infected. Something as soon as they can get infected, or I can choose what would happen even before I start the simulation. I can go and I can ask, I can have my computer say, okay, if Greg ever gets infected, what time will Greg transmit to other people? How long will his infection last? I can then say, okay, let's look at Eben. I can look at every single person in the simulation. I can do this calculation. You wouldn't do it this way in practice, but you can do it in theory. And then after you've done this, you've done. And then, at the after you've done this, you've done a lot of calculations for people who aren't getting infected, but you've also handled the people who will get infected. You know in advance who they'll transmit to and when. And so, what happens is I can go and say the reproductive number is less than one. I've gone through, I've identified that some individuals don't transmit at all. Some transmit to maybe one or two. I can do these calculations in advance, and I've actually built up a network. It's a weighted network because I can associate with each individual their duration. Associate with each individual their duration of infection with each edge, I can associate how long the delay is from my infection to me transmitting. I can calculate all those things right at the start before anything happens. And then how do we actually do a simulation? Well, we choose our initial infection and then we just follow all the edges out from that person. We don't worry about edges that go back to somebody who already got infected, but we just follow all the edges out and we get. Follow all the edges out, and we get some structure. Okay, now this is really helpful for me. Why? Well, I've got a single static object. I've got that network. And that network, once I choose my initial infection, that tells me what my epidemic looks like. But I can study a static object rather than having to do something dynamic. And it's just mathematically simpler to work with static objects. Okay, and this gives us a lot of insight into the final size of an epidemic. This gives us a lot of insight into the epidemic probability. I'm not going to get into all that. But for me, what's important here is this lets me sort of address what happens if one of these people, what would be different if I went to one of these people and broke the edges coming out of that person? Out of that person and just prevented that person from transmitting. No edges come out of that person. What's the final state of the population with and without this person transmitting? So what happens there? And I think I've got a slide that kind of builds into this. Yeah. So I probably spent longer on this last night than I should have. But so we've got a single infected individual, and I will refer to this individual as you without getting too personal about it. I have a single individual who's I have a single individual who's going to not transmit. So, this person is isolated after infection, doesn't necessarily try to avoid getting infected, but somehow as soon as you get infected, you isolate. Okay, and so in my original framework, I've got my initial infection and I followed all these edges out. And I've got some edges that didn't end up doing anything because this person was going to transmit to somebody. This person was going to transmit to somebody else. This person was going to transmit to that person, but got there too late. So we build this up, and here's this person who got infected, transmitted, and has a whole lot of people who can trace their infection back to that person. Do I want to count all of those? If I want to say how many infections is the individual you responsible for, I probably don't actually want to count all of those. Because what would have happened? This. Because what would have happened if I broke the edges coming out of node or individual? There would have been alternate paths. So, look, there's a path from here to here, which earlier didn't do anything because that guy was already infected, but now, you know, kind of mops that person up, catches that person later. So you only escape infection if all the paths from the index, that initial infection, to you, to, so an individual only escapes infection if all the paths to that individual go through. the paths to that individual go through the individual go through the uh this individual you who's the person of interest here and so how many how many is that how many descendants does this person have uh that would not have been infected otherwise that's that's ultimately the question i want to answer and um And depending on how time goes, I probably won't get to the really fancy answer where I can tell you the whole distribution of what this number is. What's the probability that it's three? What's the probability that it's one? But I'm going to talk right now about what's the expected value. And what I want to recognize is that if I can basically think about it this way, I freeze the individual you, that person gets infected. That person gets infected. I just freeze that person. I let the rest of the epidemic progress. And then, once the epidemic is finished, we're basically in our final state. Our reproductive number is at R infinity, the final reproductive number. And then I release this person and let this person transmit. And so now this person, we can think about it as an index case, newly infected individual at the end of the epidemic. You've basically just introduced an infected person once the epidemic has progressed through the whole population. Epidemic has progressed through the whole population. So it's this person is transmitting where a fraction of those transmissions that occur are to people who are already infected based on, and we can calculate that based on the final size of the epidemic. If it's been a large population, I've frozen this individual. For the rest, it goes to the expected final size. I allow this person to start transmitting, and it's an epidemic spreading in this residual population. Residual population. And what that means is that I can, instead of thinking about R0 being greater than infinity, I can think about the final R0. I can just do my calculation at the final R0 and figure out what's happening. So this is a theorem that Eben really highlighted to me a long time ago now. We're getting old. Yeah. Yeah. But you can, the fact that you can map this to the static graph is a really important thing. And so we can do basically what I said. We freeze this individual, we allow the remaining epidemic to spread, and we're going to now consider the epidemic in this residual susceptible population. So that's one of the nice things about having the static object is that it's very easy. Is that it's very easy conceptually to say, I'm just gonna not let these, I'm not gonna follow these edges until the end. That's all. I'm just not gonna follow those edges until the end. And it's still the same static graph. As soon as you conceptually have that in your mind, you can see that that's not going to change the out component of your node. If you're, you know, your initial index case, you're basically doing a depth first, a breadth first search, more or less, is what the epidemic is. Search, more or less, is what the epidemic is for those who do graph theory. Except, I'm going to freeze this individual and I won't follow that person to the end. It's still the same out component, you're going to find no changes in that because you hold off till later. Okay, so let's talk about first off what happens if the reproductive number is actually less than one. So we're going to think about a reproductive number is less than one. We're going to take an infected individual already infected. Take an infected individual already infected. This person's going to isolate or not. What's the impact? Well, if the reproductive number is less than one, and there's very few infections out there, then I cause, if I'm the person isolating, I prevent directly transmitting to whatever that reproductive number is at the first generation. And then each of those avoids transmitting to reproductive number additionally. So at one generation, Number additionally. So at one generation away, this is the number of trends of infections prevented. Two generations, it's this, three generations, et cetera. This is a geometric series. And we've got a formula for it. And a key observation there is that if the reproductive number is less than one, but close to one, it's a big number. What if your reproductive number is greater than one? Reproductive number is greater than one. Well, we freeze this person and let this person, we kept this person frozen. We let the rest of the epidemic go. Now we're going to unfreeze this person. And now the reproductive number is what I'm going to call R infinity. That's the effective reproductive number at the end, which basically looks at our reproductive number times the susceptible fraction. So it's less than one. Otherwise, the epidemic will stop. So we've gone until reproductive numbers are less than one, and we do exactly. Of numbers less than one, and we do exactly the same calculation, except we use the final outcome. So, basically, if I want to know how much impact I have in this epidemic, all I have to do is look at what the final reproductive number would be of this epidemic and ask the question there. So, again, the final reproductive number is close to one if the initial reproductive number is very close to one. So, this can have a larger impact there. And the next slide, I think, is going to show these. And the next slide, I think, is going to show these things. Yes. Okay, so if I put here a reproductive number going from zero up to a largish number, this is my initial reproductive number. I get here, this is the curve reproductive number over one minus reproductive number. And over here, this is the curve where I take R infinity and which is the initial reproductive number times the final susceptible fraction. Times the final susceptible fraction, which, as long as we assume that the population has homogeneous susceptibility, it doesn't matter what the offspring distribution looks like. It's still the same susceptible fraction, depending on it depends only on the reproductive number, not the distribution of the offspring distribution. So we get R infinity, we plot that. And what you see is if two points happen to have the same value here, what that means is that if you've got, say, an R0 initially of two, that's Two. That's about the same as something a little bit less than a half in terms of this. That corresponds to the fact that your initial reproductive number is two, your final reproductive number is about a half or so. Okay. And a key thing from setting aside this ethical question of how much impact do I have, this says that contact tracing is actually really effective if you're in a population where. If you're in a population where the initial or final reproductive number, under whatever other controls you have in place, if that's close to one, then each person you identify who's infected prevents potentially a very large number of infections, depending on how close that is to one. Question? And I think this is like maybe there's on the submission. B, so this is, I'm going to isolate. I'm assuming that, yes, my isolation is 100%. I know I'm infected. Right, right. So, this is for each person I successfully isolate. You know, if I, the sort of benefit of this goes down by a factor of 10 if I've got to isolate 10 people to stop one person from going out there infectious. Okay, so this is for each infected person I prevent from going out into the population. From going out into the population. If I, you know, if there's a whole bunch of people who are still susceptible who I also isolate in the process, that's you've got to consider that if you're thinking about what the harm is. Okay, that answer your question. All right. Okay. All right. So, what about vaccine? What if I get vaccinated? So, if I get vaccinated and I And I was going to get infected, then the number of infections that are prevented are myself plus what happens because I don't go out and transmit to others. So this, the number of vertered by me isolating is the same as the number of descendants I prevent by me just not getting infected, plus myself. But that's only if I was going to get infected in the original model. And we don't. Model, and we don't, you know, we don't know a priori who, you know, in real life, we don't know who those people are. We don't know who was just not going to get infected. We don't know that a priori, but assuming a single wave model and such, we kind of, you know, we know that there are some of these people out there. So, what we have to do is basically take the figure I had back here. I add one to it. So, I add one. One to it. So I add one to everything. And then I have to multiply by the fraction, the probability that I get infected if I hadn't been vaccinated. Now, notice that at one, we've got zero here. At one, we've got infinity here. Some cool things might happen. And in my plot here, I only go down to one because below one, it really is zero. If we assume that I'm If we assume that I'm, you know, reproductive numbers less than one, we start off with a handful of infections in an infinite population, I'm not going to get infected. So below one, it's zero, but above one, it looks like this. This is the total benefit. This is the benefit that I myself got by being vaccinated. And the yellow curve is the benefit that other people get because I'm getting vaccinated. And infinity times zero in this case is two, which is a really Which is a really kind of cool result, which we had numerically and I tried to prove for a long time. And then I asked my wife, and she got it for me in about two minutes. And then a few months later, I started trying to write it up. I went through it for a long time. And then I asked my wife, and she got it for me in a couple of minutes. Yeah. 100% effective vaccine. It will, you know, it basically, if it's 50%. Basically, if it's 50%, then everything goes down by a factor of two, if it's 50% effective. Yeah, then yeah. So this is assuming, looking at the impact on transmission. So, you know, and it gets more complicated if it has one impact on my probability of getting infected and a different impact on my probability of transmitting. You know, we have to go through the calculations again with those. So, yeah. Well, so at the stage that we were thinking about this, this was actually, we started this project thinking about measles. And then the pandemic hit. But even with Delta, the vaccine was pretty darn good against getting affected and pretty good against transmitting ongoers against Delta, which is when we submitted this. Omicron has obviously changed things. Has obviously changed things. But I'm thinking about here a single wave kind of scenario. And we're going to assume that right now, if the vaccine is 100% effective, we then basically, for the most part, say it has no impact on my infection, but it impacts my susceptibility by some probability. We just scale these numbers by that probability. Because basically, what's happening is. What's happening is this is the probability that the vaccine protects me from getting infected. So if it is only 50% effective, then this just goes down by a half and it's just that multiplication out. This assumes, does it assume no one has any immunity? I guess I'm assuming that the vaccinated person didn't have pre-existing immunity. Vaccinated person don't have pre-existing immunity. I can, um, I the final size relation. If you have some people, some of the population being susceptible and some of them being immune, you can still work out a final size relation. It's the same final size relation. It depends on just the reproductive number. So I can, whatever my population immunity looks like at the start, or because of other people getting vaccinated, I can still do this calculation for the one person who's now. Do this calculation for the one person who's now making the decision whether or not to get vaccinated. Um, if well, if I look at the reproductive number, right now, half the population's been vaccinated. Should I get vaccinated? Well, I look at the reproductive number, assuming that half the population is vaccinated. So, that reduces the final size and does some, you know, that moves us from, say, four somewhere out here to two. Say four somewhere out here to two moves this from four to two. So this one, this benefit gets bigger, this benefit gets smaller, but it's still kind of the calculations can be done. I haven't really worked through it, but for the most part, it doesn't, most of it's not going to change very much, particularly if I work under the assumption that I've got this person who I know is susceptible. Or actually, no, I think it, well, yeah, if I know the person is susceptible, it's a pretty easy. If I know the person is susceptible, it's a pretty easy calculation to fix. If I know the probability that this person is susceptible, all I really need to know is what's the probability that the person would have got infected without the vaccine. And then the rest of the calculation goes through. Some key observations. The benefit to others gets bigger as the reproductive number gets smaller, which is kind of a challenge. Your vaccine is most effective if you almost certainly won't get infected on average. And the reason for that. On average, and the reason for that is because of the fact that this is going to infinity as your probability of getting infected goes to zero. So, if we're really close to one, the vaccine probably doesn't do anything for you. But if it does anything for you, on average, it prevents a lot of infections. Maybe it's unlikely to prevent a lot of infections because probably it wouldn't transmit very far from you, but you do get some really large distributions of offspring. Distributions of offspring out when the reproductive number is a bit above one. Most of the time it goes extinct, but sometimes it gets really big. Or even if it's 0.99, most of the time not much happens, but sometimes it gets big. Kevin. And it seems like this would be from the ring vaccination. So yeah, so the question is, would this kind of justify ring vaccination? Yeah, so, or contact trace. Or contact tracing, anything that lets you take advantage of the fact that this is really big. So anything that you can do. So yeah, so an ideal scenario when you're close to one, okay, yeah, maybe go out and vaccinate people, but really contact tracing, getting those people who are newly infected and just imposing whatever costs exist on those people is much more effective than imposing the cost on these people who only. These people who, you know, only a few percent are going to get infected. So, so monkeypox say, you know, this is probably a scenario where if you can isolate as many of those newly infected people as possible, that's potentially a much bigger thing than trying to go out. The vast, you know, based on what at least I know of monkeypox right now, the vast majority of people are not at significant risk, even if it continues out of control and it's never brought under control until the infection. The infection, you know, until natural SIR dynamics take over. But still, yeah. Sarah. Because by the time you get to the if you if you take the two to three days to develop incidents to um the vaccine will get it. Okay, so let me just quickly repeat that for those of you who are listening. As Sarah was pointing out that ring vaccination, basically, if the vaccine takes longer to be, if you can't get the vaccine into the people soon enough, that it's actually had an impact before they. Actually, they had an impact before they would become infectious, which was the case in smallpox, then it's pretty good. But on the other hand, if it takes too long for the vaccine to work, people have become infectious by the time they get vaccinated, not so good. So that's the contact tracing, isolating kind of thing. But yeah, this does say that, look, the best benefit for others comes when you're really close to here. And you can make this most efficient if you can actually, if you have some way to identify those people. So get your rats out. People, so get your rats out and all that, okay. Um, but but yeah, so I'll wrap this up pretty soon, um, but this is really an interesting effect that the benefit happen as largest when you're down here where it's not no good to me. And it's just really cool that you know, that's two, not like approximately two, but it's two. Yes, one more. So it assumes that it's, I'm thinking about this kind of as an infinite population. I'm not necessarily assuming that the transmission chain itself is infinite. I'm calculating the expected size of the transmit, the expected number of infections to come out of it. And that it's expected to be a finite, you know, on average, the average number is finite, but I have to allow for the fact that some of the reason. To allow for the fact that some of the reason it, you know, there can be arbitrarily long transmission chains. I do have to allow arbitrarily long transmission chains of this. I want to wrap up quickly. What happens if we're in a case where we're thinking about, okay, let's, we've got some reproductive number and half of the infected people will isolate? You know, so how good's your intervention if you're saying you started off with, say, 2.5 and half of them are going to isolate? What's the average? Going to isolate what's the average number of infections prevented per person who isolates. That becomes really, really large as you get close to the epidemic threshold. So if you have enough people isolating, then you get no epidemic because 90% of the population isolates, so nothing happens. But as you get close to that threshold, it actually becomes very big. The average impact of each infected person gets really big, partially because of the effect that I was describing. The effect that I was describing, but also partially because there's just fewer infections, fewer people get infected, so fewer people have to isolate in order to get the impact. So here I'm looking at if I have one person who I know is infected isolating, given that 50% of the rest of the population is isolating, I could do some of these calculations. And here it does make sense to talk about a person who I know is infected isolating, even if through reproductive. Uh, isolating even if through reproductive number, the ultimate reproductive number is less than one, whereas here there's just no epidemic up here, so I can't fill in that bit. Um, we can do the same sort of calculations for what happens if people get a 100% effective vaccine at the outset. Um, similar sorts of things happen. The more people who get the vaccine, the more impact each additional vaccine has. So, the average impact gets bigger. So, if half of you get, uh, have got If half of you have gotten vaccinated and I get vaccinated, I've increased your impact because by you, by Evan not getting, by Evan getting vaccinated, that almost protects Greg, except I was going to get him anyways. But now that I've got vaccinated, Evan's vaccine protects Greg. So, yeah, okay. I had the possibility to continue on and talk about probability generating functions. I don't really have time except I'm. Have time except. I'll go to the final slide, but I want to say that penalties should be commensurate with harm. You shouldn't punish somebody like they're driving at three times the legal alcohol limit if the probability that they have any impact on anybody is almost zero. On the other hand, if you're close to this reproductive number of one, it might be really important. Number of one, it might be really important. We can prevent, uh, we can predict the number of infections that are prevented by isolating after infected, after infection, getting an effective vaccine. We can say things that about what happens if more people isolate or vaccinate. And the ultimate answer is that things are synergistic. I'm just going to skip way ahead. I had some cool stuff on probability generating functions. I'd love to talk to anybody about that. But what I will say. But what I will say is that I can get more than just the expected number of infections prevented. I can calculate the probability if the reproductive number is, say, one. That's this straight line here. I can calculate the probability that if I get, I think this, well, yeah, so the probability that if I get infected, this is the number of descendants that I would have. I can calculate the probability of each and every single one of them in an incredibly efficient way. Them in an incredibly efficient way. This takes seconds to generate. Yeah. So I'll stop there. Thank you guys. Thank you for all the questions. And hopefully anybody watching online can.
