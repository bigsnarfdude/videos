Uh to recognise us for well for first uh allowing me to be here among the fifteen uh lucky people uh to be in person and also uh for the opportunity to present this this work with uh this joint work with uh Kostya Slotsky. So okay, so I'll start by telling you a bit about elemental groups of P. Of PNP bijections. So, here, I mean, the disclaimer here is that we are going to work in this measurable setup where null sets don't matter. And, I mean, still, before delving into this, I just want to say that, okay, the general goal is I have a dynamical system. Dynamical system, and what I want to do in general is associate to it a Polish group. And I mean from my perspective, Polish actually implies nice, and so I like nice groups, and so I'm happy to be in these groups. And it turns out, and I hope to be able to convince you that studying these groups actually. Studying these groups actually gives you some more understanding of the kind of I mean it allows you to display some interesting dynamics on its own. Okay, so again I will work in the measurable setup but I think actually that you could make similar definitions of these Polish groups that I will define in the topological and differentiable setup. It just hasn't been done, but I think it's doable and the thing is then It's to Abel, and the thing is then to be able to say meaningful things about these Polish books. But that's something that I won't discuss more, but you have to keep this in mind maybe, especially for this conference. Okay, so for me, X2 would be what is called the standard probability space. And that means that, by definition, it's isomorphic. It's isomorphic to the 0-1 interval with the Lebesgue measure. So, and this is basically any probability space you could think of, any atomless probability space you could think of. And important point here is, okay, there's actually this beautiful theorem that tells you that, I mean, if you take a polished space, you put a non-atomic probability measure, then you have actually a Borel isomorphism. Be a borel isomorphism with the intervals you want, which takes your initial nanatomic measure to the Lebesgue measure. I don't really need this. All I need to have is an isomorphism between full measure sets. So, for instance, if I take the counter set with the standard one-half, one-half measure, then it's straightforward, but this is a standard probability space for what we do here. Okay. So, also, one disclaimer. Small disclaimer: everything is up to measure zero and all sets and maps in this talk will be measurable. Okay, so this is just to save space and. And so the first thing we want to look at is a PMP bijection of my standard probability space X mu. So this is a bijection and here I want it to be measurable and its inverse to be measurable. t from x to x such that for every measurable So it's that for every measurable A containing X, the measure of A is equal to the measure of T. Since I'm considering bijections, it doesn't matter if I put the T or T inverse here, it's equidotic. Okay, and I mean, this transform this bijection T is equal to if whenever I have Whenever I have a subset which is invaluant, then it must be trivial, I mean its measure must be zero or one. Okay, so these are the interesting dynamical systems in the sense that they cannot be decomposed in smaller PCs. And just to remind you. To remind you some examples. So we've seen boundary shifts. Here, of course. So let's do many different boundary shifts, but here let's take, so 0, 1 to the Z. Here the important thing is I really have to specify what my measure is. And so for instance, we could take the standard one half, one half measure. Measure okay, and you act by shift. Okay, and another easy example is so this irrational rotation. So, example of what? Example of embodic TMP bijections. So, irrational rotation, you take alpha irrational, x, I mean, its topology does not really matter to me, so let's just say it's interval 0 like this. Deval 01 like this. The measure mu is the Lepeg measure and it's called T alpha, T alpha of X is X plus 1 module. Okay, so these are two basic examples of ergodic measure-preserving transformations. And so if you want to associate a Polish group to them, well, one thing you can do is try to use the orbit structure of the space. The space. This was done by Tai. So this is the following. Oh, by the way, I should say, so for me, I will denote by autofix mu this group of all PMP, so PMP is for probability measure preserving bijections. Yeah, by the way, this. Yeah, by the way, this talk should be very, I mean, yeah, feel free to interrupt me if something is not clear. Okay, so back to Dai's definition. So I take something in order to exp. Then he defines his full group. So let me write down the definition here. Down the definition here. So bracket T, you look at all the U's probability measure-preserving bijections such that u of x is in the t orbit of x for every x in x. Okay. So this is the rule book of t. And, okay. And, okay, in the same paper it proves that, yeah, no, okay, I want to say one more thing before stating this theorem. So, from my perspective, I told you I like Polish groups, and this is a Polish group. And let me just tell you what the metric is. So fact. So you you define what's called the uniform metric, which Called the uniform metric, which actually makes sense on this full group. So let's say uniform metric between U1 and U2 elements of the full group. You define it to be the measure of the set of X such that U1 of X is not equal to U2 of X. So this is a complete separable. Second half uh metric on this football. And it actually defines uh group topology. Okay, here it's not hard to see that it defines a group topology because it's actually invariant under left and right multiplication. So everything is really nice. Okay, so this is this guy is a polytrooper. A polish group. Oh, it's I mean it's an interesting group on its own, but I'm calling it just one group because regardless of the ergodic measure-preserving transformation that you start with, guys theorem tells you that you get the same football. So, all four groups of ergodic PMP ejection are isomorphic. Okay, and I should say that it's it's more than this, it's really that you have a major preserving transformation which takes one full group. Which takes one full group to the other. And the reason is that the partition of the space into orbits, they are actually the same. If you have two partitions of the space into orbits given by measure-preserving bijections, then you have a map, measure-preserving bijection, which takes this first partition to the second partition. Okay, so this is the hysterian. Interestingly enough, This is theorem. Interestingly enough, he actually showed this theorem using really full groups. I mean, he had no, he does not speak at all about partition of the space into orbits. He has this more internal definition of the full group. But, so, yeah, that's his result. Okay, and now I want to define for you a subgroup of this full group with more interesting properties in the sense that. More interesting properties in the sense that we'll get actually many different groups. Okay, so let us let us now fix T ergodic and let us try to understand better this full group. Okay? So if I take u the full group of T then by definition for every X For every x, u of x is some power of t. Okay? And since I took an albumic transformation, almost all its orbits are infinite. And so this u is completely determined by what I will call its co-cycle, and I'll denote it as Cu. It's a map from X to Z. It's a map from X to Z and it's uniquely defined by the following equation: u of X is equal to T to the Cu of X of X. In other words, you're just asking, well, how much do I need to tr to translate by my initial transformation T in order to reach To reach in order to reach this point u of x. And one important thing to notice about this cocycle is that, well, it satisfies a cocycular identity. So if I start from point x and I go, let me state it in the right order, I always get confused, I go to this u2 of go to this u2 of x then I need to translate by this C U2 of X or yes T to the C U2 of X okay and then if I now want to go to U1 U2 of X here I translate it by wait t to the C1 since I use the map so the the point is here I use of U2 here I use U1 so I use T to the C1 of U2 To the C1 of u2 of x. So you have this cosecur equation that C U1 U2 of X is equal to C one of U two of X plus C two of X. So, what does this tell us about our book? So, the thing is, if I take now, I mean, this CU again, it completely determines my transformation. So, in other words, I can really view my full group as a subset of the following space. Space, the space of which is denoted by L is zero. So for Power List, it's all the Z-valued random variables. So this is all the measurable maps from X to Z. But you look at them again up to measure zero. Yeah, I should have said, I mean, this book also, I really look at it. I mean, I identified. Really, I look at it. I mean, I identify transformations which are the same to a matchet. This is why here I need to identify measurable maps if they coincide on a matchet. Okay, so this is nice and kind of the starting point of what I've been doing here with Torfus, so that especially so first with Alison Vocabulary and also with Kostasvatski later on. Also, with Kostya Swedski later on, is actually on this space you have a topology of convergence in measure, which really gives you this topology. And topology of convergence in measure, I'll get back to it later on. But this is kind of the... I don't want to define it here because it's not very interesting. I mean, it's really looking at the measure. I mean, this is a discrete set, so you're not just looking at the measure of the set where you. Where your functions differ. I mean, this gives you a compatible metric for this topology of convergence imaging. Anyway, so the key point is this. And now, well, what's the definition of everyone for books? So, this is a definition that I came up with some time ago. So the L1 full group of T, and let's again for simplicity assume that it's diabetic. So I denote this by dragging T but with this index one for L1. Is the space of U in the foot group of T such that, well, CU is in L? Is in L1 of X dz, which just means again that this is just saying that the integral over X of the absolute value of 0 of X is finite. Okay, so there are some things to check here. I call this another one full group, so. This and everyone full group, so in particular, it should be a group, right? And so this actually follows from this cosicle formula. So we really used at the measure imposing because if you try to integrate this absolute value of this guy, well, here you're composing with a measure posing transformation, so you're just integrating the absolute value of C1, this is finite, and here you're integrating the absolute value of C2, so it's finite. So this is at least it's a group, and And the proposition is that this is a Polish group for the L1 topology. So again, you view this as a subspace now of L1, and the thing is that this is The thing is that this becomes you have this natural L1 topology, I mean, and write down what it is, you're just integrating the absolute value of the difference of the cosecant. Okay, so now I just want to finish this first part by stating a very nice theorem, which is Pelinska's. Which is Pelinskaya's theorem. I want to state it in its original form, which is a bit stronger than the way it's usually stated. So, here I am. We take T ergodic, again measure preserving bijection on the standard probability space. On the standard probability space. You take U in the L1 full group of T and you suppose that U has the same orbits as T. Okay, so being in the full group of T, it must, it's Being in the full group of T, it must its orbits must be contained in the orbit of T, but now I really want to have the same orbits, and the conclusion is extremely strong, and it's like the first time you see it, you don't believe it, but it's true. Then U and T are flip conjugate. So, what do I mean by that? I'll just say it. I mean that either T is conjugate to U or T is U. T is conjugate to u or t is conjugate to the inverse of u. So, I mean, I should say an obvious element of the full group which has the same, of the L1 full group, which has the same orbit as T is T inverse, obviously. And yeah, and conjugacy, I mean, it's just, I mean, we've seen it before with diffeomorphisms, and it's the same thing here, but you do everything with this group instead, this group of measure-provasion transformation. So you're really conjugating by a measure-possible transformation, which really means. Transformation, which really means that from your point of view, from the measure theory point of view, they are the same. So, when you say the conjugate now, first, the consumer C belongs to the automorphism, belongs to T1. No, this is the no, the the contributes uh So the conjugacy, it belongs to the full group, but not to T1. A priori, no. And it belongs to T, so it's just eco-cycle consequences. It just shows eco-cycle equation. Yeah, you can do it this way, actually. I really prefer to think of it as a construction of conflict, but you can write down an explicit co-cycle which magically. Which magically does the job basically. It's not that you like, you know, swap orbits around. Like the orbits stay where they are. They stay there where they are. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. What year is this? Like is this a new theorem? Sorry? Is it an old theorem? Yeah, that's a good question, actually. This is from 1969, so it's quite old. I mean, it's interesting in this paper, she. Paper, she so yeah, I should have said also that Dice theorem, it was in 1959. In this paper, I mean, she probably liked Dice's theorem did not make through the wall between east and west, let's say. And so, yeah, so she proves in particular this CRM. She also observes, I mean, she proves that food groups are complete, but she did not. But she she did not define this this eventful group, so although it's kind of natural given given her result. Any other question? Yes. Good proposition and good question. So the stupid thing that you could do is just you are T on the one half in the space and T inverse on the other half. So then a pretty good So then a priori you you cannot you you cannot conjugate a priori. That's pretty much all you can have, no? So you have all the ergodic components are conjugate. I mean by so actually yeah okay so I'll just mention so the the formula. Mention the corollary to our result. So take T1 and the D then the L1 footballs are isomorphic if and only if T one and T two are split. Flip and check it. And I should say here this is a corollary not only of your work, but also of some reconstruction results that tell you that that are pretty general, that tell you that if you have a big enough subgroup of photoflex mu, two big enough subgroups of photoflex mu, suppose that they are isomorphic, then the isomorphism between them must come from a measure-preserving transformation. Okay? So then I conjugate by this measure-preserving transformation. I conjugate by this measure-preserving transformation, and I really have now two transformations with equal L-bund footbook. So, in particular, I mean, they satisfy this thing. I mean, the second transformation is in the L-bone football of the first and must have the same markets. Okay. And let me maybe, before I switch to flows, just mention one very important property which kind of is behind. Kind of is behind this preserved oars. And which is important if you want to put the similar statement in the topological realm, I mean on a counter space with a minimal homeomorphism, let's say. So the key property is that key point point of Belinskaya, I mean of Berinskaya's proof is the following is that dynamics on each T orbit is easy. Is easy. So, what do I mean by that? I mean that, so I start, I have this t ergonic, and I take u, I mean, here ergonomicity is actually not important. Let's take any t with, let's say, infinite orbits, take u in this L-1 full group, then U in particular is a bijection of each T orbit, and each T orbit is just a copy of Z. And the action on this copy of Z is a very different. The action on this copy of Z is very easy to understand. So, more precisely, if X is in X and U is in the L14 group of T, I mean, either, so when I look at the, so here I don't assume anything on U except that it's in this L1f group, either the U orbit of X is finite. Is finite. So, okay, I have this. Maybe I should just draw a picture. I have actually I don't think I have anything, so I won't draw a picture, sorry. Or the thing is that forward orbits tend to press infinity or minus infinity. So the limit as n tends to press infinity. tends to plus infinity of C U n of X is either plus infinity or minus infinity. Okay, so really points, they pick a direction and you see that if you ask that you have the same orbits as T, well, then you are what you see in this second thing. And already you see that, well, either you go to plus infinity or to minus infinity, and this is something. Or to minus infinity, and this is somehow how you get a plus or a minus in the flip conjugacy. And the idea is really that the dynamics on the orbits is so simple that you can really come up with a way to conjugate things orbit by orbit. That's what we can grow amounts of misfortune. Exactly. Exactly, that's exactly what's going on. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so now let's switch to flows and record on okay. So we started with PMP bijections, which are really. PMP bijections, which are really the same as PMP action of Z. And so, by definition, a flow for me is a Borel action of R on X by PMP bijection. So in other words, I have this map curly F from arm times X to X, which takes a reality and a point X to another point F of T X. Okay, it's an action map and it's measurable and for having And in this book, it goes to L1 mouse, right? L1 mouse. Yes. But you can cook up examples where it happens, but it's not L1. It's not if and only if. But yeah. Okay. So yeah, for every T, F of T dot this P d measure. Okay, and I will just give one example which is which we've already seen, which was at least already mentioned, which is called a very nice construction, it's called the suspension flow. So for example what do I take? So it's many examples actually. So I start with t out of x mu. So I space x mu here and I have t here. And now the new space that I built, which will also be a standard probability space, is Is so, let's call it x tilde. It's x times 0, 1. So I put all these vertical lines that we have right now. And so let me just not write down the proper definition, but just explain how things go. The the thing is, your flow uh just goes normally along this this Normally, along these lines. It's just R acting by translation on each of these lines. And the only thing that I have to tell you is what to do when you reach the top. And now when you reach the top, the thing is that you go to... So s say here you have this this line corresponds to this point X. Now when my flow hits here, I want it to go with here X, okay? I want it to go with TRX, okay? And this is a measure for loading uh a a PMP flow and uh if T was ergodic then it's ergodic as well. I mean so it's really nice and there's this notion of cross-section which somehow allows you to go the other way around except that you have to allow yourself to change the the height. Question? Question? How featured you're creating? Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that. Can you actually say again what this is doing? So again, horizontally, I mean, if I have this point here and I have epsilon small, then f of epsilon of, okay, so this is 0 and 1. 0 and 1 here and here I mean flow of epsilon dot what is it? I mean everywhere here is just doing plus epsilon okay and the only thing is when it hits the top so suppose I'm like in one minus epsilon over two then I actually use this T of X and still I mean flow And still, I mean, flow by a distance epsilon. So, yeah. Yeah, actually, I should probably have given a more rigorous definition, which for which you can write a formula, but anyway. That's a more satisfying way of presenting this. Okay. So, okay, now what do we do? We have a flow, measure positioning flow, then we can. Measure possible in full, then we can definitely make the same definition as before, which we did with Eyes and Bo Gandery. So you define as the full loop of the flow, and we call it orbit full loop, to emphasize the fact that you're really looking at orbit. So suppose we have this flow F, and which is P and P, and again you look at And again, you could cut or nature photonic transformations such that t of x is in the orbit of x. Okay? And here, again, suppose that your flow is free, so you have no fixed points for every t non-zero f of t dot has no response. So, in other words, each orbit you can really view it as a copy of the real line. Then, again, we can play this game of associating the co-cycle to this guy, and again, we view the flow here, sorry, the full group of the flow as a subset of H0 of X group R. So, this time it's R, real-valued random variables. random variables and this time I want to specify exactly what is this topology of convergence in measure. Again, yeah, this is all measurable maps from X to R up to measure 0 and the topology is the topology of convergence in measure. I'll just give you a compatible metric but it's really this thing that you view at some point in your life if you do probability error. Probability here, you have this, or maybe it's called convergence in probability. I don't remember, but anyway, it's a compatible metric is obtained by so I have two functions in this L0 space and their distance is just the integral of our. It's just the integral of x. So here I want to put absolute value of f of x minus g of x. But of course this might not be integrable, so I have to put, for instance, this thing, take the minimum between one. This is a compatible metric. And let me just mention overall that one of the things that we learned in probability theory is that this convergence measure a significant A sequence Fn converges in measure to F if for every subsequence of Fn, I can find a further subsequence which converges pointwise almost surely to F. But I mean I don't need that for yeah, I wanted to explain why Explain why this is a Polish book for this topology of conversions in measure. I wanted to explain why this is Polish, but I won't have time, so just let me just mention this as a theorem. So this is a forge book or Or topology of convergence in measure. Okay, so again we have this dynamical system, we associated the Polish book to it, so we are quite happy. But again, the situation is quite sad. And here again, we rely on the work of Robert Paul to show this. Basically, once you make the definition, it's pretty obvious to get there. It's quite hard to get there. So the theorem is that any two ergodic EMP 3 flows have isomorphic footballs. Okay. Okay, so by now I think you can guess where this is going. We're going again to replace L0 here by L1 and see what happens. And again it's on the level of orbits, like it's actually orbit equivalents? Yes, it's the same thing as before. So here you're working with a radio compact group, so it takes a bit more work to show that if you have the same full group, then the orbits must be the same. That actually that's something Same, that actually is something that we would like to push for some Polish routes and we don't know how to do. I would say, yeah, that's the flow version of automata, yeah. But yeah, I should say also I'm really not an expert on this in these flows. And yeah, the the things that we say with Tuski, as you will see, they are quite general, and we did not. Yeah, we did not. We did have a talk from the transfer of the suspension. Excellent. Okay, so, yeah. So, alright, let's go to everyone through groups of crows. By the way, I should say here, I mean, this definition they work really in a more general setup. But yeah, the rules for which we can say interesting things are rather sparse. We do have some generalizers, but so and this Berlinskaya theorem in the L1 case is really A good motivation for me to look at this everyone from books of okay. So definition So I have F a free A free flow. Freeness is not really important, but let's take it for simplicity. Again, then a free, sorry, PMP flow and it's I'm defining it's L1 full group as again all the elements Such that t of x is in the sorry next up. Now I don't want to do this. I want to look at the procycle of course. So I just want to ask that now this C T is in a My proposition is that this is again a Polish group or L1 topology. And here, really, I mean, I did not have time to explain it, but it's really the exact same strategy. We need the exact same strategy as for food so far. Okay. So, guys. Wait, sorry, what is the... I was like definitely from that app. Yeah, it's my notation is. Oh, sorry, yeah, that that was excuse me. I take an element in the full move of the flow. So, in particular, then I have this co-cycle by. Then I have this co-cycle by looking at to which, I mean, by how much do I need to push to go from x to t of x. And I want this co-cycle now to be integral. Okay. So let's evacuate immediately the, I don't know, the very kind of shameful question that we have. Actually, yeah, when we began this project, we were kind of sure that a similar result would be that there was an analog of Pelly's Gaia's theorem in this evolution setup, but we were not able to prove it. So the question is, how many books of those are there? Are there? Oh. I mean, here I want to say free analog. Otherwise, it's not hard to have with different examples. So, this is our question. So, in particular, I'm not able to tell you that there are two different L1 full groups of flows, although I strongly believe that it is the case. It's just, I mean, yeah, we are not able to tell. Yeah, we are not able to prove it. And I mean an equivalent way uh of formulating this question using this kind of reconstruction result that I did not explain in today. So when do we have that two flows have the same payment loop. Okay? So this Okay? So this we don't know, and it's yeah. Okay, but moving on, let's still try to see what we can say about this group. And I want to end this talk by telling you a bit about its structure. So let us understand what we can say in general. What we can say in general about this L1 full group of cloud, again, this is a free herbicide PNG. So what I mean by that is really understand the structure of this group as a college group. So the first thing you can do, since you've taken recyclers which are integrable, is well, integrate them. Well, integrator. So as to this, so we define this map which we call the index map. So I have t in the L1 full book of my flow, and so the index of t is just this integral. Okay, so I just did for you this map, the T from the A14 group to the reals. And it's not hard to see using this cosycle identity that it's actually a group homomorphism. And because I put this L1 topology, it's clear that it's a continuous group homomorphism. So out of this Polish group, we get this We get this uh locally compact group, uh the real line, which we all know. This is continuous. So, and notice that this morphism it it speaks because I can use my my Euro internal flow just to go back there. So, in particular, this is now. This is now the kernel of semi-direct variables. But now the question becomes: what is this? And what we prove is that this index map really gives you the abelianization of your group in the sense that. Group in the sense that this is really the group generated by commutators of the flow, and you have to take the closure. Okay? So again, this tells me that really, I mean, you have in general, I mean, you're maybe familiar with I mean, you're maybe familiar with agalinization of a discrete group, where what you are doing is you quotient by this derived group, so the group of commutators generated by commutators. Here we do a similar thing, we take the closure, and so we get this largest abelian continuous potentially, and so our theorem is that this largest abelian potenti is the real mag. Again, under the assumption then that the action is ergodic, because otherwise you could like. Ergodic because otherwise you could like integrate over different ergodic components. Okay, so how much time do I have? Yeah, I guess I'm pretty much done. I just want to comment just a key idea for proving this is, so usually, I mean, in the work that I did before, the crucial distinction, when Before the crucial distinction, when you take an element in this L1 full group or in a full group, first thing you do is you have this periodic part and you deal with it somehow. And here it's not hard to see that the periodic guy is a limit of commutators. But then you have the aperiodic part and you try to deal with it. Here, it's not this distinction which is important. The important distinction is the HOPS decomposition of your transformation. Of your transformation. So your element of the full group is acting on each orbit as a measure-preserving transformation. And the key thing is to decompose, to use the crop decomposition of this transformation. So you have this dissipative part that you have to treat separately, and this conservative part that you have to treat separately. And for each of these parts, you really have kind of a lot of work. And just let me finish by mentioning Mentioning another result that we proved, which says that somehow the situation is much richer, is the following. So take again F ergodic free BMP flow. There exists an element T in the actually this L infinity food group that you could define by just Infinity full group that you could define by just asking that the cosycle is bounded such that T acts ergodically on each orbit. So in particular, I mean in terms of this Hook decomposition, it is conservative, but of course it's much more complicated than this periodic thing that we were looking at previously. I mean, again, let me remind you that just Perlinskaya's theorem, it tells you. Just Pellis-Gai's theorem, it tells you that the action on the orbits is pretty simple. Here you have guys which have infinite orbits but which have very chaotic behavior, so you need to deal with this separately. Okay, and I'll end here. Thank you very much. Questions? When I say TF, there are what would be notations for that measure on? Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see that's where you use this. Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you get something interesting if you go to LP? So that's a very good question. So let me imagine that you could go to L P in actually two ways, for P greater than one or or actually also less than one. Or, actually, also less than one. I believe you would still get a Polish group in either case. We just did not look at it, but yeah, it would be interesting to look at these guys. I should say that with Thése Carney and Mathieu-Joseph, who is finishing his PhD thesis with WWE. So we studied for the case of C-actions. Uh for the case of Z actions, these uh LP food groups for P less than one and uh they have a very different behavior somehow. You I mean you don't get this index map anymore, these are already equal to the to their the closure of their TRF group. And a nice thing that we could do with them is is to show that this L P orbit equivalence for I mean that this Bay scale result that we that I showed here That I showed here is not true if you take P based on using this L P for groups for P. But is it true for P? It is true because L P for P yes L P what about L in T C that is L infinity, yes it's it's interesting I mean from the from the perspective of Polish rules the problem is that you you don't get a natural Polish topology and probably you cannot put a Polish rule topology because NFI is not separate. Because N infinity is not separable. But from the point of view of really orbit equivalence and asking how the co-cycle of an orbit equivalence is, yeah, it definitely is something interesting to look at. And I believe, if I understood correctly, I mean, I never looked at the paper in detail, that so if you replace Z by Z two, then there is actually an L infinity orbit equivalence uh between two systems which are not contributed at all, so contradict at all. So it's kind of a yeah a very striking distinction.
