Okay, so our work was motivated by the following conjecture of Bhargava. Bargava was interested in counting number fields. So he's counting fields of number fields of degree n and counting them up to Degree n, I'm counting them up to implicitly up to isomorphism. And you want, yeah, so by this, I'm going to, by the Galois group of K over Q, I mean naturally the Galois group of the Galois closure of K. And he was asking that this was isomorphic to for symmetric groups. This means this maximal possible Galois action. And then he was counting them with bounded field. This is the discriminant number field. So there's only finitely many number fields. A bounded discriminant makes natural. A bounded discriminant makes natural to count them. And Bargova conjectured an asymptotic formula. The following form is a half times. This is the number of two torsion elements in the symmetric group, psi, two, divided by n factorial, which is the cardinality of the symmetric group. And then you had an oil product over primes p and then summing from k equals zero to n q n n minus k. n n minus k sorry k n minus k minus q k minus 1 n minus k plus 1 this is all divided by e to the k and this is where this function q so q of n comma k is the number of partitions Of partitions of n into at most A parts. Good. So I was in Bath at the British Mathematical Colloquium and I was discussing with Avil Shankar about this resort. Ah, yeah, thank you. B. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, I was just going to see Gabo Shankar and he asked me and Tim about this factor a half. So, how to explain the factor one half. Yeah, I'll talk a little bit more about why this is. First of all, I should say this conjecture is known for n equals 2, 3, 4, and 5, proved by Mandra Bhagava. This term here, you can interpret it as some kind of p-adic density. I'm going to spend a long time talking about this kind of stuff in the talk, so it should hopefully become more clear as I'm going. This is a p-adic density, and this is also some kind of real density. And this is also some kind of real density, you can interpret, but then the fact of half is not quite clear how to think of it, you know, theoretically or real. And we look at Bhagavad's paper, and he's a bit vague at the point where he introduces this factor of a half. And he kind of, yeah, if you read, and you can interpret it, he's giving two options. So the first option is the half comes from. Is the half comes from the sign of the discriminant because we're looking at and we're looking at the absolute value of the discriminant, but the discriminant could have a sign. And the second option, which he hints at, is the factor half comes from adding the additional assumption that the discriminant has to be 0, 1 modulo 4. So obviously any number field satisfies this. Satisfies this condition. So I'm interested. I mean, I've just mentioned this now. I'm interested to what people think. So I'm going to ask you: who thinks it's due to this is the explanation, number one. Okay, four versus good. Who thinks the second one in terms of the discriminant being zero, one much with four? Okay, more people. That's good. That's promising. So actually. Actually, they're both wrong. Yeah. They're both wrong. So I'll explain, I'll tell you why they're both kind of wrong. It's because the same factor, a half, yeah, occurs. Yeah, when you replace, so we're just looking at, you know, field extensions of Q here. But you see the same factor occurring when you. You see the same factor occurring when you replace Q by any global field. I mean, it definitely can't be this one because we've already taken into account the Archimedean information here. This one's a lot a bit more subtle. I'll try and get back to this at some point to talk about what role it plays. But if you're over other number fields, you don't have other global fields, you don't have Congress conditions like this on. Global fields, you don't have Congress conditions like this on to discriminate, but you still get the same factor of a half. So, this hints that factor of a half should have some kind of geometric origin. So, factor of a half should have geometric origin. And it does, I know, create enough suspense already. It does, I know, create enough suspense already, so I'll tell you exactly what it is, and I'll try and explain in more detail throughout the talk what this means. But basically, yeah, this vector of the half is pairs effective cone constant for the stack, a classifying stack B S N. This is how. This is how want to think of this factual fact of a half and how it naturally arises. I'll just say briefly what this is, I'll talk about it in more detail later. So, yeah, so Manning's got this conjecture on rational points about the height of final varieties. Pair had some, it's got a conjecture of the leading constant. It's got various terms. One of them is this effective cone constant, which is slightly mysterious. I mean, it's some funny rational number, which you just have to calculate in each case. And if one applies Pairs formulas to this step, Applies pairs formulas to this stack and we haven't defined it yet, but it's bit sales factor for half. Okay, so I won't talk about stacks for a bit. I'll leave the stacks alone for now. But basically, what we've managed to do is once we've got this observation, we can completely generalize Bargover's conjecture to look counting arbitrary number fields where the Gawa closure doesn't have to be Sn. Gauer closure doesn't have to be Sn, the Gauer closure could be any Gao group G. So, I'd like to explain this conjecture, and to do that, I need to explain to you what Mala's conjecture actually is. So, I'll use the notation gamma k, this is the absolute Gauer group of a field. I'm going to let G in Sn be a transitive subgroup. So, yeah, G is going to be the Galois group of the extensions I'm interested in. Yeah, if you haven't seen Manlis conjecture before, it's a bit technical setting it up, but I've got to recall the setup. So, yeah, just bear with me. So for G, an element of G, we define the index of the element. It's nothing to do with the index of a group, the normal index of a subgroup in a group. It's n minus the number. The number of orbits of G on the set one up to N and then here we go here Now you define this A invariant of G, you take the minimum over all possible indices. Over all possible indices in your group. And oh, you want to remove the identity because the identity, yeah, the identity is going to index zero, and we want to remove that element. So I'll remove the identity element. And you also have to take the inverse of this minimum. Cool. And the conjecture is all about everything's phrased in terms of conjugacy classes to the group. So I'm going to buy this to be conjugacy, it's going to be the set. Whether this would be conjugy, it's going to be the set of conjugacy classes of G. And one amazing fact, I'm not sure the first person to notice this was, but there's a canonical Gao action of the absolute Gauer group of Q on the conjugacy classes. Like, oh, I've just got some finite group. Okay, there's no field anywhere yet. Okay, is mine. Anywhere yet. Well, okay, it's not anyway. I've got some finite group, and there's a canonical action of the absolute gala group Q on the conjugacy classes. So absolute algae Q acts on the conjugacy classes as follows. So rather than tell you exactly how the Gao group acts, I'll just tell you what the invariant elements are, and that's enough to determine the Gao action. So a conjugacy class. So a conjugacy class in the group is invariant. And so if we look at the absolute Gao group of some finite field extension L, say, of Q. I'm going to tell you which conjugated classes are defined over L, basically, and that's enough to tell you what the Gao action is. So the conjugated class is invariant. So, the conjugate class is invariant to this Gauer group action if and only if when you evaluate it at a character, it lies in L. So this is for all characters chi of G. So mind you, yeah, character, you look at the represent, you look at, take a representation of G, and then you take the trace of the corresponding matrix. So this value is just some complex number, and I'm asking this complex number lies in my given field. Number lies in my given field L. And that's what it means for a conjugacy class to be defined over L. If I'm going to value for all characters, the result I get lies in L. So, yeah, a bit more notation, state of the conjecture. I know this M of G, so this is going to stand for minimum. So, this is going to be the collection of conjugacy classes of G, which are non-trivial. And the index is the minimum index. So, I've encoded the minimum index already in this number, A, I'll via reciprocal. So, I have to do reciprocal back out again. But this is the conjugacy classes of. But this is the conjugacy classes of minimal index. And then I'm going to let the invariant be I look at the number of conjugacy classes and minimal index, and then I quotient out by the Gao action. So yeah, so the Gau group, absolute Gao group of Q is acting on this conjugacy class and minimum index. I count how many orbits there are for this action. Right, now I can state Mala's conjecture. So, this concerns looking at the number of field extensions of Q of degree N, such that the Galois group of the Galois closure of the extension is isomorphic to G, and this means kind of Kind of as a permutation representation. Yeah, so G, I mean, you think of G acts, you know, if K is given by some polynomial, the Galgruk acts on the roots of the polynomial. And I want G to act on the roots of the polynomial exactly via this embedding. And I'm going to look at once a bounded discriminant. Then Mallow conjectured that this is asymptotic for some leading constancy of G. And then these invariants are just introduced. And then these invariants are just introduced. So b to the power of a g, that's the inverse of the minimal index. And then you have log b to the little b of g minus one. So this is b goes to infinity. And this little b was introduced here. It's the number, number of Galois orbits on the conjugacy classes of minimal index. Any questions about the statement of the conjecture? Yes. Yes, yes, exactly. Yes. Well, the difference with Bargava's conjecture is he conjectured a formula for the leading constant, which Mallah. Which Mala has not done. That's how they're different. Is the Bargo's conjecture? No. Bargava's conjecture is gone. Yeah. Bargovi gave a conjecture of the leading constant, which Mala doesn't do. So this is exactly what I'm talking about now. So there's two problems with this conjecture. Okay, maybe the first one's an odd problem. Depends on your taste. Okay, Maller gave no prediction for the leading constant. There's a more serious problem, however, is that actually the conjecture is wrong. So the exponent of the power of log is wrong in general. And there was a counterexample found by Kluners for some certain wreath product or groups. So whenever you find a counterexample to the conjecture, you try and change the conjecture. You try and change the conjecture to fix it, and that's what me and Tim have done. So, this first conjecture I'd like to talk about. Yeah, we're still working on it. It's kind of still work in progress, but we're getting there. And we took like Manning's conjecture as our guide for how to formulate it. First of all, it's more convenient. First of all, it's more convenient for the setup. Here's counting number fields. It's more convenient for the setup if you instead count homomorphisms from the absolute Gauer group. So the conjecture is easier to phrase for homomorphisms. So I'll do that. So I'm going to, this set omega is going to be the set of bad homomorphisms that I don't want. So it's a collection of homomorphisms, the absolute Gaul group Q to G, such that my homomorphism phi is not subjective. Homeworld Simphi is not subjective. These are the bad ones. I mean, I want to count extensions whose gauge closure is G. So this means I need to be subjective. So I'm throwing out the ones which are not subjective. But there's more we need to throw out. I'll write in this way and then I'll explain what it is. So you need to throw out those which mu infinity of the kernel of phi is not equal to plus or minus one. So what I mean here, mu infinity means the collection of all roots of unity. And maybe I should put a k. Maybe I should put a K or something like that. And the kernel of phi corresponds to some Galois extension with Galois group G. And I look at the collection of all roots of unity in this extension. And I throw away those which have more roots of unity than Q. Okay, so throw away the extensions which have more roots of unity than the ground field. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there is, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there is, yeah. Okay, then to simplify things, I'm going to assume where I'm stating this conjecture: yeah, there are no local obstructions. So I'll just say very briefly what I mean by this. There's a famous theorem by somebody called Grunwald-Wang's theorem, and Grunwald proved the theorem, and then Wang found a counterexample to it, and it goes as far as it says there's no And it goes as far as it says: there's no Z mod 8 Z extension of Q which realizes the unramified extension of Q2 of degree 8. So there's some kind of, in this counterexample, there's a local obstruction at 2 to realizing certain local fields by a given field over Q. So I'm going to assume for now, I'll talk about local obstructions more later. I'll assume there's no local obstructions in our case. Uh I'm also going to assume that the set of minimal elements generates the whole of G. I know, yes. Yeah, I'll talk about this later, bro. Groups and whatnot. Yeah, yeah. Well, okay, yeah. You're right. It's a global obstruction. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, then. So what's the conjecture? So we have to normalize our counting function by 1 over g, and as I say, we're going to count holomorphisms from the absolute galaxy. From the absolute Gao group, I'm going to throw away the bad ones and then I'm going to count them of bounded discriminant. But the discriminant here, this means I'm ordering by the discriminant of the corresponding field extension of degree n. So here, despite I'm looking at the these correspond to the Gower closure, I'm going to order them according to I'm going to order them according to the discriminant of the corresponding field of degree n, because this is closer to what Mala was doing. Great. And then you get an asymptotic formula of the following form. So it's the same exponents that Mallah predicted. They haven't changed. What has changed is, yeah, basically the counterexample of clueless comes from the fact that. Comes from the fact that some extensions in this family have more roots of unity than you'd expect. I mean, Clunis himself observed this in the paper that his counterexample comes from certain extensions having too many roots of unity and various other, yeah. I mean, yeah. Here would observe this, but we're saying once you throw away these ones, you should get the exponents predicted by mala. And then the leading constant. Here, I mean, I'm working over Q as my ground field, so I just want to throw away extensions which have more roots of unity than plus or minus one, the same roots of unity as Q. Okay, so the formula for leading constant is as follows: you take a of g, which is the same factor there, to the power of b of g minus one. Minus one. I need some extra notation. So I'm going to write g check. This is going to be the collection, the homomorphisms in the scheme theoretic sense from G to G M. So this is just, well, it's a group scheme anyway. It's a group scheme of one-dimensional representations of G. So homophobicism of G to G M is a one-dimensional representation. So I'm viewing it as a group scheme. Group scheme. Then you have to divide through by the number of one-dimensional representations which are defined over Q, and then you re-normalize by a factorial, BG minus one factorial. Okay, then we have an Archimedean factor, which is more of the same as Bargo we got. You look at the two torsion elements of G divided by the cardinality of G, and then you've got. And then you've got local factors at all of the primes p. It looks like one minus one over p to the power of bg. Yeah, so this is a this is a convergence factor. We also, yeah, anything we do, we have to renormalize by the cardinality of G. So this is some kind of yeah, renormalization which makes everything work. thing work and then I sum over the number of local homomorphisms this are yeah it's quite small you might forget about this is gamma of QP to G and then I divide by one over the norm so it's just the the discriminant of the corresponding local extension and then I take this all to the power of Then I take this all to the power of a of g. Right. Hopefully that's not too squash for the people at the back. Yes, this is some rational number. I've got Archimedean factor, and I've got product of all primes p, corresponding local factors, where sum over local, local homomorphisms divided by the discriminant of the corresponding local extension to power A of G. So, I want to talk. Say again? I'll talk about that in a bit. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to, you know, create suspense here. I'll talk about the alpha constant, yeah. So, I've got this funny assumption here that the minimum elements generate the group. Elements generate the group G. This is important for stating the conjecture because you don't get this formula otherwise about this hypothesis. So, this condition that m of g generates g, we say that, yes, we call this case, yeah, okay, we call this, we call this case, well, we say here that the discriminant The discriminant uh is is a fair height function. In this case, this is basically the case where the discriminant defines what I call a fair height function. So, this terminology, fair heights, was first introduced by Melanie Wood. She's got a paper which looks at counting abelian extensions of bounded discriminant or unbounded conductor. Bounded discrepant or unbounded conductor. And she noticed that when you have some condition in the Beelian case, which she called fairness, you get nicer-looking asymptotic formulae where you get Euler products and stuff like this. So we've generalized Melanie Wood's notion of fairness, and this is the correct definition in general. Right. Now, I'll give you an example. So, how does conjecture one relate to Bhagavad's conjecture? So, the important set of elements you have to calculate first is the collection of minimal conjugacy classes. So, the elements are minimal index here. So, you have to look at the index is n minus the number of orbits of your element of your group acting one to n minus one. And the minimal index is realized by transpositions, because transpositions have Transpositions have n minus one orbits, yeah. So this is realized by the transpositions. Connection transposition group. Okay, then everyone knows the transpositions generate SN. So we're in the fair case I talked about, which is good. About, which is good. And then these invariants, well, I was already known how to calculate them previously. Yeah, I mean, the minimal index is one, so the invariant is one. And we have to look at conjugacy classes of minimal index up to Gau action. I mean, the conjugacy classes are the transpositions, and the gala action is trivial in this case. So this B invariant is just one. And then the corresponding factor of a half is just. Is just this factor here. So you look at the one-dimensional representations of Sn, which are defined over Q. And this is exactly the sine representation. This is the only one, and it's defined over Q. So this is where the factor of a half comes from. And what about the other local factors? Yeah, so this is actually something Balgova himself proved. He proved. Proved he proved what in the Malath conjectured literature is called a mass formula, and he basically showed that sums like this, which occur here, you can write them in exactly the way Bargava wrote in terms of partitions and stuff like that. Good. Now I'm going to talk about what do you do if you're not in the fair case. So, you have to do something a little bit different here. This is the second conjecture. Yeah, so assume that the discriminant is not fair, which, as defined over there, means defined. Oh, yeah, it means the collection. It means the collection of elements and minimal index don't generate the whole group. So, in this case, you have to take a quotient. So, i, you take a quotient out by the group generated by the elements and minimal index. So, this construction is quite nice because it's like this is it's an analog for stacks of itaka fibration from birational geometry. From birational geometry. So, this is the analog of Itaka vibration from birational geometry. Yeah, I mean, yeah, when you take stacks, yes. But the nice thing about this case is you can phrase everything just in terms of groups. Yeah. So this is what we call it the Itaka vibration. And you should think of it being analog attacker vibration from birational geometry. And how do you use this? I'll call this quotient i. This is for like etaker group. How do you use this? So I'm going to let psi be a home. Be a homomorphism now going to the attacker group. So the quotient group which appears in the attacker vibration. And what one does is basically one sorts one sorts of extensions and one One sorts are extensions and one sorts of homorphisms according to their image with respect to the attacker vibration. So I'm going to have this one part of the conjecture. So I'm going to look at the number of homomorphisms which land in my large group G, such that when I pass via the attacker vibration, this is why it's easier to stay in terms of homomorphisms because you can see you just. Homomorphisms because you can see you just go via the attacker vibration. I hit my given homomorphism to the attacker group I and then I also ask the discriminant of the corresponding extension of degree n is less than or equal to b, and I'm not in my exceptional set. And then I'm hoping to get constant out, so I'm going to take limit as b goes infinity. And then I renormalize by the asymptotic formula I'm expecting. And it's also appropriate to throw in, to make sure you give exactly the right answer, to throw in this renormalization factor we had elsewhere. Yeah, one over the cardinality of G. So then we conjecture this limit exists. And we do have an explicit formula for it as well, similar. Formula for as well, similar to the formula I've already given. I won't explain that now. It's a kind of similar formula. But anyway, and moreover, and if you look at the leading constant in Mallard's conjecture, so the constant you're actually trying to find, it's given by a sum over all these leading constants for the groups which appear for sort, yeah, for the attacker vibration. So this is over the psi. I don't claim this constant is non-zero, okay? It could be zero in general. It could be zero in general, but it doesn't matter because what we claim is when you take the sum over all the constants, the sum converges. So the process you should follow in this case, if the screen is not fair, is you need to sort your field extension according to the image via the attacker vibration. Any questions about the control? Yeah. Pardon? Alternating group. Oh, you take G equals A5. You take G equals AN. What's the question? Sorry. Oh, you want to tell what the formula is? Right. Okay. Sorry. It is right, okay. Sorry, yeah, in this case, yeah, so um, yeah, so sorry if you take g equals an, yeah, then the uh the discriminant is again fair, correct me if I'm wrong, Tim. The discriminant is against a fair fair counting function. So you're in this well, you're in the case of conjecture one, and one just has to stare with this formula. I mean, it maybe depends on your taste whether you. It maybe depends on your taste whether you like this expression for the addict densities or not. I mean, it's just what it is. In practice, one can simplify it using what's known in the mallet conjecture literature as mass formula. So you can use a mass formula to simplify this. But the mass formula is only in general, it's only going to work at all but find many primes. You're going to have like, you know, prime two or something. I don't know what to do in general than just calculate it explicitly by hand on expecting some formula. And it's actually really surprising in Bargova's case. He got a uniform. Surprising in Bargava's case, he got a uniform formula for primes p, even for the primes divided in the group. I don't know, I don't know a good explanation of that in general. That might answer your question, yeah. Cool, yeah, so let's talk about some examples of the second conjecture. Yes, yeah, yeah, I'll get to that. Yes, yeah, yeah. I'll get to that, don't worry. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so examples is conjecture number two. This is about the attacker vibration. So you take G is dihedral group of degree four, so it's got eight elements. Then here there is actually an attacker vibration. And the attacker vibration is just mapped to Z12Z. And what this does on the level of fields, this corresponds to the quadratic resolvent. So in this case, conjecture two says if you want to count quartic field extensions with Gaul closure D four, you should sort them according to their quadratic resolvent. To their quadratic resolvent. And the quadratic resolvent, it just means the field extension given by joining the square root of the discriminant. In this case, the conjecture is known. This is also one of the results which motivated our conjecture. So this is known by work of Cohen, Diaz, Ediaz and Olivier two thousand two. And another nice case of conjecture two is you can take G to be abelian. Here the attacker vibration is given by quotient kick out. Quotient kick it out by what I call this. So the Q torsion elements of G, and this is where Q is the smallest prime dividing the order of G. Okay, in this case, it is also possible to verify the conjecture. It requires a bit of work, and we're not completely finished with it. Work and we're not completely finished with it yet. But anyway, we've done some special cases. So there's a theme of right which gives an asymptotic formula for the number of Belian extensions are bounded discriminant. But Wright's formula is not in our form. So we'll have to do a bit of work to rewrite it in terms of ItACOF valuation. Basically, Wright uses a completely different approach using Mobius inversion. He's got some complicated Mobius sum, and you have to do this Mobius inversion, do some process. Do this Mobius inversion, do some press on summation back again to try and get it into our form. But the conclusion is: when you count ability extensions abounded discriminate, you should sort them according to the fibers of this map. Yes. No. Sorry, there are a lot of examples out there. I can't talk about all of them, but we've checked our conjecture in this case as well. But for a bounded article conductor, this work of Ila Varma and I can't remember any of the authors, sorry. And I can't remember the other authors, sorry. Yes, that's on going to next. Yeah, so thanks, Tim. Yeah. His case is not fair. Yeah, there's an ETA vibration in his case. And what happens is one of the fibers of the attacker map is accumulating, and you have to remove one of these fibers. Right, now let's let's get let's get serious. Yeah, now we're gonna do stacks. Okay, I've put off long enough. Okay, so ma malice conjecture it's a you should think of a special case of uh Manning's conjecture. Many in this conjecture for algebraic stacks, specifically for the stack BG. Well, I say subset, it's equal to this. So, this observation, I believe, I think it's actually Ked Laier has a paper on kind of mass formula, and he has a small remark at the end of his paper where he suggests looking at this stack. But the first people to try and work this out in any kind of detail was Ellenberg, such. Detail was Ellenberg, Satriano, and Surik Brown. And there's another paper as well by Dada and Yasuda, where they've got the same aim, but quite a different perspective on the problem. And what the aim of these two papers is, is to find a common generalization. A common generalization of Mallah's conjecture and Manning's conjecture for fanovarieties. That's what the aim was. But they weren't able to say anything new that wasn't known about malice conjecture. And that's what our aim is, to use this framework to say something new about malice conjecture using stacks, like stuff you can phrase without stacks, but we use stacks to guide us with what to do. And we personally found this paper. And we personally found this paper by Diagnosis User more useful. The framework in there has been more useful. Like Ellenberg, Saturday, and Soak Brown, for example, don't predict the power of log. You should get, but here they have a prediction for the power of the logarithm. So we found that framework more useful. So what is the corresponding stack? Yeah, so yeah, I'm not gonna spend ages running on this stuff anyway. Just dwelling on the stuff there. So, BG is a classifying stack. I'll just tell you what k-points are. Strictly, it's a groupoid, but we only care about the things of isomorphism anyway. So, it's isomorphism classes. It classifies isomorphism classes of G tosses. Everyone knows that this is the same as H1K of G, right? And G is still our finite group. Yeah, finite group we're looking at. Yeah, final group we're looking at. And everyone knows when the Gao action is trivial, you can write this as homomorphisms. So it's non-abelian cohomology. It's homomorphisms from the absolute Gao group of K to G. But you also have co-boundary condition. You need to identify two co-cycles if they differ by co-boundary. And in this case, it just corresponds to considering homomorphisms up to conjugation, where conjugation is taking place inside G. Is taking place inside G. So this is exactly what we're interested in, right? Great. We're interested in Homer's absolute karmic up to G. I mean, it's this extra thing about conjugation. You know, let's not worry about that for now. So this is what we're interested in. So what we are including here. So elements, so these homomorphisms of bounded discriminants, so we're all invited discriminants as subfield. These correspond exactly with rational points of BG of bounded height, where our height is the discriminant of the corresponding field extension. So that's why it's secretly a problem about rational points. How much long have I got? Oh, bugger. All right, okay. So we yeah, so basically what we do is we apply Pair's formulism to this problem. To this problem. So, pair add a conjecture if you look at rational points of bounded height. So, to say the conjecture correctly, you have to move some thin set omega. And he predicted an asymptotic formula of the form, I call it theta, theta of x divided by rank of the Picard group of x minus one, factorial. Then you have to take the order of the Then you have to take the order of the algebraic Brau group of X modular constants and then Tamagawa measure of the elements, the idyllic points of X, which are orthogonal to the Brau group. So this is the form. Oh yeah, and then you have Sien, you've got B log B to the rank of the Picard group minus one. So we basically use this formula. To use this formula and try and apply it in the case of this algebraic stack, there's one problem which is pairs formula is for the anti-canonical height function. And in our case, the discriminant is not an anti-canonical height. So anti-canonical height function is equal to is just simply the product of the ramified primes. So the product of the primes dividing the discriminant. This is what the anti-concern height function is for BG. And the discriminant does not have this form in general. So it means you can't apply Pair's formulism directly. Directly to the problem. But thankfully, there's a more general formalism due to Batu Evan Schinkle on Tamagawa numbers of polarized varieties, which we can apply, but it's just slightly more delicate. But I'll try and explain roughly how this goes. So, first thing, we need, yeah, I'm going to say yeah. So, here row of x is the rank of the Picard group of X. So we need All right, so we need first of all what analog of the Picard group should we take. So, Dardin Yesuda managed to more or less solve this part. So, we've got an analog of all the file Picard group. So, the Picard group of BG, so vector bundles over BG correspond to representations of G. The PR group is classified as line bundles, so these correspond to one-dimensional representations, and I've already got some notation. Got some notation for this. And you can't get a good theory of heights in this because it's a torsion, it's a torsion group. That's good for these heights. You need your Picard group to be like a free, finite generated abelian group. So what Dardaniusuda suggested is change the definition of the Picard group. And the philosophy is that divisors What you should think of as being the divisors on BG, which is what they call sectors in their paper, these should be equal to exactly the collection, well, should be generated by the collection of conjugacy classes of G. So you artificially create a group, which I call the orbifold pick out group, a BG, which is, well, I'll say it's this group. As well. I'll say it's this group. You more or less look at the, you take the free abelian group generated by the conjugacy classes of G, where we secretly tell ourselves that the conjugacy classes are divisors on BG. We just pretend it and take the group generated by them. And it's not exactly this, because this only generates a subgroup, a finite index, because you don't want to forget the fact that the Pig R group of BG is actually G dual. And the upshot. Actually, G dual. And the operator is you have the all-before-Picard group. A BG lies in this exact sequence. So you take the free Believing group generated by the conjugacy classes and the generic subgroup find an index, and you get the Picard group as a quotient, which you already know is G-Check. So, yeah, I'll explain this factor now, G double, how it appears. This is analog of pairs, effective cone constant. So, the effective cone of BG BG is already smooth and proper. Yeah. It's already smooth and proper. Yeah. It's a single point topologically. Yeah. Point topologically. Yeah. Yeah. It's just something I'd like to ask some of you guys about. I suspect it's probably something closely related to something like: take a faithful representation of G, take a quotient, take a resolution of singularities of that. I suspect, and compactify, I suspect that's what this should be, but I don't know. But I was hoping, yeah, maybe talk about it later. If someone would tell me this, that'd be great. Yeah, the effective cone, you just take. You just take positive multiples of the conjugacy classes of G. And so to calculate the effective cone constant, which appears in pairs conjecture, I'm not going to write that on definition. It's some integral kind of over the dual of the effective cone with a suitable measure applied and some an exponential function. But the upshot is when you have some situation like this, so the effective cone is simplicial here, just generated. Effective cone simplicial here, just generated by the conjugacy classes. And one chooses the measures so that you get the vague measure on this set when you tend to with R, which means you've missed down the correct measure by a little bit, which is the quotient corresponding index. So anyway, the conclusion is the effective cone constant in this case is the factor corresponding to the quotient. Give my one over the number of this is the number of one-dimensional characters defined over Q. Good. And I'm more or less out of time, Alexei. Okay. Well, I'll just round up. So that explains this fact of a half, how it appears in Bargover's paper. So we kind of develop the whole theory of heights on BG and from On BG, and from the theory of heights, you can also define an analog of pairs, Tamagao measure. So I've got, oh, I've got the formulas for here. That's good. Yeah. You can also define an analog of pairs Tamagau measure for idelic points on BG. And if you just run this formulism and forget about the Brauel group, then you get conjecture one, which I stated. So conjecture one is calculate all this stuff and forget about the Brow group part. You get a conjecture I stated. But the Brow group does play a role in general. Group does play a role in general, and actually, the most technical part of what we do is trying to come up with a good theory of Brau groups of algebraic stacks. Yeah, maybe I'll just finish with like demonstrating some of the things that go on. So if you want to, for example, understand the algebraic Brauel group of these M mod 2Zs, this just classifies quadratic extensions of your field. And there's a well-known formula for the algebraic part of Brauel group. And there's a well-known formula for the algebraic part of Barogen, which is H1 of the Picard group coming from the Hosschild-Sair spectral sequence. It still holds in this case. The Picard group, I already told you, is just the dual of G, so this is mu2. So you get the algebraic part of the Brauel group is Q star module squares, which is huge and somewhat surprising. If you look at quadratic extensions, there's not much going on because it's a huge Brow group, and you can actually do things with this with Brown Manning obstruction. For example, you can deduce from this. Obstruction. For example, you can deduce from this that any number field has discriminant congruent to 0, 1, 1, 0, 4. This is a property I mentioned earlier, stickleberg's theorem. So this condition is actually a brown-manning obstruction to strong approximation when it's classifying stacks. But these brow groups are too big, and we don't want infinite brow groups in here because we have to take their cardinalities. So the correct thing is not this, but it's a much smaller brow group. So you can Much smaller brow group, so you can define there's an analog of the unramified brow group, and even if your stack is smooth and proper, which we've got here, the unramified brow group is different than the brow group in general. And the philosophy is, I say, you pretend that the divisors on BG are the conjugacy classes. So you look at brow group elements, which are basically unramified along the conjugacy classes. And the conclusion is that the unramified brow group of this classified. Of this classifying stack B, Z or 2Z, it's just constant. Which is what you'd expect because for quadratic extensions, there's no obstructions going on messing up things. Okay, right. Thank you. I'll stop there. Yeah, we discovered that paper two days ago. Yeah, there is some kind of overlap in some of the formulae we have, but the key difference is he doesn't say anything about brand money, he kind of ignores the whole kind of brand manual production thing. Yes. Yeah, he also noticed the connection with this factor of a half coming from. He's written in a different way. I say we only discovered this paper two days ago, but he doesn't use the same formulism of us like pairs leading constant. He's got completely different way of doing it. Correct, yes, yeah, yeah. Showing what you show now, the random proposal that you have worked the like. Possibly. I mean, we don't need this random. We've got our own way of doing it using stacks. I mean, yeah.
