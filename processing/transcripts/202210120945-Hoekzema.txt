I'd like to welcome Renee Hook. How do you say your name, Huxima? Huxima. Huxima. Okay, sorry. I shouldn't have checked with it. Yeah. And she's going to continue talking about cut and paste invariants and relations with co-borderism. Off you go. Yeah. Thanks so much for inviting me and for allowing both me and Julia to speak. Uh, for allowing both me and Julia to speak over and over, sort of talking on related work. Um, my talk will overlap like a little bit with Julia's, but like, sort of in case people come in late, but also to sort of recap some things and also like talk about some new work that we have with Julia and Carmen. So, just to say again, like the classical story is the scissors congruence. So, uh, the scissors congruence. So the classical question is can we give into polygons can we reassemble them? Can we cut one and reassemble for the other? And this was shown to be so whenever the areas are the same. But it turned out that this generalized into a very interesting higher dimensional problem. Inside the mention three, it's not possible. So for example, tetrahedron and a cube are not equity composable, which Dane proved in 1901. 1901. In dimension four, we sort of know what the situation is. So the four-volume and a higher-dimensional Daynint variant again are the only invariants, but what happens in even higher dimensions is still open. But that's sort of the story for polytopes. And then, of course, we're interested in this different situation, which is scissor congruence for manifolds. So So, again, recapping what Julia said, we call manifolds M and M sk equivalent, or Schneider Kleben, if they're formed out of the same pieces, same two pieces, but glued over two different diffimorpholons on the boundary. And then SKN is n-dimensional manifolds up to SK equivalence, which forms an abelian group under disjoint union. Here, same as Julia, I'm talking about compact and oriented manifolds. I'm talking about compact and oriented manifolds, and in this case, closed later on with boundary, and I won't say that again. So, just a little example. Say that we look at dimension one. Well, manifolds are generated up to diffeomorphism by the circle, compact manifolds. So, if we take a circle and we cut it, then we can glue back the pieces together to form two circles. So, in particular, the generator is mapped to twice itself. So, we see that SK. mapped to twice itself. So we see that Sk1 is zero. And it turns out that this happens actually in every even in every odd dimension. So the SKN is always zero in odd dimensions. And the only two invariants, the terms of the cutting pasting is very strong. You can sort of get almost any manifold from another one, except for you can't say it's the Euler characteristic or the signature. So a different and very A different invariant of our covenant relational manifolds that we all know and love is cobordism. In particular, the pair of pants also shows that one circle is coordinated to two circles. So also like the zero, the first-dimensional coordinate group is zero. So you might ask, how are SK groups related to cobordism? So omega n is the endeavour manifold up to cobordism, which you can. The measure manifold up to combordism, which again forms an abelian group on a distance union. Talk about oriented here again. And it turns out that there's no direct map either from SK groups to combordism or the other around. But so what you can do instead is you can form the common quotient. So SK bar is end-dimensional manifold opticalism and SK equivalence. And these are called cobordism kind of paste invariance. And of course, you can ask the question: what are the kernels of the canonical rejections from SK invariance and Bordism invariance? Here's a little geometric intuition behind one way. So what if we have to escape over a manifold and we try to build a coordinate between them? So on the left, I have the two pieces glued over phi, on the right, glued them. On the right over glue them gluten over psi. I can take two cylinders, intervals times these two pieces, and I glue it on one end by phi along the boundary, and then here by psi. And then I still have a hole in my carborism. The boundary of this hole is the boundary of M1 and M2 times an times an interval glued along phi on either end. So what we have is a mapping torus here, a mapping torus for phi psi inverse. So we see that we can build this cobordism between these two SK module manifolds if and only if we can fill in this boundary that's a mapping torus. So if this mapping towards no coordinates. So we see that indeed we have these two short exact sequence where the kernel of cobordism into SK bar is exactly the mapping to R. And another easy argument shows that like the kernel for Sk to go into SK bar is generated, well, it's zero in all dimensions because SK is zero. And it's generated by spheres, because spheres have non-zero Euler characteristic in even dimensions, but obviously they're coordinated. But obviously, they're coborded to zero. So, the SK invariants relieved by the Euler characteristic in the signature, cobordism invariants in oriented case are a bit more complicated. You have the Euler characteristic mod2, which is also actually contained in the signature, which is also an invariant. And there's all the other Steve-Woodney and Monte Argon numbers. But the only common invariant actually turns out to be the signature. So, in a sense, this SK bar group SK bar group is quite simple, which I think why people sort of stopped looking at these things earlier in sort of in the 70s or so. But we're of course interested in building like higher categorifications and what we can do with them then. So we were motivated in our project for this for categorify findings and variants by two results. One is that these classical cesbanguins group of polytopes And the second thing is that if you look at cobordism invariance, of course, the cobordism groups can be viewed as the connected components of the cobordism category. And this gives a categorification of cobordism groups that's very rich, in particular the higher dimensional. Higher dimensional homotopic groups were shown to be to equal the homotopy groups of the Matts and Tillman spectrum by Galatians, Mattson-Tillmann and white. Of course, this is very rich theory we all know and love. So of course the hope is that categorifying cut and paste groups from manifolds would lead to a similarly rich theory. So our goal for the first project was to define For their first project was to find a K-theory spectrum that recovers SKN on pi-naught. So, the first problem that we ran into, which Julia also already talked about, is that if we cut polytopes, then the pieces are polytopes. But if we cut a manifold, then the pieces are manifolds with boundary. And K-theory is essentially about building things from Building things from smaller things, but those smaller things are supposed to live in the same category. And there's really a fundamental problem if they don't. So the solution and really the only way to work around this is to work in a category of manifolds with boundary. So our definition of SK invariance with boundary is, well, any measurement one falls with boundary up to SK boundary equivalence. With boundary up to SK boundary equivalence. So, what's SK boundary equivalence? So, we take a manifold with boundary, we cut in the interior, and then we glue back along everything that we cut. So we leave the original boundary unchanged, and we glue back exactly what we cut open. So, in particular, we preserve the boundary, which is unlike another definition of SK boundary that was given by Karis, Krag-Neumann and Osam. And we showed that there's a short exact sequence. So, in the sense that this is the really minimal extension of the SK groups. So, the SK boundary is really a direct sum of the boundary plus SKM. So then we apply this K-theory squares, which takes some. Which takes something that's a category with squares and outputs an infinite loop space k squares of c. So, again, a category of squares is a category together with certain distinguished squares with some conditions. And the influence loop space is built by building a bisemplicial set out of these squares and then realizing it and taking loops. And then it was shown that pi-0 of this, okay, zero is spanned by. K0 is spanned by the objects of C up to the square relation, which is whenever we have a square ABCD, we get the relation A plus D is B plus C. So this is exactly the relation that you get for a pushout, right? So if D is a pushout of B and C over A, then sort of in terms of what are the objects like versus all the, if you have spaces, like all of the points that you If you have spaces, like all of the points that you count, you have a plus d is the same as b plus c in terms of like the points. So we applied this also with this idea of pushouts to manifolds. So the category with squares manifold that we defined as objects, smooth, compact manifolds with boundary. Morphisms, as we talked about already. As we talked about already, are embeddings of coordination zero manifolds that send a boundary component either to a boundary component or to the interior as a sub-manifold with trivial normal bundle. We call these kinds of embeddings SK embeddings. And then we define, like then we take as distinguished scales push-out squares. Take as distinguished scales, push-out squares. So, this is like something being an SK embedding, I think, is definitely something you need to get an embedding, a push-out of manifolds. Of course, not all push-outs exist in manifolds, but also it's not sufficient. So, we need some extra conditions on where the boundary components go in order to get nice push-out squares here. So, this allows us to build this infinite loop space, k-squares. K squares of manifolds. And then the main theorem of her first paper is that indeed on k0, this allows us to recover the SK boundary groups. And furthermore, as Julia worked out in more detail, taking chains gives the rise of the map of spectra to K of Z, which lifts the Euler characteristic. Okay, so now, of course, we've built like We've built like this spectrum, but of course, we want to know more about it. So, one way to find out more about the spectrum is to build maps to other spectra. So, if we go back to these relations with cobordism that I were done before, it would be interesting to lift some of these maps to maps of spectra. Maps of spectra. And in follow-up work that we just posted online with Carmen Rolfey and Julia Simikina, we defined a spectrum that lifts Sk bar, so the boredom kind of paste invariance with boundary, and give a lift of the canonical quotient map from SK boundary to SK bar boundary to a map of spectra. And we did this using cubes of manifolds. So just first to go a bit. So, just first to go a bit more. Totally, sorry, I can't see the whole screen myself. So, first, we need to ask: like, what actually is SK bar boundary? So, remember that SK bar was quotient in manifolds by both SK equivalence and cobordism. But if we quoted it by cobordism for manifolds with boundary, so we allow free boundary. Allow free boundary in our cobordisms, then actually the cobordism group becomes trivial. And this is become if because like this is an easy example of how you build a cobordism between any two closed manifolds if you allow free boundary. I just take an identity cylinder on both manifolds and I like let the boundary be free. It's a rather trivial coordinate between any two closed. In between any two closed manifolds, here's that we can do the equivalent thing for manifolds with boundary as well. So that wouldn't be very interesting as a cobordism relation. So instead, what we do is we define trivial boundary cobordism. So in our setting, we call two manifolds m and a prime cobordant if we have a cobordism with boundary, but if we With boundary, but if we restrict to the boundary, then we have a trivial cobordism. So we have something that's diffeomorphic to the sitting there. Now the note by omega tilde delta trivial, the monad of manifolds with boundary up to trivial boundary cobordism. So again, I didn't mention this before, but like as soon as we start introducing boundary, which is Boundary, which is and the boundary is like preserved, then we definitely need to take a quotient D group in order to get a group because the boundary is non-invertible. So I denote by omega delta trivial the quotient D group of this monoids. So the group of trivial boundary cooperation. And then we show the following lemma. So if we include So if we include, we have a four-term exact sequence as follows. If we include closed cobordism into cobordism with trivial boundary, then we get a kernel that's given by the same Fn that we had here, which is mapping tori. So the subgroup of mapping tori hoboredism is the same as that of twisted doubles. So here's a little A little illustration for what's going on here. So, if I take a twisted double, so that's a manifold n-width boundary glued to n with the opposite or rotation along some diffeomorphism of the boundary phi. Then I can take the cylinder on that twisted double and I sort of mangle it a little bit, I pull it apart. I pull it apart, and I get the following trivial boundary combordism, which takes the trusted double distribution M and outputs just M. So in particular, we have this relation in the trivial boundary comboism monoid, which is the twist double plus m is m. This monoid is not cancellative, so we just have it sitting there inside the monoid, but of course, if we take Sitting there inside the monoid, but of course, if we take a group completion, then the twisted double goes to the kernel. So just a little side note, because this is a conference about cobordism. Maybe it's nice to say something about trivial boundary cobordism as a category. So people might know about the Ganau or fiber sequence for cobortism categories. I can think I can think of, if I think of the coborism category with three boundaries, so with any boundary, the one that has that is connected, has the coborism group being zero. Of course, I can include just closed cobortisms in that. So the m plus one dimensional coordinate category goes into the m plus one dimensional coordinate category with boundary. And then I can take a map that is. And then I can take a map that takes boundary. And then, on the boundary, if the boundary is like living on some sort of hyperplane, I just get the n-dimensional comportion category on the boundary. So this gives me a fiber sequence of classifying spaces, which is called the Genauer sequence, and this corresponds to a fiber sequence of Tom spectra. Now, Now, what we show just as a little proposition, which is an application of work by Steinman in 2020, we can sort of build a similar category with trivial boundary cobordisms. And then we can include, of course, trivial boundary comportisms included to all boundary cobordisms. And if we take boundary, what we end up with is mapping cylinders. Is mapping cylinders that are combordism extendable, which is this category TRIV. This empty set means that we're only looking at no combordant objects. And this square is a nice pullback square of topological categories. And in particular, I get a fiber sequence analogous to the Ganauer sequence that has the same fiber. So note that this gives me a sort of a categorification. gives me a sort of a categorification is this trivial boundary comparison category gives me a categorification of pi naught of it but that's the trivial boundary comparison monoids so not not the group that we are interested in right so that was a little side note about viewing this as categories but i now have the ingredients to define sk bar boundary as the group completion of n-dimensional manifolds with boundary Group completion of n-dimensional manifolds with boundary up to SK boundary and trivial boundary cobordism relation. And it turns out that I never needed the SK boundary because SK bar boundary is actually the same as the trivial boundary for Borders and group. So if I cut off the four-term exact sequence that I had before, I get a short exact sequence omega. get a short exact sequence omega n over fn to omega delta trivial to c n minus one and i get an isomorphism with the short exact sequence taking sk bar to sk bar boundary to c n minus one so this is analogous to the sequence that uh uh that we that we talked about before for sk going to sk boundary so that this this thing about um the thing that the closed thing fitting in something with boundary uh without current Without kernel, that's actually not something that happens always. It doesn't happen for Borderson, but it doesn't happen for SK bar and also for SK. So just to summarize, so we had these two short exact sequences comparing SK and omega n and SK bar. And if we take group completion, we now get an isomorphism on the lower one, and we get the same. And we get the same short exact sequence for SK boundary to SK bar boundary. Okay, so let me talk a bit about how we categorify this by using cubes of manifolds. So first, like just say again, like in the categorification of SK boundary, we use these squares of manifolds and build a spi-simplicial set. And now what we're going to do is use build cubes of manifolds. Okay, so these are cubes in the following way. So these are cubes in the following way. On the front and the back face, I have an SK, like a kind of paste square as I had before. So the vertical and the horizontal maps are SK embeddings again. But now into the page, I have trivial boundary cobordisms. And also on the phases going in, I have. I have an SK embedding of trivial boundary combordisms. Okay, so in this case, I'm not starting just from a category and selecting morphisms, but I need additional data on the faces. And in fact, like on these SK embeddings of kind of trigger boundary comportisms, I Combortisms, I then again have a cut and paste push-out square of trivial boundary comportisms. So where in the original case I had a built-bisymplicial set out of composing these squares in all possible ways, I now form a trisimplicial space out of composing the cubes. Space out of composing the cubes in three directions. So, we really need this to be a space in this situation because of details about how we work with the cobordisms and actually representing the manifolds. There's lots of details in our paper. So, in the original case, I defined k squares of manifolds as loops on the realization of this bisemplicial set, and then I got. And then I got k0, this is sk delta. Now I define k cubes of manifold bars. The cubes refers to the fact that we're dealing with cubes, the bar refers to the topology, and I define this to be loops on the fat realization of my choice initial space. And then we get the theorem that on k0, which is pi naught of this infinite loop space, I recover Sk bar boundary. I recover SK bar boundary. So, this transimplicial space has two nice sort of sub-simplicial objects, I guess. In particular, if we look up x00 dot, so that's just I restrict to sort of one thing here in the front face, and I only look in the direction going inward. Inward and then I get the nerve of a trivial boundary coordinum category. This gives me a map from loops of the classifying space of the category to my k cubes. So unfortunately, this map does not recover anything that we want really. So firstly, so on pi not of the category, we have the trivial boundary. The trivial boundary cobortian monoid. But like this, definitely drops out because we're taking loops here. But even if we don't take loops, the realization of my trisuficial space is connected. So this is a zero map. And also on pi one of these loops, so on pi naught of loops, which is pi one of the Poisson category, I get the zero map. However, I think However, I have a different syntaxial sub-object, which is I just look at sort of the front face. So x dot dot zero. This is a topologized version of my sk squares. And I can also use this topologized version of this bisimplicial, so now bisimplicial space to form k-squares, or not really in the original setup, but in the way I define it now. But in the way I define it now, namely as loops of the factorialization of this bi-centric object. And I again get that k0 of this, so pi naught of this, is escape boundary. This is like a topologized version of the spectrum that we didn't find before. And this inclusion of this simplicial object gives me a map of spectra from k squares. From k squares to k cubes of manifold bar. And on pi zero, this actually does lift the canonical surjection from sk boundary to sk bar boundary. Great. So this is sort of like now I've given a lot of details, but I haven't gone through any proofs. So I thought I might mention one proof. I might mention one proof that's sort of a nice lemma that's a bit insightful about manifolds. There's lots of details in the papers, but a proof that features in both k squares and k cubes. Namely the fact that if I take manifolds with boundary up to sk boundary equivalence, then this is the same as taking manifolds with boundary up to the square relation. So the square relation was that whenever I had a square ABC whenever I had a square ABCD, I took A plus D as B plus C. Okay, so first let me start with two SK covenant manifolds. And I'm going to show that the square relation witnesses that these are the same. So first I build a square that glues my first manifold D. my first manifold d um so d is m and m prime glued over phi so what i do i is i i have this this boundary that they're glued over and i thicken it a little bit and then uh i include this boundary uh vertically with the identity and horizontally using this this dishomorphism phi and then taking a push out i get this manifold d now here's the difference Now here's a different square that I can use to glue d prime. So instead of operating with phi here, I operate with psi. So if you look at it, I realize that I've been using red and green, so maybe people can't differentiate. But if you compare what the colors here and in here, then you see that I've swapped the two colors. And indeed, if I take this push out, I get two different manifestations. Indeed, if I take this push out, I get two different manifolds. So, what happens is that I take two squares which have the same ingredients, but they have different maps. But the square relation didn't care about maps. It just said that A plus D is B plus C. So, in particular, D is B plus C minus A, and also D prime is B plus C minus A. In other words, D is D prime. So, my square relation is telling me that. So, my square relation is telling me that these SK equivalent manifolds are identified. So, then the other round, if I take a square of manifolds, so by square here I mean with SK embedding and it's a pushout, then let me sort of in this AB and C, let me define a couple of new manifolds. So by I identify So, I identify as n manifold of one-dimension lower, that's the boundary of A going into the interior of B. So, because we're working with SK embeddings, the boundary components of A are sort of split into three types, namely ones that go into the interior of B, ones that go into the interior of C, and ones that go into the interior of both. But so N is boundary components that go into the interior. Boundary components that go into the interior of B but not the interior of C. And now I can define M to be the disjoint union of the following two manifolds, B minus the image of A and my boundary N thickened up a little bit and M prime is A and to C. Now I can glue these two manifolds together in the following way. I glue sort of vertically in this setting, and that gives me B and C. And I glue by swapping the two, and that gives me A and D. Now these two are SK equivalent. So interestingly, I only need to use the identity and the swap map. Identity and the swap map in order to realize this. And therefore, my escape equivalent here tells me that this manifold, which is B plus C, is the same as this manifold, which is A plus B. Right. So that was like a little proof. I hope you can find more details in the papers that are online. And thanks a lot for listening. Thank you. Okay, are there any questions from mostly the people in Oaxaca? Yes, there are a couple. Let me carry the microphone. Thank you very much for the talk. Thank you very much for the talk, Renee and Julia. They're very nice talk. I was wondering if there are some calculations for the SK boundary, similar like the without boundary that you say that is just zero, the integers and the two times the integers. It is possible to calculate. And I also want to ask if there are some equivariant settings. Are some equivariant settings? For example, you can take the manifold with boundaries where the action in the interior is not necessarily free and in the boundaries free. So maybe the setting could be extended. Right, so in terms of calculations, so SK boundary really is just the direct sum of SK. Direct sum of sk plus the c n minus one which keeps track of the boundary. So in that sense, like the um, there's yeah, it's known what they are. Um, in terms of like, yeah, I think it's a very interesting question to add like G-actions or something. I think not much has been done on like cutting and pasting with additional structure, but it's a very interesting question. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I have a question. In Julia's talk, we saw the categorification of the Euler characteristic that it was sending the manifold to its singular chains. How about the signature? Do we see the signature? Great. So we have done a lot of work. So, we have done a lot of work trying to categorify a signature, and we sort of ended up finishing this first, but hopefully, we will get there. The whole thing with cubes was kind of outcome of our struggles to do the thing with signature. Because cubes kind of isolate the signature, and so far it was the best that we could do. But it has something to do with like. But it has something to do with, like, we also need to find an appropriate version of L theory. So we're still working on that as a target for the signature map. But yeah, maybe before we ask questions of the Zoom audience, I can ask a question too. You had, you mentioned that for the topological category of manifolds with boundary, when you take K-theory with squares. K-theory with squares, you got the same K-naught as without the topology. Have you compared the rest of the K-theory spectrum? Do you know anything about the difference between including the topology and not for the? That's a good question. I don't think we really know at the moment. Julia, do you have more? The conjecture is that the idea. Different, but we can't prove it yet. So, what we can do is that topological one receives a map from usual coborgisms, MTSO. For discrete one, we can show this and probably some obstructions should be coming from that one. But I can't answer properly that they're different, but they should be different. I mean, a bit in the same sense of like the topological category and the. The topological coercion category and the discrete cooperative category, yes, yeah, okay, yeah, good, thank you. Okay, so are there any Zoom participant questions? No? Okay. Well, in that case, maybe we should thank both of the speakers who've given an excellent joint. An excellent joint.
