Okay, so Gala will be speaking on dynamical systems and chemical structures. Can you hear us? Yes, I can hear you. Yes, I can hear you. Thank you very much. Can you hear me now? Yes, yes. Okay, good. Well, I'd like to thank the organizers for the invitation, and this is a great opportunity for the two groups to get together. It's a long due meeting. And so, and I think that Matt has, so my job is actually to continue. Actually, to continue the conversation that Matt started in his beginning talk. And so my job is to talk about some of the possible invariants, complete invariance that are used to classify things, namely condominical structures. And I will talk a little bit about how these have been done for dynamical systems of certain kinds. For dynamical systems of certain kinds. And I once again, like many people over here, my confession is that I am not familiar with smooth dynamics and I'm very interested in learning. And this meeting has been a great venue for us to do that. And so my talk is going to be a survey rather than reporting brand new results. And so I think that it's a That it's an innovation like of math talk, and also some of the stuff I'm talking about also anticipates what Martin is going to talk about tomorrow. So let me start by telling you, like I'm trying to switch between the different modes. Different modes of my so my plan is the following. First, I will talk about the several benchmark equivalence relations that Matt has already mentioned, but Matt didn't have time to give some of the proofs. So I will give some of the proofs and also then I'll go directly to the main topic, which is about SMFI actions and also a And also, another benchmark that Matt has alluded to, which is we're all complete classes of convalescent structures. There's a rich theory over there. And then I will give several examples of classification using convalescent structures. One of them being the conjugacy of homeomorphism of the intervals and Cantor systems, and also pointed Cantor minimal systems. Minimal systems. As you can see, none of these are small systems, but they are topological dynamical systems or symbolic dynamical systems. And then I will come back and talk about the Boreau, S infinity orbit equivalence relations and provide more benchmarks. And then I talk about the subshifts and the subflows. And if time allows, I will also touch base on some of the On some of the theory of turbulence, and also this, I made up this word anti-idealisticity. Those are obstacles to classification problems being allowing countable structures as completing learners. So, this is the topic of both of my talks, like before and after the break. So, I hope to be able to cover all of these in two and a half hours. So, for most of the audience over here, I think that if you come from descriptive set theory side, and I suspect that there's very little that are new to you. But I guess the general vision for this talk is actually to bring two groups on the same page. And so, I will feel free. And so I will feel free to talk about some of the basic stuff in the discrete setup side. To begin, I want to remind people of some of the benchmarks that Matt talked about, which is equality on real numbers or canner space. Very often we use canter space rather than the real numbers. And E0, which Matt defined and I will redefine over here, which is the eventual agreement on zero. Agreement on 0, 1 sequences. Once again, cannabis space. And also, I think Matt just talked about this very briefly, what we call the E sub infinity, which known to be a universal, so-called universal or complete countable Borel equivalence relation. This is an equivalence relation that is most complex among. That is most complex among rural equivalence relations that have countable classes. So the rigorous definition is that it's defined on this Bernoulli shift on the free group with two generators. So we denote it as F2. And then this is just basically the Bernoulli shift, which generates the orbital installation. Generates the orbital insulation. And also, I want to talk about this E0 to omega, which is an infinite product of E0. As you can see, this is actually defined on infinite sequences of elements of T-and-space, and two sequences are equivalent if and only if they coordinate-wise, they are equivalent. And lastly, but not least, But not least, the equality plus equivalence relation that Matt talked about, which is also on infinite sequences of elements of Kenner space is one example. And then my definition is slightly different from Matt's, but it's equivalent, which is to say that two such sequences are equal to plus equivalent if they represent the same countable sets of elements of Tander space. Elements of Kander space. So, really, you can have multiplicity over here, but as long as they represent the same sets. So, in mass definition, you have a permutation to permute one sequence to the other. But this is equivalent. In terms of complexity, these are equivalent. So, I will talk about these five things over here. And by early work of many people, several of them. Uh, several of them are in the audience already. So, uh, silver Harrington-Kecker's Levol mentioned by Matt, and Dougherty Jackson-Kacker's is also a seminal paper which talks about hyper-finite equivalence relations and Jackson-Kecker's Lavaux, talking about the general countable brawl equivalence relations. And so, we now have a very good understanding of the relative complexity of these equivalence relations, and so. And so let me see how I can maybe write on this. Let me try it. So at the bottom, we have this equality and then E0 is actually known to be above equality. And then after that, we also have E sub infinity as well as E zero. As E0 infinite product E zero, and then we have the equality plus over here. So, so every time we go up, we have a reduction over here, and all of these reductions are known to be strict. So, this is actually the structure that we now know. And Matt wanted to actually prove the arrows. The arrows, these arrows, so equality reducing to E0 and the E0 to zero, equality plus. And then he also wanted to say that, okay, why these are, what are the methods that are used to actually show that these are not reversible errors. But we are not going to be able to do it completely. Be able to do it completely, but we will try to. Let me see. Okay. All right. Let's see. Let me see here. So I still have to somehow restart over here. First, I need to re do this mode to okay, find a way to stop this. Sorry, here we go. Okay. All right. So hopefully, I don't. So the first thing I wanted to mention over here is some proof over here that the Matt wasn't able to complete. So this is the equality reducible to E0. And in fact, I want to give a two-line proof over here, which is that imagine that you Imagine that you have fixed a bijection between the natural numbers and n squared, so pairs of natural numbers. And then you can code each real, what we call real, but really is the element of the canner space by repeating each digit infinitely many times according to how the digits are arranged by this bijection. Are arranged by this bijection over here. So each xn is being repeated in theta x infinitely many times at infinitely many places. So then if x is equal to x y, then obviously theta x is in fact equal to theta y, so they're easier equivalent. And if x is not equal to y, they differ at least at one coordinate over there, but in terms of theta x and theta y, they will differ infinitely. For infinitely. So, in other words, theta x and the theta y will not be easily equivalent. So, this is a very simple proof of this reduction. And then we can also see why E0 is actually reducible to equality plus. Because E0 is actually an equivalence relation with only countably many elements in each class. So, all we do is actually to enumerate. Do is actually to enumerate that class, each of the class, and then that'll give us a reduction to equality plus because equality plus just compare essentially two countable sets and see if they are the same. So here, once again, it's a two-line proof of three-line. So we fix a bijection again between natural numbers and all finite sequences of natural numbers. Natural numbers, not finite sequence of zeros and ones. And then what we do is try to enumerate all the E0 class elements of a particular x. So if you're given me x, then theta x, the nth element in that the nth coordinate of theta x is a real itself, is x with the first s n lens many digits replaced by. n lens many digits replaced by Sn. So this way you actually enumerate all of the elements of the X of E zero class of X. And then obviously if X and Y are E0 equivalent, then you obtain the same set, possibly a different enumeration, but the same set of real numbers, which is exactly the class. The class of E0 of X. And then what about the fact that the E zero is not borrow reducible to equality? This, of course, we want to just mention, give the indication of the proof by illustrating the methods that are used in this field over here. In this field over here, of course, is a very straightforward example of ergodicity. So you could, by ergodicity, you could use a measure, you could use also category. And here I'm choosing to use category, but using measure can also work in this context. So suppose we have a boreal reduction theta from the underlying spaces of E0 to underlying spaces of equality. E zero to underlying spaces of equality, reducing E0 to equality. Then let's consider this set, which is the, I'm going to consider Sn, which is actually the, oh, okay, which is the set of the set of x's where theta x, the nth digit of theta x is equal to zero. Of theta x is equal to zero. So if you think about it, this n digit of theta x is either zero or one. So Sn is actually half of the space, sort of, in that case. So this Sn is an easier invariant varaule set. Let me just first focus on this part. So Sn is an easier invariant varaw set because if you're easier equivalent, you're being sent to the same element. And obviously, any pre-image of Any pre-image of any set of this theta function is actually easier to variant. But it's Bora because we have a Bora reduction. And being a Bora set, it has the property of bare. And because of that, if you have a non-meager set, then this set will be commeager on a neighborhood in the neighborhood. And then you use easier invariant to argue that if you if Argue that if your set as n is co-meager in one neighborhood, then because of ergodism, because of this density of each orbit, then you can actually argue that then this set Sn, if it's co-meager in one neighborhood, then it's co-meager in the entire space. So, simply put, this Sn must be either meager or co-meager. If it's meager, then no problem. If it's non-meager, then we have argued. Non-meager, then we have argued just now that it is going to be co-meager. So, and then, like I said, this Sn or Sn complement is one of them must be co-migrant then. So we'll just let A n be that commeager set. So, A n is either S n if it's co-migr, or it's the complement of S n if Sn is meager. As n is meager, so that a n is always co-meager. Then we take the intersection of all the a n's. This will give you give us a zero, one sequence and the pullback of it, which is a Kohlmeger set because it's the intersection of countly Kohlmiger sets. But then this intersection of A and by our definition of the brawl reduction, it is a single E0 class because it's. E-0 class because it's a pullback of a single point, and therefore it must be countable, and therefore it's meager. So, these two statements are direct contradiction to each other. Okay, so this is actually the ergodicity argument that starts the whole business over here to show that certain equivalence relations are not reducible to the other. Of course, there are many, many methods, not just. Not just the measure, not just the category, but also forcing, but also other methods like other notion of bigness of sets can also be used, you can imagine. So this will give us the picture of at least the three things that are mentioned by Matt. So now I am, according to Matt, I'm done with my proofs. To Matt, I'm done with my proofs. Every talk should contain one proof, and I've done my job over here. So from now on, I can talk about things without giving proofs, but I will give a few proofs. But anyway, now let's get back to the main business over here of talking about S infinity actions. So S infinity is probably people have seen this in different contexts. This in different contexts, this is the infinite permutation. Sometimes they refer to the infinite permutation group, a infinite symmetric group. We call it S sub infinity. Some people denote it by other notation. One of them is sim n is very common. And these are nothing but the bijections between natural numbers. So when you write it this way, it can be written as a G delta subset of. Written as a G delta subset of n to the n, which is n to the n is known as the bare space, which is a polish space. So, g delta subset of the polish space is a polish space itself. And also, S infinity is the group operations on S infinity, namely the multiplications, which is composition, and also the inverse operation. These happen to be continuous with respect to this Polish topology. And so, S infinity becomes a Polish group, not just a Polish. Infinity becomes a Polish group, not just a Polish space, but also a Polish group. And therefore, we can talk, we can consider its actions, various actions. And the actions that we're going to consider is exactly these are exactly the Polish action, continuous actions of SMT on Polish spaces. So I'm going to be very strict and continuous and Polish, etc. Polish, etc. So, some common notation that are being used over here is the one of them is the orbit of an element, which we denote by this bracket x. And sometimes we specify the group by providing a subscript over there. Other times we just say s infinity dot x to indicate the same thing. So, this is the orbit, and also this gives the orbit in construction, which is Which is the main thing is that everybody knows what orbital boon structure means. It's just a notation over here that I'm emphasizing that we put this space on the top and the group on the bottom over here to indicate that if you have an action, then you use this to denote the orbital installation. And of course, is this too restrictive? Well, I think in Slave's talk, this has been mentioned that we can generalize. We can generalize the Polish spaces to standard Brawl spaces and the continuous actions to Brawl actions without actually losing any of the content over here. And in fact, what is true with the polar space and continuous action contest will also be mostly true in the standard brawl space and brawl action contest. Okay. So I'm going to, in this talk, I'm going to study on the Polish space. I'm going to stay on the Polish space and continuous action contest as much as possible. And let me first give an example of an isomorphism relation of some class of convoluted structures to be the to link them to S infinity actions. So the example I want to use is the isomorphism relation of all countably infinite directed graphs. Directed graphs, also known as digraphs. And so these are kind of graphs with arrows between some pairs of elements. And so basically, if you consider all countably infinite digraphs G, every one of these graphs has a vertex set and an edge set. And since the vertex set is always assumed to be convoluted. Is always assumed to be completely infinite without loss of generality. We are going to assume that the vertex set is always the natural numbers. Then in that case, the edge set will become a subset of natural numbers cross-natural numbers. So this is a pair of natural numbers. And this is standardizing all the countably infinite diagraphs, and we don't lose any of the isomorphism types, obviously. And so, but this has the advantage. So, but this has the advantage of having, you know, having the space, space is the very naive space of 2 to the n cross n, which is the space of all possible collections of pairs or subsets of pairs of natural numbers. But this happens to represent all of the directed graphs. So I'll say I'll use DG to denote the space. To denote the space of all of the kind of infinite graphs, which is exactly the right inside. This is a compact matrix of space and hence a Polish space. And S infinity acts on it in an obvious way, which is if everywhere you see a copy of natural numbers, S infinity acts on it. And so when you have a digraph and you have a permutation, S infinity elements, then this permutation acts. Uh, this permutation acts on this digraph by just moving the each pair like coordinate-wise. Okay, and the orbital coolness relation in this case becomes exactly the isomorphism relations. So, if you have two such digraphs, the G and the G prime, obviously they are isomorphic if and only if you have a permutation that moves. only if you have a permutation that moves one to the other. So this becomes the S infinity action, you know, modeling this. So the DG is the space of all countable infinity diagraphs, and the isomorphism relation becomes a S infinity orbit equivalence relation. Okay. But in general, I mean, this is just one example, but in general, we as logicians also talk about our As logicians also talk about arbitrary structures and that go far beyond just a graph, a possible graph or anything that has been defined or possibly has not been considered carefully. So there's this notion of logic action, which was considered first by model seers, but also in disclosure set theory considered systematically studied by Becker-Kecker. Or calculus. And so the logic action, I think this is, I would like to actually present the full logic action. So in logic, we talk about signature L and also L structures. So I'm going to give the definitions in the slide. A signature L is a collection of relation symbols and function symbols and constant symbols. Okay, there's no restriction. Okay, there's no restriction of arity, there's no restriction of the numbers of such symbols. But each relation symbol and each function symbol obviously has an arity. Is it a unary function? Is it a binary relation? Etc. Okay. And then constant symbol, of course, it doesn't have arity. But once we have a signature like this, it's just a set of symbols, then we can actually talk about the Talk about the structures in this signature. So, we call the L structure, and L structure in general is a real structure, is a tuple starting with the underlying set, and then followed by a whole bunch of interpretations of those relations and functions and the constants in this particular structure itself. So, X is a set. I put the X is a set. I put the superscript M over there to indicate that these are no longer just abstract symbols, but actually interpreted in the structure M. And so if say we have a relation symbol R of ARD AR, and then its interpretation in this structure is actually a relation in this structure. And if you have a function symbol, its interpretation in this structure. Its interpretation in the structure is attributable function, okay, and the constant as well. And so every time we have a countable signature, the collection of all countably infinite L structures can be coded in a similar way as in our examples before. So since we assume we only consider countably infinite structures, then we may as well just fix the underlying set to be The underlying set to be all of them to be just the natural numbers. In this case, then we can form the space of all L countably infinite L structures to be this fixed space, which is a huge product. Every time you have a relation symbol, you have this copy of 2 to the n to the AR, which, you know, if you think about it for a moment, it does represent the relation. The relation itself. And then, if you have a function, then you put in the space n to the n to the af, and also constants, each constant is sort of picking one element from the real from the natural numbers anyway. So model, if you actually look at this product space over here, this is just the Polish space. And S infinity acts on it by the obvious The obvious way, which is that if you have a relation, a permutation, then the permutation acting on the relation is just permuting the coordinates of the relation elements coordinate-wise. And then, if you have a function, it does that the same thing, including its image, right? So, this way, I think that basically. I think that basically we have captured all possible countable signatures and all possible L structure spaces into just a standardized kind of polar space and on which there is always a S infinity action. So this is called a logic action. And the orbital cons relation is exactly the isomorphism relation between such Between such L structures. And this is just repeating that. And in this field, I think the following theorem is worth mentioning, which is Becker-Kecker's done in the late 80s and early 90s, which is if you have a signature L that is sufficiently rich. L that is sufficiently rich. Sufficiently rich means that in this particular context, it means that the relation symbol has relation symbols of arbitrarily high arity. If this is the case, then this logic space and the logic action has a very nice property, which is that any other Borel action of S infinity on the standard Borel space X, or if you don't want to work on that context, you can just say any control. Work on that context, you can just say any continuous action of S infinity on the polar space X, it's the same thing. There is always an equivariant overall injection from theta, from this X, from this given thing, to this model. Equivariant is actually defined as the following thing, which is that if you have for all elements of the underlying space and for all group elements, you always have theta. All group elements, you always have theta of g dot x equals g dot theta x. So it's just, you know, the mod L has a copy of every other action of S infinity in there. Okay. So for that reason, we call mod L a universal S infinity action. And this is so, provided that every time L has, like I said, relation symbols of arbitrarily high. Relation symbols of arbitrarity hierarchy. Note that we actually always call functions by more or less just relations, and therefore, relations are the focus of study over here, you know, although the concrete structures that we consider sometimes have function in there. But relations is always the main thing to consider. So, but this is probably a little bit of still not. A little bit of still not applicable because we don't actually have a in our working examples, we don't have a whole lot of working examples having arbitrarily high error signatures, relation symbols in our signatures. So, but instead, we actually work with like digraphs, things like digraphs a lot, a lot of A lot of structures are, you know, for example, Bertelli diagrams is actually one kind of structures where basically we have arrows, right? We have directed edges. Anyway, so there is, however, there is a theoretic folklore, which this notion has been considered already. Notion has been considered already, just long before what we talk about over here, is already considered in model theory. This folklore says the following: if you have any countable signature, infinite or finite or arbitrary harity or fixed harity, whatever, no matter what it is, the model could be very complicated, but it can always be interpreted by directed graphs in the sense that there is a boreal map in front of. That there is a boreal map from the space model to DG. So that if you have two L structures, M and M prime, then it happens that they are isomorphic if and only if the theta m and the theta m prime, which are directed graphs, are isomorphic. So, in other words, we can assign to each L structure a directed graph to code its isomorphism type, right? So the isomorphism types are in this context preserved. So this phenomenon is actually called interpretation in model theory. Obviously, it's no longer an equivariant map. You cannot just have that property that the permutations are, you know, permutation of this structure will actually also preserve the same permutation will preserve the image. It doesn't work like that, but it But it does preserve the isomorphism type. So, this notion turns out to be an important motivation for Friedman Stanley to actually develop this so-called broad reducibility hierarchy theory later on. And so, when you put so in the early 90s, Freeman Stanley, as Matt already mentioned, Freeman Stanley. Freeman Stanley actually considered this notion of broad reducibility. And in particular, they actually studied very in a very focused way this notion of broad completeness, which is the following. If we have a class of condominium structures, we call it broad complete. It's a way to say that this class is very complicated. If it can interpret It can interpret any other brawl class of structures. So basically, any convo signature, we use this, any convo signature, it can interpret the mod L's, the L structures. When you put the background calculus and the model serire folklore together, you get that the directed graphs is a broad complete structure. A broad complete structure, a class of structure, right? So here I'm not saying anything new. I just want to state the fact that a class is more complete if and only if not just the model, but also Becker Kecker says that it actually is more complex than any S infinity action. So a class is borrowed complete if for all bored actions of S infinity on the standard broad space X. Phase X, the orbit equivalence relation can be classified by the elements of this class. So this is actually the rigorous sense of why carnival structures, some carnival structures, as long as they're all complete, some carnival structures are very powerful to be used as a complete invariance for. As a complete invariance for equivalence relations or for classification problems. So if you have an S infinity action that is the equivalence relation that you are considering, then you can always use one of these directed graphs, for example, as complete invariants for your classification problem. Then he also, in their seminal paper, also considered a whole bunch of Also, considered a whole bunch of other condo structures in different signatures. And so they show that these are brawl complete. And I am formulating it as one theorem. And also, I want to talk about more recent developments. So, anyway, Freeman Stanley showed that convoluted infinite graphs without the directions, that's okay. So, simple graphs. And also, convolution. And also countably infinite trees and also rooted trees as being used in the sense of the equal of the scorpion set theory and completely infinite linear orders. And also they noted that an old result of MAC, which predates their results, already show that. Countably infinite groups are complicated enough to be used as complete invariants for this purpose. And in fact, the macros result shows that, in fact, if you just use countless infinite nilpotent groups of class two, that's also sufficient. So in particular, if you really use nil potent groups, solvable groups, or anything like that, that's big enough class. that that's big enough class to be uh to be used um and also uh friend and stein also considered fields countable fields of characteristic either a prime or characteristic zero these are also complete um ever since their paper of course there have been a whole lot of effort to actually identify okay what are some other broad complete classes of Some other broad, complete classes of convo structures that can be used. So I want to mention a couple examples over here, and my choice obviously is very biased. I have not attempted to be exhaustive and comprehensive. And so shamelessly, I'm going to mention one of our own, my own result, which is together with Camelo. This was published in 2001, I think it's early on. Uh, early on, so we proved that the convoy infinite Boolean algebras are also broad complete. So, so even if they're Boolean algebra, that sounds like they're you know, finite Boolean algebras are very uninteresting, but infinite Boolean algebras, they can have a lot of isomorton types. And next example, I want to show that Paulini and Shella announced recently that the combat-free abelian groups turns out to be broad complete. All complete. This is very, very recent, and so I think that I want to use this example to illustrate that this question of which classes are broad complete is still an active topic, because there are other classes which are open problems whether they are actually broad complete or not. Anyway, this broad completeness. Anyway, this broad completeness is actually all of these classes being concentrating on the same complexity level in terms of broad reducibility is a strong indication that this equivalence relation should be considered a benchmark. So we have in the literature, we have a lot of different phrases, different ways to say the same thing. So sometimes Freeman Stanley's way is to say that this class is borrowed complete. This class is borrowed complete, but there are other synonyms of this. Sometimes we say that the isomorphism relation is S infinity universal, which means the same thing. You can kind of guess what it means. It's universal for all S infinity actions in the sense of interpretability or borrow reducibility. Or sometimes we say that the isomorphism relation is borrowed by countable graph isomorphism. The graph isomorphism. The graph isomorphism being picked as B class is just some kind of convention. I think you can, if you want, you can use trees and whatever, but I think people have liked the graphs a whole lot. So we are going to say all of these interchangeably, so they all mean the same thing. I want to mention one. One useful observation by Freeman Stanley, which is that any broad complete class has an isomorphism relation that is on the very top already for all S infinity actions. And in particular, they are complete analytic in the sense of what Slavics has talked about, in the sense of sets that this thing as a subset of the product space is a Is a complete analytic set. Okay, so in particular, it's not a barrel. And this is what Matt has been always emphasizing: that okay, to say that something is not borrow means you can philosophize. And one way to philosophize is to say that there's no way to utilize countable information to get to understand this. Okay. So So, I want to steal Matt's zoo map over here to indicate that we actually have talked about just this one thing over here, isomorphism convo groups. And of course, there's also the equality E0, E infinity, and equality plus, and something like E0, omega that have. Like E0 omega that have been talked about over here that concentrates on this side. But this is a morphism of kind of graphs or is actually very different because it's a complete analytic. And what about this other non-Bora? Because this red thing here is the boundary of Bora equals relations. And what are some other things in this area over here that are non-boral? I want to mention just one distinct example. I want to mention just one distinct example over here, which more properly is somewhere over here. I say this because I want to compare, keep an eye on its relationship with equality plus. Okay. Oops. Press the wrong button over here. I think I need to do this. Yes. Okay. All right, here we go. I want to talk about a non-brawl complete class, not brawl complete, okay? But nevertheless, a non-borbl complete. Nevertheless, a non-borel isomorphism relation. It is not bored-complete, but it is known to be non-boral. It's not the same. So Freeman Stanley already considered this, which is the class of all infinite abelian torsion groups. Of course, countably infinite abelian torsion groups. Of course, this abelian torsion groups have been studied a whole lot, including Including many, many people in group theory. Okay. And so, long story short, this class is not broad complete. I'm not going to give proofs, but just to mention the results. But the equality plus is not... So, the reason that it's not broad complete is the equality plus is known to not be broad reducible to this class. Okay? So, it's not. This class. Okay. So it's not above equal to plus, and therefore it's not raw complete. And but on the other hand, it is a as a subset of product space. This equivalence relation is a complete analytic set. Okay, in particular, it's not a Brawl set. So this thing here is really on the side over there. But you never know. You never know. Maybe one day you will encounter a classification problem that happens to have Belian torsion groups as complete invariants. Very possible. So I want to mention this as a benchmark as well. So once again, this is actually happening here, like, you know, it is on this. It is complete analytic, but it's not in terms of brawl reducibility, it is not very high. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now I'm going to move to sort of the next topic, which is actually to talk about some classification problems. How to classify, or what are some examples of? Or, what are some examples of classification by countable structures? And in all of these examples, I hope to convey an idea, which is that, of course, this using something as a complete invariant comes naturally. It doesn't really come from, oh, I think, you know, a group should be a complete invariant. So let me go try to find a group. It doesn't work like that because you have to study the Because you have to study the nature of your problem. And then there happens to be a group that you can actually define. So let me just take this one example over here and hopefully see if I can if I could get rid of this thing here. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. So this is the problem, conjugacy problem of all auto homeomorphisms of the unit interval. Okay. That preserves orientation, like H0 is 0 and H1 is 1. So these things look like these things look like So, obviously, if you have zero and a one, you know, h0 is zero, h1 is one. So, so it's just some kind of, oh, that won't be a homeomorphism. So, something like this is more like homeomorphism. Okay. Anyway, such a thing and And we consider the homeomorphism, these homeomorphisms acting on itself, once again, this forms of Polish group. This action on itself by conjugacy. Conjugacy means conjugacy. And then the orbital concentration is what we call the conjugacy equivalence relation. Okay, so two things are equivalent if you can conjugate one to the other by a homeomorphism of the zero, one. Uh, the zero one, okay. Um, let me get rid of here, yeah. Okay, so next, so this is a very well um result. In fact, I don't even know that people really consider it a result, but this is very well known how to classify these things by congruency. So, basically, what we do. So basically, what we do is actually we use the following kind of structure. So, in the signature over here, we have one binary relation symbol less than, which will have obvious meaning. And then we have three unary relations, S plus, S minus, S equal to. And they will, you know, in a moment, I will say what they are. And you will see that they obviously will be kind of. Coming from the nature of the problem. So, really, one binary relation symbol and three unit relation symbols. And then to each homeomorphism of 0, 1, we associate a convale structure. And the underlying space, I will say later, but I will just first specify what the s plus s minus s equal to are. So s plus is the set of all open intervals a b. intervals AB, where this is the maximal interval where h of x is greater than x. So h x turns out to be higher than x itself, but h a is equal to a and h b is equal to b. So this is the maximal interval that has that hx greater than x in between property. And then s minus is the set of all open intervals where hx sends x to something smaller. To something smaller. Okay. And similarly, and then if we have intervals, stretches of points where hx is equal to x, then I take that whole interval, which is going to be a closed interval, and with the interior, then I'll just take its interior. It's a maximal open interval where hs is equal to x. Okay, so when you put all these things, s plus s minus s equal to, then of course. as equal to then of course you get uh you get an open set um uh its complement is a whole bunch of points um but but our structure consists of exactly these intervals okay its element are these intervals and and these intervals obviously have a natural uh order some of them small you know one interval is smaller than the other if the whole every point in the interval is smaller than every The interval is smaller than every point in the other interval, etc. So turns out that it's such a structure, which is a linear order. This is a linear order with three labels, plus, minus, and equal to. Okay, we can call this a colored linear order or label linear order or whatever. This is the kind of the natural structure that are used to classify our homeomorphisms. Our homeomorphisms because I think once again, I wanted to draw this picture, but so because if you actually look at this line, y equal to x line here, then sometimes my homeomorphism is higher than the points, and sometimes it's lower than the points, and other times it actually follows. It actually follows this diagonal line, et cetera. Okay. So the observation is nothing but very simply that if you have two such things, let's say that you have something that is higher, and then you have another thing that is always higher, then you can actually match them up. Okay. So these two things are homeomorphic, are conjugates. Or conjugate because of, you know, you can actually do a back and forth construction counter style. So once you do that, so if you have H1 and H2, which are conjugate to each other, obviously they are going to get isomorphic structures over here because conjugacy is not going to change the structure of these fixed points. You know, fixed points. Okay. Fixed points will still be fixed points, and also stretches of fixed points will also be stretches of fixed points. But on the other hand, if you actually consider the yeah, so get back here. So if you actually have, on the other hand, the structures being the same, then you can match them up and get that the homomorphisms themselves are. The homeomorphisms themselves are conjugate to each other. So, this is actually an example where, but look, I mentioned the two directions, but this is only verifying that you can use these countable structures to classify these homeomorphisms up to conjugacy, right? It doesn't say the other direction. Other direction. The other direction really should be that we can associate to some kind of countable structure known to be broad complete. In this case, I'm going to use linear orderings of natural numbers. We can associate to each linear ordering of a natural number to a homomorphism of 0, 1 so that when the linear orders are isomorphic, then the homeomorphisms are isomorphic. Okay, so how do we do this? Well, this is. Well, this can be done by a can, once again, a candor set construction type construction. I guess very simply, I'm in danger of boring everybody, but I think that here's the thing. So if you have some kind of linear order, this is a carnival linear order over here. It's not necessarily dense linear order without endpoints, but even if it is a dense linear order without endpoints, Even if it is a dense linear order without endpoints, we can actually construct the counter one-third set by removing the one-third of each of the removed remaining parts, et cetera, to create a dense linear order without endpoints. But if you are not densely in a order without endpoints, then you don't need so many intervals. You can actually combine certain intervals up and get simpler ones. So once you have identified these intervals, So, once you have identified these intervals, you can actually, according to your linear order, you can actually consider putting plus signs for all of these. You know, let's say put plus signs. We don't need minus signs and equal signs. Then in that case, we can construct a homeomorphism, which turns out to be higher than the original point. Original point, you know, move every point to the right, you know, in this whole interval, etc. Okay, so you do this, then this will give you the reduction. Okay, all right. Okay, now this, what I have done proved the so-called folklore theorem that the conjugacy equivalence relation of HOM plus. The Kubernetes relation of HOM plus 0, 1 is for all bi-reducible because I indicate two reductions with the convo graph isomorphism. In fact, I use the linear orders in both ways. And in fact, one also needs, rigorously speaking, one also needs to verify that those colored mean orders are. So, Greg Horse actually presented this entire proof in his book, but he is very modest that he said that this is a folklore. So anyway. Now, I consider that a baby example. And now, maybe to talk about a more real example. I want to talk about the canter systems. Once again, unfortunately, this is not smooth dynamics, but I hope it is properly dynamical systems anyway. So let's consider a Cantor set, which is a zero-dimensional compact matrix space without isolated points. And then T is an order homeomorphism of X. Okay. So a Cantor, what by a Kendrick system what we mean is just this pair. The intention, of course, is to let this T iterate. Topological conjugacy relation is defined similarly as before, which is X T and Ys are topologically conjugate. If you have a conjugate map, which is a homeomorphism from X to Y, gamma, that conjugate that sends T to S. Okay. Okay. And so, topological conjugacy relation for all Cantor sets, because every Cantor system builds on the Cantor set. And there's only one Cantor set. We all know that homeomorphically, it's 2 to the n is a Kanor set. And so that's why there's only essentially one object over here, which is that homeomorphism of the K-ner set. So if we actually collect all the homeomorphisms of the Knox set, All the homeomorphisms of the canner set into one space, this becomes once again a Polish group. So it acts on itself by conjugacy, same story. Orbital equivalence relation, which I denote by this double tilde, is exactly the topological conjugacy relation between Kenner systems. Okay, so in this way, we make, we kind of translate this problem into a Of translate this problem into a particular equivalence relation on the polished space. And so, how do we classify this? I promised that I will not give any proofs of this sort. So, I'll just cite some theorems over here. So, once again, I want to mention that Camelo and I proved this some time ago, the topological controversy relation between Topological contributing relation between Kenner systems is broad biorereducible with carnival graph isomorphism. So, so this is once again an example of using carnival structures to classify animal systems. And so, how do we prove this? I think I want to mention the, I don't want to talk about the proof, but I want to mention the methods being used over here. So, there are two directions once again, that one of them Once again, that one of them is actually to say that you have to reduce the topological conjugacy relation to countable graphites to some kind of countable structures to say that, oh, it's sufficient to use some countable structures as completing variants. So this is one direction. And the other direction is to say that, okay, you know, it is as complicated as possible. So you have to do the backward reduction, which is. The backward reduction, which is to reduce whatever countile structure, graph, whatever, to this topological context relation. Okay. And here, the forward direction to show that countable structures are sufficient, we use a new method, which is, you know, in this talk, new method, which is actually just to stare at Which is actually just to stare at this acting group over here and say that, oh, this group is very special. And in fact, what we are using is that this group here is a non-Archimedean Polish group, meaning that it emits a neighborhood base of the identity consisting of Poland subgroups. This is actually very easy to verify. So it's actually very easy to actually directly construct. Construct Dutch Kloppen subgroups as a neighbor base of the identity for this homomorphism subgroup of 2 to the n. And then I want to mention this backward characteristics result, which is to say that if you have a Polish group, then in fact several things are equivalent. One of them is non-artimedian, and the other one is G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of S infinity. To a close-up group of S infinity. And then there's a third way to say the same thing, which is to say that if G is a compatible life invariant, ultrametric. So there are several different ways to actually say that this G is closely related to S infinity. It can be embedded as a topological group, as a closed subgroup of S infinity. Okay? And once we have that, we have some more abstract theorems. And this is one of the things that also. And this is one of the things that also Matt alluded to. He suspected that one of us, me and Merchant, is going to talk about it. And I think that we're going to both talk about it. So this is the Mackie-Yorse result, which says that if you have two polished groups, one of them being the closed subgroup of another, H is the larger group, G is a closed subgroup. If you have a G action, continuous action of G on a Polish space X. On Polish space X. You can generalize this to Borel, and that's the Mackie result. But if you say, I want a continuous action in Polish space, that's the Eurost result. And then if you have this action for a smaller group, then you can con action of a bigger, the bigger group that has a very nice property, which is that you can expand this action to an action of the bigger. To an action of the bigger group. So nice things happen. First is that this bigger action happens on a bigger space. With respect to the smaller group, the bigger action and the smaller action coincide. And then the bigger action actually extended the smaller action in a very canonical way, which said every Way, which is that every orbit of the bigger action contains exactly one orbit of the smaller action. So it's actually sort of an orbit-by-orbit extension of the action over here. This obviously will imply that as a corollary, it will say that the orbits of the smaller action is coded by the orbits of the bigger action. Rection. It's just obvious from this theorem. Okay. In other words, what we're getting from this theorem is to say that if you have a smaller group, then its action is less complex than the bigger group can have. So in other words, in our context over here, the home 2 to the n group is a close subgroup of S infinity, and therefore any action of it can be extended. Any action of it can be extended to an S infinity action. But then an S infinity action can be interpreted or broad reducible to graph isomorphism. So when you put all of these together, you get that the topological controversy between Kennedy's systems is broad reducible to kind of graph isomorphism. You're just laying these dots together. By essentially doing nothing but to actually look at this group and say, oh, this group is kind of special. special okay and um um what about a backward direction the backward direction is um really using uh another result that we proved in the same paper which is to say that the homeomorphism relation between zero-dimensional compact metrizable spaces is borall bioreducible with convo graph isomorphism it is a mouthful to say this but if you look at the zero-dimensional compact matrizable spaces and look at the homomorphism Triatole spaces and look at the homeomorphism relation. All of this is actually by its own duality exactly corresponding to the Kanbal-Boolean algebras as well as their isomorphism relation. Okay, so the result that I mentioned in the several slides ago that the Carnival Boolean algebras is actually broad-complete class gives this proof, this theorem. Okay. And then, and then we And then, and then we reduce the homomorphism relation between zero-dimensional compact matrix spaces to topological conjugacy between candlestick systems. So I promise this will be the last proof I will talk about. So the idea of this proof is the following. So suppose we have the cater set over. I'm going to just draw a picture. Going to draw just draw a picture. So, suppose this is the Canner set over here, and suppose I have a zero-dimensional compact motorizable space, okay, and some kind of X. The first thing is that I want to embed X into 2 to the N. Obviously, we can do that because we actually only care about homeomorphism. So, we don't really care about the metric. We care about just representing the set as a. Just representing the set as a closed subset of 2 to the n. And so I'm going to embed x into 2 to the n as a nowhere than set. Obviously closed, but closed sunset. Okay. And then for each, from this X, what I'm obligated to do is actually I. I'm obligated to do is actually I need to create a remember I need to create a what I'm reducing to is the topological conjugacy relation of the Cantor system so I need to create a a homeomorphism so what I call I'll call it T sub X okay so it's actually a homeomorphism of the Kinner space that I need to create in order to to to be Order to be a reduction. Okay. So what I'm going to do is this. So since X sits in here as a lower dense subset, closed subset, then it is actually the infinite branches of a tree. Okay, exactly the infinite branches of a tree. And since it's nowhere dense, what we have. Dense, what we have is that, I think I want to use a slightly different color, is that there are actually these unused neighborhoods everywhere. We have a lot of neighborhoods. Everywhere you look at it, there are some neighborhoods that are unused, you know, by this. It's outside the tree. By unused, I mean that it's outside the tree of. Is outside the tree of this corresponding to this x over here. So then what I'm going to do is a very simple thing. My t x as a transformation is to say that let's keep points in x fixed. So I'm not going to change them. And hopefully, what I'm going to end up with is actually that the that the set X over here as a subset of 2 to the N is exactly the fixed points of the set of fixed points of P sub X. So this way we will have at least recovered the information of X by this homomorphism T homomorphism T. So then in Tx, what I'm going to do is that every time I get What I'm going to do is that every time I get outside of the tree T, I'm going to see a node that are being split into two because I'm in the candle tree, right? So then I'm going to just swap these two nodes. What I mean is that I'm going to swap this entire sub-tree over here by swapping it, swapping things on this level over here. Okay, so this way, it's a very simple. This way, it's a very simple construction. I almost cheating. Sounds like cheating. So I claim that this is already a reduction because if you have an X and if you have a Y, the two X and so the set X is exactly the fixed points of TX and the Y is exactly the fixed point of Ty. And in fact, the constructions I have has the property that all of these T axes have order two. T-axis have order two. So their inverse is themselves. And then their fixed point set is exactly x. Okay. And then also making use of the nowhere dense property, you can actually show that this is a proper reduction. Okay. If you have conjugacy of the decander system, you also get. Of the two candor system, you also get x and a y has to be homeomorphic. If you have x and a y homeomorphic, you have that the resulting canner systems are conjugate to each other. I just want to use this example to say that, look, this is actually sort of cheating because I think it's actually very uninteresting to maybe people in dynamical systems because this has none of the good properties that people want these systems. Properties that people want these systems to be to have. For example, minimality, right? You know, in dynamical systems, we care about topological dynamics, for example. We care about minimality. And if you're not minimal, well, then you keep working on it. Okay. So, but anyway, that is an example, at least. I hope I made my point. Least, I hope I made my point that that is an example that we can use countable structures to be complete invariants for topological conjugates problems, things like that for dynamical systems. Okay, and there are examples where they happen to be the right ones. Okay, in the remaining In the remaining 15 minutes, I guess, I'm going to talk about this next example, which is the pointed candid minimal systems. So, this time, I hope I'm talking about some real thing, which is minimal. Okay, but on the other hand, this is still, these systems still have a distinguished point. So, these are kind of minimal systems where X is a kind of set, T is a minimal auto homomorphism. Minimal auto homeomorphism, and then we have a distinguished point. Okay, so would mean the obvious thing, which is that you conjugate one system to the other, but also you send that point by the same, by this conjugate map to the other distinguished point. Okay. And so kind of minimal systems, obviously, without the point, can a minimal system have been? Tennominamal systems have been the objects of numerous studies since the 1980s. So, there are lots of very deep results coming from this area. And so, but at the moment, as far as I can see, the following problem you open, which is the topological congregation relation. You know, if you look at all topological condominium systems and look at the topological congregation relation of them, is this a problem? Of them. Is this a Borel equivalence relation? You know, just we're asking the question in the matte style, which is, is this Borel? You know, let's first ask this question. I don't think this has been answered. So in a moment, I will talk about some results, but you will see that these just basically unfortunately is short of answering this question. Of answering this question, okay, all right. Uh, but there are some other very, uh, very great accomplishments in this area. I want to mention a couple examples of Jordano Panan school, obviously, is the kind of the Bible of this area or the seminal paper, you know, that obtained a lot of the really breakthrough results. Two of them. Results. Two of them are this. So, one of them is: if you have two counter-minimal systems, if you give up considering topological conjugacy, but consider a different notion, which is called the topological orbit equivalence, right? Two counter-minimal systems are topologically orbit equivalent if and only if they have isomorphic unital dimension groups. I'm not going to define any of these notions. I'm not going to define orbit equivalence. I'm not going to define unital dimensions. I'm not going to define unital dimension groups, but I just want to philosophize on this and say that basically you see here is a problem, classification problem, and it's considered successfully solved or at least significant progress when you are able to do this, which is basically we use some kind of convo structures. You know, dimension groups are not just the groups, but also with other structures on it. Yes. On it, yes, but these are convalescent structures to be used as complete invariants for these objects. Okay, and Giordano Pan and Skull also proved the other result that comes close to solving this problem about the topological conjugacy, which is they considered this flip conjugacy. Okay, obviously, okay, why they consider this? Because it's a long story, one thing led to another, because they actually thing led to another because they actually considered cross products the c star algebra and uh and then in that cross product you cannot distinguish between flip and and and the system itself so so that's why you know the flip conjugacy happen to be to be correspondent to uh this cross-product consideration so two condominium systems are flip conjugate meaning that it is t and as are either T and S are either conjugate to each other or one of them is conjugate to the inverse of the other. And then, if and only if they have this isomorphic, once again, topological full groups is also something that they considered and also introduced, I think, by the same group. But these topological groups are also carnival groups. And when we talk about isomorphism, even if they are called topological full groups, they are carnival groups as abstract groups. Of groups as abstract groups, okay. When we talk about isomorphism, it's it is really just honestly isomorphisms of groups, okay. Um, kind of groups, it's not topological, okay. Um, so these are the two examples where very, very significant results are obtained, but they are of the format that you can classify things, you can classify notions by assigning. By assigning appropriate convo structures, of course, with information wrapped in them. I also want to mention this. This is a well-known thing of obviously in that field over there. If you consider pointed tender mental systems, the usual way of studying them is actually to do this. You start with the pointed counter-minimal system. The pointed cannabis minimal system XTX with the distinguished point, then you associate by studying the Roping Coctani tower partitions, you actually associate what's called an ordered Bertelli diagram. And these are, also, I'm not going to say what they are, but suffice to know that there are countless structures. So these order vortex. So, these ordered vortex diagrams happen to be simple if the structures are actually minimal. I mean, the system is minimal. So, from kind of minimal pointed kind of minimal systems, we can construct the simple order Bertali diagrams. Okay. And then if you have a diagram, a simple ordered Bertali diagram VE with this order, then there's something called a version. Then there's something called a Vershik map, which is also a clonical construction, first considered by Vershik and then improved by Pannan and other people. Then you consider a Vershik map. That Vershik map gives this system Y, which happens to be a counter set, as is the Vershik map. And the Y is this so-called max or min, whatever, which I. min uh whatever whichever it is the uh uh the distinguished point it happens to be a pointed counter minimal system and what you obtained is actually topologically conjugate to the original system so this is actually the um the well-known result in topological dynamics and uh so so the the the idea over here is to assign Assign some kind of carnival structure to our system, and then these structures, because of this duality, these structures have completely captured the information of the pointed system. But you can see that all these results, like mentioned on this slide and the previous slide, they are actually of the sort to say that, oh, The sort to say that, oh, yeah, I mean, these things can be classified by convoluted structures. Okay. But they don't yet answer the question exactly where they are. Are they borrowed complete? Are they borrowed by reducible with a counter-graph isomorphism? These theorems don't answer that. So that's why this is unfinished business. This is unfinished business. However, several years ago, a student of Simon Thomas, Kaya, from Rothko University at the time, so he actually he's a discrete student. So he came in and said, let me just find the exact complexity in terms of brawl reducibility. And so he was successful in doing that. He was successful in doing that. So, he basically proved that the topological conjugacy for pointed counter-minimal systems is for all bi-reducible. Once we say bioreducible, we mean that it is actually its complexity is sort of pinned down, right? You know, it's bioreducible with equality plus. So, in particular, the equality plus is actually a Borea equivalence relation. So, if you if it really If you really add a point to the kind of minimal systems, Chayas theorem says that it is a boreal equivalence ratio. So now the big question is: if you take away the point, what happens? Is it still Bora or is it Brawl complete? We don't know yet. So let me just say what Kyle, I mean, his construction is almost too naive from the point of view of technical systems again. So what he can. Um, so what he considered was: if you have a cloppin subset of this canner set and any point in the canner set A, this is everybody knows this in dynamics. We just collect the information about the return times. Okay. So the return times of A to U is all those times in Z, including the future, now, and present, and the past. So that the T. Uh, so that the tn of a is actually in u. Okay, so this is the return time to the set, okay. And uh, uh, obviously, this is a subset of the of the integers and therefore essentially a real number, essentially an element of the canner space or just a set of a set of integers, a set of natural numbers, etc. Okay, so there's a set of integers and uh then. Of integers, and then we collect all of these into one collection, which is you take all of these clopen sets of the canner set. How many are there? Well, there are only many Kloppen sets in the Kenner set. And then take all of these return times set. Okay. Oh, it should be A here rather than X, but R sub X A. I changed my mind to use A instead of X because. To use A instead of X because the capital X and the small X are very similar in this. So, anyway, RxA is, you just really just collect all of the return times together for all of the clopping sets. And then what Kaya was able to verify was just that if you have two pointed canner minimal systems, X, T, A, Y, S, B. They are topologically conjugated if and only if just these two collections are the same, are exactly the same. Okay, of course, they will be presented in different orders, but RxA and Ryb will be the same. Sets of sets of iters, okay, in the case of topological conjugacy. So this is actually the more important direction. More important direction, which basically says that this topological contradicty relation that we considered is broad reducible to equality plus. And then, of course, he has to prove the backward direction reducibility, which is to reduce equality plus back to these pointed cannabinoid systems, which I think that if you compare these two results, that one is the backward reductionism. One is the backward reduction is more technically challenging, but it's less significant because the more significant direction is to say that this is overall equal to direction. So I'm going to just break from here, from my first half talk over here, but I want to use two slides to point out some further readings. These are Freeman Stanley, Becker Kegris, Greg Horse. Greg Horse's book, which, by the way, not only for the reason of that simple example, but also for a lot of good stuff over there, our paper on the Boolean algebras, and also Kerman-Panden Skull, Giordano-Panden Skull, and Kaya's paper that talk about these Kenner minimal systems and Kenner systems, and also pointed Kenner systems. So, so this is the end of my first talk. Thank you. Any questions? Do you know the complexity of the controversy of pointed cantor systems? The complexity of the Complexity of the pointed counter systems. I believe it is still brawl complete. But I honestly, I've never really sit down and just work it out. But if I have to guess, then I would say it's already broad complete, yes. I mean, once again, this is, I guess, 99% a guess. A guess, yeah, it's not really a theorem stated anymore. So, so I think you asked a very important question over here, because if you ask me about this canter minimal system, my guess is that it is also a boreal equalizer. It's, you know, because the very strong indication is the pointed system being bored. Once again, I have no, there's no abstract theorem that links the pointed problem and the non-pointed problem. Any questions from the Zoom? Okay, thank you picture in five minutes at 3:35. We meet on the choir. We meet on the choir.
