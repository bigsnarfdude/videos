And as my title suggests, today I want to talk about wind-wing classic turbulence with quantum skeletons and intertwined vertex tubes. In this work, we try to bridge quantum turbulence and coherent structures of classic turbulence. So, okay, let's get started. Turbulence is the most complex and chaotic system in nature. So, searching for the universal structures in a real turbulent flow is like looking for a needle in a haystack. And the first question is: How can we find the structure of turbulence? As Mofat and the Kuchiman said, the vertices. I said the vertices are the sinews and the muscles of the fluid motion and turbulence. And in perverse works, we have found that the very intense vertices always entangled with each other like warmth. So here we set out to develop a both approach to construct turbine fields composed of intertwined vertex tubes. Vertex tubes or sheets like building blocks. By comparing synthetic and real turbulence, we can know the effect of different positive structures of turbulence. And based on a novel numerical measure, in recent years, we have constructed different vertex tubes and links. And these These surfaces are all vertex surfaces, and they are visualized by the vertex surface field, which was introduced by Professor Yang yesterday. And during my PhD studies, I have been working on these vertex tubes and links under the supervision of Professor Young and in collaboration. Of Professor Yang and in collaboration with Professor Faisali Hosang and Jie Yao. And we used these vertex tubes and links to study vertex dynamics, such as vertex reconnection, merging, transition, and bursting. And all of this work have been have been published in JFN. But in this previous work, we just used In previous work, we just used simple parametric equations as vertex center lines. And in current work, this unpublished work, we try to extend this method to arbitrary tangled center lines of vertex tubes or sheets or some other structures so that we can handle the turret flow. And we know vertices are not. Are not distributed randomly, but coherently. So we think, sorry. So we think quantitance may be a natural candidate. It's a Zoom problem. Okay. It's a is a nature, maybe a clinoturbance is a Maybe cranoturburans is a nature candidate for a skeleton of classic turbulence. And cranoturburance is a tangle of vertex filaments, and it has been found to have many statistical and splicing connections with classic turbulence. And we consider a superfluid vertex tango without the normal fluid at MK temperature. This equation here is by our law in vertex dynamics, and it is also a kind of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in quantum physics. And for superfluid helium 4, the vertex core radius, we can see it is very small, so it's different with the classic. With the classical turbulence. And the simulation was performed in a cube with periodic boundary conditions. And the initial condition consists of about 50 vertices at random position and orientations. And just wait. Okay. There is a there is a here is a video and okay, forget that. We simulate the quantum turbulence of superfluid helium and we measure the length. And we measure the length of vertex filaments, and we find that it gradually saturates after a rapid transition. And we find the vertex tangle become isotropic and the homogeneous losing the memory of the initial configurations. And the frequency spectrum of the fluctuation of vertical line. Fluctuation of vertical line density for the five-third scalings, which is the observation in many different physical experiments. And here I want to talk about some details of our numerical method. And I know it's very boring, but very important and necessary. And in VFM, In VFN vertex filament method, vertex filaments are determined by sequences of disrect control points. And we need to convert these control points of spiral curves into multiple curve equations with explicit mathematical expressions. So, here for a single sequence, we introduce and calculate a discrete argland. Discrete egg length parameter and total discrete length. So we can obtain the normalized egg length parameter. And we use cubic spline parametric equations to smoothly connect the control points piecewise. And in each segment, we solve the linear simultaneous equations, and finally, we can. And finally, we can determine for vector coefficients of each parametric equation. And we just introduced the vertex center lines. So we need to specify the three-dimensional verticity field. And for a single skeleton line C, we Line C, we introduced the curved cylindrical coordinate system S rho theta based on the Freenet from TMB in tubular region. And this picture is a segment of the tubular region of omega C showing the coordinate system. And the center line is here. And we constructed the vorticity field in this. Field in this blue turbulent region and the frame TMB satisfies the Freed threat formulas. And based on these coordinates, and we can specify the vertices field as this form. And we develop a general method to construct the vertices of vertex tubes with arbitrary central topology. Central topology, differential twist, and variable thickness. Firstly, for vertex tube, we see a Gaussian curve function like this picture here. And for sheet-like vertices, we introduce a two-dimensional normal curve function, like this picture. And finally, to wave MV vertices together, we add up multiple vertices fields together. And we just introduce a new coordinate system, but we need to do some simulations on Cartesian grids. So the key is to map from the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. And for a given parametric curve C, we divide the C into we did divided C into N C segments by NC dividing points here. And so the spacing precise proximity of curve C can be divided into N C subdomains. And for a given X, we first use the above equation to determine the subdomains omega i here and the subscripts of all the The subscripts of all the omega i containing x are determined by a seed izeta. This izeta is very important because for each i in izeta, by linear interpolation, we can determine all curve parameters. And then we can approximate the voltage diffuse as these forms and for. These forms and for vertex tools and vertex sheets with compute and given variable variables. This algorithm is more accurate and efficient than the simple traversal of just of all the dividing points of curves for seeking minimum distance through numerical experiments. And the final step is boundary processing. So we need to make sure verticity field satisfies many different boundary conditions such as obvious here periodical conditions. And we find that there are two types of boundary problems that need to be handled separately. Be handed separately as in type one sign line cross the boundary, cross the boundary. And so we need to set ghost points for center lines. And in type two, only the vertices cross the boundary because of the core size. In this situation, center lines do not cross the boundary. So we have to consider the effect of the other 26 periodic. Of the other 26 periodical boxes around the constructed domain. So it will lead to demand for more computer resources. And here is the construction process. Firstly, we use vertex filament method to simulate quantum turbulence. And we reconstructed the control points on filaments into cubic lines. And then we And then we constructed three-dimensional vector fields based on these vertex center lines. And finally, boundary processing was performed to make sure the vector field satisfy the periodic conditions. Okay, finally, let's see some interesting results. The figure on the right is The figure on the right is the constructed turbulent fields, the turbulent field composed of vertex tubes with variable core size, and we call it woven turbulence. And the PDFs of verticity velocity components have the same Gaussian distribution. So the flow is homogeneous and isotropic. And we need to estimate the flow statistics from the isotropic field. We use signal structure function theory K412 to fit a mean dissipation rate here. And according to statistical theory of HIT, we can continue to obtain other statistics such as mean entropy. mean atrophy, viscosity, tilo minus scales, and Reynolds number and they are listed below. And the most important thing is the tie-low Reynolds number of the constructed vertices field is about 161. And as a And all of the key land skills are listed in this table. And we can see the com growth scale here. And the core size and the title minus micro scales are all from classical vertices. And the average distance between vertices in integral length skills and Integral length scales and box size are all from quantum skeletons. So we find that quantum skeletons encode large scale information and the introduced classical verses expand the scale range to the chromorph scale. So they make warm turbulence precise, reach multi-scale information and become more classical. And to explore the energy cascade, we calculated the energy spectrum and the velocity structure functions. The figure on the right is the energy spectrum, and the orange lines are from quantum turbulence, and the purple lines are from warm turbulence. So we find the Turbulence. So we find the warm turbulence is consistent with DNS result of classic turbulence. And warm turbulence has five scaling at inertial sub-range and a Bernie effect between inertia and dissipation range. And this picture on the right structure functions, and we find water turbulence also has. Warm turbulence also has a true third scaling of second structure function and the negative skinness of third structure function. And the task is there really allows us to understand why warm turbulence become so classical. You know, in quantitance, dissipation is carried by the phonon radiation. The fondant radiation. But in warbling turbulence, it transformed Quantum Kelvin wave cascade into a classical Richardson cascade by replacing the scalars here below the vertex filaments spacing with viscous scales. So the energy can be dissipated by the can dissipated can be dissipated by the viscosity at the column of At the commercial scale. And this kind of retestance cascade is spotted by the spectral kinetic energy flux and the transfer. The energy flux represents the net transfer of energy from all areas of wave number less than k and those of vertex number greater than k. And energy transfer response. And energy transfer represents the removal of energy from the large scales and the deposition of energy on the small scales. And so we find that kinetic energy cascades from the large scale to the small scale and maintenance balance within the inertia sub-range. And let's turn our attention to And let's turn our attention to the extreme events and the intermittency. And in isotropic turbulence, the statistical mean of dissipation and entropy is the same, but their local structure distribution differs. And atrophy and dissipation are two common measures of the strength of velocity gradients. And we can see this picture on the right: the dissipation of very intense gradients is highly intermittent, just like real turbulence. And the picture on the right, we can see the dissipation structures partly enveloped the structures of antrophy. And our model framework provides a good explanation for the dismatch between Match between atrophy and the dissipation structures. That is vertex stretching and compressing. And we can see the right picture. These green surfaces are all vertex surfaces and the red ones are dissipation isosurfaces. The blue ones are antrophy isosurfaces. And dissipation and atrophy surfaces are co-located. Surfaces are co-located in vertex tube with uniform core size, but variable core size makes the dissipation more concentrated at the position where the vertex is stretched. And extreme events can be classified through the second and the third invariance Q and R of the velocity gradient tensor, and they are dominated by version. And they are dominated by vertex stretching and processing. Unlike the classical teardrop shape, the joint PDF of R and Q looks like a butterfly in the right picture. And it lacks the transition of the fine flow structure between the upper part, that is vertex behaviors, and the lower part, that is. Part that is what is free strain. And we think it is mainly because of our vertex 2 model. This model confines the verticity to a limited region, but in real turbulence, the verticity can spread throughout the entire space. And we And we explored the dynamical warping turbines too. And we used the warping turbulence as the inertial field of the DNS of classical turbulence. And we find the warm turbulence quickly transitions into real decay, real decay HIT and the mean decay. HIT and the mean dissipation rate and the total kinetic energy have no peak and the shape of energy spectrum remain unchanged. So these results indicate that our warm turbulence is very similar with the classic turbulence, real classic turbulence. And when the vertex tube just touches each other, touch Just touch each other before the vertex reconnection. And the shape of alkyl rapidly turns into teardrop shape, which indicates that the skinniness of strength in teardrop is mainly from small scale flow structures. And the differences in vertex structure between Between these results are only stress caused by vertex reconnections. So, I think it would be valuable to study these vertex reconnections in the future. And the way of waving classic turbulence can also develop many different functionalities. Function abilities. By precisely controlling vertex elements, we can customize the turbulent fields. And firstly, we can control the Reynolds number. And we find that core size controls the length of inertial sub-range in the right picture, and which leads to a minus 310 scaling of the Rhinos normals. And secondly, we can also customize. We can also customize HC and neutrality. Internal twist is a key topological component of helicity. And so we constructed a turbulent flow with helical vertical lines. And in the right picture, we can see these vertex lines are highly corded on the vertex surfaces. The vertex surfaces, and the right picture is helical wave decompositions. And we find that the right-handed thrust wave reduces the left-handed part of the helicity as a given wave number. So it leads to right-handed traffic. And changing the element shape is a more direct way to test different positive structures of classic turbulence. Of classic turbulence. And so, for example, we present a synthetic turbine field with just vertex sheets. We know vertex sheets are the main structures of low verticity region in turbulence. And the cascade of this field follows the steeper seven-third scaling and the And the spore shape of RQ is more failed out than turbulence woven by tubes. I think it is because of vertex sheet can expand, can span a larger range of space than vertex tubes. And here is a summary. Summary: Our both our approach of waving turbulence provides a test bed for analysing and examining turbulent coherent structures. And this framework uses freely adjustable fine structures as building blocks. We use quantum vertex tangles as skeletons to wave classic turbulent states with intertwined vertex tubes. And we also uncovered the novel discoveries. Neural discoveries and developed new function abilities. The combination of cranton skeletons and tunable call size makes the warm turbulence satisfy many key flow laws. And by controlling vertex elements, we can customize turbulence and precisely adjust physical quantities. So let's end my talk.
