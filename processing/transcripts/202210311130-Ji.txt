Going to be okay. So, hello, everyone. My name is Han Ji Chi. I'm from NC State. So, my talk is going to be a study of a different flavor. I'm going to talk more about the macroscopic way to model these interesting dynamics of thin liquid films flowing down a vertical fiber. But for the sake of application, Oh, it's working? Okay. Yeah, okay. I hope people on Zoom can hear me. Okay, great. Thanks. So this is a collaborative work with both mathematicians and engineers from multiple institutions. And I hope that towards the end, I can talk about some applications where we have. About some applications where we have some opportunities to build some kinetic equation-based models for these interesting dynamics. So, let me start with. I think this one is not really connected. Sorry, can I? Yes, I think the connector was yeah, some reason. Yeah, for some reason it's not working. Okay, here we go. Sorry about that. Okay, so let me start with some generic fluid films flowing down a vertical fiber. So over here, you can see a prototype showing how we have a basically equipment that was designed by our collaborators from UCLA. We have a From UCLA, we have a lot of vertically strong vertical fibers. Those are either polymers or cotton threads. And we have some liquid flowing down from the top of the fibers. And depending on the application, you can either let some heated coolant flowing down these fibers, or you can have this prototype being used as some kind of dehumidifiers or some particle captures. Or some particle capture system. So, for example, over here, you can use a fan to blow up some hot and humid air, and then you can use some cold water from the top, which is going to flow down from the top of these fibers. And these droplets on the fiber is going to capture whatever is blown up from these counter-flowing airs. So, this type of application has been demonstrated in experiments to be very effective. In experiments to be very effective in terms of absorbing like gas and like capture some ultra-fine particles and use this thing as a dehumidifier. So what we want to do is to develop some models that can help us understand how this system works so that we can improve the application of these kinds of dynamics in the real cases. So this is what's actually happening. Is what's actually happening in the lab at UCLA. So, over here, you see a lot of fibers strung together, and we have different nozzles controlling the flow rate from the inlet. And you can trace all these droplets falling down, and they might be dripping, or they might form some interesting pattern. And one can trace the efficacy of these types of liquid flowing down by looking at the frequency of the droplets. The droplets. Okay, so for now, let's forget about all the heating and the particle in a system. Let's just focus on the very basic dynamics. And in fact, if we just look at the fluid flowing down a vertical fiber, we can have three types of dynamics. Namely, we can have the so-called convective region, where you can have a lot of droplets colliding into each other in a sort of chaotic. Other in a sort of chaotic way. This usually happens when you have the droplets falling down at a very high flow rate and they don't have the space to actually develop a more regular pattern. And you can have this train of more steadily flowing down beads. So this is what we call the already plateau instability regime. So this is actually the name of the instability. The instability that actually would form these kinds of droplets. Basically, you have the surface tension, which tries to form the droplets in a more or less rounded shape. But because of the gravity, they are being driven away from just forming a regular shape. You can actually see that the shape of the droplets towards the bottom, they are actually having some higher so-called Actually, having some higher so-called contact angle for the shape of the droplets. And further along, if we look at a flow rate that is relatively smaller, you can actually have the so-called dripping regime, where you can see that the droplets are basically dripping from the inlet, and you have a relatively long interbead spacing between these droplets. Spacing between these droplets. Okay, so we have three cases. So, for the sake of application, it is going to be the best if we can force the droplets to stay in the middle region. So, that's the stable region that can help us maintain a stable train of bees. It's easier to control and it's easier to design applications based on the middle really plateau regime, which is more like the traveling wave solutions. If we use a model, this. If we use a model to describe this, so there are many things we can consider that would affect these flow regimes. So, for example, if we increase the flow rates from a low flow rate to the higher flow rate cases, we can see that the transition of the flow pattern from the isolated dripping case to something with a much smaller interdroplet. Much smaller interdroplet spacing case. So things are becoming more regular in this regime. And you can see the impact of the substrate. So if you get a sticker fiber and you let the liquid flow down, you can actually see that the droplets would move at a slower rate if you start with the same flow rate. And that is understandable because if you think about the thickness of the fiber over here. Thickness of the fiber over here. If the fiber is small enough, you have a larger chance to form a larger bead, which is going to flow faster. So this is what's happening when you modify some of the parameters in the setting. And we also saw that you can control the system by modifying the boundary condition. So we actually are developing some boundary control system to actually control how the downstream dynamics. Show how the downstream dynamics of these droplets are going to perform. So, the basic framework of my talk would be from three perspectives. So, first of all, I'm going to mention we can do very complicated Navios type simulation for these kinds of dynamics. So, people have done that before. But the issue is that it can be very expensive. So, in order to perform a So, in order to perform a simulation for these kinds of droplets on a fiber of, let's say, 10 centimeters away from the nozzle, it can take almost a day to perform a reasonably accurate simulation. And it is very difficult to use the Nevis-Stokes solver to perform further information for the downstream. Yes. Just ask something about the experiment, just to be clear. The nozzle is always open. There's like a continuous flow, and the droplets just form because of surface. Just form because of surface engine. Yes, yes. It's not like we're cutting it, we are creating droplets by yes, yes, exactly. Thank you for the question. Yes, so we are basically using a constant flow rate from the nozzle. The inlet nozzle is always open. So the droplet formation is purely driven by the radi plateau instability. So it's purely driven by the surface tension. Yep. Okay, so basically this motivates us to do some better reduce-order modeling for the Reduce all the modeling for the downstream dynamics prediction. And we would like to first do some prediction for the regime transition. So, when do we get this nice stable train of droplets? And can we say something about these droplet characteristics? And I would talk a bit about the mathematical analysis and numerical studies of these models. And there are two levels of simplification we can do for these models. One is called the lubrication theory, the other one is called the Lubrication theory, the other one is called the weighted recedule modeling for different regimes. And after this discussion, I'm going to mention some application of this framework using when we try to use this system for capturing particles, and we can talk about the distribution of particles in the system. Okay, so let me start with the classical lubrication model for the free surface of the droplets. Surface of the droplets. So, this is a type of model that has been working very nicely for thin viscous fluids. So, imagine that you have a thin liquid fluid on a vertical substrate and sorry, on a horizontal substrate in this diagram. And you can simplify the two-dimensional Nami-Stokes equation to the Stokes equation in the low-res number limit. And then, if you further assume the If you further assume the aspect ratio epsilon for the thickness and the character length scale of the domain to be small enough, then you can simplify the theory to just one equation for the thickness of the fluid as a function of space and time. So over here you see a Reynolds lubrication model for the H, which represents the thickness of the fluid. And there are several terms that is very important. So the M term over here. So the M term over here, oops, the M term over here represents the, I think I lost my mouse, but anyway, so the M term over here represents the mobility coefficient that governs how fast these fluid films are going to move. We have this pressure term, this P term, that represents the dynamic pressure. So that encodes the surface tension that is driving the dynamics of the entire. Being the dynamics of the entire steam liquid film, and you can also encode some information about the substrate. For example, if you look at these two cases, you have a almost perfectly wetting fluid on the substrate, and you can also have some fluid on a hydrophobic substrate, and you can have a finite contact angle where your droplet is basically beat up. So, we can use a disjointing pressure to model if. A disjointing pressure to model effects like that, and it's also part of the pressure. So, the application of lubrication models can be in many, many different cases. So, for example, we can have finite time singularities in terms of the solution for the film thickness. So, this is mainly due to the degeneracy of the model. When the mobility function goes down to zero, you lose the fourth order. Lose the fourth-order nature of the PDE for the film thickness. And we have also seen models for the tier film dynamics. So, this is useful when you try to model things like dry eye syndrome that some people would suffer. So, this is something that can be explained using a tear film model for the thickness of the human tear film. When there is a rupture in a human tear film, you can have some Film, you can have some itchiness or redness in your eyes, and that's caused by the rupture of the lubrication model. And we can also talk about droplet dynamics. And recently, there's a work on the undercompressive shocks for this kind of thing-fueled model in the application of tears of wine. When you see the wine lags dripping down, and that's caused by some surface tension gradient that can be incorporated into the model. But for the sake of But for the sake of our case, we are thinking about essentially a vertical cylindrical fiber, and we have thin-liquid film surrounding this fiber. And we would like to incorporate the Navier-Slip boundary condition and some kind of film stabilization term to basically model what's going to happen if you have some wetting property of the substrate. And if we And if we take the so-called uniform nozzle film, we can define the length scale, and we assume that this is a reasonably thin film relative to the capillary length of these droplets. So I'm going to quickly show what the model looks like. So this is the full lubrication model for our case, and we have a small alpha that shows over here. Let me see. Let me see very quickly over here. Do I get back my? I think there might be some delay on my end. Yeah, anyway, so this is a fulubrication model that can help us determine what is happening for the dynamics of liquid film. Dynamics of liquid film down the fiber. So the alpha term over here represents the aspect ratio for the yeah, so I'm I cannot see the yeah, it's interesting. It w worked Interesting. It worked initially and I can do this. Um wait. Yeah, for some reason I am not getting it back. Okay, it could be a system issue. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, I'm gonna try to describe what I refer to over here. So essentially, we have a model for the free surface that is going to change in space and in time. In space and in time. So, the aspect ratio is alpha thing that tells me how thick the film is relative to the radius of the fiber. And I have the radius fiber as part of the model. And the flow rate is going to be encoded into this HN, which is the nozzle film thickness. And there have been some other models developed for this kind of regime, but basic idea here is that the surface tension plays two different roles in this dynamic. Two different roles in this dynamics. So the self-extension tries to, so if you think about the decomposition, so there is the streamwise self-extension and the axle is a motor curvature that is in the direction perpendicular to a streamwise. So the destabilizing isomatral curvature or the hoof stress, that is the one that's trying to destabilize the flat film, and that's the one that's responsible for forming the droplets. And there's this. The droplets, and there's this other one that points streamwise. That's the one that's stabilizing everything. And for the mobility, we can incorporate the ziplans and the stabilization effects that I talked about earlier. And if we think about the film stabilization model, where we encoded that pi term, the disjoint pressure, which can help stabilize the film, we can look at the Film, we can look at the instability of a basic coating thickness. So, assuming that we have a flat film and there is no droplet per se at this point, we just perturb this flat film by some flow remotes and see how different terms contribute to the stability of these droplets. So, bifurcation in terms of this critical coding thickness works the following. So, essentially, So essentially, if the film is thin enough, then everything is going to be stable. We're not going to see the droplets. But if the film is like thick enough above this threshold epsilon p, then you start seeing the unstable mode taking over the entire system, and there's a hope for you to get the droplets. So essentially, you would need some kind of flow rate in order to get the droplets to form. To form. And the mechanism for the film stabilization is essentially that we are able to stabilize some of the flat film in order to get better comparison against the experiments. And in order to characterize the type of solution that we see in the fiber coding model, we can look at some type of particular solutions. For example, one can describe the experimental data. Describe the experimental data that we saw in the rally plateau stability case as a type of travel wave. So, this is an approximation. And we can take the measurements from the experimental data and trace the peaks of individual droplets. And we can look at how fast these traveling waves are actually moving. So, by assuming a traveling wave onset, you can actually rewrite the original system into a eigenvalue problem. Into an eigenvalue problem for the H, the big H, which represents the traveling wave on SAS that I'm looking for. And by solving this constraint eigenvalue problem, where we have the mass constraint, because the total mass of the fluid in the system doesn't change, you can actually get the speed of the traveling wave and you can try to match the speeds of these droplets against the experiments. Against the experiments. So, one comparison of the experimental observation against some existing models prior to our work shows that usually there's going to be some kind of discrepancy in the speed predictions. We either get underestimate or overestimate depending on what kind of terms you are incorporating in the model. But for our case, we're able to capture both. To capture both the rally plateau regime where you have a stable train of droplets, and also the so-called isolated droplet regime, where you have one big droplet followed by a lot of small wavy patterns. So for both cases, we are able to generate like simulated data matching up to the experiments pretty well. And another thing we can do is to perform some kind of prediction for the droplets. For the droplets and compare them against experiments that we've done. So, over here, we see four panels showing up the relative, like the flow rate and the fiber radius impact on the speed of these traveling waves. So, we can solve for the eigenvalue problem for the speed of these individual traveling waves by taking in the mass of the individual solution and the period of the individual. The period of the individual job profiles, and then provide a speed based on what we solved for. And we see that for all four cases with either a fixed fiber radius and varying nozzle inner diameter, or in other cases, our model typically outperformed the other existing models in terms of the prediction of the job led speeds. Job bit speeds. There is one case over here. We see that our model doesn't really do a good job, and all the other models as well, in terms of the prediction. And all three of us didn't really get a good prediction for the speed. And this is actually the case when we no longer have a traveling wave. So the onset that we plug into the model is not a good onset. And in this case, we actually have a periodic orbit. A periodic orbit for the solution. So, both in time and in space, we have something that looks like this: you have the larger droplet moving at a faster rate and a smaller wavy pattern moving at a slower rate. H is the thickness of the droplet. Yes. Yes. So, yeah, that's kind of important here because we always assume that when we do this kind of simulation study, Do this kind of simulation study, h has to be positive so that we stay in the physically meaningful space for the solution. Yes, and then if we look at the relative periodic orbit, we can do further stability analysis for those type of solutions as well. Yes. Okay. So for the stability analysis of the traveling waves, one can look into One can look into the linear stability of the computed traveling waves, and there's actually a hop bifurcation that shows up, and that's the stability that's responsible for the appearance of these smaller wavy patterns, like ahead of the big droplet that's flowing down. And for the sake of existence and For the sake of existence and verbosness of the solution, we have got analytical results for a type of model that contains both the fully nonlinear curvature terms for the models. Over here, we did a small change of variable so that the U represents the film thickness for the fluid and also the fiber radius. We showed that we can get a generalized weak solution for these types of solutions. For these types of solutions, and under some technical conditions, we can get convergence to the traveling wave solutions. Okay, so so far, what we have talked about is very basic fiber coding dynamics without any thermal effects. And this is very far from what we actually use this system for in the real engineering application. So, one case. So, one case that we looked for is the thermal effects in the fiber coating system. So, this is the case when the liquid can change its property relative to the temperature that we impose at a specific location. And in the experiments, we see that if we incorporate some heat from the inlet without the Now, we can see that there is going to be some kind of compression of the beads. And at some point, this is going to lead to some kind of collision of the droplets. So we lose the nice property of a stable traveling wave solution that we usually would see without the heat. And we develop a slightly modified model to account for that. And this is when we have the temperature-dependent liquid. Have the temperature-dependent liquid properties along the fiber. So, when the temperature changes, both the surface tension and the viscosity of the liquid changes. As a result, you can get either a surface tension gradient along the fiber or a viscosity gradient along the fiber. So this leads to a slightly modified model, which can be used to account for when or how these kinds of thermally driven bead coalescence can. So, this is a model that can be further closer to what the real system looks like. And another type of modification one can do is to incorporate some Reynolds number that are not negligible, but somewhat moderate. So, this is a model that's called like weighted recedule modeling with moderate inertia effects. So, previously, what we've got So, previously, what we got is basically a mass conservation model with a lot of pressure, a lot of terms in the pressure term that encodes the surface tension and we have the gravity and everything else. But over here, we can also incorporate the so-called balance of average momentum that tells us what's going to happen if I encode some moderate inertial effects. So, over here, this little delta coefficient over here. Delta coefficient over here. That's a reduced Reynolds number that accounts for how much inertia you would like to introduce. So, as a result, you get a couple system for both the H, which is the film thickness, and the Q, which is the local flux. So, with this model, we can actually get a more powerful system, which can account for both the downstream dynamics and the near-nozzle dynamics. Near nozzle dynamics. So the near-nozzle dynamics is more complicated because over here, if we think about what's happening over here near the nozzle, so this is the regime when the lubrication theory doesn't apply. We do not have the required length scale aspect ratio that we needed for deriving that single equation for the thickness. So we need to do something else for this region, basically. And with the help of the weighted The help of the weighted residual modeling, we are able to capture the dynamics of these droplets when you have a fixed inlet over here. And the geometry of the inlet can change depending on what kind of nozzle you're using. So if you're using a larger nozzle, you may have something that's closer to isolated droplet region. And if you use smaller nozzles, you can have some kind of like jetting behavior and you can get more closely placed droplets. Mostly placed droplets, and they can collide into each other if the nozzle is really, really small. So, this is a type of model that can be used if we want to get the whole picture. And there's also some full-names analysis one can study, especially if we want to incorporate some complex geometry for the nozzle. And this is one study that we looked at, which incorporates the Which incorporates the roughness of the substrate. So, this is something that can be encoded in using something called the negative slippage. So, with the last five minutes, I wanted to talk about actually something that hopefully can be interesting to this group. So, we have done some very recent experiments and we've published the results just last year. So, this is a type of application used. A type of application using the fiber coding system that I've just talked about. So, we would like to use this system to capture ultra-fine particles. So, the idea here is like this. So, we are using something called a wet electrostatic precipitator. So, this is a type of mechanism that would essentially take the polluted flow from some kind of Flow from some kind of diesel generator or from some other sources. And then we would like to use the high voltage electric field to charge these particles. And then these particles is going to be flown up from this fan from bottom up. So you get some kind of counterflowing air with the particles. And then we use the liquids flowing down the fiber to capture those particles, and everything is going to be. Particles and everything is going to be basically sweat away from the fiber using this system. So now you have some particles that's going to flow together with the liquid and things get more complicated because of the kind of flowing air itself. So this has been shown to be a very effective system in terms of the liquid to gas ratio. We can use a very small amount of water to get a lot. Of water to get a lot of ultra-fine particles in the system, and this is a more environmentally friendly mechanism to capture the ultra-fine particles. So for the sake of application, we will need to take into the consideration of the counterfalling air. So, for example, we can use some simplified models. Say we have the counterfalling air like surrounding the intrabeat region when everything is. Interbeat region when everything is kind of flat, we can assume that the velocity of the air is almost constant. And then when things hit the droplets, we can use some simplified model for that portion as well. But for the particles, we can do something either very simplified or more complicated. If we want to simulate the particle trajectories, this is what's happening when you do the ANSI simulation using some simple. ANSIS simulation using some simplified like counterfalling air. We see that over here, we have some distribution for the particles near the bottom of the fiber. And as they being carried over to the top, we see that some of the particles are going to distribute to the fiber itself. And some of them would land on the droplet, some of them would land at the inter-droplet region. So it's going to Droplet region. So it's going to define an initial state for the particles like inside of the droplets that's falling down. So hopefully we can develop some kind of kinetic fluid models for this kind of dynamics, assuming that you have droplets being deposited from the counterfalling air. And we are interested in understanding how this would work and how this would affect the fluid itself. Fluid itself. So, as a summary, I am basically covering a few models for describing the fluids falling down a vertical fiber when they would get droplet shapes. In terms of the models, we have talked about the case when you have essentially no inertial effects. That's when we use the lubrication model. When we have some moderate inertial effects, the weighted recedule model is our The weighted recedual model is our friends. We can incorporate some near-nozzo dynamics, and we can also talk about when you have some thermal effects, and that's going to sometimes give you interesting geoplay coalescence. And in the end, I'm trying to incorporate some applications of ultra-fine particle capturing. So, one can potentially describe the dynamics of the distribution of the particles inside the droplets using some kind of. Inside the droplets using some kind of distribution, I am trying to develop some models that can describe these charged particles in the fiber coding system. Okay, so I hope this could be of interest to some of you here and online. And thank you very much for your attention. Any questions? I have a question actually here. You mentioned that H is always positive. So is it easy to ensure a numerical simulation? And if not, how you do this? Yeah, thank you very much for the question. So we are actually developing, or actually writing up the paper right now. So we've developed a positive T-preserving numerical scheme for this type of full lubrication model for the For lubrication model for the fiber coding dynamics. So, usually, this is not guaranteed, and especially if we are using a very coarse grid for the simulation, sometimes you do see that the strong instability can cause the solution to go negative and things would break down very quickly. And so what we did is that we developed a bounded entropy method, which would guarantee that the numerical scheme would guarantee the positivity of the system. The positivity of the solution, and everything would go smoothly afterwards. And this is based on our understanding of the system, and we always have a positivity guarantee for the solution as long as the initial data is good enough. Yes. And I have another question. When I looked at all these nice movies, it reminded me the ADV type equation when you have a wave moving and the speed of propagation depends on the size of the wave, right? Yes. Of the wave, right? Yes. So is here the speed, does it depend on the thickness of the numerical computation, if you have a diffusion, it will may affect the thickness and then the speed. And then this way you get the wrong propagation speed of the so how do you deal with that? Yeah, so that's a very good question. And actually for now, our numerical scheme doesn't really take that into consideration. Into consideration. So, in practice, when we simulate, especially for the cases when you have like very large droplets and smaller ones and they're interacting with each other, the diffusion, or especially if there's numerical diffusion in a system that's very strong, we can get systems that are not so accurate for the solution. So, I think for the sake of like longer time simulation for a larger system, this is definitely something. For a larger system, this is definitely something that we should be considering. But for now, we are not developing any special mechanism for that. Yeah, I think particles and kinetic things may be very helpful there. Yes. Yeah. So I am really trying to learn new things from this workshop. So I'm sorry that a lot of the stuff that I talked about in my talk, this is probably a little bit far from what you're very familiar with. But hopefully I can talk to people in this workshop and learn new things from here. Workshop and learn new things from here. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, no, I guess thank you for your talk. I was wondering, so this model that you were showing about the lubrication approximation, even in 1D, so it's similar to the thin film equation, but I guess you had this term that was second order? Yes. Yeah, I mean, I was going for the 1D. Yeah, I mean, I was going for the 1D case because that one is already too complicated. But yeah, but I guess the question for me was: yeah, I guess you have in this term that is H divided by H cubed. Yes. So I guess at the end of the day, you end up getting some regularization of the thin film equation with some one over row, one over H? Yes. Is that known to be well posed? You know, or that's a very good question. So actually, so if we look at this chart, So, if we look at this term, it was a little bit difficult for me to explain things without the cursor, but basically, if we think about these two things, right? So, this guy is the destabilizing term, and this guy is the stabilizing term. So, it is known that, especially for some classical thin film equation, if you only keep the destabilizing term, the well-pulsedness of the solution is not guaranteed. You can easily get blow-up or rupture for your solution. uh rupture uh for your solution and things can get really bad uh like if you don't do the well the solution of the the pde is not uh the existence of the solution of the pd after after a certain point is not guaranteed okay so this is why people usually would um take some regularization to take care of that uh okay so that that's considered as a regularization term it's not like kind of the wetted energy of like uh so um i would say that this is a term that is kind of motivated by the so the function Of motivated by the so the functional form of this term is motivated by the wedding energy. But the real value of this A that we take is actually a bit larger than what would be considered appropriate for the wedding energy. But we are taking this term so that it can really be used to stabilize the model itself. Thank you.
