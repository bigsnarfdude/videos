So we'll continue the afternoon session with Sari Hernandez Torres, who's going to tell us about catching wildlife. Thank you. I want to thank the organizers for bringing us together. I come from the probabilistic side, and I want to tell you today about a problem with probability whose solution really needs analytic from minotaurics. So I want to change. I can't. Let's see. Okay, before I can just use this. I want to acknowledge my wonderful set of collaborators. There's several of us that have worked on these things. Erin Beckman, Nicole Eckmeyer, Matthew Jonj, who is actually. Matthew Jung, who is actually the one who has worked most on the type of problems I'm going to talk about today. Naina Rai and Nindy Rai, they are sisters and a very young sister students. So yeah, I'll continue using the keyword. So I want to talk about a model that is called Chase Ski. And I have to make a disclaimer first. I'm not really going to talk about catching wildlife. Talk about catching wildlife. This is not really a model useful in theoretical biology. This is just for the sake of the story. So I want to think about prey and predators, but perhaps it models best rumors spreading through a social network on a virus spreading through a network of computers. And then there could be the prey, and the predator could be the truth trying to release the well. Like, release that, well, to take out of the market that boomer, or the antivirus, like patchy block that's affecting the computers. But I like the wolf and the rabbit, so I'm going to stick with it. And chase escape has been studied a lot, but I also want to tell you, and this is where analytic combinatorics become useful, about a variation of chase escape that is called chase escape with death, where the prey may die independently and well. Independently, and well, I'll get into the actual model in a second. And a third variation is distance-dependent chase escape, on which the rate at which these prey die depends on the distance between each prey and the nearest predator. Good, so I'll start with Chase Escape, which is very well known. So, think about an infinite connector graph. So, this is going to give us a geometry of how the frame. Geometry of how the prey and the predators are moving on space. And we have three types of sites. We have the white sites, which means that they're empty, so nobody has conquered that territory. I have the red sites, which indicate the presence of prey, and blue sides, which indicate the presence of a predator. So if I have a red side that is a neighbor of a white side, That is a neighbor of a white side, it means that we have prey that is ready to occupy new territory on the white side, and after an exponential time of parameter lambda, it occupies that space. And the way that predators move, they are actually chasing the prey. So it means that the only way that they can occupy new territory is that if I have a predator that is a neighbor of prey, then after an exponential time, An exponential time, the parameter one, they get through it, catch, kill, and occupy. So, this model was introduced by George Brotsakia in 2005. And here our main parameter is a lambda. So, this is the one that we want to vary and see if we have coexistence of the two species. Of the two species. So if it happens that for an infinite amount of time, we do see that prey extends to an infinite amount of sites, and then these are followed by the predators. But it could also happen that prey is killed at a finite time. So then we have extension. Oh, okay, we have some movement of this. And to fix ideas, let me give you an example on the Let me give you an example on the easiest geometry. So we just have a line, and these are our initial conditions. These are our very usual conditions. We have a predator followed by prey, and then everything in front of them is empty. So to fix ideas, let's think that this parameter lambda is 2. So our, so it means that in expectation, each one of these rounds. Each one of these random variables, which indicates the speed at which the prey is moving through each one of these edges, are going to be faster than the speed at which the blue ones are going to occupy the next well, the blue ones are going to occupy a red spot. So, in the beginning, well, all these random variables, of course, are independently. Independently, and we have some values for each one of the edges of the graph, and then we just see how it evolves. So, this is our configuration at time zero. And the first thing that happens, since this is 1.1 and this is 1.5, it means that at time 1.1, red is going to advance. And this one is just reading four more seconds. Four more seconds so it advances and then catches the next site, but then red gets to advance faster. So one may think that if this parameter lambda is larger than one, then one could have a positive probability of having coexistence. And this is one first situation. And on the other hand, if And on the other hand, if lambda is smaller than 1, then the predators would be fast enough to kill all the prey and this game finishes in finite time, so we have extinction. So the question is, well, we have two phases. So is there a critical parameter between coexistence and extinction? So there are always a finite number of predators. Number of predators? A finite number of predators. Well, yes, in the line, if there's a finite number of predators, you just take the largest position, and that's equivalent to having initial conditions predator prey, and then everything is empty. There are some variations. If you have an infinite graph and more interesting geometry of the graph, Interesting geometry of the graph, then having predators in several places becomes more interesting here, not so much. Good. So, well, of course, we have extinction if lambda is smaller than 1. So, in particular, at criticality, and this is what Charles Bergen proved, there is extinction as well, and coexistence with lambda is larger than 1. Is larger than one. So we can think that for each graph, we want to find that critical parameter. And this is a problem that has been studied a lot by several people. I want to highlight this result first, which is for DRE trees, which is the context on which we are going to focus for today. So on a DRE3, that critical parameter is a Critical parameter is this number, which is just a solution to some quadratic equation. And the important thing to have in mind is that this is asymptotic to 1 over 40. And at criticality, extinction occurs almost surely. So this has also been studied in delta-Watts and trees. It happens that if we know the mean of the offspring distribution, then this gives you, well, in this situation, gives you well in this situation the critical parameter for cattle water trees it would be that corresponding lambda z for T. And I also highlight this paper of Rick De Red, Matthew Jones and Sit Ten because the techniques that they use to understand a variety of situations, the ladder graph, they also prove again the result for the array trees, but in a way simpler way. Well, in a lot much Well, a lot more simple than the previous results. These are very technical, but the proof that they give here is very nice, very simple, and I'll tell you where we are going to use it in our result. Yes? So it doesn't depend on the initial configuration? It doesn't depend on the well, for trees, it would be something similar. You have this Have this theory tree or these other websites, and if you only have a finite number of predators, then you look at that sub-tree. There's a reason why it's easier to study this some trees because it's very much like a line, but you have exponentially many lines. Well, no, I mean they are growing exponentially, and then you have a continuum of lines. If you go to other geometries, and this is what they were trying to do here, to go, okay, so let's consider oriented setting or something in between, and it happens on the ladder graph that is just the lines, and then you have them connected, just as a ladder, is also very much like a line. So, there are a lot of very interesting open questions about what happens in Sadiq. What happens in setting general. And then these initial conditions would become more interesting, but even for this very simple initial point of having just one predator and one prey, it's kind of open to know who is lambda sea, that critical parameter. It has been studied as well, just to give a quick overview on the complete Quick overview on complete graphs, and since they already know what happens in Velcombe trees, jumping to the configuration model is not as hard. I hear maybe it's closer to what some of you have suggested, of having like several parameters in the network, but this group of people where they are actually more interested in the applications and communications networks. So they look at Networks may look at Woisson Gilbert graphs, or for example, some Woisson permit oscillation, and they consider these proclamation models in the continuum and think about the lines that are connecting the dots that appear under your configuration. But this is just a quick overview about what is known on Chase Escape. But I want to tell you mostly about these variations of Chase Escape with death and distance-dependent chase. And distance-dependent chase escape. So, well, now the difference is that we have an additional state which is dead and it's marked with black. And it's equivalent just to consider that on the prey. So if we want also death on the predators, it would just change the actual analysis a little bit, but not in a significant way. Not in a significant way. So the analysis is essentially the same. So we can just consider that on the prey at some exponential rate, it's some exponential random variable with rate rho. And so each prey, you can think that once it occupies, it has a clock that gives it its lifetime. So it means that it may die for some other reasons than by being eaten by a wolf. So at this starting point, we have a lot of water. So at this starting point, we have again one predator, one prey, and the rabbit has a lifetime that is exponential. And then, well, they continue spreading with this dynamics of chase escape, but then prey may die. And when it's dead, it means, since we are not changing these dynamics, that the predators are not going to be able to occupy that space. So it's kind of lost forever from our. Lost forever from our configuration. Yep. Is it possible that prey occupies a black dot? That prey occupies... Ah, no, we're not changing that as well. We still have the rules that prey is only going to occupy white sites and the predators, double sites, are only going to occupy the red sites. The websites. It kind of becomes important in a moment when I tell about the possible faces that we have on Jesus Keep death. I want to focus, because it's easier to study, on the area trees. So we are going to have as parameters, d, which is the number of children, and lambda and rho, which are the corresponding rates for the advancement of the prey and the lifetime. Lifeline. This independent chase escape is just a very small variation on this model, where now the rate at which the prey is moving is going to depend on its distance to the nearest predator. So I'm also putting this in the context of the array trees because it's easy to find who is the nearest predator. Who's the one in your ancestral line? So for example, you know, we still start with this initial configuration. So start with this initial configuration. I have predator, prey. So this is a distance one from the nearest predator. So it means that it's going to move at rate lambda one. Predators still move at rate one. And as well, its lifetime depends on the distance to the nearest predator. So as we advance, then this one has lung bones. has lambda modes. It's going to advance either to this position or to this position at some exponential time, but with great lambda 2 and so on and so forth. And well we also have our killings. So this is our variation to which our methods work as well. So these are the possible So these are the possible phases. We have the coexistence phase, as in the case of Case Escape on the line. So it means that we have a positive probability that both, and well, we have to think about the whole process. We let it run forever. So that the cardinality of the set of blue sides is infinite with positive probability, and as well of the red sides. In particular, of course, if there's an infinite Because if there's an infinite amount of blue sides, it means that they have to catch the red ones. So it implies that there are infinitely many prey at some point. We also have some extinction, so it means that either the predators manage to kill everybody, or that the prey die by themselves. And in that case, almost surely they are going to be finant. But we have something in between that is the escape phase. In between, that is the escape phase. And this is why it was relevant to say that we cannot, well, these blue sides cannot occupy the black ones because they serve as, well, they are blocking actually the advancement of the predators. So it means that there is a positive probability if these red ones are moving fast enough to just advance down the network. Then we have these critical parameters. Here we have these critical parameters besides just a critical parameter for lambda. Now, if we fix our graph and we fix some lambda, we have critical parameters for these lifetimes. So they potentially can give us this extra phase which is called escape. But we still have to show that this actually exists. Between coexistence and extinction, which happened for G'scape, we have this phase where there is a we have this phase where there is a positive probability that only the prey managed to survive. So the first theorem is this complete phase diagram for the phase transitions. So fix your D and this is the lambda C from a previous slide that is a critical parameter for the RB trees having chase escape over it. And we have Over it. And we have lambda c plus, which actually is the other root from that polynomial from which lambda c is defined. So I'm not writing their actual values, although, well, this is just some number. But the important thing is that lambda c is asymptotic to 1 over 4d, and lambda c plus is 4d. So we look at that region, and if we have that lambda is not between lambda c minus Is not between lambda C minus and lambda C plus, so it will be, let's say, something like here, then we only have two phases: escape and extinction. So similar as in chase escape. But if we do have some lambda on that open interval, then we do have the three phases, coexistence, escape, and extinction. And at criticality, we also understand the behavior. Criticality, we also understand the behavior. So, at row C we have escape, and at row E we have extinction. So, that, well, this is just a line. And here I have some data points because we don't have an explicit formula for rho c as a function of lambda. We can also understand what happens with the expectation. So, if we think about So, if we think about a set of blue vertices, the expected number of blue vertices is finite if rho is larger than rho c and it's equal, and this is actually different from what happens when chase is given. We have equality, I mean we have that this is infinite, when rho is equal to rho c. Okay, now further theorems trying to understand that dotted line we have that We have that some bound somebody's row C that is smaller or less well smaller than the square root of D, or square root of D times a constant. But although we cannot compute it exactly, we do have an algorithm that tells us if given some rho, as long as we are not unlucky enough to just get rho C. This algorithm tells us if row is smaller than rho c or a row. Smaller than rho C, or a rho is larger than rho c. So from running that algorithm, we can get an approximation to that dotted line, and it looks like the curve here on the left. And what happens for distance-dependent chase escape? So here we have, we need some assumptions on how lambda, rho, How lambda rho are growing? And well, we have more general assumptions, but for the sake of this talk, just think that they have this decay on their quotients. And here we have a result on the expectation. So this is going to be infinite. So we have expected coexistence, means because remember, if we have an infinite amount of loose sites, it implies an infinite amount. It implies an infinite amount of websites for. If we have a radius of convariance, if m is smaller than d for this radius of convariance of a generating function. So we arrive to the part where analytic combinatorics comes in the picture. So who is this? These are the weight of catalog and numbers, depending, those weights depend on this vector lambda, that vector rho. And well, here the question is: well, how am I choosing these weights? Using these ways, how is that disappears at all? So, let me use the remainder of, I guess, three minutes to tell you like the six key ideas on how we go from chase escape with death. And let's just stick with that case to weighted catalog numbers. So, the first thing that one realizes is that there are some important vertices as we run a process down the tree. Process down the tree. And it's every time that we see a repetition of the initial conditions. So the initial conditions are this blue vertex followed by a red vertex and then everything down the tree is empty. So if we see the process, maybe that die and then that advances, at this point we see a repetition of initial conditions for this vertex. Because above that vertex, there's only a blue one and below. Only a blue one, and below everything is empty. So we call that a renewal vertex. And then we continue looking what happens. This one is not going to be a renewal vertex because it already has someone who is right below it. But, well, if I'm already putting down what happens down here, but this if everything is empty below it, it's also a renewal vertex. It's also a renewal vertex. So, I'm going to think about this process of, well, this renewal vertexes as a branching process that is embedded into my original Chase Escape with Death process. And here it's not so difficult. This is more just like an indication of, well, if I have an infinite amount of loose sites, in particular, I have an infinite amount of renewals. An infinite amount of renewals, it means that I saw an infinite amount of blue ones. So, this inequality is easy. But what is difficult to show is that these are in fact equal. So, we are giving a characterization of this critical parameter. We are saying that ρ is actually equal to the critical parameter for that embedded branching process to be infinite. So that's So that's key for everything that follows. Then we say, well, since these two critical parameters are equal, it's just good enough to understand this embedded matching process and in particular its expectations. So we can just think about how many renewals I get per generation. And then I started to get that function that is just number of renewals per generation. Number of renewals per generation. And here, since I'm just looking per generation, I can just follow what happens in one of the rays of this tree. So it's useful to just see what happens of one of the rays. So we look at the process on the line. So here we have our initial conditions again. We have a blue vertex followed by a red one, and then everything is empty. And what we are empty and what we are keeping track what we are keeping track of the distance between the largest blue and the red one the largest red one. So here in the beginning the distance is one and this is one of the ideas on this paper that I mentioned earlier today. So when we see this process happening we realize that every time that we hit one it means that we We hit one, it means that we got a repetition of initial conditions because we're at just distance one. So this is our initial conditions, and we are this for this mark of change, these are the transition probabilities, well, except for the possibility that we are maybe killed. So here again, we got a renewal, but at some point somebody dies and then we just killed everything. So we are counting how many renewals we get. How many renewals we get before somebody is killed, and when anybody is killed, we just killed everything. So, we want to understand the probabilities of these paths. And for a lot of people here, these are kind of a familiar path because this is just a big path translated by one. And the weights are those transition probabilities. What is the probability that this particular path appears on the Markov chain that I just described? Of chain that I just described. So these are where the Catalan numbers, well, your weighted version appears. So these weights come from these transition probabilities. And what is really, really, really nice about this analytical metabolics approach is that we can understand what is a critical parameter. A critical parameter for this embedded branching process with the generating function or with continuous fractions. So, this is really what we use to understand, to pin down the behavior of criticality and to generate these algorithms. That part comes from this side of the equation, to see whether rho is smaller or larger than rho c. So, to finish, these are the takeaways. What was important? Take away, but what's important, and actually, is missing from the distance-dependent chase escape. That's why we only got an expectation result. But the reason why we were able to get a full description of the phase transition diagram for chase, escape, with death is a characterization of that critical parameter in terms of the embedded branching process. And then we were able to understand the behavior of that John. That John Markov chain with analytic coming at correct some way that paths. But here, well, when we first did this, we thought that we had an amazing solution and we were the first ones to do something like this. But it turns out we aren't because there is a previous paper of Recolette and Niegerman where they do this kind of analysis for birth and death Markov chains, which we were not aware at the moment, but well, you can see that. But well, you can see that these are not really new ideas on this other side of the conference from the analytic point of view. And finally, final reason why this works is because of the geometry of our problem. Because it's really, this tree is behaving as a lot of lines, which we are able to have an interesting behavior because we are in a tree. We are military, but at the end of the day, the analysis can come down to just this linear behavior. And this is my time to finish. Thank you very much. So, any questions? We have time for one quick question. Do I have time? One quick question. Do I have time to do that? Yeah, yeah, jump in, jump in. So, when you analyze the microchain, those transition probabilities, what are the renewable rail virtual systems? And then whether the results are for exact key value of the renewable agencies? The thing is that it's enough to understand how many renewals. If you have infinite amount, well, if you can show that with positive probability, there's an infinite number of renewables. Infinite number of renewables. In particular, by the definition of renewal, you have an infinite amount of blue vertices. The opposite direction is a hard one to say. If I have an infinite amount of blue vertices, it also means that I had an infinite amount of, well, like those probabilities are positive in the regime. We should probably take further questions offline. And thanks, Arivika. Thank you.
