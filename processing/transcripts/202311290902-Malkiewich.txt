W, W is also allowed to have corners. And so, what's happening on the boundary? So, the boundary is going to consist of M, and then I'm also going to have it consist of this piece that looks like the boundary of M times I. I think we lost video. And then, what's that? Did I say something? Oh, but I heard. I guess it was just an echo. No, I think I didn't lose the video. We lost the video. Oh, there is. We lost the video. Oh, there it's back again. Thank you. Oh, okay. Great. So the boundary of W is going to consist of M. Down here at the bottom, it's going to consist of some trivial sides. So the cocortism on the boundary of M is going to be trivial. And then it's going to consist of this top base N. I want to assume that the only corners, so I'm allowing corners, but the only corners are going to be along. Be along the boundary of m times i. Another way of saying this is if you think of the trivial cobordism, so think of m times i, right, that has an m on the bottom and m on the top, the boundary of m times i and the sides. I'm going to assume that w looks like the trivial cohortism near the bottom and sides. So there's this region in W here that is diffeomorphic to the corresponding region in the Dipiomorphic to the corresponding region in the cobordis. So basically, I'm allowing corners, but I'm not really allowing the corners to do anything. So all of the handle attachments, all of the interesting topology is going to be happening in this region in the cohortism. The non-trivial torsion, that sort of thing. Near here, everything is going to be trivial. So, as a result, this, you get the same theory as the usual case where. As the usual case where we only had manifolds of boundary and the boundary of W is broken up into M and N. So, in particular, these cobordisms up to diffeomorphism are going to be the same as these cobordisms up to diffeomorphism. Okay, and I guess I should say when I'm doing a diffeomorphism of these, I want the diffeomorphism to be the identity in some small neighborhood of the bottom and sides. Okay, so since these are the same things as before, we got the usual Esco-Borgson theorem for these. So just recall that. So this is Barden-Maser installing. Again, we're calling that the dimension of M is at least 5. Oh, sorry, I forgot part of the definition here. Which part did I forget? Right, it has to be a homotopy equivalence. Okay, good. Of course, the inclusions of M and N into W have to be homotopy equivalences. So I'm making that small on the board here, but of course, that is very important. That's what makes it an H-cobodism. Okay, so the theorem is that the H-cobodism. So the theorem is that the agent coordortisms on M up to diffeomorphism are in bijection like the whitehead group. So this is defined even if m is not connected, but for each connected component, so I'm just going to assume now that m is connected to describe it. This is k1 of z pi1m. of z pi 1x modulo plus or minus pi 1 of alpha beta n s. So this is basically invertible matrices in the group ring, but I'm modding out by elementary row operations and I'm modding out by some trivial matrices that are just plus or minus one element of the group. So the correspondence here is that this cohortism goes to the one-petge origin. And so since this is a bijection, this is telling you that the Is a bijection. This is telling you that the tortion of w relative to m is zero if and only if w is diffeomorphic to a trivial cobordism, which in particular gives you a diffeomorphism between the bottom and the top of the cobordism. That's one of the big reasons why we care about this. Okay, so this is a theorem about H cobortisms up to diffeomorphism. Of course, anytime, you know, if you're a good homotopy. Know, if you're a good homotopy theorist, anytime you see a statement like this, you think, oh, what about the rest of the space? But actually, that's the theme of this workshop, right? Spaces of manifolds. So this is just your thought. What about the rest of the space? We define the space of H coordinates. I'll call that H of atom. So there's a couple ways to describe what this is. If you just want to understand. If you just want to understand what a tomato type is, it's a disjoint union over diffeomorphism classes of these H-cobordisms of B of W, but I wanted to include the diffeomorphisms relative to the bottom and sides. In particular, the diffeomorphisms of the trivial cobordism are going to be pseudo-isotopies. Another way of this Another way to describe this is as a simplicial set. So, if I want to say, what is a case implex? Well, I'm going to describe that as some manifold with corners that's mapping down to the case implex. I want this to be a smooth bundle. And the fibers of this bundle are H-covoises. So, this is a manifold with corners. This is a map of a manifold with corners. It's locally trivial, and the fiber looks like this. So, the fiber has all of the structure. In particular, the bottoms of the covortez are giving you a map from m times delta k to that bundle. That's how you can define it as a simplicial set. Okay, so this theorem, so the s-comportism theorem is about pi-0 of the simplicial set. Of the simplicial set. This is age comortisms up to diffeomorphism. If you have a path between two points in this simplicial set, that's a bundle over the one simplex, but that bundle can be trivialized. And so that gives you a diffeomorphism between the two H-cobordisms at either end. So it's natural to ask: well, what about the higher homotopy groups? As if some kind of description of these in terms of algorithmic weird. But there is, of course. That's a rhetorical question. There is, but that relationship only holds in a stable range. So to get the relationship, we stabilize. So we define this map from H. So we define this map from H cobordisms on M to H cobordisms on M times I. Intuitively, what this map is doing is it's taking W, so I've drawn a little cartoon here. Here's W, M, and N, boundary not pictured, and I'm multiplying it by the unit interval. I feel like every one of these vertical lines is a copy of W. Lines is a copy of W. Well, actually, no. That's not the right thing to do. Why not? I insisted that the cohort isn't meant to be trivial on the sides, right? And if you look at the two sides here, this thing here is a copy of W. That's not trivial. Okay, so I got to fix it by doing that. So instead, I take this band and I put it inside the larger square like that. So I have this band that looks like w times i. And I stick it in here. I have this shape down here. So I have a copy of m at every one of these points. So here I'm going to have m times, I don't know, whatever that shape is, but half pipe shape. And then up here, I'm going to have. And then up here, I'm going to have n times whatever this shape is, this half disk. So that gives us a way of stabilizing and getting a smooth manifold. Well, I also have to give a smooth structure along these two frontiers. So I do that by choosing a lower collar for W and an upper collar for W. It is tolerant to get that smooth structure. Equivalently, here's another question. Equivalently, here's another picture I can draw. So this one is more fan-shaped. So I have more of a film point here. And now I have a copy of W going along each of these lines. So in this one, this is W times I, but then I union along N times I with a single copy of N. So I take the top of that W times I, which is N times I, and I crunch it down to a single copy of N. And then down here again, I have M times. Here again, I have m times, I don't know, whatever the shape is, that shape. So of course I want these to be smooth because I'm working in the smooth category. So I make a choice of color. I actually want a color on the top and a color on the bottom. And that's enough to give me my smooth structure. My tooth structure. If the top of my cohortism looks like n times i, then this region here gets identified with n times a disk, n times a half disk. And so I can give it the smooth structure that comes from n and the half disk. If I choose a different color, I get a different smooth structure, but as you know, the space of colors is contractible. As you know, the space of colors is contractible, so I'm getting a contractable choice of suit structures. So we're going to want to find navalization comportism spaces, at least up to homotopy. I'm bringing that up because that'll be relevant for the functoriality discussion later. Okay, so anyway, we get these stabilization maps, and Yagusa proves that these stabilization maps are roughly. But these stabilization maps are roughly n over 3 connected, where n is the dimension of the nanohole. So if I define h infinity of m to be the co limit along these stabilization maps, notice, by the way, manifold with corners, right? So here we're not successively rounding the corners, we're just letting the corners be there. So if we take this code limit, then the mapping from the middle to this. And the mapping from M to this is highly connected. As the dimension of M gets big, that map gets more and more highly connected. Okay, so now that we've stabilized and we know what the stable range is, we can now state the version of this theorem that applies to the higher homotopy groups. This Waldhausen, Yarn, and Rogness. So, in this theorem, K-theory of a ring is replaced by Laldhausen's A-theory of the space. So, I won't define this at all in this talk, which is what you're supposed to think is this is a version of K-theory. This version of K-theory gets a map from stable homotopy of M. And I can form a fiber sequence where the third term here is white-headed diff. So, this appeared in Semel's talk earlier, yesterday. So, that's a fiber sequence. And then, furthermore, thinking of this as a spectrum, if I take its infinite loop space, okay, now I'm going to be bad here. I want to loop this one more time. I'm going to write it like that. Apologies. So, loop it one more time, loops infinity plus one. Then, this is the stable H coordinate space. And this is the stable H-cohortism space. So you should think of this as describing H-cohortisms in terms of algebraic A-theory. That's the mantra for this theorem. In particular, erasing a theorem, and I'm going to put it back again. So, in particular, on pi naught, pi naught of this 80 covor sub space. Okay, so on pi naught, I get h combordisms up to the amortism. That is pi naught of the space, at least if the dimension of m is high enough. So pi naught of the space becomes pi one of this spectrum, and that becomes the pi one of this cofiber, which the sequence splits. So pi naught of that becomes pi one. That becomes pi one of a of x, modulo pi one of stable element of the doing this thing where I replace comes by x's. There we go. They're all n. So the connected components of the space are pi one of that spectrum. That's pi one of this modulo pi one of that. In this low degree, pi one of A of x is just a one of the group rate. K1 of the group rate. And this is exactly a Z mod 2 and the abelianization of the fundamental group. So we recovered the S cobordism theorem from this. This is the theorem about the whole space of H cobordisms, and on pi naught, it's giving you the S cobordism theorem back. Question so far? That concludes the first part. That's the non-equivariant theory. Okay, so modern homotopy theorists have many jobs. One of the many jobs we have is that of a G prepender. Take an existing theory and add G to the front. So let's do that. I learned that from derived means from spectral speech. I'm a proud G prepender. Okay, so now let's do the equivariant theory. So now G is going to be a finite group. And now this group is going to be acting smoothly on my manifold M. So smoothly is enough to guarantee that the action is low. Is enough to guarantee that the action is locally linear, right? It's locally going to look like a representation. But since M is corners, I want to add a little extra assumption to that. So I want to assume that this action is locally. The manifold locally looks like G times over H is V times zero infinity to the K. So here, H is a subgroup of V, V is an H representation. Representation. So H is acting linearly on this vector space. And then the most important thing here is that on these corner coordinates, G is acting trivially. So in particular, if I have a corner like this, I am not permitting the G action to flip the corner directions around. It has to fix the corner directions and only act non-trivially in the directions that are normal to that. That's my standing assumption. I'm doing that because why am I even introducing corners in the first place? I want to have iterated stabilization maps, and that involves multiplying manifolds with boundaries. So if you think about it, if I take a product of G manifolds with boundary, I'll get a G manifold with corners, but it will always have this condition. When you have a boundary, the inward pointing direction isn't being moved by the G action. So if I multiply a bunch of those, I'm going to get a corner. Multiply a bunch of those, I'm going to get a corner with trivial g-action. But it's also super convenient to make this assumption. Like the fixed point submanifold is going to be neatly embedded, lots of other nice stuff. So that's what our corners look like. All right, so I'm going to be using a bunch of notation from equivariant theory. So let me just put it all up here at once. So if H is a subgroup, then MH is going to be the H fixed minus. Of m. So self-explanatory, right? These are the points that are fixed by the subgroup H. I'm going to let M lower H be the H stratum. So these are the points where the stabilizer of your point is exactly equal to H. If you are H fixed, then your stabilizer is some group that contains H, but it could be bigger. So X to the H. So x to the h is things that are fixed by h, x sub h is things that are fixed by exactly h. So I'm going to let wh do the normalizer mod h. This is the while group. And observe that the while group acts on the fixed points of my manifold, and it acts freely on that H value. If I'm in the normalizer. If I'm in the normalizer, I'm going to send fixed points back to fixed points. And if I'm in the stratum, then I'm fixed by exactly h. So once I mod out my h, the action is free. Okay. So now let's think of an equivariant map. So equivariant, of course, means it commutes with a group action. I'm going to say that such a map is isovariant. In addition to being equivariant, when I take any point that is fixed by exactly h, I get a point that's fixed by exactly h. So a map is isovariant if it is both equivariant and stratified. It's preserving the stratification by fixed point sets. And then in isovariant homotopy equivalence. It's exactly what you think it is, right? It's an isovariant map that has an isovariant inverse, and the homotopies to the identity are isovariant. So M goes to M, that's isovariant, that's isovariant. These homotopies are isovariant. All these things are all isovariant. Are all isovariant. That's a condition that's stronger than being an equivariant homotopy equivalence. In an equivariant map, a point that is less fixed can map to a point that is more fixed. So my strata are preserved. Okay, and then an equivariance or an isovariance H cobordism W on M. W on M is a G manifold with corners. Same conditions as before, same conditions on the boundary. Right, so there's that condition I mentioned at the beginning of the talk that along the bottom and the sides, it has to look like a trivial cobordism. So the only non-trivial part is you've built like you have a You've built, like, you have a, what's one of those pools that are in your backyard, right? The ones that are like stand-up pools, right? So you have the walls, the side. So the non-trivial part is the part where your kids are swimming in the middle. That's where you put your handles in. The same conditions on the boundary. And now if I look at the inclusion of the top and the bottom into W, these maps are equivariant, respectively, isovariant homotopy equivalences. Homotopy equivalences. So it's an equivariant H-cobordism if these are equivariant homotopy equivalences. It's an isovariant H-cobordism if they are isovariant homotopy equivalences. That's a stronger condition. So a trivial H-cobordism, in other words, m times high, is certainly an isovariant of H-cobordism. And an isovariant H-cobordism is certainly an equivariant H. cobordism. Isovariant is a stronger condition, so I could always forget it and just get an equivariant H-cobordism. Doing great. All right. Right, so you know, the point of the S-cobortism theorem is: I have something over here and I want to make it trivial, right? So hopefully it's Right, so hopefully, it's clear why we care about isovariant age comboisms. In order to make a trivial, at the very least, it has to be isovariant. So, this is a partial step towards making a trivial. You can actually go backwards here if M has a weak gap hypothesis. So, the weak gap hypothesis says. See this all right? This part of the board? Okay. So, the weak gap hypothesis says: if I have a non-trivial inclusion of fixed points, then the dimension of the bigger one is at least three plus the dimension of the smaller one. That's a weak gap hypothesis. So, when I step between fixed point strata, my dimension is going up by at least three. My dimension is going up by at least three each time. In case you're wondering what the strong gap hypothesis would be, that would be if the dimension doubles plus one every time you go between strata. So compared to that, this one's pretty loop. And I should say this is not for all maps of manifolds. This is for cobordisms. This is for a particular kind of map of manifolds. Under these hypotheses, you can go from equivalences on the fixed points to equivalences. On the fixed points to equivalences on strata, basically by looking at the normal bundles of the strata and saying, well, because this is the inclusion of the bottom of a cobordism, these normal bundles on W, I restrict them to M, and then the normal bundle on W is a pullback of the normal bundle on M. So I can get control over these links between the strata if I know how they interact on M. That's really convenient, though, right? So actually, as long as we have this gap hypothesis. As long as we have this gap hypothesis, we don't actually have two different kinds of cobords. It's just the same kind. Okay. Great. What's that? That's too many practice? Yeah, I thought about it. It's not a generic condition. Yes, I mean, does it happen frequently? Yeah, it happens pretty often in practice. In practice. But if you look at popular groups, you can also cross big enough representations. Yeah, actually, right. So if you have a manifold that doesn't have this hypothesis, you can cross it with a representation disk. And so long as the representation is big enough, you can make this happen. So actually, the first part of the talk, I did this non-equivariant theory, right? How are H coordinates classified? So when you equivariant theory, So, in the equivariant theory, I'm going to summarize what the theorems are before I give them. You can classify these. So, you can classify the equivariant H covortisms after stabilizing, so multiplying them by representation distance. If you multiply by a big enough representation, then we know how to classify them. We can classify at least a variant H covortals. We don't destabilize, but we do have. We don't have to stabilize, but we do have to assume the dimension is big enough, just like in the non-provarian case. So there's two theorems to this effect. The first one is Iraqi and Kawakubo. So this says that equivariant H combisms on M up to Up to so I want to do this up to stabilization, and I also want to do up to ditty work. Those are classified by the equivariant lighthead group. And this is a sum. I want to give myself more space for this expression. This is a sum over conjugacy classes of subgroups of the non-equivariant whitehead group. So I apply it to the fixed points and I take Fixed points, and I take the homotopy orbits of that by the while read. So if I allow myself to stabilize, then these are classified. Eric, is there a date on that? There is, but I don't know. Do you know, Mona? Maybe? Yeah. So the question is, yeah, is there a nice way to think about actually isovariant homotopy equivalence by thinking of these spaces as a functor of the orbital category? The orbit category to the calibration? Yes, so you have to subdivide the orbit category because for your isovariant homotopy type, it's not just about how the fixed point space includes into the larger space, but you have, think of CP. So you have like fixed points and you have free points, and you have this link between them, like a neighborhood of the fixed points and the free points. So you have a three-term diagram like that. And if you know that diagram, then you know the CP isovariant homotopy type. So yeah, so Sarah Eacle and M. Bar Klang and Sarah Yekel. Eagle and Embark Klang and Sari Eagle have written some papers recently about this in the abstract, studying isovarian homotopy type, generalizing earlier work by Dula and Schultz. Great. Thank you. Okay, so like I said, you know, the equivariant theory here is we want to classify these cobordisms. If they're equivariant and I stabilize, they're classified by this equivariant lighthead group. If they're isovariant, so this one is brouter. So, this one is Brouder, Quinn, and Rothenberg. And we don't have to stabilize, we just need the dimension to be big enough. So, if M has a weak gap hypothesis, and I want to assume that the dimension of every fixed point submanifold is at least five. Okay, then in that setting, the isovariant H-cohortisms, just modifying mortisms, are given by a sum of reconjugacy classes of subgroups of the Wethed group of the H stratum of M orbits by the Weyl group. So, as I mentioned earlier, the H stratum has a free action. So, this is Stratum has a free action. So, this is really the same as homotopy orbits. It's just I can take strict orbits and it's a manifold, and that's nice. So, we have these two theorems that are slightly different, right? One of them, the white hat groups split in both cases. And this one, I'm taking H fixed points, and I'm taking homotopy orbits by the Weyl group. And here, I'm taking the H strata, so it's slightly smaller space, and now the homotopy orbits are the same as strict orbits. Strict ordinance. All right. Actually, that second theorem is stronger, but the second implies the first. So you can observe this by saying if I have an equivariant H covortism, then multiplying by. And multiplying by a sufficiently big representation disk, I get the weak out hypothesis. And so if I stabilize, I get an isovariant H covortism. The thing that we were informally talking about a little earlier. So, an equivariant H-covortism up to stabilization becomes an isovariant one, and therefore it's And therefore, it's classified by this. The other observation, you might have noticed that these two expressions are not the same, right? So the other observation is if I take m times a disk and look at its H stratum, that is a map to the H fixed points. Here just M. This map becomes highly connected. Math becomes highly connected. Again, if the representation of B has sufficiently many non-trivial representations in it. So as a result, eventually it's an isomorphism on pi 1. And so these white head groups become the same group if you stabilize. So these things up to stabilization are the same as these up to stabilization, which is this up to stabilization. Which is this up to stabilization, and that becomes the same as that group. So you can deduce the equivariant classification from the isovariant level. Okay. So we're doing the equivariant theory. Oh, we got a question. I actually won't just be getting why the G of gamma and B is finite so that's does it because G is finite or does yeah throughout here G is finite. Yeah, throughout here, G is finite. Yeah, but so otherwise the theorem is like there is an isomorphism to white h of n, and there is some definition of white h, but you haven't given prior. Yep. I'd have to think about it. I've been focusing on the finite case, so let me not say anything and incriminate myself. Yep, I think they put this for compact meets their store. I mean, many of the strata compact. Okay, I'm just not going to claim that here because I'd have to go and check to be sure. Thanks. Okay, so where are we? I've been talking about H cobordisms. I've talked about how they were classified up to diffeumorphism by their torsion. And now I added some G's here because that's fun, right? And so now they're classified again by some kind of equivariant version, whitehead torsion. But there's a part of the story that's missing, which is, this is just the pi-naught statement, right? The pie dot statement, right? So, like, what about the space? What about space of equivariance or olive areant H cohorts loose? Is this classified somehow by some form of algebraic K-thereum? So, can a lot of So, in light of these considerations, I'm just going to focus on the isovariant case. So, I'm just going to let hg of m be isovariant h covortance on m defined in exactly the same way we defined it in the non-equivariant case. Okay, so what I would want out of this, what do I want? Out of this, what do I want? So let's go back to this Waufhausen-Yar and Rognis theorem. So I have this stable Hudism space. I have stable homotopy. I'm rewriting the fiber sequence by moving one step to the left. So I've got a fiber sequence like this. I'm blurring lines here. I'm really taking infinite loop space of those two spectra. Let's ignore that. Okay, so what I would want is if Okay, so what I would want is if I added in a G here, and let's change this into a U to emphasize that we're stabilizing using representation disks. I would want a fiber sequence like this, right? So what I want to do is make these into the G spectra that if I take their G fixed points, these are genuine fixed points. Can I get such a fiber sequence? That's the goal. That would be an equivariant or isovariant version of Waldhausen-Yauer-Rogness. Okay, so is this reasonable? Well, we know something about this. This is a theorem, this in theorem in equivariant stable negativity theory by Tungdeek. It says that this spectrum splits. It's actually a product over completes and classes of subgroups of suspects. Of suspension spectrum of the H fixed points, and then I take homotopy orbits by the Weyl group. So Mona and I also thought about this. So this is a result of Earling, that there is a way of making this into a genuine G spectrum. So that when I take the G fixed points of this, I also get a similar splitting. So I get a product of reconjugacy classes of subgroups of A theory. Subgroups of A theory of MAH, homotopy wild age ordinance. So each of those two terms splits. And it's kind of suggestive of what we want. Right, we want this space to split as well. But you took fixed points. Why don't you, you're also taking fixed points of the fiber. Yeah, so that would suggest that this should also be g fixed points of some genuine G object as well. Points of some genuine G object as well. And under that green, do you expect the map from the unfixed-pointed equivariant stable homo hobby into the variant A to split as G spectrum? No, the splitting should just be on the fixed points. Okay, so it's not going to split. Yeah. Yeah, so this, right, so this also suggests this should be the G-fixed points of some larger space as well. Fixed points of some larger space as well of non-equivariant cobordisms, where if you take something g-fixed, you get something equivariant. Oh, you mean this map of G-spectra? Yeah, I'm saying, is there a map from equivariant A, equivariant stable homotopy? You don't take fixed points. Is there a map going the other way? Just like in the Walthausen splitting theorem. There should be. There should be. There should be. We have not proven anything like that. We have not proven anything like that, but there should be. Yeah. Maybe addresses. All right. Let's put pressure on you. All of our greens are riding on you. All right. So this is all very suggestive, right? Like, what should I put here? I should put products over conjugacy classes of, again, I should do a non-equivariant thing, so just age coordinates of L. Cobortisms of MH on the tubio orbits by the wild roof action. And so, if we can prove that, then we do get such a fiber sequence. This is like if and only if. We can do this if and only if there's such a splitting. Is this reasonable? Well, yeah, I mean, right, look at the pi-0 statement. The pi-0 statement splits. So, this is reasonable. So that's our theorem. This is Goodwilly, and Guza, myself and Erling. Give myself some more room. So see other board. Let's make a little portal here. Pop into the portal, come out over here. Here we are. Okay, we're still in the theorem. So if the dimension of these fixed-point spaces is at least five, then the space of isovariant H-covortisms, that's the space, has a splitting into non-equivariant spaces. Of H cobordisms. And the form here, it's going to look like the Browner, Quinn, and Rothenberg theorem. So I'm going to take the H stratum of M and take its orbits. And that way I have a manifold. Non-compact, but don't worry so much about that. You can compactify it. Okay, so the theorem is that this space of isovariant H-cobordisms splits apart into these non-equivariant H-cobordism spaces. Okay, and then I stable it. Okay, and then I stabilize, so I multiply by these disks. So I get the stabilized space. This equivalence passes through the stabilization. On the side, if I take these M's and I keep If I take these m's and I keep multiplying my representation disks by this theorem over here, that h stratum eventually turns into h fixed points. And so I get exactly the term that I want. Okay, so that's the theorem, the space of isovariant H cobordism splits. In particular, on pi naught, this recovers the Browder, Linn and Rothenberg theorem. Recovers the Bradder-Winn and Rothenberg theorem. And so, therefore, also recovers the theorem of Araki and Kavakubo and Pi naught. So, this is a space-level statement that on PI naught is recovering our earlier group-level statements. So, that's the equivariant theory. So, I want to say a little bit about how you prove this, and then a little bit about punctoriality, which is kind of a thorny issue that comes up as you're proving this. So for the proof, I want to return to the stabilization map that I mentioned earlier in the talk from H of M to H of M cross I. Right, so remember, this was the map where you took W and then you went. You and then you went right that map. So this map generalizes. I kind of snuck in a generalization already where I multiply by a representation disk, but it generalizes even more. I can take any smooth embedding and I get out of that a map of H covortes new spaces. And furthermore, this is a functor. So, not only does it give maps, but it respects compositions. But we're going to do this a little bit later because this is kind of the part where things get a little thorny. Doesn't that require you to choose a tubular neighborhood to do it? I mean, if I remember correctly, yep, yep. So, actually, yeah, so what's wrong? So, actually, yeah, so let's draw the picture of it. So, here's M0, a manifold with corners. And let's assume that it's sitting inside some larger manifold M1. And furthermore, M0 has over it an H cobordism, W naught. So there's my H cobortism. Same conditions as before, so along the sides and along the bottom, it's trivial, like that. Like that. Okay, then I also have to pick a tubular neighborhood here. So I also pick a disk of the normal bundle that's embedded inside. So now what is this? So this is an H cobortism on M0. How do I produce one on M1? Part is fun. Okay, so what you do is you kind of do the picture. Because you kind of do the picture we were doing before. I take my H covortism and swing it around. But now I'm taking this whole H covortism and swinging it like that. So this space is W naught fiber product over M naught with D of μ naught. And then again, I'm opposing some relation because I'm gluing the whole top together. Gluing the whole top together. So that's the non-trivial part. So each of these slices is a copy of W. Then I fill in below with something trivial. So I fill in below here with something trivial. Now I have a cobortism that's trivial along the bottom and all the sides. It's trivial all the way over on this side and all the way over on that side and along these edges. You kind of see this and convince yourself that it's true. And so now, And so now, if L1 is this larger space, I can now just extend this to a trivial cobordism on the rest of M1. Like that. That's a way of defining the stabilization. Again, smooth structure, you're choosing a color along the top of W to get the smooth structure along that along the Smooth structure along that binding, along that crease. Okay, so once you know you can do this, you take your G manifold and you cut it up into concactified strata. So I let M lower brackets H be the H fixed points, and now I take out, I don't just take out MK, but I take out a two. Take out mk, but I take out a 2b to the neighborhood of mk for all of the smaller fixed point submanifolds inside. So here in the middle I have m lower brackets g that's just mg. But then if this is mh, then m lower brackets h is going to be just this part. So I basically took MH, but I took out a tubular neighborhood of the smaller fixed points. Then again, I take out a tubular neighborhood of this, and then all of the rest, all of this part. And notice again that corners are naturally occurring here as I'm doing this. All of that there is m brackets one. Okay, so I'm cutting the manifold up into compacted by strata. So now that's good because now if I take the union of these, that's a compact manifold, and it has a smooth embedding back into M just by the identity bound. And so now we can hit that with this H cobordism functor. Take H cobortisms on that whole space, and that maps to H cobortisms on M. That's the construction of the map. So now it just remains to simplify that left-hand side and see that it simplifies to this, and to prove that the map is an equivalence. And I will boot on both of those because we're almost out of time. But basically, you can separate this into pieces. You can separate this into pieces, this becomes a product, and you reduce down to H cobortisms on a manifold with a free action. Once you have a free action, you can just take orbits by that action. H-cobordisms on a free G-manifold are the same thing as H-cobordisms on the orbit manifold. So you cut up into pieces, and then those reduced to orbit spaces. You prove this by a kind of induction on the strata. So you get fiber sequences, and you use the fact that this map exists. And you use the fact that this map exists to split those fiber sequences. The proof is a little complicated because the third term in the fiber sequence has multiple components, so there are multiple fibers. So you have to actually do some wrangling to prove that the fibers are equivalent to what you want. And that wrangling is exactly where the dimension assumption shows up. We need cobordisms to have negatives. Is it false without a dimension assumption? Assumption? Is it false that you don't assume that? I'm not sure. Because, yeah, I guess, I mean, I'm reducing to the non-equivariant H-covordison theorem. I'm not asserting that this is classified by whitehead torsion. So maybe it's possible that with more cleverness, you could get around that. Okay, great. I have about 10 minutes left. Other questions? Yeah, John. It seems that you never have to use. Have to use the fact that there is an equivariant or slash equivalent stability range. It falls out of the theorem that there's a stability range in these places, right? Exactly. You get the stability range from this, from the operating system. Using the usual, I should emphasize, right, this line here is an unstable result, right? This is about the unstabilized space, and then you can stabilize it. And then you can stabilize it and get the one that will be related to algebraic K-theory. All right. So thanks for listening so far. So with my last bit of time, I want to talk about one issue that shows up as you try to do this carefully. It's the issue of this being a functor. So, in order for this to work, defining the map is fine, but in order to get this to commute with stabilizations, the reason why these maps commute with the stabilizations is because the stabilizations are also applying the H-combortism functor to an embedded. So, you're commuting the two things past each other. So, this boils down to proving a statement to the effect of if I have m0 into Effect of if I have m0 into m1 into m2, each cobordisms on m0 defined these maps. Maybe they rely on contractible choices, so defined contractable spaces of maps. But there's this issue that I need to make sure I know how to fill in this two step. I need to prove that those maps agree, or failing that, at least give some choice of homotopy between them. So, what goes on here? So, I'll just draw a Goes on here. So, I'll just draw a really simple picture just to illustrate the idea. So, I have just a single cobordism here. I'm going to stabilize it once. So I'm going to draw the stabilization kind of slanted like this. But this is the stabilization from before. I'm taping W and I'm scrolling it around like that. Okay, so now I've stabilized from, say, a point to a line. Now I want to stabilize from a line. That I want to stabilize from a line to a square. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to take this covortism that I've already defined here. This is the circle opposite W like that. And now I'm going to swing that door. I'm going to swing that door along this hinge, right? So it's going to get messy. I'm going to swing this. So, I'm going to swing this door along the hinge, and what I'm going to end up getting is a half ball with copies of W lying along every ray coming out from the center. Okay, so if you stare at that, and everything below this ball is trivial, so who cares about that? If you stare at that, that looks like the same as if I stabilized all at once. Right, so I included one point to the square, so I have a two-dimensional norm. To the square, so I have a two-dimensional normal bundle, and I'm taking fiber product of W with a disc now. So I'm swinging it all the way around. Great. So that is why you have a two-cell. Except, what about the smooth structure? Right, so the smooth structure here, I get by choosing a color here. That gives me a smooth structure here. Then I choose another color here. Let's make the colors blue. And that gives me the smooth structure. And that gives me the smooth structure kind of in a neighborhood of this hinge. So the problem that arises is that the smooth structures don't agree. They are only isotopic. So it's a bit of a technical problem. Technical problem, but an important one because to define a functor up to homotopy, right? To define an infinity functor, I have to actually have two cells. It's not enough to just have that map and that map. I have to have some way of controlling the way that they're related and ideally have it controlled in a way that then when I have higher coherences, I can fill in the higher cells as well. So, this creates a non-trivial problem, and the most naive A non-trivial problem, and the most naive solution to it doesn't work. So, if you just choose colors, there isn't really a canonical way to choose this color and this color so that the smooth structure I'm getting here is the smooth structure that I get by stabilizing all at once. Okay, so the problem really is to describe those H covortises. This H-coverism space as an infinity functor. In other words, as a homotopy-coherent functor. And the problem is really something that you start to encounter not so much with the zero cells and one cells, but with the two cells. Like what framework do you use to keep track of this homotopy so that you can make things coherent? So I should mention Malta Peber's thesis. We tackled this problem for pseudo-isotopies, but that's very similar to this. But that's very similar to this. And in the non-equivariant case. And so it turns out, tackling this very directly, things get very complicated. So we wanted to do this for G manifolds. This is in the case of G because one. So we wanted to do this for G manifolds, but we started by going through this thesis and it was kind of slow going. It's very complicated stuff. And so our goal was to try to simplify or clean this up. Simplify or clean this up or make this painless. Find some way of setting things up so that the things just naturally cohere with each other and you don't have to artificially define these contractible spaces and use obstruction theory or something to show you can fill the cells. It turns out you can. If you approach this in just the right way, you can make this functoriality relatively painless. So there's a couple of key ideas. Those are the last things I want to. Ideas. Those are the last things I want to share with you. I think they're pretty cool. So you want to use the following ideas. So the first one is instead of choosing colors to find the smooth structure, you want to choose a meter structure. So by that, I mean a g times z mod two equivariant so you can structure. Up here on the double of W along N. So take W and double it along its top, not its bottom. That's a little surprising. So this already has a smooth structure there and there. Choose a smooth structure in the middle that extends it. This choice of smooth structure gives you a privileged equivalence class of colors. Specifically, those colors, where's my color chalk? Specifically, those colors that when I double them, the bicolor is smooth in the chosen smooth structure. That's what we mean by the mirror structure. So, by some miracle involving some calculus, every color in this equivalence class gets the same smooth structure. So, once you have Smooth structure. So once you have this, you get a unique smooth structure on stabilization. So therefore, if we work with these mirror structures, these equivalence classes of colors, instead of the colors directly, then we get well-defined smooth structure, and the stabilization inherits a well-defined mirror structure again. And now we're in business. So now we can start. And now we're in business. So now we can start to easily compose these. And smooth structures line up exactly, so we don't have to define isotopies between them. That's one of the ideas. There's a question in the chat whether it's the same as using smooth normal fields as an all-calculation manifold for those paper. It's the same as using smooth normal fields. I'd have to think about that. I don't remember what the smooth normal fields are. If it's equivalent to this, then yes, right? The point is that it's not just one vector field, right? It's an equivalence class of vector fields. So I'm taking groups of those normal fields and grouping them together. So that makes me think that maybe not, but I have to go back and think about that a little bit. Okay, so the second idea is: so this pertains to the normal bundle. There's a problem that arises when we compose beads and banks. So you can think of this as a vector bundle. That's like what a sane person could do. But it turns out that, kind of like the problem with colors, this creates a problem. This creates a problem. So, when I use this contractible space, things don't nicely compose. I want to replace it with this contractible space. Similarly, over here, instead of thinking of this as a vector bundle, I want to think of it as something called a round bundle. So, a round bundle is just a bundle whose fiber is the disc, and whose structure group is dithyomorphisms of the disc. Orpisons of the district have preserved the distance to the origin. So not the full group of bifeomorphisms, but this subgroup. And this group is homotopy equivalent to the orthogonal group. So studying these round bundles is essentially the same thing as studying vector bundles. Like in this thing, I'm replacing one contractible choice with another. But round bundles. Other. But round bundles have a feature that vector bundles don't, which is that when you compose a round bundle with a round bundle, you can shave off the corners of the result, and what you get is canonically a round bundle again. Vector bundles don't have this property. If I compose a vector bundle with another vector bundle, the composite is not a vector bundle. So thinking of it this way, we get a notion of two-builer neighborhood that respects composition. Neighborhood that respects composition along these embeddings in a canonical way. Not just up to some choice of isomorphism that we then have to keep track of or build into the higher simplicities of some siegel space. It's just canonically. So what you end up getting out of this at the end is: I'll just summarize what happens, you end up building this map of You end up building this map of siegel spaces. That is the left vibration. And so by the version of straightening, unstraightening, De Pedro actually wrote a paper about left vibrations in this particular setting. There's a straightening unstraightening theorem that then says this gives you a functor from manifolds to spaces. But what these tricks do is. But what these tricks do is when I'm actually defining these Siegel spaces, instead of having to give some definition for all the simplicies, I end up being able to define these by taking the nerve of a category. So this H and M actually become simplical categories. Their composition is strictly associative as a result of using both of these tricks. Results of using both of these tricks. And so that is, that is how we deliver on this promise of making this as painless as possible. This eliminates the need to think explicitly about a lot of the higher selves. Okay, that's all I want to say. Thanks. Any questions? You made it sound like it's more or less story about the speech structures in the comprehensive that you get. So, topologically, would it be much easier? Yeah, I think the issue with the smooth, this is really just an issue with the smooth category, that making topological or PLH combortisms functorial isn't hard. Yeah, I mean, that is a good idea. And by the way, do you have the double note to this? Excuse me. Oh, about this splitting. In the topological category, it doesn't split. That's even on the level of high zero, it doesn't split. Split. Yeah, that'd be. I'd have to think about that a little more. It's a good idea. Compare how painless that is against how painless this is. Which one is it seeds at being more painless? Or nature cobordism because you don't have stability. So, you know, you have to smooth the bottom and you have to smooth the top. You have to smooth the middle and they have to be compatible with each other. No, no, no, but somewhere I think that you use that kind of sensibility back crossing just with a trivial application. Okay. Yeah, I mean, this is a cool idea. Like, let's talk about it a little bit more so I can see what goes into it. Yep. Some applications of the covariant data portal. Oh, well, I mean, the same applications as the not application. Well, I mean, the same applications as the non-equivariant one. If you equivariant one correctness, that isn't correct, right? I mean, so I mean, you can have, there are manifolds that are equivariantly homotopy equivalent to a sphere with a linear action that are not difficult and with an infinite number of them and blah blah blah. So it's sort of true. I mean, they would be twisted doubles. True. I mean, they would be twisted doubles, but then it still doesn't look like a Poincare conjecture, but something could fit. I was going to say something more basic, which is if you have a cobordism and you can trivialize it, then it's giving you a diffeomorphism between the top and the bottom. So, but as you're indicating, the equivariant case is more complicated than the non-equivariant case. In the splitting on stable homotopia. So I'm wondering whether there's a human. Ooh, yeah. I mean, somehow stable homotopy, you have a lot more maps you can work with compared to the geometric setting. But I mean, the idea would be to somehow boil away everything other than a certain isotropy. That's an interesting idea. That's an interesting idea. I don't have an answer for you right now. Is there an equivariant GMO that equivariant? There is. Tom and Kiyoshi were working on that actually. And actually, that was their motivation for wanting to work on this as well. So I kind of emphasize more Mona and I, the motivation that we had coming into it, but they had their own nefarious schemes and reasons for wanting to prove. And reasons for wanting to agree with those. More questions? No, put a question on Sankara. What are you doing?
