To let me speak here. So, I want to talk about a new result that I obtained with my supervisor, Seban Vaz, about super-rigidity for groups which are not ICC, so whose group phenomenologicals are not factors. So, let me go back actually to Stefan's presentation, because that's the starting point, where he talked about this result about super rigidity for groups. For groups equipped with a token cycle twist, right? So, for these twisted group phenomenon, for these, that's right, three product groups, the twisted group phenomenon completely remember the group and the twist. Okay, so how would you now get to groups with center? Well, the idea is to look at central extensions. Because what happens if you just take any central extension like this with Any central extension like this with countable groups, of course, would see an infinite abelian group. Then, of course, you can always identify L of C with the infinity functions on the dual. And then, if you take any character of the dual, composing it with the Tucson cycle corresponding to the central extension gives you actually a scalar touchocycle. And that allows you to make the observation that this group. Observation that this group von Hermannage about the central extension is actually a direct integral of twisted group von Hermannage plus over the group G. So now of course the idea is if we take G as in our theorem A then these twisted group point algebras remember the group and the twist and we should get some rigidity. So the precise result that we were able to prove is the following. So we take groups G, which are again Take groups G, which are again left-right lead product groups. The groups gamma are still in class C, but they're a little bit more restrictive for some technical reasons. But they're basically free products of C with Z, and C is just a subgring of Q generated by some products. So for such groups G, you can You can find infinitely many different central extensions that are W star subrigit in executive setting, the sense that the group polynomial algebra completely remembers the group. Alright. So let me remark also that while this C is not the whole of Q at least, there are also infinitely many central extensions that are not W source. WSOUS. Alright. So let me say a few words how you could hope to prove this. So let's start with an isomorphism with our L of G tilde with a mystery group, L of lambda. So the first step is definitely to show that this lambda itself must also be a central extension. So this takes some work, but of course once you have done that, also L of lambda is a direct integral. Direct integral of two situations fundamental. And by our isomorphism, this direct integral is, of course, equal to our original direct integral. And then, okay, you don't get to compare these two direct integrals, these two just with Fonneman Cross on the nose, but after taking like a non-negligible subset and a non-singular isomorphism, okay, you do have an isomorphism of just twisted. An isomorphism of just twisted group phonemic modules. And now we can apply the theorem. So we have an isomorphism for twisted group phonemic modulus, which gives you an isomorphism of the groups with the twists. But you're not done, of course, because we merely have an isomorphism of these groups at the left end, right, this G and lambda zero, and of these scalar two cycles. And this you still need to somehow lift to really Somehow, lift to really get an isomorphism of the center, which gives you a cohomology between the two cycles corresponding to the central extension. And that's actually where these kind of restrictions on the groups gamma that I talked about came in. So for some specific groups gamma, then we can analyze these two cohomology of these groups G with values in the group C more carefully. That you could see more carefully, and also this map, and that allows you to improve the theory. And that's all I have to say as well.
