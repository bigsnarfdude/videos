Yes, we do. Yes, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's my great pleasure to introduce the third talk. It comes from Professor Oliver Baikrit from Sobang University. The title of his talk is curved. Curved discrete series. Let's welcome. Okay, so thank you very much for the invitation. It's good to see you all at least online. And well, certainly it will be a pleasure another time to come in person in China and to participate to physical meeting. So this work I want to talk about is the work, joint work with Robin Grammar. We have done this work some time ago already, but well actually we have not written the paper yet. But I quite like this work and so I thought it's a good idea to give this talk and maybe it will be an impulse for us to really write down. For us to really write down the paper. So, let me begin with conformally compact Einstein manifolds. We have heard a lot about this during this meeting. So, they relate conformal geometry with Riemannian geometry. Is Riemannian geometry. And this is a construction originated in Ferrarmann and Gramm work. So you start from a principle, you start from a conformable manifold, x, dimension n minus one, and you want to fill in by an Einstein. By an Einstein manifold, which is conformably compact. So that means that near the boundary, so near X, which is the boundary of M, so you have a defining function X and G must look like the hyperbolic metric, the X square plus gamma over X square. Well, of course, there is a whole development. Development of Effermann and Gran that you can write. So it's one over x square and it's dis2. You have the gamma, which is the first term, and then you have x2, gamma 2, plus etc. You have a whole development here. Okay, so the standard So the standard example is of course real epic space, so real epoch ball if you want, with isometric group SO1N. And its boundary is a conformal sphere, which you can write as SO1N over a parabolic group. Or if you make some choice, you can write it as SON mod SON minus 1. And so the whole idea of this correspondence is to construct Construct conformal invariants of the boundary from Riemannian invariants of the interior. For example, in this week, we heard several times about GGMS operators, which are obtained in this way from GGMS are conformal invariant operators that you obtain from certain Laplacians on the Riemannian side. And so what I want to emphasize today is that To emphasize today is that well, on the control side, there are the well-known BGG operators, so a whole series of control invariant operators. And what I want to explain is that they are related to Dirac operators in the entire, actually, so twisted Dirac operators. Okay, so So this idea came from reading the Attier Schmidt construction of this fat cell. So that's old construction. So let me explain here just for the orthogonal group, SO1 to N, but it works for all groups. So you take So you take representation of SO2N. So representation of SO2N is parametrized by a dominant integral weight of SO2N. So this is an enuple of numbers. Well, it's integral, so this enuple must be made of integers or of half integers. integrals and it must be dominant dominant weight which means that it's decreasing like this so such Henupel parametrizes the representation of SO2N and this gives a homogeneous vector bundle on for example the real hyperbolic space. The representation of SO2n here gives a vector bundle homogeneous A vector bundle homogeneous and hyperbolic space. So, of course, we have all the classical bundles, they all arise in this way. If you take the standard representation, the weight is just one, zero, zero, you get the tangent bundle. If you take all weights to be one half, you get positive spinners. And if you take all weights to be one half except the last one, minus one half, you get the One minus one half, you get the negative spinner, and of course, you have the Clifford multiplications. That's a tangent vector acts by Clifford multiplication on spinners and exchanges positive and negative spinners. And the dark operator, so you twist, when I write like this, it's I should have said it's a ton. I should have said it's a tensor product, of course. It's S tensor V lambda. So you consider spinners twisted by V lambda, this homogeneous bundle, you apply the covariant derivative, so you arrive to the tangent bundle getting in, and then you cliff on multiply and you come back to the same bundle. This is a Dirac operate. Twisted. Twisted dark operator, and this dirt operator exchanges positive and negative spairs. And the observation of Attia and Schmidt is the following. You consider the L2 kernel of this Dirac operator. So call it H lambda. And well, it follows from an application of Fatia's gamma index theorem. As a gamma index theorem that, well, this is not zero. So it's unit, it's, of course, it's a Hilbert space. So it's a non-zero unitary representation of SO1 to n, because of course the group of isometries, all this is natural, so the group of isometries of hyperbolic space acts on this. On this. And at the end speed proven, yes, I should have said this is not for all representation. You need what's called a strictly dominant weight. That is, you need the lambda n to be strictly positive. So what Attienchwid proved is that when you take all the collection of all these representations for all possible representations of SO2N. Representations of SO2N, so for all possible lambdas, well, this gives a construction of all the discrete series of SON to L. So that's, you know, that's representation which represents the discrete part in the general Planchet formula. And so it's a very nice geometric construction of the discrete series. So the simplest example, so if I want strictly dominant, so lambda n must be strictly positive. So the simplest example is to take all the coefficients to be one half. So the V lambda is the representation is a positive spinner, S plus. And then, so you're when you twist so that you consider S tensor S plus. tensor S plus. Well it's well known that you know the square of the spinar bundle is the X terrier algebra and you get basically the well in the Durham complex the D plus D star operator and so written in this way it goes from even forms to odd forms and you just take some self-dual part inside. side and it turns out that the then the this head series is exactly the space of L2 harmonic safe dual n-form that's middle degree form to try know that for any conformally compact n-time manifold this space is infinite dimensional So it's the simplest example of the discrete service. Okay. Any questions so far? No? So now let's pass to BGG sequences. So BGG is at Bernstein, Gelfand, Gelfand. And it's a celebrated construction of CHAP, Flovac, and Souchek that you can construct BDG operators in the curved case. There were other constructions also around the same time, especially by Calderbank and Diemer. So I write it, just write it down. Just write it down. I write it in the following way. So the boundary sphere is this quotient SO2N over SO2N minus 1. Again, the representation of SO2N minus 1, so it's rank n minus 1. So you have only N minus 1 numbers. So it's the same rule. It's again all integers of half integers to get an integral weight. This gives a This gives a homogeneous vector bundle on the sphere. And so the construction of the BG sequences is the following, but it's not the construction, it's what the result is. You start from a representation of SO2N like before. So given by n up lambda, dominant integral weight. Dominant integral weight. And the BG sequence, it's an old sequence which starts with this bundle. So it's a game with the coefficient lambda i. In the first bundle, you forget the lambda one because you on the sphere you need only n minus one coefficients to describe the bundle. And the second bundle. The bundle and the second bundle you forget the lambda two, but the lambda one is here. The first place you put the lambda plus one, here next you replace the lambda three by lambda two plus one, etc. And there are natural operators between all these bundles. You arrive at the middle where all the coefficients are lambda one plus one, etc. lambda n minus one plus one. Plus one, etc. Then there is a middle PGG operator, which is a bit special because it goes to the same bundle, and then you go back to the initial bundle. So while I have not exactly described the BGG sequence here, because all these operators are conformally invariant, I have not described the conformal invariant. Because if I want to describe the conformal invariant, actually I need to consider not representation of SO2N minus 1, but Of SO2N minus 1, but representation of the parable group. And then you can see the weight which gives the control weights of all these bundles. So the simplest example, again, you just take lambda equals zero. And then this is the first one you see is a trivial bundle. It's R. This one is 1, 0, 0, it's 1 form. This is 1, 1, 0, 0, it's 2. This is 1, 1, 0, 0, it's two forms, etc., and you get exactly the Darn complex. The Darn complex is the first example of a BGG sequence. Okay, so the claim now, the claim is that there is kind of correspondence between the Between the Dirac operators that appear in this crazy series, so on the twisted Dirac operators, on spinners tensored by some P lambda, and the BGD sequences on the boundary for a weight which is shifted, so you maybe have not said that, sigma is the weight for the spinners. So one half here we go. So there is a shift, which is normal because here I asked the lambda to be strictly dominant and here I ask it to be only dominant and the shift is exactly this. So there is exactly a correspondence between the parameters. So a vague form of the theorem is the following. Is the following you take any conformally compact Einstein manifold M of dimension 2n this is for even dimensions you don't have discernites in odd dimensions and with conformal boundary X gamma X gamma. So all this is local. So actually you don't need a complete conformally compact Einstein metric, you just need the formal development near the boundary. Then there is a construction of all these curved BGG operators on the boundary as obstructions to solving all the range type. Granstein manifold, so near the boundary, the equation ds equals zero. This means you start from some s which is in one of these spaces of the BGG sequence. So this gives some value at infinity for the Dirac operator, and you want to extend this value to a solution of ds equals zero. And it turns out that you cannot always do that. You cannot always do that. There are attractions. And from this abstraction, you get exactly, you can get the construction of the BGG operators. So it's kind of geometric way to see these BGG operators, or rising, as obstructions to solving the Dirac equation. On the conformally compact metric. Okay, so the most obvious example is the following. So the two simplest examples, they do correspond. We have seen that If I take the weights which corresponds to the spinners here, I just get basically the Durang complex and the discrete series that half degree self-dual forms L2. And when I shift the weight by sigma, so this corresponds to zero, so the BGG sequence is the Durham complex. And indeed, Indeed, it's obvious that, well, if you take half degree form, self-dual and harmonic, so that is closed for a self-dual form. Then the restriction to the boundary is just taking the pullback to the boundary, and of course it has to be closed. And D is a BGG operator. And D is the BGG operator. And conversely, of course, if you are given the boundary value, which is the n-form on the boundary, of course, you need it to be closed in order to be able to solve this equation in the entire. Okay, so it's clear, at least on the discrete series, here, what is What is the relation, and you can do this, of course, with forms of any degree, not only with half-degree forms, so not only with the forms which appear in the discrete set. A more complicated example, which I like quite a lot, it's dimension form. So let's see let's say we are on the on the high public ball. On the high public ball, the representation is S3 plus, that's the third symmetric product of S plus. If you don't know what it is exactly, it's not important. The only thing which is important is that the discrete series is made of harmonic L2 tensors of type V plus. So the same type of tensors of So the same type of tensors as a value plus. So this is the descriptor. And so if you look what we have on the other side, on the conformal side, it turns out that it is a deformation complex for the conformal metric. So the first operator here is the lead derivative. The second operator The second operator, so it's between trace-free symmetrical tensors, it's the differential of the Cotton York tensor. And finally, the last operator is blank. So, you see, the this is an example where the orders of the visual pointer are not one. Here it's one, but the middle one is three. And Okay, so what I say is that if you have harmonic tensors, harmonic tensor of type W, sorry, harmonic tensor of type W plus, then it says actually in X3. So you have a top order term, W top, and it is in W top times X3. It's easy times x3 plus lower order terms. So if I consider the top order term, turns out that the top order term lies in this part of the BGG sequence, always the piece which is after the middle operator. And well, it has to be in the kernel of the Blancie operator. And this will be in general the general interpretation of the operator which is just after the middle BGG operator. It is the obstruction that the boundary term of the element of the decrease series must satisfy. So here we've seen an example where it's order one, but in general the order can be very high. So well, so it's from So, well, so this formula is in terms of the lambdas, it's some den minus one, minus round plus one. So, this came a bit as a surprise for us to have an order one operator, the arc operator, to generate obstruction of arbitrarily high order. So, this is for this BDG operator. So, what about the Operator, so what about the middle BGG operator? Where do we see it? Okay, so there is some, so this is the next theorem is valid only for the model, only for the high public space. Somehow you take high public space, you take one of the different series, so you have the boundary. have the boundary sphere uh you take an element in the disfactor series s so which satisfies this equation ds equals zero and so as before you there is some top order term which leaves in this space for the bdg operator after the middle which is in the kernel of this bg operator so dn minus one here So dn minus one here, it is a middle B D G operator. This is a middle B D G so we we have D N minus one which goes from E n minus one set to E n and so the S top the top order term is in E n here. In n here, and what I say is that there is an isometry, so the L2 norm of the S of the spinner, you can calculate at the boundary as, well, you take this dn minus one or minus one half, so it's a pseudo differential operator, you apply a stop order term of s and you take the L2 norm. So this gives an isometry. So this gives an isometry between L2, well the discrete series actually with L2 norm, and the space of top order terms in some negative subolet space. So H minus lambda n, because we will see the middle BGG is order 2 lambda n. So the middle BGG, from this point of view, it has a very clear meaning. Well, let me pass maybe very quickly on this. You can write it very easily on the two examples which I wrote. Well, maybe it's first I detail slightly the first example because it's clear what's happening on firms. Well, you're on forms, F is S. F is S. So this is the first example. S is an end form which is self-dual and which is harmonic. So for self-dual form, it's equivalent to just being closed. And well, you're just on the ball. So of course you can write S equals d alpha for some alpha. And then you write And then you write the norm of S square as the norm of S wedge S because S is self-dual, but this is the alpha wedge S. So we are on the whole hypocrite space. But now S is closer. So this is an integral on the boundary. Oh, we are on H2 and so we are on the boundary. And well, this is exactly the same as this formula. Because in some sense, you can write that alpha is d minus 1s, since I have d alpha equals s. alpha equals S. Okay, so it's a standard formula for forms, but it turns out that it's true in general. Okay, so okay, another point which I would like to underline is that there are That there are dual discrete series. So let me explain this. So we have seen the discrete series are in this space S plus V lambda. So it turns out that this tensor product, this is a tensor product, you can decompose it as a sub of irreducible orientation. And of course, one of the pieces is the eigest weight piece where you add the weights of S plus and of V lambda. So you have one irreducible piece inside, which is V of lambda plus sigma. So V lambda one plus one half, etc., up to lambda n plus one half. And it turns out this was proved by Atias Schmidt already in the hyper public space that the discrete series lies entirely So the discrete series lies entirely in this component, not in other components. So the elements of the discrete series, they are all in this component. Basically, it's a right-hand-block formula to kill the other components. It's a complicated right-hand-bog formula on the square of the Dirac operator. And you can show that there is no kernel for the Dirac operator in the other components. The only components where you have a kernel. Where you have a kernel, you can have a kernel in this one, and then you can consider the dual series, which, well, you take the same coefficients, but except that the last one you take the opposite. Geometrically, it just corresponds to changing the orientation. So, on forms, it corresponds to considering anti-sell forms instead of. Anti-self-dole formed instead of self-dual formed. And so there is a dark operator here also, and there is a well-to-count. And it's from the point of view of these SOAs, it's the same because they are exchanged by the group SO1 to L. But if you think from a more geometric perspective, it's not the same because we know on the It's not the same because we know on real carbonic space, for example, Paul, we have self-dolphant and we have anti-self-dolfant. And so, what is the relation? So, between these two spaces, so again, let me rewrite the BGG sequence, the middle, you have the middle BGG operator here, followed by this operator. So, this operator gives the obstruction to boundary value. To boundary value of a different series, and this is the middle BG. So, the middle, the boundary value, the top order terms of this element of the discrete series, they live in this EL and they live in the kernel of this DA. So, this is the space where the boundary values of these cases can lie. And well, I claim there is an orthogonal decomposition into the top-order terms of the discrete series and the top order terms of the dual discrete series. So again, it's something which is well known for forms, but it's true for Known for forms, but it's true for all these spaces. And in particular, the top order terms, the boundary values of disk series, it's not the whole kernel of the BDG operator. It's only a half-dimensional, in some sense, half-dimensional subspace. Subspace. Okay, so this is something, well, okay, let me say this quickly, but it's related to some problem which I solved, which I studied a long time ago, which is a positive frequency theorem on Zelda-Einstein matrix on the four-ball. You consider on the boundary. On the boundary of the four ball, so this deformation complex with a cotton york. So, if you apply what I've just said, you see that here you have the discrete series that the boundary values of harmonic tensors of type W plus. So, they decompose into some H plus plus H minus. Here, well, the dual discretion is that harmonic tensors of type. discuss theory that's harmonic tensors of type w minus to the what i wrote here and uh it turns out that the first space here well it's a deformation complex it corresponds to boundary values of matrix so well that's actually conformal matrix on the boundary so infinitesimally of course and so well the image of the the first one so this is cage it's not important So, this is gauge. It's not important. So, if I quotient all infinitesimal control metric on transfer here by the image of the gauge, well, I know that since the BGG on the model of the BGG sequence is complex and it's exact, so this is isomorphic to the kernel of D2. And so you can decompose this. This space here into two spaces, which are sent by the BDG operator, so the differential of Cotonou, to H plus and H minus. And it turns out that these two spaces are correspond exactly to the boundary values of self-dual or anti-self-dual Einstein matrix in the book. So this was a question asked by LeBron. A question asked by Lebran a long time ago. I explored this theorem. And there was some later work by Robin, actually, more from this, precisely from this perspective. And also, I think some, and then much later, some other work on the same problem by Joel Fine and collaborators. Okay, so let me enter a bit in the details of the techniques, what is involved here, because it's quite a complicated algebra. So I'm going to go ahead and do If I start from some bundle, on high public space, on the boundary, of course it decomposes further because you have one privileged direction, which is a normal direction, so which gives you SO2 to decompose the bundle. So even if you have an irreducible bundle on the hyperbolic space, it decomposes. Hyperbolic space decomposes on the boundary into bundles indexed by the sub-orbitizations of lambda for the group SO2N minus. So the rule is the following. You decompose the sum of P lambda prime and lambda prime, so it has to be a dominant integral, dominant rate rise of n minus one. And the one which you see inside V lambda are the one which satisfies this. The lambda prime i must be between lambda i Must be between lambda i plus 1 and lambda i. Okay, then I consider a generalized gradient operator. So you start from some V lambda, you take covariant derivative, you arrive to T V lambda, and then you project on some other V mu. If this representation appears in the decomposition of T V. appears in the decomposition of T V lambda, then this is non-trivial. The composition is gradient operator, this gives you basically all first order operators, all natural first order operators, and the direct operator is made of a huge quantity of such gradient operators. Okay, so if I have on the boundary some component here on that line which is prime which is in both V lambda and V mu then I can consider the initial operator of D on this component so it's a first order operator so it has to be just of the form X DX minus delta which is the critical weight for this gradient operator on E lambda prime okay so the initial Okay, so the initial operator, I suppose everybody knows, but this means that the D is then you have lower order terms, so derivatives on the boundary, and then lower order terms. And so this initial operator governs the behavior of solutions to the behavior of solutions to this operator. In particular, the kernel, the top or bottom, must be in x power delta. Okay, so there is some surprising fact that for such gradient operator, the critical weight does not depend on the piece on which you are. So this is a very So this is a very this is something which simplifies life a lot. A priori it should the critical rate should depend on lambda prime lambda and mu but it does not it depends only on lambda and mu and you can calculate it in representation theoretic terms and here is a result so for example so let me not insist on this because i have not that much time but Time. But these are the gradient operators which are involved when you want to construct the BGG operators. So lambda i plus one half up to k and then minus one half and you change only the case coefficient and you can calculate everything. So the critical weight, it's n minus one. So n minus one half, this corresponds to l2. So that's why I isolate it. This is L2. This is L2. This corresponds, this is the critical weight for being in L2. So, plus something which is positive. So, this is in particular, this corresponds to weights which gives L2 solutions. Okay, and so. So the top and bottoms of this credit series. So let me explain. So suppose I have some element of this criterion. So it is in this bundle and it satisfies the Dirac equation. So then I claim that the top order So then I claim that the top order term is only in this piece, in this subpiece of the decomposition of the monogram. And the order is, well, exactly the one I had just before in my calculation, n minus one half plus one half. And this is just a consequence of the calculation of the initial operators, because the arc operator on this piece, well, it's a sum of gradient operators. Operators. It's the sum. What appears here are all the corresponding bundles where you change only one weight. You put somewhere minus one half instead of plus one half if this exists, because this must remain dominant. And so you can calculate everything. Turns out this initial operator is very simple. Is simple, and it turns out that when you look at the sub-representation here, lambda prime, it always appears in several pieces. Sorry, it appears in at least two orputations, except the top one, this one, which appears only in the orientation where you take lambda n minus one half. Minus one half. So if the lambda prime appears in two different representations, it means that if you have it here and you have it twice on the right-hand side, but with different critical weight, well, the initial operator is injective on this piece. But if you have it only once, then you have a kernel of the initial operator, which is just in x-power delta. And the only sub-representation at which this occurs is this one. So this proves the claim. This one, so this proves the claim. Um, so oh, I'm very sure. So, I was sorry, I was very slow. So, let me explain quickly where the observation comes from. Now we've seen that where the top order term must be and where is the obstruction. Well you start from this top order term and you want to solve your equation ds equals zero by well in the usual way by expanding in power series and because you have calculated all these initial operators you can Calculated all these initial operators, you can do that. Especially everything fits well, you have no more kernels of the initial operator, and so you can always solve somehow inter iteratively, except for one problem. And the problem is that in the image, well I should write this here. Well, I should write this here. So this goes, you want to go by the sorry, it's not written. If you go to the lambda, you change only the last coefficient. But this representation here, it appears here, but it does not appear here. You cannot kill the Cannot kill the terms in this subormentation here because it just does not appear here. So you have no initial operators to kill this term here. And it turns out that this is the obstruction to solve the regression. And you can calculate where the obstruction is, at which order it appears. It appears actually at order lambda n minus one, minus lambda n plus one. And it is the obstruction to solving the Dirac equation. Equation and it gives the Big operator. So there is something here which I will keep. Well, it's a nice question, but I will skip it. We had some problems with the indicator operators being non-trivial. That is this operator, this coefficient. Is it non-zero? When you calculate the indicial operator, this is a purely representation theoretic question, and we found no expert to... And we found no expert to answer this question. And finally, we found the answer. This is related actually to Bonson's classification of generalized elliptic freightant operators, which ultimately relies on harmonic analysis. There are more algebraic proofs, but some cases still rely on harmonic analysis. And so we found way, and we found the old Russian book where all calculations are made. Calculations are made, and we found a way to prove that the cis coefficient is non-zero. And in particular, this gives a new proof, well, completely algebraic proof of Branson's criteria in all cases. Okay, so I'm running with time. So the general construction, so I have explained something just for the top or bottom of this. For the top or bottom of this credit service. So it was, I simplify a little bit the argument. In general, we to do the general case, in the curved case, we do something slightly different. We apply the same kind of techniques, but we apply it not to the Dirac operator itself because there are some technical problems. We apply it to this square, which is a Laplacian. But the principle is the same. The problem is to solve formally. Formally the equation, and you find the obstruction at some order in some representation, which no, sorry, no, it's not that. You solve this inductively. So you have solved inductively d square s equals zero, but then ds is maybe not zero. And the top power term of the ds is the abstraction. Obstruction. The middle BGG, it's a special construction, it's a bit different. It turns out that you again look at this, the square of the dark operator, on this bundle where the disk factories live. And it turns out it is a log term of this Laplacian. Of this Laplacian. So it's something very well defined. And it's exactly order 2 lambda n because the orders are n minus 1 as L2 weight plus lambda n. That's where you have the discrete series. And so the dual weight is minus lambda n. And the long term, where you go from delta n minus 1 to delta n, so it's order 2 lambda n. Okay, so Okay, so I've described actually, well, maybe you have not seen it, I've described only the second half of the BGG sequence, but the first half, it's basically adjunct operators. So you, well, there is some other construction, but if you have one half of the BGG sequence, you have the other half. The construction depends on a metric. Understand metric, of course. And it's known the curved BGGs depend on choices because you you Depends on choices because you may add curvature terms and you find other BGG operators. So it depends on choices, but here we are in even dimensions, so we can choose if we want, we have canonical choice, which is an even metric of a family. Of course, the theory is coherent. If you don't know what is BGG, you can recover that in the flat case, you have constructed something, a sequence which is exact. Something sequence which is exact. And I would like to finish by some developments that one can do after this work. Well, first, one must remark that these BG operators exist for all parabolic geometries. But this discrete series of TH Schmidt exists for all symmetric spaces also. Also. So, and these parabolic symmetries, the rise so that the on G and P, which are boundaries of the symmetric space. So, I think that there is a much more general story that you can relate the BGG operators on parabolic geometries with the Einstein matrix inside. And the particularly interesting case is a CF case. I studied some I studied some special cases some time ago, in particular in dimension four, the deformation complex. You have something, some decomposition which is similar to what I have shown here for V plus tensors. And also what's interesting is that you can imagine to look, we have not done that, but you can imagine to look at index problems. You have this boundary values, you have this decomposition in two, say, half the half. Half-dimensional spaces, and in general, in the curve case, this means that you can set up a well-behaved index problem, so the freedom index of a pair. And so, what is this index? What is this meaning? Maybe there are some interesting things to do here. Okay, I finished. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any question or comments? Hi, if you for the last index problem, do you mean some index theorem on the conformal infinity? I know it's not on the conformal infinity, it is on the conformally compact Einstein metric. You have also a version on the boundary, a correspondence on the boundary. So, sorry, I missed what you said. I mean, okay, because on the on the On the hypothetical space, you have the index theory by solving the Dirac equation. So do you mean also on the boundary, there are some correspondent theorem? No, I think. I I think oh I think about this you know the the boundary values of this uh of the discrete series so the the Cell two kernel of the Arc operator and the the dual one and on the model on the real public space they are complementary one is a supplementary subface of the other so in general that's not the case so there is some index involved here and I think And I think, well, what is this index? What does it depend on? I think it's an interesting problem, but I don't see an interpretation in terms of the boundary. So maybe there is some formula involving the mic time invariant or something like that. But well, I have no precise idea of what should happen. Any more questions? Any more questions? I had a sort of question that was partly answered, which was to do with the uniqueness. Have you calculated any of the operators so that you can compare and see if you're getting the usual BGG curved operators like in the chat slow app? Probably not. Okay, no, in the case of the model, so of real expanding. No, there's a bottle of fine, yeah, yeah. Bottle of course, fine, yeah, yeah. Of course, it's unique. No, I think in general, it's different because you know there are plenty of choices somehow. Absolutely, yeah, they're not unique. So, I guess, well, actually, I have no idea, but I would be very surprised that it coincides exactly with one of the known constructions. Yeah. I see no reason for that. Yeah, no, I agree. Um, yeah, and in some cases, you know, you Some cases, you know, you, I guess, you know, I can't think of the specific cases, but we know there are some cases where there are better versions than what you get from the usual costant type construction that they're doing there. So it would be interesting if you were somehow producing nicer curved versions. Yeah, which is possible. Yeah, yeah, that's possible. No, that's interesting. Yeah, that was all. Yeah, that was all. Okay, since the time limited, let's thank Professor Oliver Bikrade for your nice talks.
