This work is on using eco-evolutionary games as a way to try to understand human environmental systems. So when we're first taught evolutionary game theory, we often get this very static and very fixed picture where we have a game payoff matrix and some payoffs and some strategies. Maybe it's a prisoner's dilemma. But what you But what unites all of us in our interest today and in this meeting is that what we're really interested in are games in environments. And this could be a game where we have different people harvesting fish out of a common pool, or we could be thinking about, as we heard from Yoiwasa earlier this week, how illegal logging might be. Might spread through a system or how it might be stopped. And then, of course, we can think of the games that nations play with each other when they negotiate their climate commitments. And so all these games are taking place in environments. We can think about the environment of the atmosphere being the critical one for the climate change problem and the environment of the forest for the The forest for the case of illegal logging. But what's interesting about these types of games is that they're also games of this sort, games in changing environments that occur not just in human environmental systems, but also in purely biological systems. Here we have an image of a biofilm where these organisms in a biofilm construct the environment that they live within. And this sort of niche construction is a process where there's feedback between the strategies that they employ. Feedback between the strategies that they employ in terms of producing the biofilm and their sort of success or failure as a system. And so all these examples can be thought of as eco-evolutionary games. And we've seen a variant of this figure in just about most of the talks we've seen so far. But the idea is that in these eco-evolutionary games, we have strategy frequencies, and those strategies affect And those strategies affect the environmental state in which the game is playing. So it's not that fixed matrix, but instead the game is taking place in this environment that's changing. Next, we have the environmental state, which shapes the payoff matrix of the game. So there's this feedback effect between the environment and the game. And finally, as we study in evolutionary game theory, we have the game payoff matrix affecting the dynamics of the strategies. The dynamics of the strategies and the frequencies of the strategies through time. So, a very simple example of something that could be thought of as an eco-evolutionary game is the case of a fishery. So, here we can think of having multiple different harvesting efforts. So, you have a low-intensity harvesting strategy where small boats are employed to harvest the shared stock. You have a high-intensity strategy where larger, more commercial fishing may be taking. Larger, more commercial fishing may be taking place, and together that shapes the dynamics of the resource that you have. And in the simplest setting, you might imagine that these different harvesting strategies compete only through their effect on that shared resource. So in that case, there's not much of a game-theoretic interaction going on between the two strategies, at least in the instantaneous time scale. And only through the feedback on the environment is there a strategic interaction. Strategic interaction. But you could also imagine the case where there is actually direct competition, where these strategies don't just sit on the edge of this common pool resource, but they're actually directly interacting with each other. So we want to build a setup that allows us to consider both these sort of indirect effects through the feedback of the environment on the different strategy types, as well as the direct impact from one strategy that one strategy has on another, even within a fixed. Even within a fixed, even for a fixed state of the environment. So, fishery can be an example of that as well. If there's, yeah, these waves are crashing on the small boats, making it more challenging for them than the big boats are present. And then in the context of climate change, we can also think of this as the strategies that individuals or firms or nations have on their contributions to the global stock of greenhouse gases. Stock of greenhouse gases, as well as sort of the direct competition between individuals, maybe following social norms, as we've heard this week, as to whether to employ the strategy of having an electric car versus a car that runs on fossil fuels. And one of the important characteristics of these games is that what I've described are two different settings with the fishery and with the problem of the climate, where when we think about what the environmental About what the environmental stock is, or how the environment is governed, they may have different underlying dynamics. So, if you just leave the fish stock to itself, as we see in this left-hand curve, you expect it to grow. So, the simplest case, you might have logistic growth. On the other hand, in the case of the climate, if every nation stopped emitting, then the sort of intrinsic dynamics of the stock of greenhouse gases, we would expect to be. Greenhouse gases, we would expect to be some sort of decay back down to pre-industrial levels. And we want to be able to use this approach of eco-evolutionary games and understand both kinds of systems where we have self-renewing and decaying resources. What we find is, at least for the most simple formulations of these, either as logistic growth or exponential decay of the resource stock in the absence of the impact of the strategies. The impact of the strategies, but these two approaches are really very similar, and there's no real major differences in terms of the results that we see from our analysis of this as an eco-evolutionary game. So, in terms of describing the game, we first think about the effect that the strategies have on the environment and what happens when one strategy or another dominates. What's the long-run dynamic of the system given the dominance of one strategic type? So, here Strategic type. So here we can see that with the low-impact harvesters, you have this resource stock that approaches some, not necessarily its carrying capacity because there are still harvesters present, but it approaches some environmental state, which we term like the rich environmental state at an equilibrium when that low impact strategy is fixed in the population. And on the other hand, if you have the high impact strategy, there's a lower state for this environmental stock that persists when all harvest. persists when all harvesters are harvesting at high impact. And we find that if we describe the dynamics of the system instead of with the full range from zero to the carrying capacity of the resource or from zero to infinity for the stock of carbon dioxide, but instead restrict it to those states which would be obtained under dominance of one strategic type or another, then we can simplify how we describe the system and describe it in a way where we can. system and describe it in a way where we can actually make direct connections and direct relationships between very different systems be they you know relating the dynamics in a in a fishery system to the problem of the climate or maybe even if we're feeling bold trying to tie that back to what happens in in the context of a biofilm so next we describe the games that's being played in these extreme Being played in these extreme environments and writing the payoff matrix instead of having a single payoff matrix, we'll talk about these linear, we call them linear eco-evolutionary games, where we describe the system in terms of the payoff matrix that occurs at these extreme environmental states. So either at the rich environment or the poor environment, we have one payoff matrix for each of those. And then at intermediate environments, we describe the payoff matrix as a The payoff matrix as a weighted combination of these two payoff matrices. So the actual realized payoff matrix at any given point in time will be this one where we have the weighted average of these R0 and the poor environment and the R1 in the rich environment. So this allows us to describe the strategic interaction taking place for intermediate levels of the environment. And yeah, so then Yeah, so then finally, now that we know what game is being played, and it's a game that is depending on the state of the environment, sorry, we also need to think about the dynamics of strategies. So how does the frequency of high and low impact respond to the current state of the environment? And how does and then finally closing this eco-evolutionary loop that I showed before, we think about how the game affects the strategy frequency. Affects the strategy frequency, so we model that with the replicator dynamics for this paper. And in terms of what we find with this approach is that in terms of our analysis, so because of the way I posed the problem and that normalization that took place, now we think about the environmental state always being between zero and one. So just what happens when the low impact strategy dies. The low-impact strategy dominates as you tend towards this environmental state of one. And when the high-impact strategy dominates, you tend towards this environmental state of zero. So we know that these will be the dynamics of the environment. And what we find is that we can understand the dynamics of the coupled strategy or the coupled eco-evolutionary game simply by looking at what happens at each of these. looking at what happens at each of these corners and what are the what are the incentives of individuals to switch strategies at the corners of the system and this is for the for the for the linear eco-evolutionary games and so you can kind of interpret this corner as being the incentive to be a leader of change so you have this rich environment and everyone else in the population is following a low-impact strategy it's like what is Impact strategy. It's like, what is your incentive as an individual to be the first person to go lead the gold rush, to go exploit that richness of the environment? And that's described by the difference between T1 and R1. So how much bigger is the high-impact strategies payoff compared to the low-impact strategy's payoff when everyone else follows low impact and the environment is in its most abundant and rich state. And so we call that this incentive to lead the gold rush. Incentive to lead the gold rush. Next, in this other corner, is this difference between P1 and S1. And so that's you can think of that as not the incentive to lead the gold rush, but the incentive to follow it. So you still are imagining that everyone has switched over to the high impact strategy and you're sort of the last person who wants to switch. We find that that's a key driver of whether or not you'll get a stable or cyclic dynamics in this coupled system is if the System is if the incentives to follow tend to be stronger than those to lead, then you are in a case where you might end up with cyclic dynamics. So, conversely, in the poor environmental state, in the degraded environmental state, we have these similar incentives to lead or follow strategic change. And we can think of that as like maybe leading an environmental movement if we want to talk about saving the climate. And finally, And finally, this incentive to follow. So, with these four parameters of leading and following change in the rich and poor environmental states, we find that we can categorize the types of dynamics that are possible in this very, very simplified, very, very simple eco-evolutionary game. And the case that I'm most interested in are these cases where we might get cycles, and those tend to occur when there are positive incentives for changing. Positive incentives for changing your strategy, the extreme environments. So these two arrows point inwards, that's the incentives to sort of like lead change, lead strategic change, then we might think that we could get a cyclic dynamic depending on how fast or slow the environmental response is, depending on how much time scale separation there is between these approaches. But what we find is it's actually also necessary for the incentive to be a follower. Incentive to be a follower, these incentives on the off-diagonal to be sort of stronger than the incentives to be a leader. So having incentive to lead change isn't sufficient. It actually takes stronger incentive to follow change. And finally, here's an example where we've come from this part of the parameter regime where cycles are possible, but they don't obtain because the fast environmental dynamics prevent any overshoot of the strategic environmental system and give you. Strategic environmental system and give you this instead of a stable basin of attraction in the middle of the phase space. But if the environmental feedback is slower, so if the environment is much slower than the strategy dynamics, then that changes. And then we get this case where cyclic dynamics can persist. And these persistent behaviorally driven environmental cycles are something that has really interested me and something is what I'll focus on for the second part of the talk when I talk about. For the second part of the talk, when I talk about the role that forecasting and environmental forecasting can have on systems that have this cyclic human-driven environmental cycles, rather. So to sort of summarize, depending on the incentives to lead change, you may find either these case that I showed you where you have positive incentives to lead change in both the extreme environments. And you can get a mixed equilibrium or you can get cyclic dynamics depending on. Where you can get cyclic dynamics depending on the incentives to follow change and the time scale of the system. If the incentives to lead change are negative, so that's what's shown by these arrows here, then we end up in a system where no matter what the incentives to follow are, you get biostability. So this way of analyzing the game makes it quite simple to understand like, oh, well, if you don't have incentives to lead at these extreme environments, then we know we can't get cycles. We know we're going to end up in a pipe. KIT cycles, we know we're going to end up in a bi-stable regime. There are other small regions where cyclic dynamics can occur when the incentives to lead change are mixed. But what I'm going to focus on for the remainder of the talk is this region over here. We have the potential for cycles. Okay, so just to summarize, we've seen many talks this week about this kind of problem of human environmental systems. Problem of human environmental systems, and I would argue that this approach of using eco-evolutionary games is a nice mathematical tool for analyzing these systems and also for comparing what happens in one system to another just by looking at these incentives at the corners of the state space. And then maybe if it's in one of these yellow regions, looking at the relative time scales of the system. And we can think about this as in the context of common pool resource harvesting, in the context of climate change. And the context of climate change being particularly interesting examples. Climate change is important to note that if we think that it might be a game that falls within this yellow region, then it's certainly a case where this environmental response is very, very, very slow. So it would be a system that this model would predict would be susceptible to cyclic dynamics. And now, for the second part of the talk, we have the addition of Vitor Vas Goncelos, who was at Princeton University and is now at the University of Amsterdam. And this work on forecasting is work that I've collaborated closely with him on. And one of the topics that has received some really nice discussion throughout this week so far is this idea about idea about rationality and what how do people make decisions and how do people make decisions when the environment is changing and we sort of have two extremes here on the one hand I just presented a model that took an evolutionary approach where we use the replicator equation and all the individuals are myopic so they don't think about the future they don't necessarily even really need to know that they're playing a game they just copy individuals who are doing better than them Who are doing better than them? They copy their strategy. On the other hand, you have this model of the rational actor where individuals might calculate the net present value of various strategies and they might know the equations for the dynamical system that govern the climate or govern the common pool resource that they're harvesting. And what I would argue is that neither of these approaches are necessarily all that great for studying human environmental systems. Studying human environmental systems. We saw a nice talk by Alan Hastings earlier today showing that there are these long-term transients where we may not know that we're not in a stable equilibrium, may think we're in a stable equilibrium, and actually we're in a cycle. Or there may be a case where we think that we have some chaotic system that'll persist, but actually the parameters are a little bit off and it's heading towards extinction. So even if we do have this rational actor model, we may not do a very good job. Job implementing it because of the complexities of real-world systems. But on the other hand, with this evolutionary approach that I've pitched before, we are interested in these games and the environment, like I said, and I was trying to sell you all on this idea that eco-evolutionary games could be a good tool for these games in changing environments. But at the end of the day, the little agents that The little agents that were modeled with the replicator equation in the game, they still thought they were in this world. They still thought that they were in the world where they had a fixed payoff matrix and they were just copying other individuals. Whereas in reality, we're interested in these systems that have environmental feedback. So as this kind of schematic of this idea about environmental forecasting, we need to think about, well, what would an individual We need to think about, well, what would an individual who's right here at this point in time, what would they assume is going to happen to the environment going forward? And there are many different ways you could imagine going about this. You could think of a case where they just assume that the environment will stay fixed at whatever it's currently at. So you might just think that this, their forecast, the environment would just follow horizontally from this point. That has actually consistent. That is actually consistent with the initial model that I shared. You might think that they have some delay where they look back in time and then project forward. So, if they look back to here, then they might project forward through based on this delay. And that would give you a set of delay differential equations. But for this work, I'm going to do something, we do something that's very simple where we just say, okay, well, if they're at this point in time, they assume that the rate of change of the environment is going to be constant going forward. Environment is going to be constant going forward. And they use that to formulate their forecast of the future environment, which I call n hat of t, where t is how far into the future they're looking. So they think it'll be, you know, just continue at the same rate of change as it's currently at. So with this forecast, we modify the model that Modify the model that I shared from the previous one by including discounting and forecasting into the payoff matrix. So before, we just had this pi sub L for the low impact strategy, and it depended on the state of the environment, N, and it depended on how many people were doing the low impact strategy, Z sub L. But now it depends also on their forecast of the environment. And so we integrate using this discount function. Using this discount function, we integrate their payoff function, assuming that they have this forecast for the environment. So now when they make their strategic change, they're not thinking about the instantaneous payoff. Instead, they're thinking about what they think their net present payoff, net present value, or what they think their value, given discounting of the alternate strategies they have available to them, will be. And it's important. And it's important to note that this and hat, like back here, we don't know if it's going to be correct or if it's going to be very wrong. But the agents are going to be constantly re-updating it at every point in time. So they're always updating their projections of what the future environments will hold. So before we had this where it was just the dynamics were just based off of pi L and pi H and now we will have this. And now we will have this modified so that we still have that pi L and pi H term, but we've solved this forecasting problem. And because the payoff matrix is linear, it has this nice, very simple form where we see that in addition to caring about the current payoff difference between these two strategies, they also care somewhat, depending on how much they discount the future, they care about how much they think the payoff difference between the two strategies is going to change going forward. So they take into account Forward. So they take into account this dynamic environment that they're in when they're making their strategy decision updates. And it's still linked with this very simplified model of a decaying resource that we call a decaying resource. What we see is that if this discount rate goes to infinity, then we recover the case where they're myopic. So it's consistent with the first model that I shared. And the main finding that we have. And the main finding that we have for this section on forecasting is that in a system that could be susceptible to cyclic dynamics, so the parameters coming out of the region for cycles, when myopic individuals are the only types of individuals present in the population, we can get this persistent human-driven environmental cycles. And if the forecasters care sufficiently about the future, Sufficiently about the future, that system can completely change, and instead you end up with a stable mixed equilibrium. So we see that forecasting the environment has this ability to stabilize otherwise unstable human environmental systems. Yeah, so from this part, I just want to highlight how we have sort of implemented a first A first pass at thinking about how these agents in human environmental systems might model environmental dynamics and might make forecasts about the environment. And hopefully it's an approach that can sort of bridge these economic approaches of rational agents making decisions with evolutionary approaches where we have individuals who maybe don't know so much about, or we don't assume that they know very much about the human environmental system that they're embedded within. Environmental system that they're embedded within. So, trying to find it, an attempt to try to find a middle ground between these two extremes. And we find that this forecasting behavior can be like strongly stabilizing on the human environmental dynamics. And what I didn't show is that the stability of the environment also increases the average welfare of the individuals in the system. So these environmental oscillations that are driven by people are also like strong. That are driven by people are also like strongly decrease the payoffs that they get from average payoffs they get through time in the game. And this so stability improves the welfare of the people in the human environmental system. So this leads me to the final part of my talk, and it's the part that I find most exciting. And this is thinking about, well, sure, forecasting might be good for stabilizing human environmental dynamics. Human environmental dynamics, but will individuals who do this kind of forecasting actually be better off than individuals who are myopic and care only about the present? So is there the ability of this forecasting type to invade a population of myopic individuals? And this increases the dimensionality of the system because now instead of having just the forecasting types or just Just the forecasting types or just the myopic types, and altering the discount rate to maybe scale between one of those two extremes. We now have low impact strategy forecasters and low impact strategy myopic individuals, as well as high impact myopic and high impact forecasters. So now it increases the dimensionality of the system. And we, yeah, so, but we think about it as having these pairwise interactions between. Pairwise interactions between the different types of individuals and the different strategies, and that we assume that there's a cost of being a forecaster. So, all else being equal, it's more costly to make these to sort of have the cognitive ability to know more about your environment and to predict what the environment is going forward. So, what's interesting is because of the cost of being a forecaster, even when these forecasters invade. These forecasters invade, they can't achieve this stability that's achieved when you assume that everybody's a forecaster. And the reason for that is that once the environment has been stabilized, there's no longer any benefit for making a forecast because in a stable environment, your forecast of what the environment will be in the future is that it's the same as what it is in the present. So that forecast won't affect your behavior at all. It won't give you any advantage, but it will still. Advantage, but it will still be costly to have this ability to do it, we assume. So that leads to this sort of self-limiting nature of forecasters, where when there are only forecasters, they quickly stabilize the environment. When there are a mix of forecasters and myopic individuals, the forecasters can't get to high enough frequency. They stay at quite low frequency, but they still stabilize the system quite a bit relative to what was occurring when they're only myop. Was occurring when there were only myopic individuals. And relating nicely to Alan Hastings' talk about these long-term transients is this figure showing the actual invasion dynamics of a sample invasion simulation where the forecasting types here are in purple and it takes them thousands of time steps in the Of time steps in this ODE, thousands of units of time in the ODE to establish and to get to this new equilibrium that I showed you in the previous slide. You can see that the system is oscillating very, very rapidly compared to that. So you could think if the natural time for one cycle in this human environmental system was one year, then maybe it'll take a thousand years for forecasters to be able to invade the system. To be able to invade the system. But they do achieve the fitness gains that the forecasters would achieve alone. So there's sort of this balance between the transient period taking a very, very long time, but the fitness benefits of the stable environment, or at least the stabilization of the environment that forecasters create, are felt much more quickly than what occurs in terms of shifting to this new equilibrium of the coupled system. And another complexity that I don't really have a full grasp on, and maybe others here will know better why this might be the case, is that the invasion success or the invasion failure is highly idiosyncratic and context dependent for this process of forecasters invading a myopic population. So, here on the panel on the left, the outer ring is the state. Ring is the stable dynamics or the stable limit cycle that occurs when only myopic individuals are present in this coupled environmental strategic system. And so it starts out that the system just oscillates around counterclockwise. And then periodically, spaced equally in time, we introduce a little perturbation where we let a forecaster show up and see if that can lead to successful. Lead to successful invasion. And what we find is that there are certain, depending on when those forecasters show up, the invasion might be successful or the invasion might fail. If it succeeds, the system ends up with much less severe environmental oscillations. And the lack of severity is what leads to this increase in the fitness of everyone in its population. But whether or not it succeeds or fails is not easy to predict and depends on what. Predict and depends on when they arise, and even whether or not you'll see whether this invasion succeeds or fails, can take a very, very, very long time. In this simulation, the oscillations here take about 20 units of time, and you can see it takes about 10,000 units of time before some of these invasion processes finally start tending towards this new equilibrium women's cycle. Yeah, so to conclude this section, we see that there is this process by which the forecasting types can invade, but it's via this very long transient. So maybe what happens during that process is more important than what happens in the long run. And also, And also, the invasion doesn't replace the myopic individuals. They are always coexisting with the myopic individuals. So, I think one interesting area to explore that we haven't thought about much at all is this, what happens when there are multiple different decision-making processes, multiple different ways people make decisions in a human environmental system? How might that affect the couple dynamics of human environmental systems if we have a diversity of decision-making methodologies that people and the population follow? That people and the population follow. And finally, and most excitingly, these welfare improvements that forecasters can bring can be attained even if they only achieve very small frequency, even if they don't become very abundant. This forecasting can still be beneficial for the whole population. So you can think of this forecasting type acts as a public good where the whole community benefits even if they don't, even if they aren't themselves forecasters. But ultimately, the forecasting itself. But ultimately, the forecasting is self-limiting in that if it were to fully eliminate environmental variability, then it couldn't invade. So I'm going to try sharing this, but I don't know whether it will work or not. But this is the last slide that I have, so I'm happy to start working through or taking questions. But this is just a illustration. Just an illustration of first the myopic individuals quickly approaching their equilibrium, and then an illustration showing just how long it takes for these forecasting types to invade relative to the process of one of these cycles. Okay, so Alan, I see you have a Okay, so Alan, I see you have a question about the time scale of forecasting and how does it interact with discounting. Yeah, that's a great question. So let me add to that actually. One please is I was just going to relative to this is that forecasting is also not free. So you've got to, in some sense, there's the cost of obtaining the information that you need to make the forecast and the cost of the forecasting. So yeah, go ahead. Sorry to throw that in there. Ahead. Sorry to throw that in there. I was just going to type that up. Yeah. So, wait, can you repeat that? So, so additionally, to sort of forecasting is that forecasting is something that has a cost. Yes. And, you know, so if you're myopic, you don't have to pay the cost of getting the information you need to make the forecast or to make the forecast, et cetera. And that also plays with. Forecast, etc. And that also plays a role in the time scale aspects. Really interesting talk, made me think a lot. So, thanks. Thank you. Yeah. So, in terms of the time scale, the forecasters make projections like infinitely far into the future, but this discount rate sort of puts an effective time scale on how much, like how far into the future they really care about. How that interacts with the cost is something I've not. the cost is something I've not considered, but it's a great, it's a great question. How does the yeah, how does the cost of forecasting interact with this like time scale over which they really are putting most of their weight of their forecast? And just, I mean, people have studied that sort of question, you know, sort of how much you should put into monitoring, say, for an invasive insect species, which would then enable you to detect it sooner. Enable you to detect it sooner to have a better forecast and therefore cheaper to control, but it's expensive to do the monitoring. Yeah, Sandy Leibold has done some of this. And I think Julie, who's here, also has worked on that. Julie Blackwood. Yeah, that's fascinating because that's really the case where you're like trying to detect this very small. This very small invasion process was here. The forecast is really more just about the overall dynamics. So, yeah, like what you would care about in terms of the value of the forecast would depend on like whether you had a sort of outbreak dynamic compared to this where it's a more straightforward environmental response to the strategies. Andrew, would you like to go through the long-term? Would you like to go through the last slide here? Oh, this is the last slide. Yes. So, what are we seeing here from the last two figures? I don't know if the video, I think sometimes it's challenging for these things to work over Zoom, but it was just illustrating the dynamical process of one of these invasions. So, this invader showed up at this point, and then very slowly increased in frequency, and like as the Frequency and like as the and then approaches like new attraction with a smaller limit cycle than what it had before. But I'm happy to take questions at this point. Well, that's thank you first. And a very interesting talk with some ideas. Thank you. So yeah, so Alan, you had a couple more questions. Did you still want to discuss those with let's let somebody else yes. Let's let somebody else yes, okay. So until if unless right, Frank, you had a question. Would you like to ask Andrew? Would you want me to read it out? Sure, no. Thank you very much for the great talk, first of all. I was wondering, so the forecasting, is there something in the model how much into the future you can forecast, how much anticipation? Much anticipation there is because what I'm imagining is that you know, if you're too ambitious and try to forecast too much, then the model or the forecasting might break down and you can get some overshoot, undershoot, and so on. And maybe then it will not work so well anymore in stabilizing the oscillations. Yeah, that's a great question, Frank. And I think because of the way that we specified The way that we specified the forecasting. And it turns out that that issue doesn't really arise. And this was to my surprise as well. I assumed that if they made forecasts that were completely ridiculous, that it could have some surprising effects. But it turns out that there's no limit to how far into the future they look, but this parameter R is the discount rate, and that puts an effective cap on how far into the future they look because that. Because the weight that they put on everything beyond a certain time into the future that's a function of R can be ignored. Now, they definitely will make some forecasts about what the state of the environment is that may even fall outside the phase space. They might think that, you know, here we've normalized everything so that the environment is always going to stay between zero and one. Individuals might think that the environment is going to go to two or to negative one, but that surprisingly doesn't have any. doesn't have any that doesn't lead to any to any major irregularities in terms of what happens and in general the higher when you have only forecasting types the further into the future they look the more effective their forecasting is at dampening and and stabilizing environmental dynamics it sort of it acts as a governor that prevents them from overshooting the environmental equilibrium Great, thank you. So, Lou, you have a question in the chat here. Yeah, so Frank asked part of this, and that has to do with the time scale of forecasting, which I now understand is basically encoded in the discount rate. But there are lots of different ways of thinking about forecasting. So you're using one based upon rate, current state. Current state. And in collaboration with psychologists over the last several years, and the things I'll talk about on Friday with regard to climate change impacts, there's this whole thing of sensing and forgetting. And that ties into what we typically would do, which is a moving average over the past, maybe linked to something like the rate, the current rate stuff. So, have you tried all So, have you tried alternatives and do they actually lead to destabilization at certain discount rates or certain times to predict? Yeah, so we've tried this setup. We've also tried setups where there's like this window of the past, which you're using to project it forward. So you say, oh, what was it two days ago? What is it today? That's two days from now will be that jump. Will be that jump. We haven't done anything more sophisticated than that. But one thing that we have done that I didn't talk about at all is we've imagined that if we go to the payoff function here, we say that they're forecasting what happens to the environment, but they're still assuming that what they think everyone else is going to do is fixed. Right? So that is also kind of strange because if people are changing their strategies. Because if people are changing their strategies, then maybe you would say, Oh, well, I know people are shifting towards this new thing, and I'm going to take that into account. And that's actually the thing that can be really strongly destabilizing, is if you make forecasts about the behavior of others, then that feeds back into the equation for how quickly you're changing your strategy and can create these positive feedbacks that like blow up the system or have these really weird singularities that can occur if you care too much about the future and predicting what other. About the future and predicting what other people are doing. I don't have a great story for what that means for these systems, but maybe we should be concerned about, I don't know, algorithmic traders who try to guess what other algorithmic traders are going to do. Yeah, you're getting close to making money, though, on these things. Be careful. Or at least saying you know how to make money. It doesn't matter whether you really can. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thank you, Lou. Thank you again. Thank you again, Andrina. We still have questions here, but I think usually we like to take a five-minute break now. But don't go away because it's going to be a good discussion session. So we'll start again in five minutes. Thank you.                    Are we ready to start the discussion session, Vrichov? Yes. Yes, yes. Sorry, I needed to find my button here. Yep. Shadi also taking notes, volunteering. I just realized that there has been a lot of money. I just realized that there's a whole bunch of stuff going on on the chat that I hadn't seen. So there's a question you posed, Richard, maybe a good place to start. That you were curious about how widely invasion success depends on the timing along the cycle. Yeah, and it has generated a lot of discussion since. Yeah, exactly. So that's... Maybe we'll just take this online. Why not? Good place to start, I would think. Yeah, so Andrew. Andrew is still there. Yeah. Andrew is still there, yes, or again. So I was curious about your results: that if you introduce these forecasters at different points of the cycle with non-forecasters, sometimes they would be successful and other times they wouldn't. And in terms of a dynamical systems kind of approach, if you just have a limit cycle, then it's either stable or unstable, and it doesn't depend on where on the limit cycle. On where on the limit cycle you start. But stability, so I'm kind of curious about how you resolve this apparent paradox here. But of course, stability is a general thing. It says there exists a perturbation or instability. There exists a perturbation that leads you away from that. It doesn't mean that all possible perturbations lead actually away. So there could be some kind of a saddle structure. We don't know. We don't know. And then the other thing that I put in there is that when you look at reactivity, so the question is: even if you have a stable limit cycle, the question is if you perturb it a little bit and then you look at how far the solutions go away from the limit cycle because they come back.
