So, I'm going to give a sort of overview about some of the simulations we've been doing at multiple length scales that involve biological polymers. And it's a bit of a sort of collection of ideas that actually I'd be interested in people's opinions about. So, it's not a sort of it's not a it's not a sort of I'm not going to tell a story I'm going to throw together a load of ideas so it's more like a buffet than a three-course dinner so I'm starting off with this wonderful picture from the Noganos lab which shows cell division so here in the middle we have the DNA in blue and the chromosomes are being pulled apart by the cytoskeleton during cell division During cell division, and we'll come on to this picture again a bit later. But I think it's just the most amazing example of biological polymers because, of course, the DNA, the chromosomes are a polymer and the cytoskeleton is also polymeric in nature. So, the first set of simulations that I'm going to tell you about are based on atomistic molecular dynamic simulations. So, these are the most detailed simulations. The most detailed simulations we run of biological polymers, and they work by representing every single atom as a classical ball, all of the bonds between those atoms as classical springs, and we have non-bonded interactions, and the exact parameters describing the strength of all of these various interactions is described by an empirical force field. And so, what we get is we get a movie of the molecule changing. Movie of the molecule changing shape as it undergoes thermal fluctuations, so due to temperature. So, this simulation that you saw is one of this is this is MASA here, and you notice that in this picture, experiment, i.e. MASA, and theory, i.e. me, completely match. You can hardly tell us apart, which is very successful. So, these are MASA's DNA sequences, and they're extra chromosome. And they're extra chromosomal DNA sequences that she detects coming out of that she detects in human cells. And what we do is we simulate these things at the atomistic level using big supercomputers like this one I'm standing next to here. And it's a bit like bringing the system to life. So this is Frankenstein's monster being animated by electricity. And this is what we do. Electricity, and this is what we do with the computer simulations: we take static structures and we use, in this case, Newtonian mechanics to evolve the system as a function of time. And in this wonderful paper here, the term the computational microscope was coined. So, this is the idea that these simulations are sufficiently accurate that they're as if we had a microscope that enabled us to watch the changing shape of our molecules as a functional. Our molecules as a function of time. So these are the atomistic simulations. And these are very expensive. So the maximum size of DNA circle that we could do, closed circular DNA, would be around 500 base pairs. And this one's about 300. So we're interested in this extra chromosomal DNA, firstly, and most importantly, because our friends work on it and we like working with them because it's lovely, but also because they are potential. But also because they are potentially extremely biologically important. So these circles have been detected coming out of all sorts of human tissue and similarly in C. elegans and they've also been implicated in the fact that these, so very large versions of them, I mean these are megabase things can fragment from chromatin during From chromatin during cancer. And these things are under-chromatinized. So they look, dare I say it, almost bacterial because they're not packed like normal chromatin. And they sit on a circle that's outside of the main chromosome. So they're very interesting to model. But they can be very small, hundreds of pace pairs, or they can be very big, sort of chromosome fragments. So the fit to So, just to summarize everything that I've learned about DNA, supercoiling and topology from our simulations so far. So, just to summarise, so the first thing I'll show you this one at the top. So, this is a very old simulation now. And what we do is we raise and lower the salt concentration. And of course, the DNA is negatively charged. So, in high salts, this is a negatively supercoiled Supercoiled DNA circle and the high salt it likes to form a compact plectineme structure and then at low salt it likes to open out. And this sequence here that I designed, I designed it with flexible elements opposite stiff elements. And we see repeatedly as we sort of pump the simulation with salt that the flexible elements always end up at the elbows, the apices, and the stiff elements always end up at crossing points. End up at crossing points, which makes sense because the flexible elements are more bendy, so they want to be at the elbows. So, this shows that in some way, sequence can encode the folded structure of one of these DNA circles and presumably also larger plasmids. The other thing that we've learned from our MD simulations of DNA is that negative supercoiling promotes denaturation. And I can show you this movie here. So, we'll see in the middle that the DNA starts. We'll see in the middle that the DNA starts to melt and form these open structures. And that's because when you untwist the DNA, you weaken the base stacking interactions and that causes the DNA to denature. And that's obviously important because it provides access to the genetic code, even in the absence of potentially a transcription factor. So supercoil DNA can have holes in it, is the take-home message. So of course the bio. So, of course, the biological implications are that genome can fold in a sequence-selective way, and also that we can have topology-dependent recognition and transcription. Because, of course, when you change the supercoiling, if you untwist or over-twist the DNA, you change its shape. You might even change whether there are single or double-stranded regions, and that can alter the way that DNA is recognized by other molecules. So, that's everything. By other molecules. So that's everything we've learned so far. So there are a few new things to add. So we've been looking a bit more, and also Agnes from York, my collaborator from York, has been looking at protein-DNA interactions and how they might affect supercoiling and how supercoiling might affect protein-DNA interactions. And there are a few things that we find. So this is one of Agnes' lovely simulations here. Simulations here is she shows if you bind a DNA bending protein, that can put a big bend in your DNA, which then of course fixes the DNA shape. So this protein here, IHF, this will always be at the plectonine and it will form a plectonine if there isn't one there because it will cause this big DNA bend. The other thing that we've seen is that we can get additional protein-DNA interactions. Additional protein-DNA interactions in plectinemic DNA that you wouldn't expect in linear DNA, quite simply because you've got loads and loads of DNA really close to the protein. So, this example at the top here, showing topa, this is topoisomerase 1 bound to a negatively supercoiled DNA mini-circle. We see these extra contacts formed between the motor and the DNA, and that's because. And the DNA, and that's because there's DNA hanging around that is very nearby that can then interact electrostatically with the protein. And you wouldn't expect to see this happening in a linear DNA sequence. And then, of course, we've also been starting to look at mini circles interacting with nucleosomes. And this is a picture of one of our simulations. I'll show you some more in the moment. And the other thing that we're really starting to get interested in is when interested in is when we have diffusing supercoils, how the presence of these proteins might affect the transmission of supercoils through different regions of the DNA. So we're interested in protein binding and supercoiling and the coupling between the two. So this is one of our new simulations of a pair of nucleosomes bound to a 336 basis. Bound to a 336 base pair DNA mini circle, and this is done with Tom Bishop, Masseura, Steve Levine. So this is Masse's sequence, and Tom actually built it. I wasn't clever enough to put in the nucleosomes, and I couldn't do the tails. Tom had to help with the tails. I couldn't deal with the nucleosome tails. So, what we've done with this one is we've taken our R336 base pair circle that we know masses, and we fitted in. And we fitted in our nuclear zones and we put them as far away as possible from each other because we thought that was probably the most sensible thing to do. And then we picked a situation in which we thought it was going to be relaxed. And of course, this is the simulation that we get. The DNA is very happy. There's no denaturation in any of the naked regions and everything's completely happy and intact. So we know now that we're pretty sure that we can fit two new. Can we're pretty sure that we can fit two nucleosomes as well as just one on this tiny circle. And then, what we can do, and this simulation is done in implicit solvent. So, the previous one had real watering cations. This one's done in implicit solvent. And it's more of an illustration than anything else. But I absolutely love it because I think it's so striking. So, what I did is from that last simulation that I ran, I then simply took out the nucleosome. Took out the nucleosomes, and you see that we get this structure. You see how amazingly compact the DNA can get when the nucleosomes are there. It's really quite astonishing because, of course, of the electrostatics, you neutralize that negative charge on the DNA backbone and its persistence length just collapses. It's really, really flexible. Okay, so we remove the nucleosomes and let's see what happens. I mean, everybody can guess, but it's quite dramatic. But it's quite dramatic, the whole thing just pops open, and then what we can now do is because we built our 336 base pair circle with our two nucleosomes in so that that was as comfortable as it could be, we can then look and see what the levels of writhe and twist are in our remaining DNA circle. We've been playing around with that because it's fun. So, I like the simulation because it so dramatically shows how. Shows how neutralizing the negative charge on the DNA backbone enables this massive compaction to happen when you add things like nucleosomes. Okay, so when I ran that simulation, I then added more water and re-equilibrated it to try and see what the shape of that new sequence minus the nucleosomes was going to be. And I've done this in two ways. So the first way I did it, Ways. So the first way I did it, I added calcium ions to the surroundings because we're really interested in magnesium. But for reasons that I'm not going to go into, magnesium, I'm not confident with my water model and magnesium because magnesium is very, very tiny, very huge charge density. So we use calcium instead, which is a divalent but isn't as tricky as magnesium. So I ran the simulations in calcium and what we The simulations in calcium, and what we found, and we've seen this before, but it's particularly striking here. What we find is that actually the two strands attract each other at the crossing point because the divalent calcium ions form a bridge between the two strands. So the two strands are here, and the yellow blobs are regions where there's a lot of calcium present, so where there's a high density of calcium. Present, so where there's a high density of calcium, and you can see that the calcium glues together the DNA at the crossing point, which is very interesting and very fun. So, from this simulation, what I then did is I thought, okay, well, that's quite interesting. I bet that doesn't happen for a monovalent iron. So, I swapped every calcium, keeping the same position, I swapped every calcium with sodium. Swapped every calcium with sodium, which only has one positive charge, not two. And I deleted half of the chlorine, so my system was still neutral. And then I ran another simulation. And that's this one. So here, the simulation has been firstly equilibrated in calcium. I've swapped the calcium for sodium, and you know what's going to happen. So I run the simulation. And it opens out into this perfect figure of eight structure where there's no longer the glue between the crossing points. So, I like to think of it that the analogy that I have in my head is imagine yourself going swimming. Okay, if you go swimming and you're swimming in sodium, it's all fine. You can do breaststroke, you can do crawl, it doesn't matter. If you're going swimming and you do swimming in calcium, And you do swimming in calcium, crawl is fine. But if you do breaststroke, if you bring your hands close enough together and slowly enough, you'll be in danger of your two arms sticking together because the surroundings will pour in and glue your arms together because the presence of these divalent ions enables, even though it's negatively charged, the two strands to stick together, as we already know. But it's nice to see it playing. Nice to see it playing out in the simulation. So, this is all about the sort of physics and mechanics of DNA. But of course, DNA is obviously a physical object, but it also conveys information. So, the way in which we think about the information content of DNA, we can think about it in terms of its bioinformatics, it's just a four-letter chemical code like a book that you read, or That you read, or we can think about it in terms of a mechanical object, sort of physical genomics, if you like. And we know, or it's pretty apparent, really, that if we have complex DNA topologies, so where the two ends are restrained, it's not just a linear strand, it's restrained or it's a closed circle, then this can store more information than just a simple chemical code, because the physics and the topology starts to matter a lot more. So, what we really So, what we really need is we need models in which we can combine the information content and the physical manifestation of the object. Now, the reason that this is so important biologically is every time something is transcribed, it generates positive super calls ahead and negative super calls behind. So, this means that any process that's a very important Any process that's sensitive to supercoiling can know what's going on in the rest of the genome, assuming there are no topological barriers between the two processes. If there's no topological barriers, a gene can sense that another gene is being transcribed because this information is being transmitted through the DNA itself. So if we're going to have models that are more that capture some more complicated processes, this is More complicated processes, this is something we need to be able to take into account. And we know as well that, of course, I mean, we saw earlier that under twisting melts negatively super cooled DNA. And if DNA melts, it can then, in certain situations, depending on the sequence, refold to form all of these wonderful exotic structures, like quadruplexes, R loops, cruciforms, that in principle might also. That in principle might also act as beacons for DNA binding proteins that might then be associated with regulation. And also, they could provide a barrier to supercoolal diffusion. So, we have this idea that DNA is a physical object, it also contains and conveys information in some way, and we need to think about what type of models capture both processes reasonably well. Processes reasonably well, and how we're going to deal with that. So, fortunately, my wonderful collaborator at Davis, Craig Benham, has got a fabulous statistical mechanical model that enables us to predict from the sequence and the level of supercoiling. So, I don't need an atomistic simulation, I can just do it with STETMEC. So long as Craig helps, obviously. So, Craig's model can predict the presence. Model can predict the presence of these exotic DNA structures. So, I can't, if I want to understand something like the output of a DNA plasmid in a bacterium, or even more excitingly, potentially the output of one of these EC DNA circles that might be associated with cancer. I am not going to be able to represent this atomistically. It's going to be absolutely It's going to be absolutely impossible. And if we think about biological modeling more broadly, there are 10 to the 14 atoms in a eukaryotic cell. Big computers, although I love them, they're only going to take us so far. We also need more powerful equations. And I just want to point out that actually, even if I could, which I couldn't, it would be completely computationally impossible, but if I could build a model of a eukaryotic cell with every single atom and every single cell atom, Cell with every single atom and every single water molecule and every single ion and all of the proteins. And I started running it with thermal fluctuations, it would not be alive and it wouldn't be alive because there's no quantum mechanics. And without quantum mechanics, there's no chemistry. And without any chemistry, we can't burn fuel. So even an atomistic model would not be alive. It wouldn't have the necessary ingredients to reproduce. Ingredients to reproduce, for example, the activity of molecular motors. So, moving on from an atomistic representation of DNA to a new way of thinking about it that our group are just starting in collaboration with Craig here. And of course, so this is when we went to visit Marielle and Javier. It was a lovely day, but also with Charlie Dorman. Also, with Charlie Dorman and Karsten Kruger, who are microbiologists from Ireland, and Susan Stepney, who's a computer scientist. And her scientific dream, which I think is the best one ever that I've ever heard, is to design a seed that will grow into a spaceship. And that just, for me, puts the, you know, like the idea of Elon Musk just building a rocket, that really. Just building a rocket, that really lacks vision and ambition. Susan's idea of growing a spaceship from biological components is, in my opinion, far more interesting and exciting. So the idea is, is that when genes are transcribed, RNA polymerase moves along, generates positive supercoiling ahead, negative supercoiling behind. If we know whether genes are upregulated or down-regulated by negative. Or down-regulated by negative supercoiling, then we'll be able to construct a sort of hybrid physics information type model of how the DNA behaves in, for example, a plasmid, so long as we know what genes are on there and what other proteins are present. And we're going to build synthetic plasmids, put them into bacteria, and start to construct these models, obviously with Craig's help. And these behave as logic circuits. These behave as logic circuits. They're AND gates and NOT gates and NOR gates. Because basically, if this gene gets transcribed up here, pumps negative supercoiling into the one below, and the gene below is upregulated by negative supercoiling, then you get a cascade. This one's transcribed, and this one's transcribed, and this one's transcribed, and this one's transcribed. So, these are, it's like a logic circuit, which is why, of course, we collaborate. Why, of course, we're collaborating with the computer scientist. Because what Susan would like to do is she would like to take our physics information type model. So this model that works at the level of a plasmid, not at the level of the atoms, and use this to write a DNA code that can then be compiled. So she's going to use her computer science expertise to come up with a way in which we could look. To come up with a way in which we could look at DNA sequences and the proteins interacting with them and actually compile that information in the way that we currently compile a piece of C code, for example. And so there are all of these amazingly different interconnected processes that affect whether something's transcribed or not. And supercoiling, obviously, with me being a fabulous fan of supercoiling, supercoiling likes. Supercoiling. Supercoiling lies right in the middle. So I wanted to now talk a little bit about a slightly new topic, which is all to do with, again, the next scale up. So not atomistic modelling, the next scale up. But now we're thinking about biological polymers as we're looking at motors and we're looking at the cytoscope. Motors, and we're looking at the cytoskeleton, and we're looking eventually at cell division. So, let me just show you a movie of where we're going to start. This isn't one of mine, I can't take credit for it, it's absolutely wonderful. What it shows is the molecular motor dyne walking along a microtubule. And it's a wonderful thing to look at, and it's really, really instructive. But you'll notice a few things about the movie. So, it's an animation, it's not a simulation. Animation, it's not a simulation, it's wonderful, it's created from what we imagine it might look like. But of course, it's a bit looks like a person, you know, the Dyneen's walking like a person, and there are no stochastic fluctuations. So, wonderful as it is, and it's very inspiring, it might not be an accurate representation of the way that this molecular machine walks. And just to point out that dining is ubiquitous. out that dynine is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells. It's responsible for carrying cargo around. It's one of the sort of freight vehicles of the cell, if you like. So my mates at Leeds, they are experts in, I'm very lucky because they're experts in cryoelectron microscopy, which is of course very famous at the moment. And this is negative stain actually, which they're also Actually, which they're also experts in. So, this shows some negative stain EM data of dynein walking along a microtubule, and you will notice that actually it doesn't walk like a person. In fact, the two hips sort of disassociate from each other. And so, what we've tried to do is invent a new modelling tool that enables us to capture that. And we do that with a technique. And we do that with a technique known as fluctuating finite element analysis. And what fluctuating finite element analysis is, is it's conventional finite element analysis with thermal noise added. And Fred, it's white noise. So if you think that's wrong, we need to talk about it. So this is what fluctuating finite element analysis is. And so what we can do is we can then run simulations. Oops. Oops, of our dynamine. So here's one here. We can run simulations of our dyne, and what we find is: I'll just accelerate this a bit. This one falls off. This one takes one small step is what we've managed to simulate of the cycle. It doesn't walk quite yet, but it does take one step in our simulations. And so what we can see is that. What we can see is that actually adding what we did here to stop this one falling off is we added a non-specific interaction potential to the surface of the microtubule. And that's the only way we can stop the dyne from disassociating from the tract. And we know that microtubules are modified by post-translational modification, so they have little tails, and this is called the tubulin code. So we have the DNA code and we have the tubulin code, and we notice that both. Code and we notice that both of these codes are carried on polymeric objects. So, one of the things that you'll notice is that dynein is a big long stalk and some blobs. So, one of the ways in which we've tried to make our fluctuating finite element analysis more computationally, well, less computationally expensive is by adding rods. So, we have blobs in three-dimensional. So we have blobs in three dimensions, and now we have rods in one dimension, which is our polymeric structures. And on a good day, we can connect the rods and the blobs. So this is the rod and this is the blob. And we'd like 2D sheets. We don't have 2D sheets, but we could do membranes. If we had one, two, and three dimensions, we'd be able to do blobby things, sheety things, membranes, and long things. So polymers. Things so polymers. The time is up. Okay, okay. So I'll show you my one simulation of our. This is part of our microtubule simulations with the we're trying to simulate the kinetochore. So we have these big long polymeric objects. And that's how far we've gotten that, really. And so the questions that I'm putting out. The questions that I'm putting out to the community are: when we're doing this sort of modelling, how do we choose our levels of representation and how do we move between different levels of reputation? So how do we go from an information view to a physics view or a mathematical view or etc, etc., etc. And when do we classify something as a blob, a rod or a sheet? And could we use our rod representation? Could we use our rod representation for intrinsically disordered proteins? And if we can, then when do short tails become an intrinsically disordered protein, or when is it just a furry bit on the outside of the structure and we can treat it implicitly? And so these are the sorts of questions that when we do multi-scale simulation, we see all of these different factors in the physics that come into play. And these are the questions that I'd like to put. These are the questions that I'd like to put to the community for us to discuss. Thank you very much, Marielle. It's lovely to see you. Miss you lots.
