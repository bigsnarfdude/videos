What I'm about to talk is a joint work with the Kapushka brothers and Kapushka. And I will tell you about some natural relation between two. Natural relation between two families of hypercaler manifolds, which was somehow highly expected, but finally it's also proven. So, what are the objects? We have two hyperkeler families and one family of manifolds. On one side, we have Gushel-Mukai fourfolds. On another side, we have WPW sextics and the third corner is WTW cubes. Is WTW cubes and in the middle I can put Lagrangians in the wedge tree of a six-dimensional vector space. So, all these objects, which I will define later, are the have some clear connections to a Lagrangian plus a choice of some special iteration in P6, you can associate a Buchan-Mukai-Horpole. And these Lagrangians are directly associated with these double APW sex sticks and double APW cubes with some. Cubes with some generative assumptions here. So here we have somehow some one-to-one and some two-to-one associations. I will also explain the difference between these two. And by work of many people, you also have a link. You also have a link between this Bush-Mokride forport and this WSW sector. This is definitely not something neat as in this case, that for one Lagrangian, you get one FEW sex stick. Here, for a four-dimensional family of Bushel-Muccai fourfold, you get the same double FEW sex. And we have this geometric link going all around. And the question is: what happens to hodge structure? It is somehow very natural. You would expect somehow that the hodge structure of these portals could be related to those of these sex sticks and maybe also to those of these cubes. This is a natural effect, but sometimes. But sometimes the naturality phase, already in the hyperkeler world, you have some counterexamples by exactly, exactly, yes. And yeah, then I can do also some constructions as model spaces, but I was really thinking about the Ulevel Manuel association. The Manu Belder association. So, one case where this sort of symmetry on the Hodge level fails is actually in the simpler case of cubic forcals. With cubic force, you can associate many hypercolor manifolds. Sometimes there's a clear relation between the structure of the cubic forced and that of the associated hypercolor manifold. And to my knowledge, And to minor average once in this phase. Existed a good relation for all the structures. For all the structures between this powerful span a variety of lines. Of lines the length length JÃ¼rgen Manstrophy eightfold the intermediate Jacobians So, all of this share some relation between the hard structures. As far as I know, here it works only with Q coefficients. Well, here you just take the primitive, the vanishing part of the first homology, the primitive part of the second homology, and again primitive parts of the second cohomology. Parts of second commo, primitive parts of second commodity here, and orthogonal to some rank to natural space here. But you have no relation whatsoever with the so-called variety of sums of power of the cubic. So, what this strange object is just the ways to write this cubic equation as 10 cubes of linear factors. This forms a fourfold, which surprisingly is an hyperkeler fourfold, and the hodge structure of this fourfold has nothing to do with the hodge structure of the cubic fourfold. And this is Clare and Ranestad result or Ranestad. Rohan is that and what's yeah so I I think that uh on the That on the APW and Gushel Mukai side, it is natural to expect that the whole structure to behave somehow in the same way. But even if it is natural to believe this, one needs to be careful because it doesn't always happen. It's just a word of caution that this naturality needs to be proven. And some sets of this isomorphism about the structure. Isomorphism about the structure are extremely clear because here, from the cubic force to the final variety of lines, you obtain a natural morphism about the structure given by Abel-Jacobi integration. And the same here, because this is actually a modeling space of twisted cubic on this eightfold. A little less here, but still you can construct a natural correspondence which allows the trick. And clearly, here is enough. And clearly, here you cannot. And on this other side, you can, let's say, with some generality assumptions, you can construct this double L sex stick as a modulus space of conics on this Mushroom-Mukai forpose. So the link between the Hodge structure here and the Hodge structure here. Here with a whole structure here is something geometric. And by our construction, you also get in a geometric way the link between these two, because it turns out that this one will be the modulus space of twisted cubic, well, will be related with the modulus space of twisted cubics on this fourth volt by result of a Guo Vanguard. And so it fits perfectly together. But directly constructing the modulus space of twisted cubics as this APW cube is quite hard. And it was, I think, what people were trying at first, but the construction was too difficult. So, what are So, what are all of these well, I fix a six-dimensional vector space, and I will put some symplectic structure on its wedge tree. So here I just put the natural one. You have a volume form on Wedge 6 of W, and you define this simple active form as basically a multiple of this volume form. You just put classes and get the volume. And then we define a couple of objects for any Lagrangian space in this way the three of W. Three of W I define XA which are vectors in P of W such that the dimension of B where to W intersect. Intersected with A is at least one and while A as the set of three spaces W That's the dimension of U wedge wedge to W intersected with A is at least two. So these are natural losses you can consider in here. If you take A general, here we are just intersecting A with a different loss. In A with a different Lagrangian with respect to this structure, we expect that for a general D, this dimension will be zero. And the same goes here. For a general U, this dimension should be zero. So this leaves in P5 and this leaves the Grassmannian precision. So the trick double and here I'm taking I'm close to the log sheet because of this condition, but I also want to consider the log sheet where the dimension is exactly something. So I will define analogously X A I be the same. I should be the same thing such that the dimension is exactly I and y A I equally well the dimension is exactly y I  So, the interesting part is, I mean, these are not yet the hyperkeler manifolds I want to consider, but I want to take double covers of this variety and these double covers with the nice. Covers with the nice hypothetics on A will turn out to be smooth hypercalories. So the first is like O'Brien if we have the when we project device A and When we project device A and we intersect with the Grassmannian three six, we get an empty space. And the third law for the dimension is exactly true. It's empty, then there exists. Exist a double coder XA field of XA random fight along Xale, which is a smooth. Is a smooth hypercader manifold deformation equivalent to the Libra scheme of two points on a tatrix. Actually, you can do something similar, even if this. Something similar, even if these conditions are not satisfied, unless they are not too far from being satisfied, you still have a double cover, but you need to resolve some of this double cover to obtain an hyperclared manifold. And here, you can compute the degree of this hyper surface in Pw, and you get that this is a sextic. So, this sextic will be called the Pw. Text stick will be called the FW sex stick, and the double cover will be obviously the normal FPW sex stick. You can also compute, you can take the natural polarization of this X-ray, you pull it back to the double FPW sex stick, and you obtain something of degree 12. So, if you compute the Bogin-Bogomol of degree of this polarization in here, you obtain two, which is the minimum one for such many things. So this. So, this as a polarization of the grid. The idea is to do exactly the same also for this one, and this has been done by. Been done by William Kapushka Kapushkan Rana study. The conditions are similar if again Yove A does not intersect the Grassmannian. And the fourth locus is empty. So this first condition means that this Lagrangian does not have totally decomposable three vectors, while this condition means that a locus which has expected dimension minus one is actually n. Minus one is actually n. In this case, there is this double color IA builder Ramified on Y83, which is the smooth singular locus of Y8, which is hypercolor manifold. The formation equivalent to the Libre scheme of three points on a K3. And it again inherits a polarization by pulling back to the Fluker polarization. And this time the Bovil-Bogomalo to GT degree is four. And it's not a random one of the grade four, it has divisibility two. So, this divisibility does mean that if you pair That if you pair this form with anything in the lapis, you always get an even number. So, from these computations, it follows that if we take The primitive commodities are ya field with that coefficient, and if we look at it as a lactase, then this is abstractly isomorphic to two copies of the hyperbolic lactase, two copies of the negative definite lacties, and And two lattices of rank one where the generator is square minus two. And this is actually the same also for the APW sexy. So, the hope is natural that this Lapis isomorphism will be if you fix A also some false isomorphism. So, this is as Lapis's. And the extension of that for geometry is exactly. Donometry is exactly the result. Let A be a Lagrange such that Actually, I need four conditions on the other board. UA intersected the Grasmanian is empty as are the As are the first locus of YA and the third locus of XA then there exists a hydrogen From H2 primitive product exact coefficients to H2 primitive with that. It is, but then there's some work to do. So we have a geometric correspondence which works on H4, but on H4, not of the smooth hyperpellers, but of the singular orbits. And then from it, we obtain. And then from it, we obtain something which was actually coming from the H2. But now I will give you the correspondence and this has some corollaries. The first one is that given Agushen Mukai fourfold associated to A YA field can be constructed. Can be constructed as a model space of stable objects which should call it that A. On the cousins of components of the derived category of the A. So you take Agushen Mukai fourfold associated as 11 my value to this Lagrange. To this Lagrangian subspace, you take the cuz net of component of its derived category, so basically, just the orthogonal complement to the natural bundles inherited from the Gaspanian. And you can construct, you can choose a Mukai vector and a stability condition in such a way that the module is based with that Mukai vector and stability condition on this goodness of components, gives you. Components gives you precisely the WPW and with this Let me write down that that chromatic can be made more precise. Actually, why a field depth is a thing via the modeling space. The modern space of twisted qubits on that A. I will bearing them here. You take two qubits on the A, you take their ideal shape. You take their ideal shift, and more or less you try to project this ideal shift to the continent of components. You get some Mochai vector. If you pick the modulus space with that Mochai vector, you obtain y A tilde. So objects in here naturally represent field qubits on that A. And once you are able to do this link, you can obtain the ojisometry also by Abel Yakovi. And one more for all the rest of the world, you see here these two have the same lattice structure, and this lattice structure somehow governs the modulus space. Well, the yeah, the modulus space of polarized hyperkeler with the Arrived diaper color with this deformation type and a polarization of this fixed degree. So you can look at what are these modules bases, what is the one associated to double FEWQ and to double FEW sex. So you're saying them as portions of this structure here by some arithmetic subgroup. And these subgroups are related. Related. The subgroup associated to this white A is actually bigger than the one associated to this. So you obtain a natural mapping from the modulus space associated to this double APW statistic to the modulus space associated to double APW cubed, which is a map which clearly respects our structures because it's a map between the periods. Periods left in X in the period domain proceed. Double double sex sticks and left UI is the one for the PW It was observed by Lada and Ogredik. I don't know what to call it. There exists a natural convolution on the X and the portion is D Y. So, what is this? So, what is this inclusion? You always, once you choose a Lagrangian, you can always choose the dual Lagrangian. And this gives you some involution in the space of the fiber colour, which actually respects the Hodge structure. So, the WFEW sex peak associated with the dual Lagrangian has the same primitive chromology. So, it gives you an evolution. So it gives you an involution in here. And this exchange given by this involution is precisely the extra element you are potentially buying when you obtain this model space. So the quotient will be naturally isomorphic to this. And what is the geometric interpretation? Well, the geometric interpretation is is exactly what we want. The portion Proportion from the X to Y sends X A tilde to YA tilde and probably not immediate, but Nothing immediate, but if you take the double FPW cube, well, actually, or it is the FPW cube associated to a dual Lagrangian, you get exactly the same stakes. And this final corollary is simply because. You have to report a bit as well. Yes. The notation I inherited from O'Crady. If you prefer, I just, I mean, I just can put it like this. Everything works here because then the Grassmania. Everything works here because then the Grassmannian itself works, the Grassmannian physics. So I define XA dual in this way. This is the set of hyperplanes in P of W dual such that the dimension Such that the dimension of the intersection between A and H cup which to W dual curve is at least one. So I define it in this way. Okay, and what about the cool So the math is just sending XA field to YA field. And the point is that YA field is the same as YA dual field. The key step of the proof is actually correspondence to fabric. Correspondence to put everything together. So I take omega, which will be percept of the elements. In the projectivization of web scripts of W which are of the forms plus of B, which beta where beta is in which two of W. Is in well two of W. I have some natural orbit for the group action on web3 of W. A general element cannot be decomposed in any way. Then a special element can be decomposed as a MD is in W. A special element can be decomposed as a simple vector wedge. A simple vector wedge, a two vector. And then a very special element can be decomposed as a totally simple three vector. So will be an element of the Graspanian and three six. So this omega is just the closure of one of the orbits by the group actions. And the nice part of omega as a natural map, because to a vector like this, to a three vector like this, you cannot take this. As long as your element of omega is not integral.   With this I define k A I never remember the pairs u alpha. The first few alphas, which are in 28 times T of Word 3 W such that this alpha lies actually in Actually, in P of P U intersected P of A intersected omega where P U is just U wedge wedge two of W. So I'm taking special. I'm taking special elements in this ya, actually, times omega, in such a way that this alpha lies inside the device Lagrangian, inside omega, and inside this q, which is related to the construction of this double TW cube, because it wasn't the locals where this intersected with A at least dimension 2. As at least dimension two. So now we have natural projections. KA goes naturally to the first factor, YA, and Ka goes also to the second factor, omega. So, if A if P of A does not intersect the Grassmannian G36, then you will have that in here there are no elements of the Grassmannian G36. So, every alpha excites in here will be in omega minus. Will be in omega minus the Grassmannian. So actually, this projection will land in omega minus the Grassmannian. So you could also compose with this natural map and go to Pw. And this is the key of everything. Because now Ka will must go to the APW cube and to the APW text.  So, we don't have anything to do with because we don't. W because whenever you have this class alpha, this class alpha will be of the form V wedge beta and then V wedge beta will lie in particular in the P of A. So we have that B which beta intersects P of A, and this means that the dimension of intersects The dimension of intersection between A and B wedge 2 of W is at least one on the point we obtained here. So this point is actually in the AP double sextic by construction and by taking P one and P one And P1, I obtain the marking between all the structures which I would like, or at least I almost obtain it. This operation now like a message is a very good thing. In saying, supposing that this Lagrangian does not intersect the Grassmannian, the element alpha, I can write it uniquely in such a way as B was something. And the two maps I have are projections U and projection well and associated to this just B. This one I will call C one. So now I can look at what via these maps. The easiest one is this one. The easiest one is this one. So P1 is generically or no, no, no, it's even easier. It's actually just three to one generically So, why so you fix you and then what is the fiber? Well, this is the set of alphas in omega such that well, alphas in omega intersected u. U intersection P of A. If we take U generally in YA, we know that this dimension will be, well, the dimension of the projective eyes of this and this will be one. So this is just a line. And so we need just to compute the degree. And so we need just to compute the degree of this omega in here. But it turns out that this intersected this is just a determinant of cubic. So we got just three classes out. The other one has positive dimensional fibers. This is This is the artwork scheme, but also the fibers here are very interesting. C1 has generic fibers, well, as general fibers, which are general five surfaces. Surfaces 84 with 20 notes. These surfaces, I think, they are interesting in their own. In their own, because these 20 nodes are even sets of nodes, so there is a double cover of these surfaces, and the hard structure of these surfaces is still related to the hard structure of the double sector. And this sooner or later will appear in a work in progress. Okay, so once we know these fibers. So, once we know these fibers, the direction we want to take is clear because we don't want to integrate along this mass because these surfaces can be hard to control, but we want to pull back and push forward over here. So, this will give us a map between the body structure of this to the body structure of this. So, these two, what we and the state, they are actually over different because they are just. Orbifolds because they are just portions of manifolds by involution. This one, we are not sure it is an orbifold. We didn't find non-orbifold singularities, but just to be sure, we can replace it with the resolution. And so we have the maps coming from the composition with the resolution in here. So to stay at least. So, to stay at least in the all-default world, so that this push-forward structure are better behaved. So, after doing this step, I define K as C one upper star composed multiplier by one of the lower star and here there's not much to do on the second homology because the second homology of this is just one-dimensional and if you look at this map on the second homology it will do the only thing it can do. Do the only thing it can do, and this the polarization here, the polarization here. But you can look at fourth cohomology, which is interesting because the fourth cohomology somehow contains the symmetric power of the interesting part of the second response structure of XA field. So we look at the fourth cohomology and we see what this map does from H4 here to H4 here. Wait for here. What we want to see is that we are not, we didn't construct in a complicated way the zero map. We have a length map A and for zero form. XA for zero four to a non zero for zero four. And this we do by explicit computation. We take the for zero form on the smooth locus of Xa and we choose well. We choose well for elements with which to compute the 404, well, the image by K of this 404 on Y. We, I mean, we can try to pull everything back to the double covers, but the double covers. But the double cover of this Ka will be very bad. But from what we saw, we saw that the two zero form on the double cover didn't see this some of this correspondence because this was only defined downstairs. Yeah, initially we hope to finish directly with this. Finish directly with this and obtain it on the 2-0 form directly. We weren't able to do it yet. I mean, we construct that in good correspondence by this one, but it seemed to send the fibure form to zero. Okay. And now the H4 of XA can be decomposed in some interesting pieces. Well, the first one is What you get by cut the product between H2 and H2, so just the square of the polarization class. Then you have the symmetric product of the primitive homology of XH. X8 tilde and that's it. And how do we see this? Because this is an orbifold quotiented by is the quotient of a manifold by an involution. So its orbifold homology will just be the invariant cohomology of the one cover. Cover and the H4 of XA tilde is just a SIM2 of H2. We know the action of the involution on cohomology, and we have the this, which is the SIM2 of the invariant part, and this, which is the SIM2 of the anti-invariant part. So, our K is really interesting on this part, and this part is close to being Close to being an indecomposable body structure. There's actually one-dimensional substructure which you can speak from it. This SIM2 of H2P splits as the part of type 22 generated by this. Of type 2, 2 generated by the symplectic form which is conjugate, and another structure which we call WXA following O gradient, and this is irreducible for general A. We have a similar decomposition also for H4 of YA, only that you have extra factors, but the only element which contains something of type 4, zero is the corresponding. Is the corresponding y of w of y a so our correspondence gives us a map of the structures between this irreducible of the structure and an analogously irreducible ones. And it is not the zero map because of this computation. So we actually obtain an injection of our structures at this step. How much time do we have? Zero. Zero. Okay. Okay. So, what do we do next? We are almost done, meaning that we basically have something which is defined on the SIM tool. Which is defined on the scene two of what we want, or more precisely on an eigerplane in the scene two of what we want. But we can also let A vary among all Lagrangians which satisfy our condition. And in doing this, we obtain that this correspondence sends all classes which are the sin 2 of a class of square zero to the sin 2 of To the thing two of a class of square zero on the other manifold. So it's basically a math which preserves a quadric in the Veronese. And from this, by an elementary lemma, we obtain a map which is defined not on the sim two, sorry, basis of two, but really on the H two. But we lose the integer coefficients. We need to go to some extension of Q. Go to some extension of Q, which of course is not what we want, but at least we obtain a map between the H2s we are interested in. Then we move again to a special point in the period domain where we can control this map. And we prove that on this special point, the map is up to a constant, the same as a map defined over gray integer. So we replace k by k times a constant, and then we are done. Constant, and then we are done. We have it defined over the integer set of okay, thank you very much.
