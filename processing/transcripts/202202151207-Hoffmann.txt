Pipeline that Brooks Taylor in the lab established a few years ago allows us to generate dynamic responses to fairly easily to, for example, here, cytokine TNF over time, over about 20 hours. You see individual cells here in this heat map responding over time to many different types of doses. And PAMFI-CSK, a total like receptor-like. A tolac receptor ligand, CPG, another one, LPS, poly IC. So there's a wealth of data that we have, and you see qualitatively that there are differences in these responses, both dose-dependent differences, but also clearly stimulus-specific differences. So these stimuli activate different receptors, but they converge onto this one transcription factor. Transcription factor. And so here we're addressing exactly this issue of the degree of specificity. And so these dynamics represent, were hypothesized to represent a code, a signaling code, by which macrophages that are able to sense different types of immune threats can specify a variety of different responses, whether they're cell intrinsic defenses. The cell intrinsic defenses or local immune responses of recruiting other immune cells, or a systemic immune activation, including the adaptive immune system. And so we're interested in understanding the capacity of this code to convey different types of responses, so specificity. And if there is a code, then there ought to be code words that communicate information. Information. And so we took this approach of establishing a large library of about 918 different types of features that are potentially time point measurements or integrated activities by certain time points or derivatives at each time point or other features just such as peak amplitude or duration of Duration over a certain threshold, or oscillatory characteristics such as Fourier transforms and peak-to-peak distances and so forth. And we simply asked which ones of these hundreds of possible features that we could imagine convey information. So we use Shannon's information algorithm to ask which of these features can, or which combination of features provides for. Features provide for maximal information. And here, and this information maximizing algorithm shows that with one feature in response to any of these ligands, we're getting close to one bit of information for different doses. And that was what Andrei Levtrenko published many years ago. But with more features, we can get more information. Can get more information, and if we're using taking the data from all stimuli, we see that this amount of information maxes out around 2.1 bits, and that about seven-dimensional vector captures most of this information. And so what are these seven things? Well, they are actually six because the first are two derivatives that are very early that really show the speed of the result. Show the speed of the response upon stimulus. There's a peak of activity, and there is a later derivative that indicates whether there is a post-induction repression or an oscillatory activity, an oscillatory feature. And then the next three are at a longer time scale things like total activity or how much of the activity is frontline. How much of the activity is front-loaded? The early versus late? When is what's the time point of half maximal? And or the duration of total, the total duration over some threshold. And so those six features convey information. And so they're called, there are features in a code and analogous to the genetic code. The genetic code immunity, where this work was published recently, that Editor took a liking to the word signaling codon. And those signaling codons are deployed stimulus-specifically, as you would expect, with CPG being lower or poly IC being lower and so forth. Peak amplitude is not so much ligand-specific, but dose-dependent. And so you can see these distributions for many different cells. This is a violin plot, of course, how they're deployed in different cells. And you also appreciate the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in every sample. So if these are code words, then we ought to be able to teach those code words to a machine or machine learning. A machine learning algorithm, a classifier, an ensemble of decision trees. And so we're asking here: if we make a model using all 918 features or just six codons, how well does my machine learning model work? And we see here that the F1 scores are pretty similar. And so that suggests that these six codons indeed are sufficient. Sufficient in conveying the specificity. And so, of course, what's nice about any sort of classifier is not only that you can determine the precision, the F1 score, but also see where confusion lies. So, here you see, for example, there's pretty high confusion between PAMPACSK and LPS. But of course, both of those are bacterial line. Both of those are bacterial ligands that activate TLRs that send bacteria, and so maybe there doesn't need to be more specificity. And so we can also classify our ligands in terms of, or group them, in terms of host cytokine, bacterial ligands, or virus ligands, and we see pretty good specificity. So that means a single pathway. A single pathway is able to tell nuclear target genes with some level of precision what is on the outside of the cell. Of course, there are other pathways that should help in this, but here we're just simply looking at one pathway. And so we asked, is this something that is physiologically relevant? So we used a mouse model for this inflammatory. Model for this inflammatory disease Jurgen syndrome, which is quite unpleasant. And we asked, we took macrophages from this mouse and examined the signaling codons. And so speed is unaltered, peak is unaltered, oscillatory versus non-oscillatory in response to TNF and LPS polyRC is very specific, but in the But in this mouse model, is a loser specificity. Total activity is pretty much unaltered. Duration is also altered, is loser specificity that we see previously. And early versus latest is unaltered. So there's very specific signaling codons that are affected in this surrogate syndrome mouse. And that results in a much greater level of confusion. A much greater level of confusion, whereas the specificity is very high in the healthy mouse and the surgery syndrome mouse. There is quite a bit of confusion when the mouse, when the macrophages are seeing a host cytokine TNF, they are interpreting it as if they're seeing bacterial ligand LPS. And so this obviously is an over. Obviously, is an overreaction or a hyperactivation to some extent. So, just to sum up this brief first part is that we can, by using a lot of data, we can use an information theoretical machine learning approaches to identify these features that convey information to the nucleus and their signaling codons, and they give us a measure of specificity. Use a measure of specificity. And when specificity is reduced in some immune diseases, maybe we can call these inflammatory diseases. They really are signal confusion diseases. So how are these codons actually encoded by the network? Well, the NF-KARB network is modular in structure. The ligand is sensed by a receptor. Is sensed by a receptor. The receptor has receptor-associated proteins, adapters, and they feed into activating finally a kinase called IKK. And that kinase is inactivating an inhibitor that therefore leads to the activation of NF-kappa B. And the inhibitor provides negative feedback, it's inducibly expressed. Expressed. And so, this negative feedback loop has been well studied and is well known to provide oscillations. And these are the oscillations that we see because of this negative feedback loop. And to just confirm that the literature is correct, we bred our reporter mouse into an IKAV alpha knockout. And indeed, we are losing the oscillations. So, this is great. So, this is great, but we have this negative feedback loop, and it's providing oscillations. But we also know that in response to some stimuli, the dynamics are non-oscillatory. And so there's still the negative feedback loop. So how can a negative feedback loop provide non-oscillatory dynamics? And so here we actually took a modeling approach and leveraged the fact that this The fact that this negative feedback loop that is shown in more detail here with every little parameter described actually is very well understood, really based on protein structure, folding of proteins, and biophysical measurements of kinetics. And we have parameters for all of these things, and we have a pretty good understanding how this works. So if we therefore use the model to find out more about Find out more about this negative feedback loop. We do a hop-bification analysis of the negative feedback loop and we find that as a function of the IKK level, at low level, there is a single steady state. And that's in this regime one. You can see that here. So there's non-onscotian F-carbibles, super, super low. And then at some critical At some critical threshold of IKK, there is a bifurcation that leads to oscillatory NF-kappa B. And then, interestingly, at a higher level of IKK, that bifurcation ceases, and now we have non-oscillatory NF-kappa B. So the feedback loop allows for both oscillatory and non-oscillatory NF-kappa B levels. Cover B levels depending simply on the level of IKK activity, the upstream kinase. So that means it's a very simple method system in which a negative feedback loop interprets the precise amplitude of IKK, a quantitative measure of the amplitude, in terms of a qualitatively different NFK dynamics, oscillatory versus non-osculatory. Oscaratory versus non-osculatory. And so we need to understand, therefore, how IKK is regulated, and IKK is here. And so each of these receptors interact with adapter proteins and finally the kinase. And the receptors are able to receive ligands, the poly IC or TNF or TLR9, and each of them is combining into this. Is combining into this. So these are slightly coarser models. They're not based on a lot of biophysical information. Some, yes, but they're certainly these are coarser grained than our common core module. But the simple approach actually works. We see here at different ligands, different concentrations of TNF. IKK activity is simulated, NF-KOB activity is simulated. Activities simulated, and we see that some of the data matches our simulations. And the same is true for TLR4, TLR3, TLR9, TLR2, and so forth. And so ongoing efforts are trying to actually account for the heterogeneity, therefore fit the sensitive parameters to fit the distributions of those sensitive parameters that can account for the For the heterogeneity of the data, here experimental data, and here the predicted simulations. And some of it, it seems to be working well. And postdoc Xiaoliu in the lab is doing this. So I'll have an update another time. So for now, though, I think what we can say is that the Common Core module encodes both oscillatory and non-oscillatory. Oscillatory and non-oscillatory codons, and that depends on simply the amplitude of the kinase activity. And that the receptor proximal modules encode other signaling codons based on ligand half-life receptor turnover and Hill kinetics. And all of these complicated molecular mechanisms we recently summarized in a review in Immunity that goes beyond, that's just molecular. Beyond that's just molecular mechanisms. So, of course, the question then is: now that we know what the words are, the six codons, how are they interpreted? And actually, we've made some progress here too. So Robin Lee, when he was with Suzanne Godet, published a nice paper that showed how an incoherent feed forward loop interprets the amplitude that is. Loop interprets the amplitude that is stimulus specific. We published a paper in which the duration, which is stimulus-specific, is interpreted by genes both their mRNA half-life as well as their nucleosome dynamics. And speed is interpreted by the negative feedback loop and or by a Yeah, by a couple different gene regulatory mechanisms. This is collaboratively with Mariko Okada. And then we published a paper on how the oscillations or non-oscillations are interpreted not so much by poised target genes, by genes that are ready to go, but by actually chromatin regions that are not yet. Regions that are not yet poised, that are hidden by chromatin and they need to be opened up. And that provides essentially the low-pass filter for ostroturbus and non-ostoter activities. So in the last few minutes, let me tell you about some ongoing work that's not yet published, which extends this analysis to the fact that these macrophage. To the fact that these macrophages, actually, which we're stimulating with all of these different immune threats, they are actually not monolithic cells. They are highly plastic and they are affected by the micro-environmental cytokines. So, in vitro, we can polarize these macrophages into different types of macrophages with using these polarizing cytokines. And then Cytokines and then stimulate them with the different threats. So that means we have 48 conditions. In each case, we generate a lot of data. So let me, and then this data, we've essentially used our codons, which we have previously shown contain all the information. The codons as a way of dimensional analytics reducing our data. So, by dimensionality reducing our data, we are able to look at correlations between replicate one and replicate two. Fortunately, you see good reproducibility on the diagonal. And you also see that M0, which is the first little square in each case, is very stimulus-specific. There are no correlations, right? But what you do see is some off-diagonal correlations. Diagonal correlations, and that suggests that polarization modifies signaling dynamics, and some polarization conditions converge signals. So, it's a really complex set of dynamics and data and correlations. And so, we did a little bit to analyze this. And so, one way is to say, well, one fundamental point is: can we measure the threat level? Level. The threat level, there's host, there's cytokine that comes from the host, and there's pathogen. Presumably, you need a different response. The threat level to pathogen should be higher than host. So by linear discriminant analysis, we try to maximize the difference between host and pathogen, and we see that that is in fact possible. And that every polarization condition state the The threat level stays to the right for pathogens, but there is a little bit of overlap. There's some convergence for some. And then we can look into what these dots are in terms of their ligands. And you can see that the ligands are distributed depending on what the polarization conditions were. So that means the polarizers increase, some polarizers increase. Increase some polarizers increase and some decrease the threat level, and that the polarizers' effects are not affecting all stimuli equally, but the effects are simul-specific. So let's get away from the codons and see whether we can do something that is featureless. And the Pek Sha Singh, who did this work, used a long, short-term memory machine learning model. And trained it, was aware of overfitting issue risks and accounted for that. And then determined the model performance and, of course, also the confusion. And what we find from that is that the F1 score, which is high for unpolarized macrophages, drops particularly with interferon beta and with R4. Data and with RL4. And so those are very different types of polarization conditions, but both have the effect of dropping the F1 score or the specificity to the different immune threats. So meaning that these conditions lead to more of a convergence of the responses. And that has actually, for the two ligands, very different effects, whereas IL-4 dampens some of dampens response. Some of them dampens responses to viral ligands, and that leads to confusion. So, here I'll see that. So, R848 has a higher duration than TNF, but in R4, the duration is more equal. And oscillatory responses are also less distinct. And whereas interference beta converges signaling by Converges signaling by not dampening but enhancing the responses to viral ligands, and you see that again here with the duration. And early versus late means that the activity is later with this drops. So what we're seeing basically is that these macrophages, and the big picture might be macrophages, have two distinct sort of broad functions. One is sentinel functions that are important about. Functions that are about orchestrating the immune response, inter-secreting cytokines, recruiting other immune cells. And those functions have to be very threat specific. And the other function of the macrophage actually is, it's a macrophage. It eats bacteria. And so it has effective functions. It neutralizes pathogen, and those responses are more stereotyped. It doesn't matter what the pathogen. It doesn't matter what the pathogen is, you gobble it up and eat it up. And so, and so, what polarizers seem to do, they have to rebalance the sentinel versus effective functions of macrophages. So, I showed you this sort of approach here of generating lots of signal stimulus response data and using machine learning to account for the threat discrimination or to characterize threat discrimination. And that got us thinking that maybe we can use these stimulus responses to dynamics also to actually map a landscape of different polarization states. Similar to how people use single-cell RNA-seq, but single-cell RNA-seq is a static measurement. And here we're having a functional stimulus response measurement. And so we're using functional PCA, for example, for this purpose to dimensionality reduce. To dimensionality to reduce this in a featureless manner. And indeed, we see that for different polarization conditions in different colors can be distinguished when cells are stimulated with Panthe-CSK, but actually not very well with TNF. So PAMTO-CSK reveals the differences in a network. And similar conclusion comes from when we're using our codons, the dimensional, to reduce our complex data. Our complex data where the PCH has uses is on the six codons. TNF, very little distinction. PAM3CSK, very good distinction. So this work is in progress and look, wish I could discuss more in person, that maybe this afternoon, we've attempted to use stimulus responses to map the functional cell states. And the context is basically that. The context is basically that so far cell states are mapped either by chromatin single cell ATAC or gene expression single cell RNA-seq. These are static measurements. But the reality is if we want to functional, if we want to categorize or map cells based on biological function, we need to do something that probes their response, or in the case of macrophages, the stimulus response. And that's what we're attempting to do here. So, the work was all of this imaging work that really changed our trajectory here. It was done by Brooks Taylor many years ago. Adi Adelaya brought it to fruition and now Axel Singh is working on it. And I'd like to acknowledge amazing contributions from Roy Woolman and Eric Dietz to give us inspiration. And I have to say, I have the best-looking lab than anybody. than anybody. Thank you very much. Just to interject, so the people, the participants in the room, they may have trouble asking questions right now. I think Carlos is just on the way to maybe help facilitate that. So if anyone in Zoom has a question, now might be the right time. I guess I can start. Alex, it's a great talk as yours. So in the first part, So in the first part, you did your processing independently of the concentration of ligands, I guess, right? And no, we when we try to identify the single encodons, we yeah, no, we used both we attempted to distinguish both the ligand and dose. But when you you ended up with two bits, it's mostly independent of concentration, right? It includes concentration, right? Okay. Concentration. Right. Okay. So, yeah, it's both concentration and ligand. Yeah. So it's only two bits. Okay. I see a lot of questions from Europe, so let the Europeans ask this afternoon. Aneta? Yeah, great. Thanks. It was an amazing talk. I have first a basic question. The way I understand all the experiments, they were done with constant. One with constant ligands. So, do you, yeah, correct? Correct, yeah. So, actually, I should define what I mean. So, we add the ligand one time, but of course, the ligand decays over time. So, in that sense, it's not constant, it's also consumed to some extent. Yeah, but would you expect, for example, the signal encodons to change if you would have? Change if you would have signals that change over time? Well, I think certainly you would see a difference in, I would say, the deployment of signaling codons, whether you actually have different types of codons that you could discover, maybe. So I think the space, the potential space is bigger than what we've interrogated. You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. You know, there's also other ligands you could try. So there may be additional codons to be discovered. And then the ones that we've discovered or identified may be deployed differently depending on how you stimulate. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, maybe I can just sort of great talk. Hi, Thomas. Good to see you from the distance. Hopefully soon in person. Hopefully, soon in person again. So, it was really great talks. It just leads me to ask you a speculative question. So, what do you think about the receivers of the words? I mean, people have worked a lot on, say, transcription factors downstream of NF copper B and so on, but do you think these are very specific units, or it's rather a very distributed type of? The very distributed collection of effects. The receivers. So, in this case, the receivers are genes, right? And the genes, and there are many of them, right? So in some of our recent work, we sort of try to develop math models for about 100 of them. You know, I mean, when I say math, they're all similar models, but they have different parameters. Different parameters. And some are able to distinguish some of these codons better than others. And so that's how I would think about that, right? So that some genes show more specificity than other genes, and those that show specificity use different mechanisms to or different. Different use different mechanisms and therefore sensitive to different codons and how they respond specifically. Okay, thanks. And then there's Oma. Hi, Alex. Yeah, thanks. Very nice talk. So two quick questions, I think. Are there any other transcription factors that these TLRs regulate? Absolutely. There's probably three other pathways. Three other pathways. One is GNK, the other one is MAP kinase P38, and the third is IRF signaling. So, and certainly MAPK P38 and also IRF show quite a bit of specificity, stimulus specificity. They may also show some dynamics, stimulus-specific dynamics, but are probably less pronounced than NFLB. Okay. NF probably. Okay. So you don't think that they could increase the resolution to differentiate the ligands? Absolutely, they will. They will. So I think when we're talking, so in response to Thomas's question about the genes, right? So when we looked at 100 genes and we made sure that those are solely regulated by NFCAB and not by the other ones. Yeah. So no, no, no, those other pathways definitely add information. Absolutely. Yeah. And then just another quick question. So I And then just another quick question. So I work a lot on ITAM receptors. And I'm kind of curious. So I think macrophages have multiple ITAM receptors that I think would also activate NF-kappa-B. I wondered if you've ever thought about looking at those or are they more of the phenotype that, for example, just cause macrophages to eat and therefore it's not really important to differentiate their limits? I think the connection between ITAMS and NFIB is not as clear, as far as I understand. I think that some of them are also inhibitory. Think that some of them are also inhibitory, right? And they may function through TLRs. But we haven't done any our own research on this yet. I only know a little bit from the literature. Okay, thanks. Would be great to do more. Can you hear us, Alex? Yes, I can. Oh, that looks like a question. Can I ask a question? You'll need to come near the computer at the front of the room. You need to come near to the computer at the front of the room to ask a question. My apologies. Hello. Oh, hi there. Great talk. I have a question regarding the syndrome. So whenever you have a classifier, there's always directions that will be very fragile to the classifier. So for instance, antagonistic interactions for ligand recognition are directions like this. Are directions like this? So I was wondering if there is something special related to the syndrome. Is it kind of the easiest way to basically put confusion in your metrics or is it kind of nothing special? Have you looked into this? Because we already studied this mathematically and I was wondering if there was something special there. Right. So in this case, this particular, so this particular, the Sjurgen syndrome has many different etiologies. But one set of patients appeared to have genetic mutations in the promoter that controls this ICAB alpha gene. And so that's the one we used, right? So we sort of stacked the work in our favor in some sense by using something that we knew was going to have a bigger difference. But since then, we've also looked at macro. Macrophages from high-fat diet, obese mice, or from just old mice. And we also see differences there, right? Which we cannot, we don't know exactly why, you know, but so the dynamics do give you a sense of the state that the cell is in, like you would expect, really. Yeah. Okay. I guess if you are around for the discussion, I would like to ask you more questions about this. Discussion: I would like to ask you more questions about this, but okay. Anton, I would thanks. Hi, Alex. Oh, hi, Anton. So thanks for paving the way. Well, thanks for a great job. So I just want to follow up on Gregor's question. You probably explained, but if you just to clarify a little more, so all these experiments are in single cytokine conditions, right? They're not a mixture. Yeah, they're not combined cytokines. They're just. Combine cytokines. That just, I understood that whether we were looking at different doses. Yeah, we looked at different doses, but we did not combine cytokines in this. We have combined cytokines since then. So, and by and large, we do not see any non-additive effects. And so, you don't see a problem. So, the seven out the wood. The word, the seven-letter output word, is still unambiguously able to distinguish between all the pairwise inputs at least? No, no, not necessarily. So, for example, if I mixed LPS and TNF and they added together, that means LPS is which is the dominant signaling pathway. Basically, TNF can't modulate that. Okay. TNF plus LPS is exactly like LPS. LPS is exactly like LPS. I can't distinguish between even at low dose of LPS. No, at some low dose of LPS, then TNF. So when I say additively, I mean within the network. I don't mean algebraic addition of the signaling codons, but within the dynamical systems network, the model that I described with The model that I described, whether you have these different modules of receptors and they feed together and converge to the cytokine, that module can account for all of the different combinations that we've tested so far. We tested it because we were hoping to find cases where there is synergy or antagonism that is not accounted for by the model, but we didn't find any of that. Okay, I think Jayjit has a question. Okay, I think Jayajit has a question, but I'm looking forward to some more during discussion. Hi, Jayajit here. Great talk. I have a quick question. So I was wondering what is the effect of cell-to-cell variations of the kinetics? Let's say 10% of the cells show oscillatory behavior, but the rest do not, right? So how would that affect detection of You know, affect detection of the signaling codes, you know, you have done? Well, it definitely diminishes the precision of being able to distinguish, right? And so I think when we see confusion, that's because of this heterogeneity. And we also find when we're using these polarizing conditions that some polarizers shift the mean and other polarizers simply Other polarizers simply alter the width of the distribution. And so it's a very good point. The heterogeneity is key. Now, the heterogeneity that we observe in vitro may be an overestimate of how heterogeneous cells are actually in vivo. It's, you know, because of our technology. Because of our technical error, too, and in detecting signals and so forth. So I think whenever we're making these kind of statements about 2.1 bits or 85% F1 score or this kind of thing, those are always underestimates because we cannot distinguish technical from biological variation. But there is variation. Right, right, right. Because if you look at Right, because you know, in if you look at you know, flow data, you know, stimulate you know, T cells and K cells, you know, a tiny fraction of them, you know, become activated, but you know, probably those are just doing the job, right? Restor. Right. Right. How do you apply this framework in that context? Yeah. Yeah. And the other difficulty, of course, then is if you have this heterogeneity and you want to examine, for example, how are these signals decoded by target genes, you really You really, you know, we don't have the capability yet of looking at single-cell chromatin modifications rapidly, you know, after seeing after observing NFKB dynamic signals and this kind of thing. So there is a disconnect yet, you know, being truly to be able to account for single cell regulation, I think it's going to take a little bit more technology. It's going to take a little bit more technological development. Thank you. Thanks.
