Thank you very much for that, I presume, kind introduction, but I heard nothing. So anyway, great. So here we are. So anyway, thank you very, very much for, I appreciate very much the organizers' invitation to let me talk about this today. So of course, it's been a weird period past couple of years. Weird period, past couple of years. And this is the first talk I've given in a long time. And furthermore, it's a talk about basically about a subject that I feel like I and we maybe as a community, maybe there are things I'm missing, know almost nothing about. At the same time, there's some questions that I think are very, very compelling. And anyway, so. And anyway, so the talk will be informal in a lot of ways. Some of the mathematical facts that I state will be stated in sort of general way. Hopefully it'll be understandable. And there'll be a number of questions I think are quite interesting. Maybe some of them seem impossibly difficult. I don't know. That's maybe our doom at this point. Our doom at this moment. Anyway, so let me let me let me start. So, how do I do this? Here we go. So, so here's a brief outline of the talk. So, I'm going to talk about what we've been calling the Weyl principle. You know, it has something to do with sort of the scope of Riemannian geometry. Talk about maybe one of the first instances where the problem arises. Instances where the problem arises, context hybrid services. Let's next talk a little bit about how we're able to frame the problem in a bit more precise way than at least that's at least one thing we've been able to do. Just maybe understand a little bit how to state the problem, if nothing else, in terms of the so-called normal cycle. Talk about one case where we have sort of at least in some sense some success or we sort of know something, definable spaces. Definable spaces, subanalytic spaces. Here I'm talking about spaces definable with respect to some so-called O-minimal structure. Talking in another case, PL spaces, piecewise flat spaces, where again we know something, but there's, I would say some of the things we do know are actually sort of are the sources of further mysteries. And then talk a little bit about, I mean, just, I don't know. A little bit about, I mean, just I don't know, just some sort of abstract nonsense I kind of dreamed up for for the purposes of thinking about this problem. Nothing too fancy, nothing too deep, but maybe something will stimulate somebody's thinking. And finally, maybe talk a little bit about this mathematics I've been trying to learn about over the past few years in fits and starts. Starts. I mean, again, I'm very distractible and I haven't made as much progress on understanding this stuff as I feel I ought to. But anyway, this sort of beautiful work, very striking work by these two statisticians, Robert Adler and Jonathan Taylor. And maybe that'll help people a little bit. Okay, so anyway, so on a personal note, let me just start. Like, you know, so this is a problem I've been, oh, anyway, before I go on, let me just. And anyway, before I go on, let me just talk about contributors to this line of thinking. Some of the great names in mathematics have been associated with this general thought. You know, Gauss, of course, involved with everything. Jakob Steiner, Minkowski, Hermann de Weil, Chern, Herbert Feder, Alfred Gray, A.D. Alexandrov, Hugo Heidegger. More recently, some people who probably mostly alive today, Jeff Chiger, Vern Mueller, Robert Schrouder, Harold Donnelly, Tom Banshaw. Rauter, Harold Donnelly, Tom Banshoff, Partisan Sala, Jan Rattai, Peter Vinken, Ludwig Brecker. I hope Ludwig is here. Then I'm calling the postmodern period, try to keep my cultural references fresh here. So Samuel Lesker, Keep Figure, Andreas Bernik, Jean-Marie Moran-Vant, Dujean-Pucorny, Alexander Licha, Thomas Vonner, Jill Solanas. Thomas Vonner, Jill Solanas, Dimitri Feifman, Daniel Hoog, Robert Alder, and Jonathan Taylor, whom I just mentioned, all making, I think, serious contributions to this subject. I apologize in advance, I am not doing well with attributing results on the fly during the course, the substance of the talk. So I apologize in advance. Let me just also, oops, can this be seen? Yeah. If Ludwig Brecker is here, I just wanted to give a little shout out. I just wanted to give a little shout out to him. He organized a bunch of conferences around the turn of the century and minister, brought a lot of people together. And I really feel like those conferences were the sort of the key to getting us as far as we are on this problem and related problems. Anyway, maybe hopefully this conference here will push us into the next phase of things. Okay, so. Okay, so this talk, as I say, is sort of broadly about what I call the, or what many of you will think, so-called vial principle. Okay, maybe you'll explain, or we'll come across why we call it the vial principle in a little bit. But anyway, the general idea is that sometimes you've got some geometric quantities that might be associated with some embedded object, some object A, typically embedded into some other. Typically embedded into some other space like Euclidean space, for example. But often that geometric quantity can be constructed, reproduced just from the intrinsic structure of A. So this is probably the, you know, there's this great example, classic example, the terium agrigum of Gauss. So it says, if you've got, here's where we have a very satisfying statement of the problem and even a very satisfying answer. That very satisfying answer. So, if I've got a smooth surface, if I look at this Gauss map, and then the determinant of the derivative of that Gauss map is so-called Gaussian curvature, and it turns out to be computable from the inner metric structure of the surface itself. And maybe the most, to me, the most satisfying way of thinking about this maybe is in terms of these ball volumes. Look at a geodesic ball of radio. At a geodesic ball of radius r about some point p and well take its area and it turns out well the leading term is just pi r squared but there's a there's a fourth order term which is expressible in terms of that same quantity k of p and then uh that's that's it and furthermore i like this way of saying these things we don't need any christoffel symbols or any of this nonsense but we can just discuss this this quantity in purely metric terms this object be of Purely metric terms. This object B of P R is the set of points joinable to the center P by a curve of length that's or equal to R. This, of course, applies only for small values of R. Okay, so that's great. That's an old success story. So to bring it into the modern context, well, this is still not quite modern, but if we have a convex body in Rn, so my little telegraphic. My little telegraphic notation here for convex bodies in Rn. Then its volume, as I think almost probably most of you, if not all of you know, its volume is given by a polynomial of degree n. And the coefficients, well, are these what? These are sphere volumes. Little omega is the volume of the sphere of dimension n minus k. Ball, if you think, ball of dimension n minus k. And then we introduce these quantities. I'd like to denote the mu sub. I'd like to denote them mu sub k, so-called intrinsic volumes of A. And anyway, these intrinsic volumes turn out to be so-called valuations, which is a key concept for me. I feel like, again, this is one of the key advances we have in our understanding of this general framework. I guess basically Samuel Esker's work brought this to my attention at least. work brought this to my attention at least. These things are finitely additive. So for me, the way to say this is what? You can also apply them not just to convex bodies, but also to say finite unions of convex bodies. And they are, as I say, finitely additive quantities. So if you apply the extract this number from a union, it's just the sum of the quantities associated. Uh, quantities associated to the two constituents with the intersection removed. So, um, yeah, and so um, that's a classical fact, but then this this gets some extra intrigue, some extra mystery, some extra significance from this amazing theorem of Weil, Hermann Weil from 1939, usually called the Weil tube formula, but somehow the formula is not the. But somehow the formula is not the point, but rather this other point, this other characterization of the formula. So I call the Bottle Tube theorem. So, first of all, it says that this Steiner formula holds for, at least for small values of R, for smooth, compact submanifolds of M. And the coefficients are in fact so-called intrinsic quantities. So in particular, they can be constructed as integrals. They can be constructed as integrals of contractions of the curvature tensor. So yeah, so they just come for the metric, albeit in a more complicated way than we described simply for a surface. This also holds if M has a boundary, first of several incompetently navigated historical points. I don't know who did this. I don't know who did this first, the boundary case, but in this case, these quantities also involve the second fundamental form of the boundary thought of as a hypersurface within the Riemannian manifold M. So if there's no boundary, then half of these things vanish. Just a slide point. And what else? These things, again, have come to be called total Lipschitz killing curvatures. Again, the Lipschitz killing curvatures. Again, the history behind this name is unclear to me, but anyway, that's what we have. We've just been doing it that way. The top one, the one associated with the dimension of M, is just the volume of M. And the lowest one, the zeroth one, is always just the other characteristic of M. So these beautiful, the ones in between are somehow some kinds of intermediaries between those two extreme cases. To extreme cases. So then there's this decisive move ahead in 1959 when Herbert Federer introduced, well, the so-called sets with positive reach, PR sets, essentially analyzing the case, analyzing the phenomenon of two polynomials pretty much completely, I would say, sort of giving a definitive answer to when volumes are. Volumes are polynomials in the radius. Okay, well, work of Daniel Hoog actually, and I think his collaborators showed that this is not literally true, but in order for the two coefficients to have some kind of geometric meaning, this is the case. So basically, just a PR set is one where there's always a unique closest point within the set, to a given point, at least within. A given point within at least within a certain range, which we call the reach. Now, one curious feature of these sets is that they are definitely no longer manifolds. In fact, their dimensions, the local dimension of such a set can vary from point to point. If you can see my screen here, I don't know, this is, if I just, for example, have some kind of object like this. It's like a little, just look at my board there. At my board, there you know, you have a little blob with a tail on it. So, somehow, one of the issues here is that, well, that we'll get to the question because of this moment. These are definitely not manifolds. They're definitely not subject to anything like a classical theory of involving a curvature tensor and things of that nature. So, in principle, In principle, the PR class includes the previous cases I discussed: the convex bodies and the compact, smooth submanifolds. So somehow it's a comprehensive theory. And I guess one of the key points is that the tube formula actually localizes. So if you look at a tube around the given set, but you only consider those points in the ambient space where the unique closest point, this closest point projection here, will This closest point projection here belongs to a given set E, then the volume is still a polynomial, and the coefficient is now the so-called K-the-curvature measure associated to A evaluated at the set E. So as I say, these things are signed measures. Okay. And I guess, yeah, what else? So since phi, zero corresponds to zero corresponds to mu zero, which is Euler characteristic, then one of the wonderful things, perhaps very seductive things about this subject is that this phi zero is something like the Cherngas-Binet curvature. So it integrates its total variation is just the Euler factors to get A. And another fact that comes out of Federer's theory is that there are these so-called kinematic formulas. I guess those had previously been known. Those had previously been known, at least for convex bodies. I'm not going to say a lot more about those, but those who know know. And maybe some of the facts I discuss in the slides to come will have reference, at least oblique reference to this fact. Okay, so anyway, so the first question, as I say, this incredibly to me, and I should say, To me, and I should say, I encountered this, on a personal note, I encountered these basic things like Fedders' work, learned about Vial's work as a young student, and immediately there's sort of this completely, to me, completely irresistible problem question. So does the Weil principle apply to PR sets? So in other words, if I've got a set with positive reach, I can construct. Set with positive reach. I can construct these mu k's. I can even localize them as phi k's. The question is: can these quantities, this mu k, this number, this phi k, this measure, be reconstructed from the metric space structure of A? It's not too hard to show that if I've got a connected PR set, then any two points can be connected, can be joined by a curve of finite length, even a minimal curve, a curve of minimal. a curve of minimal length, a geodesic, but how to construct these quantities, this valuation and this measure from that structure remains basically a wide open question, but it's sort of, as I say, it's now irresistible. So let me mention that this subject of curvature measures, mild principle for curvature measures and so on is Principle for curvature measures and so on is, I will say this again, probably in a few slides, but somehow in general, I think of it as somehow being orthogonal, disjoint, what have you, from the sort of this mainstream of metric geometry involving one-sided curvature bounds. Nonetheless, Lichak in 04 did show that PR set is always a cat case base. That means it's That means it has curvature bounded above in a certain virtual sense. What else? Oh, yeah. And so there's one sort of positive answer that we can give to this question, which is that if I've got a set which is actually convex, an actual convex set, then actually with a little bit of trickery, one can reconstruct the One can reconstruct the, here I've said, the intrinsic volumes, the mu k's, but also by other methods, the phi k's. I won't write that down here. One can construct the tube coefficients by intrinsic means, just by looking at distances and within the set itself. And so the idea here is this. So just look at all points within the set, okay, and look at the Okay, and look at the metric ball around that around the point within the metric of the set, okay, and intersect that with the boundary of A and take the Euler characteristic. So that's an energy-valued function of P for each value of R, integrate that with respect to P, and voila, turns out you get the same tube formula, more or less, except with these signs. These mu k's are the mu k's as before. So here we have actually succeeded in proving. Succeeded in proving the File principle for convex bodies, convex subsets in Euclidean space. So that's sort of hopeful, but unfortunately, it doesn't go too much further than that. So maybe the next case where we might hope to have success, at least if we react optimistically to the fact I just mentioned, is to consider. Is to consider the case of a smooth hypersurface, the boundary of a convex set. Well, here I said smooth hypersurface. In fact, if it's a smooth hypersurface, then of course the Weil formula holds. And there's this nice formula. The curvature measures of the smooth manifold are just twice the curvature measures of the body itself, or else zero, depending on whether the parity. Zero, depending on whether the parody is right or not. But as I say, the sort of the next irresistible question is that, you know, if A, if the boundary of A is not smooth, then that boundary is definitely not PR either. And the Weil principle question again arises. And, well, again, we have no Riemannian structure to this thing. Structure to this thing. In fact, the curvature measures, or these so-called curvature intervals, could be, for example, fractally distributed in simple examples. Okay, so the answer to this bile principle, though, at least is true. It's positive if the manifold, this geodesic hypersurface is actually a surface dimension too. It's a well-known train of thought. Well-known train of thought due to A.D. Alexandrov, although to my taste, the literature is not in great shape. So it's sort of hard to find a really technically satisfying discussion of this stuff. But here's the basic idea. So Alexandrov, in fact, introduced these so-called, you call them manifolds of bound curvature. There's a very interesting address you can find in the You can find in the proceedings of the ICM in Edinburgh in 1958 by Alexandroff. So, the idea is simply to use Gauss-Binet to construct this Gauss curvature measure intrinsically. So, basically, if you've got a geodesic triangle inside your convex surface, you can just look at the angle deficit for the geodesic triangle, or surplus, I guess, the way I've written it here. And well, according to Gauss-Vinet, that should this. Gauss-Vinay, that should, this surplus should measure how much curvature is within the, lies within the triangle. So you just insist, well, I guess in this case, you observe that for a convex hypersurface, whenever you've got a disjoint family, the sum of the angle surpluses is dominated by 4π. And then maybe if I further hocus-pocus, which I again cannot give you a good reference for, you can construct. You have a good reference for you can construct this curvature measure just by this sort of simple measure theoretic construction. And it's tempting to think that one could try the volume of balls approach that I gave to the Terramer Gray Grum, but there are technical difficulties with this approach because of the vanishing of the, well, we should say, injectivity radius could be zero essentially everywhere. And so these balls. Essentially, everywhere. And so these balls sort of don't actually have the volumes you'd expect. Okay. And what's more, you can go, Alexandrov didn't just talk about these convex surfaces, but also surfaces with possible negative curvature. Yeah, and let me point out again that such manifolds of bounded curvature may have, for example, atoms of positive Gauss curvature and of negative Gauss curvature both. And of negative Gauss curvature, both, and in particular, there's no one-sided curvature bound possible. Okay, in higher dimensions, the problem is completely open, even in dimension three. You might try to think about the, even in dimension three, think about the scalar curvature, again, in terms of volumes of balls, but the same difficulty arises. Okay, so. So, what can we say about this problem? So, I guess I want to at least try to frame it in its natural generality. So, again, there's this broad vial principle. We know that it's true in a few special cases. We are tempted to think it's true in other cases. And now I'm going to give you a whole framework where we will again be tempted to think it's true. Be tempted to think it's true, although I won't be able to give you a whole lot of concrete evidence or arguments for that claim. So, basically, the question is: for what objects can this be framed in this sense? So anyway, the two volumes incidentally should properly be replaced by these quantities here, these integrals of Euler characteristics of intersections of. Of intersections of balls with the subject body, you'll observe that if A is smooth enough or convex, for example, then this, for small values of R, this set here is always contractible or empty. Hence, this is precisely the two volume in those. Nonetheless, this is some of the right thing to do. Okay, and so in order to extend these ideas to more general, general. To more general sets, general spaces, singular spaces. There's a long-standing device, which I like to call the Euler-Morse theory of height functions. It's basically just Morse theory where the indices are measured, are taken only in terms of Euler characteristic, kind of reductive approach to Morse theory, kind of ignores a lot of information. So you define this. So Euler, Morse index of, you know, if you've got some set. Got some set, A, some topological space A. I guess I'm framing it as a subspace of Rn. May think of it as a PR set or a convex set or manifold or anything like that. So if you've got a smooth function on the ambient space, I define this Euler-Morse index by simply looking at the sublevel sets of the function, well, intersected with A, and see how the Euler characteristic changes as one passes through the point. One passes through the point x. So if x is a critical point, typically this will be non-zero. Otherwise, it will be zero. And I should say that this index as a function of A satisfies this finite additivity condition because of the finite additivity of Euler characteristics. So there's this inclusion-exclusion principle holds for it. And so in general, one can define, for example, the zeroth, the The zero, the Chern-Gauss-Binet curvature measure, in terms of these Euler-Morse indices, you simply look at all points of the sphere for each point of the sphere. You look at the height function in that direction. You take the Euler-Morse index at all points belonging to the set you're trying to take the measure of, add them up, and there you go. And then integrate over all possible directions. So that's a classical expression. That's a classical expression. And another nice expression for this is that, well, if you look at the so-called normal cycle of A, well, simply, I guess here I've written as the conic normal cycle, which came to my attention through the work of Martina Sela and Peter Vincen in the 1980s. Well, what is it? You're basically looking at the outward pointing normals in the case of a convex set here. So you look at all. set here so that you look at all points of a together with points that vectors that point away uh if a is who it's a manifold it's simply the essentially the normal the normal bundle and it's also definable for a pr set if you give this thing a nice orientation then you can carry out an intersection product with the graph of a given smooth function and if you just look at the so this uh this will be some some uh This will be some sum of points with multiplicities. If you think of that as some kind of atomic measure upstairs in Rn cross Rn and look at the pre-image of a point under the projection of Rn cross Rn to the base space, the first factor, then this intersection gives you precisely this Euler-Morse index. So this normal cycle thing is sort of this key object. So it turns out So it turns out that these things are, these normal cycles are uniquely determined essentially by those relations. Where are they? Relations one. There they are. That the Euler-Morse index is given by the intersection numbers. Okay. So, of course, this Euler... Of course, this Euler, this conic Lagrangian thing has infinite volume. So we can make it finite volume by restricting to the unit vectors. This NC thing here is in the case of A simply the graph of the Gauss map of A. Again, these things as maps to spaces of integral currents are finally additive. And sometimes... And sometimes you can construct them in a nice way. If you take, say, some, I mean, typically, this is how it's done historically. You take some family of sets, some continuous family sets decreasing to A, and suppose that these things are nice enough that you know they have normal cycles, and suppose they're nice enough that their masses are uniformly bounded, then typically one can construct the normal cycle of A as the limit of the normal cycle. Of A as the limit of the normal cycles of A sub R. Okay, so this condition here is key invoking, which the federal filling compactness theorem for intercurrence into play. Okay, so what's our motto? Our principle here is that the vial principle makes sense anytime this normal cycle exists. Well, why? Because if a normal cycle exists, then you can construct in some sense. Construct in some sense the analogues of these intrinsic volumes and the federal curvature measures. So here's one of the maybe a conjecture that arises pretty much immediately from this motto, from this vile principle I've stated here. Again, kind of irresistible to me. So it says this, that suppose you've got a kind of So it says this: that suppose you've got a compact, smooth, submanifold, then, well, according to the logic I just outlined above, if I loosen it up slightly, if I take a limit of such things, suppose I put bounds on the masses of those, of their normal cycles, then the limit of the normal cycles should often be the limit of the normal cycle of the limiting object. And so the question is. So, the question is: Does that limiting object satisfy the Weil principle? Well, the very first condition for that to be true would be that the limiting object actually is an inner metric space. It actually has a, you can actually measure distances within the space. So, in order for that to be true, well, I suppose the approximating objects should also have uniform, should all have uniformly bounded intrinsic diameters. intrinsic diameters so so anyway so here's the here's the uh here's the inequality the conjectured inequality oh i should probably have included simply not said that this is valid in this way but perhaps bound even by some function of this thing um yeah so it turns out to be true in in the case of a two-dimensional manifold um so i proved this by some some horrible means in 04 and later peter topping Peter Topping, completely unaware of this line of thinking, gave another theorem in a different direction, which also gives a better bound, but also say a more elegant solution of this conjecture in this dimension only. Okay, so again, that's a fundamental question in my view. So moving onward, let's just talk. So moving onward, let's just talk about some spaces for which are subject to this normal cycle construction and therefore subject to what I call the Weil principle problem. So if I've got some O-minimal structure, like, I don't know, I guess sub-ellipticity, I guess, is the best known, perhaps, it turns out that you can always construct a normal cycle. So the way you do it is by essentially by that. The way you do it is by essentially by that continuous nesting instruction. You view such a thing as an intersection of a continuous family of nicer definable sets and take a limit. So, oh yeah, I should say one way that this line of thinking does make contact with, as I say, the mainstream of metric geometry over the past few decades is this. Over the past few decades, is this nice theorem of Andreas Bernigan O2? It gives a lower bound on the, well, what one might call the scalar curvature measure of a definable space. It also satisfies a lower curvature bound in the sense of Alexandrov. Okay, so it turns out that the Weyl principle kind of holds for these definable sets, although, I mean, I Sets. Although, I mean, anyway, so let me tell you the theorem. I'm going to call it a folk theorem. I've been, you know, nobody's written this down because the proof is so somehow disappointing. And maybe even the statement is a little bit disappointing. So it says this, suppose I've got a couple of sets that are definable with respect to some ominable structure and a definable map between them. And suppose this definable map is actually an isometry in the sense that it preserves curve lengths. it preserves curve length then then then the the the curvature measures behave properly okay and so i guess what may what i want to point out is that somehow you know yes this is sort of a proof of the vile principle but you know there's this there's this sort of pesky extra condition on our isometry that is that is the map has to be definable so we're using the structure the ominous structure the ominal structure to to to to to prove this some which is somehow again somehow orthogonal unrelated to the to the metric structure and well anyway i and and also it sort of doesn't tell us as you'll see uh how to construct these things from the metric structure other in any in any uh in any uh uh enlightening way so um yeah Yeah. So, yeah. Oh, so in particular, it relies on stratifications. So, PR sets are not stratified. General convex hyperserphas are not stratified, not in any useful set. Okay, so anyway, here's a little sketch of the proof. Maybe I won't go into that, but again, it simply uses somehow this continuous nesting construction based on, well, some definable function that cuts out. Definable function that cuts out the singular set of a definable space. Anyway, I'll post this slides and I won't go through this proof today, but as I say, I'm kind of not really satisfied with this argument. I mean, it works. The theorem is true, but whatever, as we say, nothing to enlighten. Say nothing, nothing too enlightening. Okay, so moving on, of course, there let's think about these piecewise flat spaces, which received a lot of attention historically in this subject. Of course, these things are also definable, but they have special features which permit a more satisfying discussion. So maybe one of the earlier appearances. Earlier appearances of stuff in literature is from Banshoff in 67. So he studied these piecewise flat spaces. You can think of them as simple sort of complexes with metrics, which are flat on each simplex. And he used this Euler-Morse theory to define, in particular, the Gauss-Chern-Gauss-Binet curvature measure, which lives only on the vertices of the simplest complex. And he gave this nice theorem, this nice formula. This nice formula in terms of that. It's like slightly non-obvious formula. Basically, if you look at any vertex, what's the curvature there? Well, you look at all the simplices incident to it. You look at the exterior angle of that simplex at V, and you group them by dimension, sum up those exterior angles in each group, and then sum those alternatingly with these signs given by the dimension. So it's a nice formula. So it's a nice formula. Banshoff went so far as labeling this the terema egregium for piecewise flat spaces. I guess, you know, thinking about this, I sort of started to doubt that, you know, it really deserves that name. For one thing, like, you know, how do you measure these exterior angles? Well, somehow you definitely need the cell structure in order to know what's a simplex and what's not, which is not. Complex and what's not, which is not, again, strictly metric. Later, Tiger Miller and Schrader, in the course of their, I would say, landmark paper, which I'll talk more about, gave a more complicated formula based on this one in terms of interior angles. Again, when I read that, I was like, I was thinking, okay, here's our intrinsic formula. But again, I mean, if you, on reflection, it's not entirely satisfying. You know, so the cell structure, in order to write down these formulas, you definitely In order to write down these formulas, you definitely need to use the cell structure. So here's a little problem. Maybe it's not that hard, or maybe it's maybe it's not that hard. Maybe it's just complicated. I don't know. I haven't worked it out. I haven't really made a serious attempt to work it out, but that's purely due to my slovenliness. But so here's a problem. So to adapt the Chigermiller-Schrouder formula to express Schrader formula to express it in terms of purely metric terms. So I feel like it seems to me looking at that formula, just looking at the metric links of various points and iterating the process, looking at the links of the links and so on, one should be able to reconstruct the Georgia Miller Schroeder formula purely in metric terms. I think that would be an interesting exercise. It could get a little bit complicated and messy, but there it is. But there it is. Okay, so the real landmark here on the Jude Mueller Schrader was this one. Basically, let me, I've tried to state it in a way that makes technical sense. I'm not sure I succeeded. It's a little bit hard to interpret what they mean. The general sense of their theorem, I think, is clear. And the challenge of framing it in a completely different way. Of framing it in a completely rigorous way is not, in some sense, not serious, but maybe a little bit elusive. Basically, what they're saying is this. If you've got a smoother Riemannian manifold, suppose you triangulate it, you take it with finer and finer triangulations, okay, and you put metrics on those, on the approximating superscale complexes by taking the distance. By taking the distances between the vertices to be the actual Riemannian distances, okay, and then extending those distances to the interiors of the simplices. So you assume that the diameters of the simplices go to zero as the triangulations become finer and finer and finer. You also assume that the so-called fatnesses of the simplices are bounded below. They don't, they, they, the, the, the, let me just leave it at that. They don't. That they don't become flatter and flatter, so to speak. Then the curvature measures of the polyhedra converge weakly to the curvature measures of the manifold. So that is the Trier-Miller-Schweller-Schweller theorem. Again, to my mind, you know, if we're trying to use this to understand the general Weil principle, this is, again, their approach is somehow somehow deeply unsatisfying. So the proof, for example, relies on the fact that the limiting object is a smooth submanifold, therefore subject to the Ramanian theory. And one basically applies some invariant theory to the curvature tensor to conclude that these limiting measures are the measures you want. So that Riemannian technology is not available, of course. Technology is not available, of course, in a more general situation. So, here's another problem I propose, which is just to turn the tables on the CMS theorem and try to ask the opposite question. Suppose you've got a PL manifold, and suppose you want to approximate that by smooth manifolds, and okay, maybe in some Grumoff-Hausdorff sense. And now the question is, under what conditions will the curvature measures converge to the curvature measure of the PL manifold? Concursion measure of the PL manifold. So, somehow, presumably, you're going to, there's going to be some extra hypothesis needed, something like the, something sort of analogous to the fatness condition on simplices of peak, which I have grown to think of as being probably, well, I, okay, it's an object of faith. It's an object of faith for me. So I'm searching for this notion that there's some idea of curvature size of an abstract Riemannian manifold that if we give it a bound on that, then this problem will have a positive resolution. So somehow this is somehow built on the analogy with the normal cycle. The normal cycle. So, the mass of the normal cycle is something like the extrinsic curvature size. And so, is there something like an intrinsic curvature size that gives us some kind of control of the Riemannian geometry of these things at the level of curvature measures? So, I don't know. I believe it. Why do I believe it? I don't know. I can't justify it. So, but I do. Okay. So, let's see here. So let's see here. So, I guess I thought we'd try to take stock where we are. So, here's our status report. So, we know the Weyl principle for ellipsoids killing curvatures because for smooth manifolds because of, well, we can do algebra essentially with curvature tensors. What else? The PL situation, I claim, well, it's not as good as we think, but maybe there's something we can do. Something we can do. So beyond these cases, we almost know very almost nothing. And as I say, the spaces we're trying to study are not even manifolds in general. They don't have, not only are they not smooth, but they may not even be equidimensional. Even at a local, at a point, in the neighborhood of a point, you may have nearby points where the local dimension varies. So it's hard to say, hard to imagine perhaps what kind of answer one might expect. So, I mean, the, oh yeah, so as I say, there's something about this study, which to me seems orthogonal to the typical theory of one-sided curvature balance. And, oh, yeah, so I just want to give a shout out to this great class of WDC sets. Great class of WDC sets Pokorni Ratai brought into play, which now subsume actually general convex cypher services and PR sets. So somehow, in some sense, these things are the most, are the broadest class we understand today where normal cycles exist. Okay, but anyway, those things are also not equidimensionals. They just make the scope of the Weyl principle problem broader, a little bit more mysterious. Are a little bit more mysterious, a little bit more intractable, if you like. Okay, so I just want to maybe try to give some kind of sort of very abstract nonsense-y proposal for conceptual framework for how you might try to resolve these questions. So first observation is that, well, as Samuel Lesque has pointed out, valuations, these finally objects, at least if they're nice enough, they can be. If they're nice enough, they can be multiplied by one another. And the intrinsic volumes turn out to be, well, essentially powers of the first one. I guess I'm fond of this particular rescaling of mu1. I call that t. And then the powers of t are these various rescalings of the higher intrinsic volumes. Okay, omega k, okay, omega k again is the is the volume of a ball of dimension k. Of dimension k. And you can also multiply valuations by curvature measures, and you can reconstruct all the higher curvature measures, all higher federal curvature measures, simply from the Chern-Gauss-Binet federal curvature measure, simply by this product. So that's a kind of a nice thing. Okay, so in other words, what am I trying to say? There's sort of just two ingredients, just two things. Ingredients, just two things. Okay, not just not two n of them, the mu n, u i, mu k's and the phi k's, but just t and phi zero. And furthermore, these things are kind of tantalized, they seem to lie tantalizingly close at hand. Mu1, actually, if you apply it to curves, gives the length. So mu1 is some kind of some kind of length. Is some kind of privileged extension to evaluation of length measure. So it's something which seems like it must be very, very natural, very, very, well, intrinsic, if you will, to a metric space, to a length space in particular. And then 5-0, it's the Turing-Gauss-Binet term. It's a localization of the simplest possible Euler topological invariant, the Euler characteristic. So how hard could it be? So, how hard could it be to construct this thing? Well, of course, fiendishly hard, but somehow, as I say, it seems to lie close at hand. So anyway, so I love this formalism of evaluations and curvature measures. So I just wanted to maybe just space out for a minute and talk about what kind of things we might have on more general spaces. General spaces. So these are things I just sort of dream about sometimes. Like I've been calling them, well, I haven't been calling them for the purpose of this talk, I'm calling them measured valuations. So basically the idea here is that, you know, if we take the take a cue from Semyon's work on translation invariant valuations on Rn, well, if I've got some metric space X, you know, I can construct like a set function by function by by given from certain simple data give a take some family of nice ish subsets of your space put a measure on that family and then given a set subset a of the space you intersect with with every element of your family take the other characteristic and integrate okay and that's well provided it the integral converges and all these other characteristics are well defined that's a nice valuation it's finally it's Valuation is finally additive, finitely additive. And what's more, there's a natural notion of product, which is easy to write down for two such measured valuations. You simply take the family given by the intersections of the two elements of the two families and integrate again over the intersections with respect to the product measure. So great. So this thing you can certainly do on any space. What's a, yeah, oh yeah. What's it what's a uh yeah, oh yeah, so then of course the the kicker is like what on earth do you want to do with this? How would you actually get mu one? What what what characterizes a family, a measured family uh that actually yields mu1 well this is to me a complete mystery, but but anyway, I guess I am for better or worse proposing this as a as a question or a problem. Okay, another 10. Okay, another tentative definition. What's a curvature measure on the metric space? Well, again, I feel like maybe by analogy with the earlier cases we looked at, maybe you have a family now of functions, nice-ish functions on your space. And again, some measure on that family of functions. And well, to take, to produce this curvature measure associated with the measured family of functions, A here should be, oh, yeah. Should be, oh yeah, so you take A as some subset of X, and you look at the Euler-Morse index of f, of each element of the family, of each function in the family, take the Euler-Morse index in the set you're trying to measure, and integrate over the family. Or else you can perhaps do something a little bit more fancy by considering this product of how you might take a product of a measured. Of a measured valuation with a measured curvature measure. Okay, so whatever. So, again, the question here is: which measured foundation of functions yield phi zero? Again, not that I have any idea how to approach this question. But if you can answer these two questions, bingo, you've solved the vial principle. Okay, so. Okay, so let me conclude by, I guess I say in my introduction, I refer to this as a ray of hope. Again, why does this make me feel hopeful? Perhaps it's more of a desperation reaction than anything else, or maybe just that I just like this. I'm just intrigued by this map. This, I'm just intrigued by this mathematics. Um, anyway, so just to describe a little bit about what Adler and Taylor have done. So, uh, so these guys, I say, are theoretical statisticians. Adler is in Technion in Haifa, and Taylor's over in Stanford. And so they got interested in this problem, apparently, for practical reasons. And they had a third member of their team named Keith Wars. Of their team named Keith Worsley, who I guess there's one interesting article he wrote in, I think it was Science magazine about sort of a real practical application of these ideas. He apparently was an applied statistician to actually had practical interest in these ideas, which is always appealing. So anyway, so their framework was the following. They studied these so-called They study these so-called Gaussian random fields on manifolds. So basically, you take a random function, a random C2 function on a smooth manifold. So here it is. So big omega is your probability space. And you assume that for each point, x here is p, excuse me. Assume that for each point, the distribution of that function is a standard Gaussian, normal with mean zero and variance one. mean zero and variance one should have written mean zero here and furthermore that the covariance of the values at any finite collection of points is multivariate gaussian and perhaps some other technical conditions and then they they uh they did the following first of all uh perhaps i should start with the bottom line here so they given such a such a family they construct these nice um riemannian metrics namely as the as Namely, as the expectations of the squares of the differentials of the elements of the family. So I should point out that somehow that metric is like a integrated version of what happens when you get a smooth immersion. So basically another way of thinking about a smooth immersion, smooth isometric immersion of a manifold in R big N is just, you're just trying to express the metric as the sum of the. As the sum of the symmetric squares of the differentials of coordinate functions. So, here, rather than a finite family of lists, I've got some measured family of functions. Of course, this refers to my measured curvature measure definition. Anyway, under these conditions, you impose, if you're giving your Gaussian random field, you impose this metric on the manifold. Then you can look at these so-called excursion sets where the functions exceed some given. Where the functions exceed some given value, you take the expectation of the Eul characteristic, it turns out you have what they call a Gaussian kinematic formula. You get some polynomial, well, sort of a Gaussian polynomial involving, well, the intrinsic curvatures of the Riemannian manifold together with these Hermite polynomials and the cutoff U with the Gaussian factor. So, yeah, so So, yeah, so anyway, so for some reason, I got excited about this. So, I mean, as I say, there are at least two reasons to get excited about it. One, certainly valid, one of them perhaps based on my desperation. The first one that's valid, of course, is just, I think it's just super cool construction and worth delving into. I'm still trying to understand it. Second one is that maybe even though... Maybe even though maybe isometric immersions are relatively difficult, you know, Nash is not that easy to prove, but maybe you could construct metrics by looking at like infinite measured families of functions instead, and maybe you can make them Gaussian, even if your space in question on which you want to construct these functions are not so nice. So nice, you know, basically if they're a general convex hypersurface with generic type structure or a PL space, where maybe you could use this kind of construction to give what I would consider a more intelligible proof of the Schieger-Mueller-Schrader theorem, or perhaps the PR spaces, positive reach spaces. Who knows? Anyway, like I said, so anyway, to conclude, I mean, this is, as I say, perhaps a death. Perhaps a desperate array of desperate hope for me. I feel these questions are very, very compelling. I've been preoccupied with them in the back of my mind for some time. We don't know much, but perhaps there's a way forward. I would love to have more contact with you all about these things. And thanks very much for your attention. These things, and thanks very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Joe, for this very interesting and intriguing talk. Are there questions? If you have a question, then maybe after the talk, you can just unmute yourself and ask it. May I ask a question? Yeah, thank you very much for the very inspiring and interesting talk and so many. interesting talk and so many so many interesting questions um so uh i i would like to um to double check if i understood so one of the first questions correctly uh so concerning uh the sets of positive reach and definable sets so i guess that you would like to have really a formula so a kind of intrinsic while formula but did i understood correctly so that uh it's even not known that if you have say It's even not known that if you have, say, an intrinsic isometry between such spaces, then these while curvatures are preserved. This intrinsic. Right, right, right. That's a good framing. Yeah, as far as I know, you are correct. We do not know this about, say, PR sets. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. And Antonio was raising his hand, I think. No, I think I was just plousing the seminar. Okay. I have a question. So is there some way to approximate PR spaces by P L spaces? I never saw something in this direction.
