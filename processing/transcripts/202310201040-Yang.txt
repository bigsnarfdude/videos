I'm going to talk about the extension of ability groups on its computability aspect. Especially, I will focus on a problem imposed by Bayer in 1936. Let us begin with some basic concepts. Basic concepts. All groups are building groups. The extended CA collects all isomorphic types of selective homomorphism from G to C. G is an group with kernel isomorphic to A. Informally, the extended CA collect all CA collector all possible method to put C and A together. So a formally definition is tendency, it's the collection of all shorter exact sequences of this form. So at least it has an element. It's the direct sum of A and C. Direct sum of A and C. And we can define a canonical add operation on S and C and A to form a valid group. And the direct sum is the zero element. A more important case is 10 C A equal to zero. So, by the definition, this condition means if subjective homomorphism with kernel isomorphism to A, then the kernel of pi is a submound of G. A submound is a subgroup which has another subgroup, this group and another and that subgroup, the the direct sum is the whole G. The whole G. And a standard CA equal to zero has an equivalent statement. Every subjectial homomorphism onto C with kernel atomorphy to A has a splitting homomorphism. In some cases, the In some cases, the standard can be calculated. For example, a standard Z and J2 equal to zero. The Cardan-Eidenberger theorem in abetting group, the Cardan-Eidenberger theorem is a useful technical lemma to deduce. To deduce properties of abelian groups. But in the view of category theory, it's not a technical lemma. In fact, it gives the definition of the extended CA. For every exact sequence, there is a long exact sequence. Long exact sequence to emband this older exact sequence into it. Presentation of groups. One can present a group using symbols and relations of these symbols. For example, x, x1, x2, da da da, is the set of symbols. Is the set of symbols and the formula of this one is a relation on this set S. The free group, the free group on S, we denote it by F S, it's a collection of all relations on S. And if sigma is a subset of F s, then the factor group F of S over sigma is the group presented by sigma. It's the group presented by CMOS from isomer relations from sigma. For group C, which is presented by symbols and relations, we can analyze the condition extend C equals zero from the point of From the point of Cardan-Eilenberg theorem. Since there is such a short exact sequence, and Carl-Ailenberg theorem tells us the long exact sequence as this. And if exact extension of C, extension of CA equal to zero, C A equals zero. Then this means from the map from home F s A to home sigma A is a subjective homomorphism. This means every homomorphism from sigma to A can be extended to be a homomorphism from I b s to A. This can be restated as by any consistent system of equations. Of equations. Whose left parts are relations in sigma and the right parts are elements of A. It has a solution in A. A particular case is the torsion part and the torsion free part of a given group of top given group. Tau, a good given group of G. Tau G is the collection of all taut elements in G. The factor group of G over tau g is a taunt group. Then extend G over tau G and tau G equal to zero if and only if tau G is a summary of G. So for every G, it has its tau G and it's G over tau G. Over tau g and it has a standard g over tau g and tau g. So for every abelian group, we have another another group, a standard tau, a standard G over tau g and tau g. It describes the all possible methods of putting together g and g over. G and G over tau g. The next is the bare problem. A free group is a group with a basis. Basis is independent, and every element is an integral combination of elements of basis. If this is a classical theorem in abelian group theory, if f is a free group, then extender f g equal to zero holds for any abelian group g. So if g if if g over oh this this wrong is tau g if g over tau g is v, then tau g is a summoner of g. G is a summon of G. In particular, if B is a fluid, then for any torsion group A, a standard of B A equal to zero. This means that if the torsion free part of a group G is free, then the only possible method to putting together tau G and G over tau G. Tau G and G over Tau G is the director sum. Baer in 1933 posed the problem. Is the converse proposition of this statement also holds true? If for every torsion group A, a standard B A holds, then is it necessary that B is a free group? B as a free group. So we give this condition a name. Call B as a bear group means that for every torsion group A, it's time that BA equal to zero. Some elementary properties of a bear group can be proved from Carton-Eidenberger theorem. For example, every sub-group of the For example, every subgroup of a bear group is also bare. Every finite cyclic group is not bare. And then bear group are totally free groups. Bear proves that every countable bear group is free using cardinality evaluation arguments. After 30 years, griefs prove that every bear group is free. Remove the cardinality restriction. We want to study the computability aspect of this Bayer's theorem, Bayer's problem or Bayer's theorem. Zero. Every bear group has a basis. But if we restrict our scope into the universe of all computable sets, whether this statement also holds it's can we find a computable basis for every computable bear group? Bare group. In second, other arithmetic every every group is comfortable. So we could give a more simple more simple characterization of bear groups. Resistion of Bayer group. G is a bear group if and only if the standard G and the direct sum of all say n equal to zero. So from the cardinal Element argument, we can transfer this condition to another form. It's the following. Is the following if a Bayer group is presented by symbols from s and relations from sigma, then a system of equations whose left parts are relations in sigma and the right parts are elements of this direct sum of infinitely minor groups, it has a solution in this space. So, we want to analyze bare group and free group. So, we analyze free groups in second order arithmetic first. Free group has some logical and geometrical. And geometrical properties in second-order arithmetic. This dependence decidability is a logical property. If there is an algorithm to decide whether A one, dot, AN are dependent, then we say that the group is dependent dependence decidable. Dependence decidable. Yeah, I say zero. Not every group has such an algorithm. In fact, every group is dependent decidable if and only if SA0 hosts. But every free group is dependent decidable. give a operation on it. The group is a G and operation on it. It's not necessarily presented by symbols and relations. I referable. So we use basis. If the group has a basis B, we use this B to derive to deduce algorithm to this. I'll always come toward this side of the city. Yeah, the basis. The basis is a model. So, so if you give a group G, it's free, then I have a basis in the same model. This this is a a logical property. This is a logical property. And free group has some geometrical property. Free groups are torsion-free. And it's every torsion-free group is free. No. For example, the rational number is Q is thousand. Number is a Q is thousand free, but it's not free. The reason is that if there is some element, A, A can be divided by two, A can be divided by four, A can be divided by any power of two. If the group has The group has such an element, then it's not free. So we call a torture-free group such as a pound-vargin condition. If all NA A1, AN, there's elements B1, BM, cover A1, which means every rational combination of A1, AN, you integral. Integral combination for B1BA. Every group satisfies hormonal condition. So we have some necessary conditions for a free group. Dependency decidable under point reaction condition. We analyze this panel reagent condition. What it means. In fact, we can refine A1AN, A1AN, A1AN arbitrary elements of the group G. If you give Y, Y is a rational combination of A1, A2, A3. A1, A2, A3, A, A4. It's all for this one. You can't say that G is A1 over 12 in general. Since there may be no A1 over 12 in this group. But we can chop A1, A2, A3, A4 technically to obtain for. To obtain for new vectors, for new elements of the same group G B1, B2, B3, B4. And then A1, A2, A3, A4, and Y. Y is the rational combination. And why? Are all integral combination? integral combination of B1, B2, B3, B4. In fact, B1, B2, B3, B4 are finer than A1, A2, A3, A4. This process could be iterated. We can travel A1, A2, A3, A4 to B1, B2, B3, B4. And And if you give another rational combination of A1, A2, A3, A4, or B1, B2, B3, B4, we can chop this B vectors to C vectors. We can continue this process. G satisfies a boundary eigen condition if and only if this process will hold infinite steps. Will how to infinite steps. So, so we can we can write down a table from these factors. We can chop them. We can chop them. Look B1, B2. And then if this process stops at the say the The S volume. This is say the S volume, the S plus 1 volume are all the same. If it's this case, then the S volume is a basis of this group. If A1, A2, A3, A4 is a maximal. It's a maximal independent set. It's a basis. If this AI are an infinite maximal infinite maximum independent set, A1, A2. We also We also could do this process. By the power reaction condition, the first row will hold in some step. And the second row The second the second row will halt and then the third row will halt if if this table is generated by all elements of this group G. Then we collected Then we collected all the position, every row halter in this position. Then this set is a basis of this group. So from maximum independent sets, we refined and refined refined step by step. We got a basis of Are basis of the scope. So we prove. We prove such equivalent of condition. A group G. A group G is free if and only if it's torsion-free. It's torsion-free, it's dependent decidable. And there is an algorithm for A1.AM. The algorithm outputs B1BN covers A1AM. If there is such a such algorithm, we know which step this process will halt in any row. So we capture the basis of this group. Yeah, yeah, I say zero. Now we go back to bear group. To prove bear group is free, we just need to prove its dependency decidable and find an algorithm for every one a n. For every one a n to output some elements cover cover A1. The torsion freeness of Bayer group is proved from Carl-Eilenberg theorem. And the Cadden-Eilenberg argument can go through in assay zero since its proof. Since its proof are all diagram tracing arguments, every map in Carnot-Iran-Bogger theorem are explicit defined. So the torsion freedom of bear group is proved again, can be proved in E. So for countable A computer computable bear group is also talking to it. The dependency decidability for a bear group. We want to find an algorithm. You give x1, xn elements of a bear group. This algorithm This algorithm tells me whether it's impaired or independent. So a group, any group G has a standard presentation. I enumerate all elements of G enumerate all elements. Enumerate all elements of G. We see this as all symbols. And the relations, the relations sigma, are these relations holes in G. This is a standard presentation of a group. So if you ask me, X1, X2, X3 are independent or yeah, independent or dependent. I could track these relations one by one. Sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3. If I encounter a relation, it involves only x1, x2, x3, then x1, x2, x3 are dependent. But if we denote, we doesn't encounter such a relation, we go to go to go to track next relation. Go to track an extreme. But we need a bound. If we have not a bound, this this this this this algorithm may not help in for out for some input. So we use the bear property of so we use bear property in this situation. We could define a system of equations sigma 0 equal to R 0 sigma 1 equals to R 1 sigma 2 one equals R1, sigma two equals R2. So Ri Ri is an element. Ri is an element of this director sum. We can choose this RI has a one in the i dimension. And at the other, this space has infinite mining dimension. We can choose Ri is one in the I in the I dimension. In the I in the Image and the zero in other dimensions. So it defines such a system. But the bear property, this system of equation has a solution. I have a solution, X1, X2. X1, X2, X2. These are all elements of this space direct sum. Now, you ask me whether x1, x2, x3 are independent. I track this solution. Attract this solution if say 100 is a dimension x1, x2, x3 nothing involved as well as they are our symbols. Now this this is the solution. Now, this this is the solution. I pick one handler, our key one handler S1, S2, S3 not involve the dimensions greater than one hundred. Than 100. Then we track this to 100. It's okay. Because if sigma i involves only x1, x2, x3, its index cannot be greater than 100 because this solution, S1, S2, S3, 2 S3 not involved dimensions greater than 100. So from a solution of a system of equations, we get an algorithm to decide some elements are dependent or independent. For find the argument condition, we also could use this system of equations solution argument. Now we use another presentation of this group. Presentation of this group. Suppose a group has a maximal independent set A1, A2, A3, A4. We have a write-down search table of elements. We pick all symbols, all symbols of this presentation. It's just all the entries in this table. Table and the relation are the relations of these entries, holes in G. Now I can define a system of equations. For example, For example, if if y zero twelve twelve y zero equal to x one minus three x two plus two x three plus eight x four. We can pick a R in this direction to kill the possibility to kill a fixed value of x1, x2, x3, x4. X4. This R has a one in dimensions. This X1, X2, S3, S4, not involved. And this dimension, this dimension, the index of this dimension is a multiplar of this trial. A multiplar of this type. If this is this case, if then this X1, S2, S4, S3, S4 are killed for fixed X1, S2, S3, S4 are killed. There's no Y0 Y zero satisfy. Satisfy this equation. So we can we can in this style to kill all potential solutions of all possible A1, A2, A3, A4. We can define the second We can define the second equation, the third equation. If this process does not halt, it goes on forever, then we will kill our potential solution of this system of equations. So, this contradicts the bare. The bear property of this school is not going to be a good idea. Now we go to the infinite maximal independent set case. The reason is the same. For the S volume, S is the least grid at which the S volume and the S plus one volume are different. So we could define Define this equation, these equations as above. If phi i, phi i is a computable, partial, partial computable function from this a1, a2, a3 to this, to this space, to this space. If phi1 if phi s defines If I defined defined at S step, if if I defined on A1, A2, AI, then we could define an equation to kill this file to kill this one because it has fixed value in A1, A2, dot. A1, A2, dot AIS. But by the bear property, there is some computable function phi E survive. It's not killed. So this survivor solution could guide us to find. Guide us to find the basis of the group. How? Consider this at P P is all s greater than E. At the S step, phi E converge at X one and X S. We can We claim that this is a finite set. Since for every S in P at the S step, phi E is not killed. Why phi E at this I step is not killed? There is some I less than E. Less than E for I is cubed. But all computer functions whose index less than E are finite, E minus. So this P is a finite set. It has at the most E elements. So we pick a number as zero greater than all elements of p if ye housed in x1 xr at some step t greater than x0 therefore s greater than t we have r is We have R is less than S. Let's say that from some volume, the R is operator the R. Say R is three. Then from some volume, S is the least greater attribution. S volume and S plus volume are different. The least changing point of the S volume. So from some from some T, from some T the the A1, the first row, the dot dot dot R row are unchangeable from the T1. From the T wall. So from the solution phi, we compute, we compute this table will stop, will stop changing at which step. So we capture a basis from this solution. So we proved we proved that every countable every computable variable has a computable basis.
