I want to highlight today an important place I think in causal analysis that looks to draw conclusions about fairness or discrimination where values or specifically moral considerations inevitably enter and I think should be much more consciously incorporated than I think is now being done and that's the task of variable construction or covariate selection or feature selection. Causal analysts, be they philosophers or computer scientists or statisticians, always proceed by Scientists or statisticians always proceed by first setting forth a set of features, covariates, variables, or drawing on a model with a set of data, and then conclusions are always after that. So I want to show that this first step is a really important part of value-based screening. So I'm going to first go through some simple examples to start off by complicating the question of what constitutes similarity and difference. So this is one of my favorite examples. It's called Legacy versus Prodigy, and it's in the vein of a classic correspondence. In the vein of a classic correspondence study or audit study, where you have two, you can imagine two people applying for a job and they have all the same resume contents on their resumes, except Presley Kurtzman here is age 12 and then Presley Kurtzman over there is age 22. So this should kind of jog your memory about the classic Reich and Shamal resume study. So we're thought, oh, these are all similar, but for age. Or we might ask, are they different substantively because of age? I might ask, are the richest I might ask: Are the rich and the poor taxed the same because I make them pay the same tax rate? Or are they taxed differently because they pay totally different sums? Are they similar or treated similarly or differently with respect to the tax that they pay? Or we can ask in this case, whether the individuals here who are, let's say, interviewing for a job, whether they're the same, they're wearing the same clothes, but one is perceived to be sex to male, or are they substantively different because they are sex to male versus perceived to be sex to male Sex to male versus perceived to be sex female. So the structure of all these cases is the same. In the legacy versus prodigy case, in the wealth case, and in this case, the difference in those attributes in wealth, age, and sex bring into these other differences. Differences in perceived merit, prodigy status, differences in ability to pay, differences in, let's say, fit with culture, gender conformity. Now, here's a question: when I'm responsive to these other factors, ability to pay, may. Other factors, ability to pay, merit, apparent merit, gender conformity. Do I treat you similarly or differently on the basis of age, wealth, or sex status? Of course, in one sense, I treat you similarly, right? I can describe the principle under which I treat you as one that tries to minimize the so-called effect that your trait has on my actions, right? I say, look, I make all people pay 10% regardless of their wealth, right? I'm not discriminating with respect to wealth. I make everybody pay 10% of their. Wealth and make everybody pay 10% of their total wealth, or I guess income and taxes. I can say I only hire based on the displayed merit of an individual, of a candidate. I only hire based on whether a candidate seems like they will be a good fit for my company culture. I don't pay attention to age. I don't pay attention to sex. So on this view of things, I'm framing things such that it looks as though wealth, age, and sex don't affect my treatment. But of course, in another sense, I also treat me substantively different. Substantively different. The things, the qualities about these candidates that I'm attending to is intimately tied in with these other features, right? So these are kind of easy cases to try to bring out that there are ways of describing similarity and difference that are clearly a matter of vantage point. And by differently highlighting what's similar and what's different, we can draw out different intuitions about what's fair or unfair. Now, if I'm supposed to figure out now what qualifies as disparate treatment or as kind of Qualifies as disparate treatment, or it's constitutionally prohibited. I can't say, well, in one way, you're disparately treating in another way or not, right? We're going to have to come to a better answer. So, a lot of causal advocates think that one way we should get touched on this problem is to think about what the relevant and irrelevant features are between these two candidates, whether there are, let's say, direct or indirect pathways of influence from these protected categories. And what discrimination is, we should define it as being kind of. We should define it as being kind of sensitive to those forbidden types of differences or those forbidden pathways of difference across candidates that are similar. So, for instance, if a change to perceived age changes perceived merit and merit is something that I'm allowed to be sensitive to, the thought is, then we can characterize legacy and prodigy as not just different in age, they're also different in merit. And since this difference is something I'm allowed to be sensitive to, then I'm allowed to treat them differently. Two, then I'm allowed to treat them differently without tripping the alarm, as it were, of disparate treatment or age discrimination. That would be an example. So, obviously, my slides are not queued up with my notes. Okay, but the thought is, okay, I'm not allowed to kind of do this direct pathway, but insofar as age and merit are causal links, I am allowed to be attentive to merit. We've already kind of pretty familiar with this. One way we might break that out is we might want to adjust for merit. We want to say, Of who might want to adjust for narrative. We want to say, okay, well, really, I want to bring out the fact that this prodigy is super talented. They're basically equivalent to someone who has a master's degree from Ottawa with a 3.9 and so on. I want to make them seem as substantively similar as possible so that the only difference that might be explaining my bad treatment is age. So, similarly, I might want to change perceived sex status that changes gender conformity. That changes gender conformity and allows certain sets of differences to persist so that to make the candidates similarly situated except for age. Okay, so in that way, what I've done is I've drawn out that there's a normative choice here about the types of similarities and differences that are eligible, right, to make a difference to my action. I want to contrast this with another perspective from causal analysis that tries to draw out similarity and different That tries to draw out similarity and differences straight from the data, right? So I think by contrast in the world of causal inferences, sometimes when we determine whether two cases are similarly indifferent, we just kind of appeal to what's presented in the data. We say, look, these two cases are similar across all X's, right? We say, like, it satisfies overlap, or we say that it satisfies positivity. What we mean there is not that the two cases are exactly similar. We just mean that they're similar, that that's going to be impossible. We just mean that they're similar in the ways that are captured by our data. Similar in the ways that are captured by our data. That's what we mean when we say that we've achieved overlap. And so that we can say that there are two cases that are substantively similar, but one is labeled white and one is labeled black. But one has gotten the treatment and one hasn't. But of course, all these cases that I've shown are cases where it's pretty clear that we don't want to get similarity on the cheap in this way. We want to draw out the substantive kinds of similarity that are going to be relevant for disparate treatment. So in these cases, what we need to do is present an argument. Cases, what we need to do is present an argument for why what's captured in a data set, what's captured in a set of X's and Y's, it's the set of relevant differences, right? The relevant differences for disparate treatment. Otherwise, we'll just kind of take for granted that the variables that we've chosen are the ones that are going to capture the relevant kind of substantive similarity. So, for example, though, let's go back to my legacy versus project case. I could choose variables to say, look, I have two candidates here that have. I have two candidates here that have total overlap on the x's, x1 through x4. They look identical according to my data set. They're only different in age, z. This would be a choice of variables that would highlight their similarities and bring out a single difference in age. But of course, I could choose a different set of variables that would bring out a different set of differences across the two cases. I could say, I want to choose a set of variables that's going to bring out the fact that they graduated from college at a different They graduated from college at a different age. So, this would be a choice of features that would point out a greater set of differences than this choice of features. So the point here is that we can describe cases or we can choose features in a way that underscores differences or underscores similarities. And this is just a matter of what features we select. We can obviously do the same thing in the classic audit study with Greg and Jamal. I can choose. With Brad and Jamal. I can choose variables that will emphasize that these are similar candidates, right? Or I can choose very, you know, I would do that oftentimes by choosing the variables to represent race and then choosing the variables to represent non-race. Or I could choose a different set of variables to bring out or to suppress difference across the candidates. So I can make coarser-grained variables, or I can do variables that rely on facts about racial geography. Say this candidate scored in the top 10% if there are districts. Percent of their district SAT, but this candidate scored in the top 20 percent of the national or whatever district SAT, right? So the point is, these two cases are only similar and different on a substantive choice of variables. So just as in some cases we might want to measure or evaluate, and I know those of you who are familiar with the affirmative action case at Harvard and UNC might be familiar with ways of the kind of normative implications. The kind of normative implications of characterizing individuals as similar but for race, different butt four race, these are all going to be sensitive to a set of chosen variables. So instead of marking just what GPA and what high school Greg went to and what GPA in high school Jamal went to, you might want to choose variables that will characterize GPA in high school, given that Jamal is black and Greg is white and given facts about racial geography. You can also change, of course, how coarse in grain or fine-grained your variables are. And all of this is going to rely on normative judgments. And all of this is going to rely on normative judgments about what makes two things substantively similar and what's essential to capture in a given case when we're trying to figure out, you know, draw out conclusions about discrimination. And of course, ignoring or not taking into account certain pieces of context or only incorporating information that's readily at hand is as much of a stance as another one. So the lesson was just, very quickly, that we can see difference where there is apparent likeness and we can see likeness where there is apparent difference. And this is just a matter of Apparent difference, and this is just a matter of feature selection or variable choice. And since the variable construction ultimately sets the bases of our causal conclusions and from which we draw our conclusions about disparate treatment, this is going to be a key normative matter. And there's a real risk here to not thinking very consciously about the features that we rely on, where oftentimes it seems like there's a real disconnect between choices of features and the data that we operate, work with, and the analysis that's being performed on that data. Being performed on that data. When we don't think about covariate construction or variable construction, we take for granted how things are now. We decide who to hire based on credentials alone, or we subscribe to a myth of equality that says that credentials are a good basis for hiring because they more or less reflect effort or merit or desert. And so we try to make salient facts about just bear credentials. We already have a set of similarities and differences that are natural for us to use because they are just how we do things now and they reflect the. We do things now, and they reflect the prevailing ideology of meritocracy or equality or so on. So, part of the call to variable construction is to remake these, which is to see credentials formed against the background of social inequality and to see credentials as relevantly different even when they're superficially similar. That is, we can see similarity where there's difference and difference where there's similarity. And I want to contrast then two different approaches to thinking about variables. You can think about variables in what seems like an extractive way, where you see it's Where you see, it's as though we take the world as it is, and we can simply identify kind of off the surface differences and similarities as they appear. But I want to suggest that good variable construction, by contrast, is going to play an active role in challenging the presumptive similarities and differences and draw attention to or actively ascribe normatively significant features. And that's, I'm going to call that a scriptive approach to variables, which is that variable construction has a prescriptive quality, which is that we should see these people as similarly. We should see these people as similarly indifferent, even if it's harder for us to see them as so on initial glance. What does this mean practically? I think that variable sets that have a distinct race variable or sex variable or age variable, they can easily suggest that a person or a set of two cases are truly the same but for race, because all of the difference has been localized to that one attribute of the person. But if you relationalize your data more, then you'll see that there's more difference across. More, then you'll see that there's more difference across apparent likeness. If we conceive of racial status as marking a relational fact, then we can see how race materially affects access to resources or social relations, and that should affect the way that we collect data to account for these facts. And I previewed a couple of ways we can do that. We can think about SAT or SAT scores that explicitly account for neighborhood opportunity or family resources or racial geography. That's just one very on-the-way, cheap way to just try to change the way that we can get similar. To change the way that we can get similarity on the cheek. Now, I've emphasized this part of the pipeline of causal inference because it's, I think, received less attention than I should, especially since it trickles down to everything else that we do with our data analysis. But also, I think it's because you all, we all, we all have a first mover advantage in some sense in terms of dictating the terms of the fairness conversation just by choosing a set of features from which we can then say things about overlap and positivity and draw facts about. And draw facts about causation, we're already setting the terms for what defines the relevant sense of similarity and difference. And just by even choosing features, we're already priming a certain way of seeing the differences that would be fair or unfair to propagate. And this is really, I think, typically taken for granted. And it seems to me this should be a really major point of scrutiny if you think that your causal analysis is something that's going to be able to draw out normatively significant conclusions. Significant conclusions. So, I want to suggest that an important task for those of us theorizing algorithmic fairness is: how do we construct variables or measure covariates or collect data that makes salient social categories as a relational fact or a marker of social difference? I think doing that would achieve two things. I have just stopped with the slides entirely. Oh my god. Two things. First, I think it would just be more accurate. It would give a more accurate and rich description of the social world that we're studying. That's the first thing. World that we're studying. That's the first thing. And second, it would help us avoid traps that define discrimination or non-discrimination or fairness, which is quite the sameness. I'm almost in. Once we see that the similar but for X is just downstream for a particular substantive choice of X, it makes a reification fallacy, right, and mistakes a particular way of conceiving of similarity as just the fact about similarity and difference, then we'll be less tempted to approach the matter of racial fairness or, you know, sex fairness. Racial fairness or sex fairness or discrimination by trying to think about when similar people get similar treatment. Instead, if variables are constructed to bring out difference, then I think we might proceed along what I think is going to be a much more fruitful path, which is asking when different people are owed nonetheless similar treatment despite their differences. Quick time for a couple of questions. Oh, we're not to give you the topic. We're not to give you the publications. We're not going to be able to do it. Okay, cool. Okay, so our next provocation will be from Alexander Tolbert, who is an assistant professor. Yeah, thanks.
