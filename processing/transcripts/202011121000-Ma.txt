So, my name is Kevin. I'm a fourth-year graduate student in Yonatan Grads Lab at the Harvard School of Public Health. I'm excited to share some of our work today applying microbial GUBOS methods, in particular to Neisseria gonorrhea. So, Neisseria gonorrhea is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen responsible for causing the SCD gonorrhea. We know it's rapidly evolving to become multi-drug resistant. Rapidly evolving to become multi-drug resistant. In the past few decades, it's gone from this readily treatable infection to one in which we're now seeing the emergence of these strains that are basically resistant to all of the frontline antimicrobial therapies. So the goal of this project was to use genome-wide association methods to try to identify some of the additional unknown mutations that can lead to resistance. And the thinking here is that if we know the genotypic basis of resistance, we can design better surveillance. We can design better surveillance panels, we can design better genotypic diagnostics, etc. So, gonorrhea is treated currently using a combination of two drugs, azithromycin and a beta-lactam. And here we're focusing in on azithromycin for the study. So, it binds to the 50S subunit of the ribosome and inhibits translation. And these known resistance mutations include mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA, that's a component of the 50S ribosome, and mutation. The 50S ribosome and mutations sort of at this macrolide binding spot can lead to resistance, as well as mutations slash recombination in the MTR CD efflux pump. This is just the primary efflux pump for antimicrobials in Neisserogonorii, and any sort of gain of function mutations intuitively will also lead to resistance. So here's data from a surveillance data set of about 1,000 isolates collected in the US by the CDC. In the US, by the CDC, where we're just showing the distribution of azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration. So that's MIC. That's just a continuous measure of how resistant the strain is with higher indicative of increased resistance. So using the sort of clinical breakpoint shown in the dashed line, what we see is that in red is the distribution for all strains, and then in blue is the distribution for strains that contain one of the two mutations, two resistance mutations. Two resistance mutation pathways that I just mentioned, 23S RNA, or sort of these efflux pump mutations. You can see for higher level resistance, these are mostly explained by those known mechanisms. For lower level resistance, strains with MICs of two or four, there's a substantial fraction that lack these known resistance mutations. And so, microbial GWAS or genome-wide associations provide a powerful tool to try to get at what could be going on in this sort of unknown fraction of strains. So, just a little bit of brief background on the Ganococcal genome. This is about a two-megabase pair genome encoding about 2,000 genes. We know it undergoes a lot of horizontal gene transfer within the genus Neisseria. There are several plasma variants and as well as antigenically variable genes, mostly encoding sort of surface proteins. And so, we thought maybe the easiest way to deal with all of this variability was just to work from the de novo assemblies, and we generated. Noble assemblies, and we generated these sort of unitigs, these stretches of sequences generated from the Bruin graphs to encode this variation in a flexible manner. So that's just sort of how we decide to treat the genetic variants in this case. And we put all of this together in a regression model. Essentially, we decided to just run GWAS using a regression-based approach, where we're modeling the phenotype, which is just the azotomycin MICs, as a contribution of the effect of the unitate. Of the effect of the UNITAG under consideration. And we also include a sort of random effects term that adjusts for population structure, so the overall phylogeny of the data set, and of course, just the random error. So we're fitting this regression model independently for every single UNITIG genetic variant in our data set. And then we just look at how sort of substantial beta is, the effect size, as well as the significance, the p-value. The significance, the p-value. And on the right here, I'm just giving you a bit more intuition why we even need this sort of random effect term. So we run a regression without this random effects term. This is a Manhattan plot showing for each variant the significance along the y-axis along the genomic coordinates. If we don't have this control for population structure, you just get this rampant inflation across the genome. Basically, you just get a ton of false positive due to the nature of population structure in this data set. And just by including This data set. And just by including this term, we can really get rid of a substantial fraction of those false positives. So, the data set that we're using is this meta-analysis collection of nearly 5,000 strains. So, we were just putting together genomes from published data sets with relatively good temporal and geographic coverage, although a little bit biased certainly towards more recent samples, as well as samples from North America and Europe. Here I'm just showing you a phylogeny of the entire data set as well as annotation rings with MIC thresholds showing resistance or susceptibility for each of these three drugs. As mentioned, we're focusing in particular on azotomycin, that's the outermost ring. You can see resistance can be clonal in some parts of the tree, like here, but overall it can be sort of gained and loss really quite frequently throughout the whole tree. Uh, tree, and that's sort of in contrast to something like ciprofluxin in this innermost ring, where you get this more so clonal expansion of lineages with the sort of ciprofloxin resistance determinants. So we took the information from the tree, we incorporated it into the random effects, and we ran GWAS on azithromycin resistance. And what we saw was actually initially kind of puzzling. So here are just the raw results on the on the right. Raw results on the right. We did pick up the 23S RNA mutations. I actually haven't shown those here. They are, you know, sort of very significant, but we picked those up. Those were a good positive control. But just like looking down this list, we found that after doing literature review, et cetera, most of these significant genes didn't really have a known role in resistance in Neisseria or in other species. So we were kind of concerned about this. You know, it's possible that they could all be sort of truly causal and novel, but we were skeptical. So we thought. But we were skeptical. So we thought most of these could be false positives. And sort of in line with this, there are a lot of false negatives. So I mentioned this MTR-CD efflux pump. These known resistant genes with lower level effects were not significant at the Bonferroni threshold, so they would be far below the sort of cutoff here. So we looked into what could be going on. We basically just took the phylogeny and overlaid several variants from that list, the putative list. That list, the putatively novel variants in green. And we also overlaid the 23S mutations that I mentioned that were highly associated with resistance and are known contributors and drivers of resistance. What you can see is in this clade where they all have this sort of A2059G mutation, all these other variants that are significant in the GWAS basically just line up perfectly with this A2059G clade. And we just computed this simple genetic linkage score for the rest. A simple genetic linkage score for the rest of the variants, and we see a sort of bimodal distribution with a substantial fraction having a similar pattern to what we see with these three, right? We just see a sort of high degree of genetic linkage with these known resistance mutations. And so, what we think is going on here is that even though we're controlling for population structure to some degree, we're not actually controlling for the effect of these highly prevalent, high-effect size resistance mutations in our regression model. And what is happening is that it's basically just And what is happening is that it's basically just skewing the results and driving these linked non-causal variants to significance. So one of the strengths of using aggression-based JUWAS approach is actually fairly easy to sort of try to adjust for these potential confounders. Essentially, all we did was just to add another term encoding the number of 23 sRNA mutations into our regression model. And so we're just simultaneously So, we're just simultaneously estimating an effect of the contribution of those mutations while we're estimating an effect of the unit teak of interest. So, we're just controlling for the presence of the 23S RNA mutations with this approach. So, after rerunning JUWAS, we compared all of the results before and after conditioning. So, this is just a plot showing for each variant its significance in the unconditional GWAS. Its significance in the unconditional GWAS. So that's the first run. And then after conditioning, that's the second run. And so everything here in the bottom right quadrant are things that were significant in the first step, but no longer significant after conditioning. And what I've done is also just to color a lot of these dots according to the genetic linkage to the 28s RNA here. And sort of as we expect, a lot of these highly red variants that were significant in the first pass that we think were sort of spurious correlations no longer are. No longer are significant after conditioning. And then, maybe more interestingly, in this top left quadrant, a lot of the, these are the variants that weren't significant in the first GWAS, but became significant after conditioning. A lot of them were associated with the MTR-CDE pump. So I've annotated them in triangles. And these are, or sorry, diamonds. And so these are sort of our lower level resistance sheets that we know are other sort of positive controls. And so we're Sort of positive controls. And so we're really excited that we were able to recover these. And that sort of leaves this variant here in RPLB. So that's a component of the 50S ribosome. And again, similar to the other lower level resistance mutations, wasn't significant in the first pass, but became significant after conditioning. And this is sort of due to two effects. We saw that the effect size increased from before to after conditioning, and the standard error associated with the effect size decreased. Associated with the effect size decreased. And so a combination of these could sort of drive the p-value lower. So we did some more follow-up work to try to understand the mechanistic basis of resistance. So we know that RPLB is a component of the 50S ribosome. The genetic variant that was significant specifically was a mutation in this G70 site. And when we look at the structure from another bacterial species, what we saw was that this amino acid was predicted. This amino acid was predicted to basically contact the azithromycin at the macrolide binding site. And so the mutation that we observed, this G70D mutation, could potentially increase resistance, essentially just by reducing the binding of azithromycin. So G70D had been sort of observed in Ganococcal data sets before, but there wasn't really a sort of strong association with binarized resistance levels in previous analyses. Levels in previous analyses. And here, because we're using continuous MIC levels, I think that's partially why we're able to see this such strong of an association. And also, as a result of those initial studies, we think that they were thought to be sort of rare or unimportant and weren't really included in surveillance panels. And so the prevalence wasn't really known up until this point. So we just looked at the overall prevalence of these mutations, and we saw that their presence. And we saw that they were present in about one in 20 streams, so not infrequent. And actually, in some data sets, in some time spans, the prevalence was greater than 10%. So indicative potentially of sort of local geography-dependent selective pressures. Here we're just taking the phylogeny and overlaying the presence or absence of G7BD. You can see these lineages which have picked up the mutation and are potentially in. And they are potentially in the process of sort of expanding as well. What we also observed when we're doing this analysis is that there were other mutations around this G70 site, other rarer mutations that also were sort of scattered throughout the tree. So we characterized those a bit more in depth. And we saw mutations like G7DS, G7DA, et cetera. So this sort of pattern of repeated independent mutational events at this same site, maybe indicated. Events at this same site, maybe indicative again of selection due to macrolide use. And we just did a simple statistical test to look at the MIC distributions of those strains with these rarer mutations, reasoning that if G7AD is associated with increased macrolide MICs, that these rarer mutations would also be as well. And that's exactly what we saw. We saw that the geometric mean MIC of these rare mutation streams was even greater than both the G70D as well as wild type strains. As well as wild type streams. So we brought some of these hypotheses basically into the lab to just to validate it because anything that sort of comes out of the GWAS is to the extent possible we try to confirm experimentally. And so we just took a lab stream that's 208BL and we made two isogenic derivatives with the G70D RPLD mutation. And what we saw was that the zithomycin MIC, in line with our GWAS predictions, increased. JUWAS predictions increased about three to fourfold. And then our final question was just to ask if, at least in vitro, if there was any substantial fitness cost to RPLD G70D. We know that many resistance mutations do carry substantial fitness costs. And so we basically just grew these strains out, sampling every two hours or so, and then plotting the CFU per mil. What you can see here is that given the highly parallel slopes here, Highly parallel slopes here, at least in rich media, we didn't see any sort of substantial fitness cost to this particular lab stream picking up this mutation. Of course, this experiment could be repeated in different contexts with environmental stressors in the mouse model and so forth. So to summarize, what we observed was that conditioning on known resistance mutations in our hands really improved the ability of microbial GWAS to detect these causal variants with these. To detect these causal variants with these more subtle and lower effect sizes. And that these data sort of underscore the importance of including RPLD as a contributor of resistance in future Ganococcal surveillance panels and diagnostic panels. And I think something I'm really excited about and would love to chat more at the breakout session about is sort of future directions, thinking about other bacteria where similar confounding may occur. For instance, you know, in Um, you know, in bacteria where you have a dominant resistance mutation that is already known, like a carbapenomase, could incorporate that directly into the regression model, as we've done here, also improve the power to discover sort of more subtle drivers of carbapenome resistance, et cetera. And so, this paper is out at Nature Communications, which you can access with the QR code here. And I just want to thank everybody in the grad lab who's helped with this work, in particular. Lab, who's helped with this work, in particular Titana Mortimer, as well as to our many collaborators and funders as well. Happy to take any questions now. Thank you, Kevin. We have four minutes left, so we could have a lot of discussion. On the chat, there are two questions now. Toby is asking, do you know if atomycin resistance is totally mediated by the genome? Mediated by the genome, or whether there are environmental and other factors that influence resistance? Yeah, great question. So, the way we've measured azithromycin resistance is just a sort of lab-based assay. And so I think there you could definitely have things like the type of plate that you use, the type of specific macrolite test that you use, you know, aggro dilution versus. That choose, you know, aggregate dilution versus e-tests, all those things could sort of affect the degree of resistance. And then I think the extension of that is to think about, you know, in vivo, what's really going on when bacteria are resisting antibiotic. And there's all sorts of, you know, things there, like antibiotic tolerance, that really aren't picked up in our typical MIC assays. So I think the spectrum of resistance is really a lot broader than what we've characterized here. Okay. Okay, I have a second question on the board here. Jesse is asking: Do you think that the rarer mutations nearby G7TD could have a greater fitness cost? Might that explain their lower prevalence despite being associated with quite high resistance? Thanks, Jesse. Yeah, that's a great point. That's exactly what we've been thinking. We haven't had the chance to sort of validate that in the lab, but it would make sense that a mutation. But it would make sense that a mutation, I think, that sort of abrogates azithromycin binding to a greater extent might also just affect the function of the ribosome to a greater extent, hence driving higher fitness costs and hence sort of not being able to spread as far into population. Cool. Thanks, Kevin. Great talk. So, Kevin, I had a question. In your talk, you had this ask well showing that those Well, showing that those are highly significant ones has a with what is 23 is those markers, it's called the markers, has a this R square value has a bimodal distribution like one is very low, one is very high. So in your plot, then you have those high R square values colored as red. So, how would you incorporate those ones like in the initial single association analysis? They are very highly associated, but they are not very related, associated with these 23s, these features. In your conditional analysis, these ones are not rather highly significant. Rather highly significant anymore. Do you have an interpretation for those ones? Yeah, yeah, excellent question. So that's something we've looked into a little bit more. And I think to some extent, it was a sort of limitation of how we, I think, computed the genetic linkage. When we overlaid the sort of tree annotation rings, we sort of visually saw that they were to some degree still sort of visually linked to 23S. And we think those could be lesser examples. Those could be lesser examples of linkage to 23S where it just sort of wasn't as strong, and the metric we used didn't really capture that. But certainly, they also disappeared after conditioning, which sort of suggests that in some way they were sort of still linked to 23S. But yeah, great question.
