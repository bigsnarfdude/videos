Just before the talk started, I was getting a little flack for this uh field geologist photo in here. This is uh this is me, this is I have the puffy that I was just wearing, it's the ice axe. And I got very excited. This is the Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska. And I got to go underneath the Mendenhall and in one of these R channels, and I just started hacking away at the side. And all of this ice in here is, I mean, all of this sediment stuff in here is frozen, and it's frozen to the ice above it. It's frozen to the ice above it. And so it's very cool. You can zoom in when you're there and look right at this interface and see the connection between the ice above and the sediment below. And so that was very fun. So that's why I put it in here. So I'm going to be talking about this frozen sediment. It is kind of funny to ending a meeting, talking about something that hasn't been spoken about at all yet in the meeting. But I guess that's part of this is a launch pad for discussion. I'm Colin, I'm at Dartmouth. This is some of the stuff that I did. I'm at Dartmouth. This is some of the stuff that I did as a postdoc with Alan Rempel. So I'm going to be talking a lot about his work and then a little bit about mine. And so it'll be sort of a broad overview about that. Yeah, great. So taking an approach sort of like Joe's, I put some questions up, but unlike Joe, I answered them in a way that I thought was it. So the first thing is that since I showed you a picture of one, I would say frozen fringes exist under glaciers. Believe it or not, there's some frozen sediment under glaciers. There's some frozen sediment underneath there. I've seen it firsthand. I can attest to that. But you might be asking, well, what is that? What is frozen fringe? And so I'll answer it in a way that, maybe this is kind of like Joe, in a way that doesn't really make sense also. It's kind of analogous to a capillary fringe, which happens in Vedozone hydrology where you have a partially saturated zone. That's essentially why it's called a fringe, frozen fringe, is because it was named in an analogy to the capillary fringe. To the capillary fringe. And then, how and why would we incorporate fringe into inversions? Well, at the end, I'll say maybe topography. Maybe you're, this is fringe gives you a way to dynamically change the basal boundary condition and generate topography and things like that, which could be of very interest. And I put that in there basically because we spent so much time talking about inversions. On the bottom, here's a, that's a picture from the cover of Journal of Glaciology. We sent the picture in horizontal, and it printed it this way. And it prints it this way. I still would have cropped it. But anyway, I put that in there because it's kind of fun. And then this is a picture from Alex Robel's Twitter, where he's doing a regulation experiment. And I like that Andrew's book is the one that's going to get most wet. It's hot, Tom. Yeah, the calculus, the foundational subject. Okay, and then here is a very nice picture from Taylor Good. A very nice picture from Taylor Glacier, where there's some rubbles till down here, and then you can see that there are this layer of fringe frozen on the bottom, and then there's some ice above it. And so, yeah, I mean, I think the frozen fringes exist under glaciers, believe it or not. Okay, so what is a frozen fringe? Okay, named analogy to a capillary fringe, it's this partially saturated region of sediment and ice and water. And so you have some sort of pure ice up here. You have some sort of pure ice up here, and you have some sediment particles and some ice in between them, and some water surrounding it. And a lot of this was developed in the context of frost heave, right? So in high latitudes areas, you have roads, and the water freezes, and it generates some heave, which I'm going to talk a lot about. It doesn't come from the density expansion. And so, this idea of this frozen fringe was developed for these frost heavy stuff. So, there's some great work by O'Neill and Miller and Andrew has worked a lot on this. Alan Rempel worked. Alan Rembell worked on this Frost Teave stuff. There's more recent work by Patman and Steil. And so Frost Teave has been, a lot of this has been developed there. And essentially, one of Alan's areas, he has sort of transported Frost Heave work to subglacials. Because heaving processes are essentially the same in both contexts. The parameters are just a little different. So Frost Heave and Frozen Fringe. Okay, so here's just some more pictures. I guess this title could be, I guess we're still in. This title could be, I guess, we're still in the white fringe exists. So I showed this picture over here. Here's an experiment, sort of frosty, which you can see this partially saturated zone and then these very interesting ice lenses that are generated. Here's lab experiments on colloids that were done by Gray Worcester and Postdocs. And then here is another piece from Twitter. This is from Matt Siegfried, showing what the bottom of a borehole at Willand's Ice Stream looks like, which you can Willand's ice stream looks like, which you can tell that there's a bunch of frozen sediment at the bottom. And so, this is, you know, this is ice that's sliding along. This is, you know, they're still in what they were calling the ice stream as they were going along, and this is sort of like a packet of frozen sediment along the bottom. That colonet picture on the left, is that this one? Yeah, that's when somebody made that? Yeah, this was a lab experiment. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, so they sat this thing in a bucket of water and then. This thing in a bucket of water, and then they froze it from the top, and then it draws up the water, it generates this ice lens, which generates, makes the heave. And so this is just sort of an analogy for, I mean, it's a lab experiment showing the frost heaving action. Yeah. Okay, so let's go. So, how might some of this happen? Is what we're thinking about in the glacier context. We like to think of a clean ice sediment interface. So, something like this. So, something like this. And if we zoom into the sediment scale, you get to some curvy stuff like this. And there's some radius of curvature here of the ice as it has to sort of bend around the sediment particles. We're on like a very small scale. So just believe me that something like that might happen. And then if we do that, we can generate, we can talk about this critical entry pressure, which is related to this radius of curvature and then this ice water surface energy, the surface tension. Ice water surface energy, the surface tension of the interface. And why is this important? Well, okay, if we like to talk about this effective pressure, which is the pressure difference between the ice and the liquid. So we have the liquid pressure, the pore water pressure, and then the ice pressure pushing down on it. And what the effective pressure really is, is a force deficit. It's saying that the amount of ice pressure pushing down and the liquid pressure pushing up, they don't equal. They're imbalanced. And that extra force has to be loaded onto the sediment, which is why. Has to be loaded onto the sediment, which is why you get these yield stress things that depend on the effective pressure because it's saying something about the strength of the sediment. But okay, so if we consider this situation where we have some ice pressure and there's a difference between that ice pressure and the water pressure, then it's not hard to imagine that, okay, if I'm not pushing down very hard, if the difference between these two things, the ice pressure and the liquid pressure, is small, then it's enough to be held along this interface. And so you can have a clean ice sediment interface. Clean ice sediment interface. However, if you push down very hard, the surface tension is not going to be able to hold it at that place, and so you're going to start to enter the sediments. And so this is sort of like the garlic press kind of thing. You're pushing down on a heart, and then you start squeezing the garlic into the. And so that's what's happening over here. And so this is a way of thinking about how these frozen fringes are initiated. And so, this is, I give you a purely mechanical way of thinking about this, but now we can think about the thermodynamics of this situation. And so, when we think about the phase diagram for water, right, we have interacting water, we have water, ice, and water in the pore space, we like to think about the phase diagram for equal pressures. So this is like a thing that people look at quite consistently. And this is so this is for a constant pressure. So we can go from ice to water here along this constant pressure line. Along this constant pressure line. And the line that goes up here, this is the Clapeyron slope, which says that, okay, if we increase the pressure, then we're actually going to decrease the melting temperature. But I'm going to remind you that this here is for constant pressure. This means that the pressure in the water is the same as the pressure in the ice. Where in this last slide, I've just told you that the pressure in the water is different from the pressure in the ice. Okay, so then we can ask the question: what effect does that have on the freezing of these sediments? Okay, so now to do that, I'm going to take. Okay, so now to do that I'm going to take to move into a different space and this is called the Gibbs free energy plot. The Gibbs free energy is really just going to tell you something about the enthalpy and the entropy and the temperature. And so you can look at these lines. You can see, okay, here's the Gibbs free energy for the liquid, here's the Gibbs free energy for the ice. And where they intersect, that's where you're going to have a transition. It's where you're going to have melting or freezing. And so, you know, below the melting temperature, the ice state has a low. The ice state has a lower free energy, so therefore you're going to be in the ice phase. And above the melting temperature, the liquid has a lower free energy, so you're going to be in the liquid phase. And here I have plotted the ice and the liquid at the same pressure. So that's this same crossing right here, just redone in a free energy space. Okay, now I'm going to add two more lines where I now can say, okay, I moved up to a different pressure. So here's P plus W. Pressure. So here's P plus delta P, this was P, this is where they cross, is where the melting temperature is. And so at this lower pressure, if I increase the pressure, the melting temperature here decreases a little bit. Okay, and the amount that it decreases is exactly that claper on slope. That's this here. You're just moving the pressure, but the pressure is the same, and so you increase that, you drop the melting temperature a little bit. But the fascinating thing about this is that there's actually another. About this, there's actually another equilibrium. And that equilibrium here happens when the ice is at a greater pressure than the liquid. And so it happens right here. So you can see higher ice pressure and lower liquid pressure, and you actually get a much greater decrease in the melting temperature. And so this is the sort of genesis of these ideas about pre-melting, where because the pressure in the ice and the pressure in the water are different, the melting temperature has a huge variation that you would never get in this sort of typical thinking about the Of typical thinking about the Clapeyron way, and so we can talk about all the things that Tyndall and Kelvin argued about years ago over beers and things like that. But the idea is that this pre-melting is what gives rise to this frozen fringe, this partially saturated zone. And so here, I've drawn this radius of curvature and this frozen fringe. And over here, I have a little bit of data that's collected from Beacon Valley. They took some Beacon Valley, they froze this, they put some. Took some Beacon Valley, they froze this, they put some water in it, and they froze it. And they looked at what the saturation, the ice saturation, so how much of this image over here is this dark blue versus how much of it's this light blue. So the ice saturation as a function of the temperature below the melting temperature. So this is the, and so that's what's plotted over here. And they did this using these mercury experiments, which are very cool. And there's also some Monte Carlo simulations. And then there's also some Monte Carlo simulations in there where they essentially just are throwing darts at the different areas and asking whether it's frozen or not, which turns out to work amazingly well. But the thing that I want to draw you to most importantly is that the saturation depends on this undercooling. It depends on this temperature below the melting temperature. And this is essentially saying that entirely within this frozen fringe area, this partially saturated, that you are sitting on phase equilibrium lines. Phase equilibrium lines, right? That the amount of saturation is given by this difference in pressures that's set to the melting temperature. And that's just following this undercooling the whole time. And so what's fascinating about that is that you can think about it in just a purely enthalpy space. In a sense, that region is a mushy zone where you're sitting on this phase equilibrium line throughout that entire. Line throughout that entirely partially saturated region. And so I can tell you what the temperature is for a range of temperatures. I can tell you what the enthalpy is as we jump through these different regimes, through the pure ice and the frozen fringe, and the waters and the sediments. And essentially, based only on thermodynamics, we can just write down what the enthalpy is. So in the pure ice, you can say, okay, the enthalpy is something that. You can say, okay, the enthalpy is something that has to do with sensible heat. And then in the frozen fringe, you have a sensible heat component, which is small, and a latent heat component. And then when you are in the water and sediments, you have the sensible heat component plus the latent heat, since we started down here. And so this is a new way of thinking about this partially saturated zone. Okay, so I said I was going to talk a little bit about frost heave and what frost heaving means. So this is an image. So, this is an image straight out of Alan Rempel's paper, which now here is connecting both the thermodynamics and the force balance and asking, you know, what is the motion, what's the regulative motion for this to be in steady state. So this is all done in steady state, where you say that the heave rate is equal to the melt rate. And so you're thinking about essentially that the ice is moving in one direction and regulating around the particles. Around the particles. But the regulation that it's doing is not the classic Wertmann regulation, because if you see a paper from us from the last year, that happens at Wertmann regulation says that the pressures are equal, which it turns out that they very likely are not equal. And so this is regulation in a broader sense where I am thinking about the change in the ice and water pressure as it sort of moves around this. And so you can think about it moving down or up. So I like to think about it, I mean. So, I like to think about it. I mean, it depends on the sign, but in this case, it's a little easier to think down. So, the ice motion is moving down, it's regulating down into the sediments, regulation in a frozen fringe sense, and then it's being lopped off at the bottom by melting. And that's how you get this steady-state, partially saturated frozen fringe at the bottom. It also can go the other way where you start freezing the stuff on, and then you're actually like pushing the glacier up, which is what happens in the roads, in the high latitudes, in the frost. In the roads in the high latitudes, in the frost heave situation. Okay, and so then in this steady state case, if I know what my effective pressure is, and I know what my melting or freezing rate is, or if they're in balance, I can write down how thick the steady-state frozen fringe is going to be using essentially rearranging that other equation and inputting the equation from the last slide, and inputting this melt rate. Inputting this melt rate. And based on that, and so sorry, I've scaled this by this PF, which is that critical entry pressure to enter into the sediments. And so based on that, if you can get, so you can see that these are about 100 kPa, which is large, but it's not that large. And so you can imagine that there are many places that are you're actually infiltrating into the sediments. Yes, I'll go. Very quick question. Where does this number come from? 70 kPa. Yeah, yeah, good question. Yeah, yeah, good question. It comes straight from here, which is just related to the radius of curvature in this poor throat and the ice water surface energy. So it knows a little bit about the sediment type, and then it just says something about the surface energy between them. So it's not a number that I can, it's not an empirical, I mean, it's an empirical number that you have to measure, but it is something that I can't fiddle with. And where that the radius is the characteristic size of the largest poor throat? It's the poor throat radius. I don't think the largest world for all this. Yeah, I mean, if there's a huge distribution, then it becomes kind of hard to tell. But if you think of, yeah, if you think, yeah, yeah. Okay, so you can see that you can generate the many meters of frozen fringe on the bottom for these effective pressures. Okay, and so now I'm going to talk for just a second about some transient fringe evolution and then get to some discussions. And then get to some discussions. So, if we think about sort of external heat sources and sinks, and you can write down a melt rate something like this, you can say that, okay, the freezing is going to release a little bit of latent heat at this rate. And so then if you're thinking about what's happening inside this box, you can change the thickness of your fringe as well as have regulation, and these both are contributing to this latent heat. And so you can balance this and find an equation for. Can balance this and find an equation for how your fringe. This is sort of a linearized equation around some equilibrium state, essentially, where you'll have changes in the fringe thickness due to your melting and freezing and then your heave rate. And so you can see clearly that when the fringe is in steady state, your heave rate is balancing your freezing rate. But I can then use this to think about sediment freeze-on. Think about sediment freeze on between Heineken. So the only reason that I'm putting this up is to show you the variation of the fringe thicknesses, and also I guess to advertise that we did this paper on Heinrich events. But the important part is, so each one of these dashes here, where times it goes to zero, is when there's a Heinrich event going off, the big ice stream pulse that's happening. And then in these inter-Heinrich periods where it's slowed down and it's freezing, you see these. Slowed down and it's freezing, you see that you can freeze on appreciable amounts of fringe. You're talking about 15 meters or something of fringe. And the reason that I wanted to point that out is that if you imagine doing that everywhere uniformly over the ice stream, okay, it doesn't really have any effect because you're just sort of adding stuff to the bottom of the ice stream. But if you do imagine that you're doing it in a way that it's, you know, In a way that it's heterogeneous. There are places where you're sinking into the bed more than in other places. Then you sort of have a problem where you have some sort of topography, which then you have to ask sort of what happens at the bed that involves this frozen fringe, right? So essentially the sliding lock question becomes even more complicated because you're now thinking about the ability to freeze into the till and move the stuff around, and then the rheology of this stuff is. And then the rheology of this stuff is super complicated. And so, if you have to try to deform that stuff over some bump, that's very complicated. And you might imagine that instead of deforming over it, I might try to generate some fault here where I have these closely spaced places where I've generated frozen fringe. And so it's easier when I'm sliding, instead of deforming, to actually have a plane where I'm just literally have Coulomb friction along. So, you know, this is a water. So, you know, this is a watercolor painting that I did, which is why it looks so terrible. But the important part is that this is no calculation in here. It's just an idea of what might be happening at this bed and how a frozen fringe might be impacting the sliding lot and features like that. So I'll close here and say: I hope I've shown you that frozen fringes exist under glaciers. They have the possibility of generating time-varying topography. Time-varying topography, they interact with the sliding lot and you know respond to heat and force balance. And now, I guess the question is: what do we do with all this? How do we go find frozen fringe? How does transporting sediment like this affect our calculations? And is it sensible to try to put this stuff into inversions? I think it might be. Thank you. We have lots of time for questions. Yeah, Lots of hypercushors. Colin, the assumption about the poor entry pressure assumes, I think, that the ice-water interface is at equilibrium. Do you think that's necessarily the case? Yeah, I mean, so it's a good question. In the terms of surface energy as well. In terms of, yeah, is this surface energy here a well-defined quantity at this interface? Yeah, but you're assuming a curvature and that so if you plunk a piece of ice down or sediment, the surface is then going to change over some time scale. Yeah. The question is that time scale is shorter than the time scale. Yeah, no, I think that is a good question. And I would say that it is, that it's rapid. And in the sense that it's on a very small scale. Because you also know in this whole, because we were talking about this this morning, that the whole rapid thing about these ice lenses is that the stresses don't relax. Right. Yeah, yeah, is it, is there? So, yeah. The point is that you're able to sustain these differences in forces across this distance here, where in a typical sense, if we had a different force, a different stress at this point than in this point, then it would just relax viscously. But the idea is that it's able to support elastic stresses. So I guess I would interpret Andrew's question as asking: you know, on the time scale of the ability to make these, you know, to To make these, you know, to conform to the interface, can I still sustain these elastic stresses? Is that a fair characterization of your question? And I think yes, because it's just, I think yes for two reasons. One, because it's not moving very much. And then the other reason is because I think you're going to start melting as the sediments, you push into the sediments. I mean, if you imagine doing this with a bunch of nails sticking up or something like that, then I'd. And then, you know, at a really high density, like one of those things that you put your face on. That's the typical regulation. Yes, yeah. Which is not the same as this poor entry thing that you're. No, right, right. But I'm just saying that this thing is going to regulate a little bit into there. And then to the point where it starts to have this poor entry. Sounds like a conversation for Beer's. Yes. Yeah. Dan? No, it's not a very good question. Yeah. I was going to know. I was going to ask whether you can say anything about the rheology of this ice-sediment mixture and whether the way that the shearing goes on with it here does it sort of enhance or reduce the effective discovery of the yeah so there's a there's a really nice review paper and the name is escaping me of the the person who wrote it but about the the rheology of About the rheology of ice-sediment mixtures for, you know, across like all the different scales. And the crazy thing is that in certain cases you can get softening, and in certain cases you can get hardening. And so, and so it goes both directions, and it has a lot of complicated features. So, I think that I think it's an experimental question to see, you know, if we take some till and we freeze it, what are the biological characters? Freeze it and what are the rheological characteristics of that. But I think maybe what you're to the larger point you're asking: the reason that we were thinking about this sort of like plowing regime is that I think it's likely that if you had on shorter wavelengths fringe and no fringe, then it would be far easier to relax the stress that's applied to it by shearing along a fault type thing than rather than having the fringe have to deform. Have to deform because it might be rigid enough. And so this comes back to an idea that's out of the frost heave literature, which is that essentially the frozen fringe is rigid. And so this is the rigid ice models that come in, which I'm sure you know about. And so as the frost heaving is happening, the whole packet is moving up rigidly rather than actually deforming. But does that then mean that we should think of the ice-bed interface really as just... ISMED interface really is just the top layer of the frame. Oh, oh, yeah, that is a yes. Thank you. Do you mean this part here or this part here? Well, I mean, if you're saying that that bit's rigid. This part is rigid. Yeah. Yeah. This was a point that I didn't make, but I wish I had and was hoping I would make, is that the bottom of the fringe is most likely to be the location of what we would consider the bottom of the glacier. The bottom of the glacier and not the top of the fringe. Why is that? Why is that? So, when you remember in Matt Siegfried's borehole or whatever, they were drilling through the ice and they were still in the deforming part of it and they were drilling through this whole packet of sediment. And so, like, if you go to lots of glaciers and drill through them, there's some sediment that's frozen on at the bottom, and the slip interface is happening beneath that. Happening beneath that. And I think that that is because this stuff is so rigid. So it's a yield where yield stress is the least. That's what you're defining as the yield stress is less in the ice, it will shear off in the ice. Yeah, no, I mean, and I think that that's totally possible. Yeah, I think it's totally possible. And I also think that it's possible that this stuff is frozen and it's frozen quite deep, and this is a no-slip interface. Right? So essentially, you can't. Right, so essentially you can't deform, it's not sliding. So, maybe like in the ridge of an ice stream, it's frozen, it's a frozen fringe, but then at the top of the frozen fringe, that's where the deformation might be happening. I'm not sure that that came out as clear as I'd hoped. So please continue to ask questions about that. Yeah, I'll try. Two questions. One is, I think in one of your first pictures, and you certainly see this in some of the issues, you've got a really concentrated fan. In some glaciers, you get a really concentrated band of sediment. And I wonder if you can comment on that given your frozen fringe. And the other question was kind of tied in with the people that Elizabeth spoke about earlier. Are there circumstances where you would get, instead of freezing on of sediment, you'd get, for example, lots of dissipation through shearing and heating at the base and therefore melting back out of sediment. And would you be able to? And would you be able to sort of anticipate where you think you'd get freeze on and I'll have to do that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think I'll tackle the first one first, which is that I think that because of these, I think there's, well, I don't know, this is just something that I have been thinking about for these things, is because this is an evolving slip interface, and that's also where you're freezing on, I think that that's why you get this layering. I'm not sure that it has that much to do with the freezing process. That has that much to do with the freezing process. And so, and I pulled this one up because, um, so this is the frozen fringe in the Worcester experiments, right? And so, it's hard to really tell anything, but then it starts kicking off these ice lenses. And depending on the dynamics, I'm sure you've seen these experiments going, you know, these look relatively ordered, but some of them just look crazy. And so there's not a clear pattern. And so we have a grant pending about doing some of these experiments in the lab and trying to see. These experiments in the lab and trying to see what the frozen fringe looks like. So I think about that. And now to your second question. In these Heinrich event simulations that I didn't talk that much about, but here we are using this just a very simple melt rate thing. And so, yes, you have periods of time where you're picking up fringe, and then periods of time where you're letting it go by just because of the heat balance. And so, what I haven't done, but I've worked a little bit. And so, what I haven't done, but I've worked a little bit on, is the transport of fringe, which I think is sort of getting to your point, which is that you can sort of pick up fringe in the upstream part of an ice stream and then carry it into the downstream part of an ice stream where it's then going to start melting off. And so it would start depositing sediment there. Yeah, you have an enthalpy temperature diagram. Yeah, and I want to try to understand it. Is this the enthalpy? Is this, this is the anthropy tangential, this is the diagram for a three-part mixture with a pressure difference across it? Is that a fair description? Yeah, yeah. I think I would say this is a schematic for what you just said. But the other important part is I have put in an ice lens. So it's ice lens, so it's pure ice layer, and then frozen fringe, and then pure water sediments. Okay. Okay. And so, and that's important because then you have this first-order phase transition that's happening there, where you jump from in the frozen fringe, it's partially saturated, to then in the ice lens, it's fully saturated. Whereas the three-phase mixture, I mean, this curve would just essentially continue on down as the water content changes. And then that empirical law that I put up here, this is not right because you. Here, this is not right because you can see that as the saturation, it starts to drop off, whereas this one is just going to continue on and on and on, or whatever, if that makes sense. I mean, in this direction, yeah. Yeah. I think uh I guess I don't know the last question. Just you're gonna
