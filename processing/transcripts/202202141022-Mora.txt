uh looks like it's starting at 10 30. yeah so i should tell people where uh that should have been uh okay i'm sure it's my bad oh the talk was ending at 10 50. the coffee brace was ending at 10 15 okay so okay oh that's good uh okay hi every uh hi everybody there is a little correction we've just been told that actually our break continues uh for another For another five minutes, so we will be back online at 10:30. So, please have a cookie or a healthy snack, and we'll be back soon.           Okay, hi everybody. So we are restarting the morning session and the next speaker is Kiri Mora. Is Kiri Mora, who is going to be talking about long-term strategies of affinity maturation. Kiri, it's the floor is yours. We see only black. And you can unmute. Yes, now it's working. I just need to unmute myself, which I had trouble doing. Now you should see the slides. Well, hello, everybody. First of all, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting together this hybrid event. And so today I'm going to tell you about some purely theoretical work we've been doing with collaborators at the ENS. With collaborators at the ENS, Victor Chardes, Massimo Bagasola, and Alexander Valczak. And so, the idea of this work is to think about design principles of the immune system, to think about ideal immune systems, in particular about immune repertoires. So, as you know, immune repertoires are made of many different, composed of cells with many different receptors. And the diversity of receptors is believed to match. Is believed to match the diversity of possible antigens carried by pathogens that may encounter and has to recognize. And so we view the immune system, in particular the immune repertoire and the memory and immune repertoire, as a record of past infection. And we view the goal of this as a way to better prepare against future ones. And so that means that the immune system through its repertoire has to solve two tasks. One of them, the first one is to predict, is one of predictability, right? Is a one of predictability, right? So, to better protect against the future infection, you better have a good idea what the next infection might be. And that's possible because there's some predictability in the evolution of pathogens. And once it knows that, then it should actually organize its repertoire in an optimal way. And this is a resource allocation problem to best prepare against the most likely next infection. So, why do we have a resource allocation problem? It's because there's a trade-off. Of course, you have a very large number. Of course, you have a very large number of B and T cells and a very large number of specificities, but what really matters is how fast you're going to recognize the bug. And so, what matters really is the concentration. And so that sets some sort of a global constraint on the entire repertoire. And as a result, the statistics of specificities in your repertoire should somewhat match the antigenic environment. So the statistics of what pathogens you're... Statistics of what pathogens you're likely to encounter. So, this is sort of the starting point of some work we've been doing over the past few years. And to put this in more concrete terms, I first need to introduce the concept of immune shape space. So, we're going to put the B cell and T cell receptors or the antibodies, and I focus in this talk on antibodies for a reason you see in a second. We put that and the antigens. Put that and the antigens in the same space with the idea that an antigen and antibody will be close by in that shape space if the antibody has good affinity for this antigen. So here I place my antibody and each of them has some sort of a radius of cross-reactivity. So this is the set of antigens it may recognize. And so for instance, this antigen here would be covered by two antibodies. So we don't really know what the, so this shape space is a theoretical construction. It was proposed by Space is a theoretical construction. It was proposed by Segor and Parson in the 80s. We don't really know what the dimension of the space is, but it has to be relatively low. It's estimated to be five to eight. Maybe if you focus on one particular type of protein, maybe it's lower. So this idea of shape space has been quite fruitful for studying the evolution of viruses. So this is an example for the flu, for instance. So here you see a phylogenetic tree of the flu over the past 30 years. Of the flu over the past 30 years or something, H3 and 2. And here on the right, you see the projection of these strains onto a two-dimensional antigenic map, which was created by doing a dimension interreduction on the results on data from hemagglutination inhibition assays over a panel of antibody sera. And so as I said, like this. So, as I said, this was mostly done on the viral side. So, now we want to actually think about this problem of how to put the immune resources in the same space. And so, when you ask about how should you distribute your repertoire, your immune resources over that antigenic map, you can think of two different levels, two different scales. So, the first scale is like really you think about the entire antigenic map, so all possible antigens that are out there, and the second one. Out there. And the second one is: if you look at a species-specific subspace, or maybe a class of antigen-specific subspace, for instance, here influenza will be represented by this purple area. This will be a close-up. And in the past, we've actually focused more at the cost-grain level, like think about the whole internet space. How should we distribute the resources across these different families of pathogens? And so we learned some broad insights. We learned some broad insight from this. I mean, one sort of obvious one, but we could quantify is the fact that how much receptors you should put against a given disease or pathogen should scale with the concentration or probability of that pathogen. So that's those kind of the static picture. We also look at the dynamics, so how things should be distributed in time. And for instance, you learn that you need to discard memory to make place for new memories. There's a diminishing return and diminishing response upon further reinforcement. Diminishing response upon further reinfections. And also, one conclusion we draw from this is that memory will only be useful if this antigenic space is sparse enough. And that makes sense because here I'm representing the whole space, but in practice, only a few small fraction of the space is actually occupied. So, for instance, if you think of the circulating pathogens out there, they will actually only cover a finite fraction of the entity. Know a finite fraction of the antigenic space. And so today I want to focus on what's going on about. So, what we've been doing so far, as I said, was more the coarse-grain level. And today, I focus on a more detailed view of one particular pathogen or one particular epitope, if you like. And in particular, how the immune system should try to anticipate the escapes from the viruses and the coevolution between the immune system and the pathogens. And the pathogens. So that would be more like a species-specific subspace question. And then the question is: how do we do optimal affinity maturation? And so, what is optimal, what is affinity maturation? So, that's something that, of course, B cells don't have, only B cells have it. And I mean, to give a very brief summary, it's a way for the immune system to make very good receptors. So, it has multiple rounds of proliferation, hypermutations, and selections. Hypermutations and selection for antigen affinity. And the net results is a group of very highly specific B cells or B cell receptors or the soluble version of the antibodies for the varroepitope of interest. And now the question becomes: how do we actually somewhat design this affinity maturation so that it best anticipates the next Tarot strain? So the best. Parallel strain. So, the best, how it would best protect you against future infection with the similar virus. So, think of the flu of SARS-CoV-2 different strains of the same virus. So, again, they live in the same space, antibodies and antigens. And what we want to do with the, from the point of view of the immune system, we want to basically cover the space of possible future viral strains that may have escaped the immune system. That's a co-evolution problem because the virus is also trying to escape the immune system. Also, trying to escape the immune system. So, let's say the virus starts here. And now we're going to, you know, as an immune system, we basically want to place our antibodies in that antenic space. And the first obvious idea is to just put the antibody exactly centered where the virus is. So like perfect affinity maturation. You perfectly target that particular virus strain. Now, this might actually be a good idea if the next exposure to the same virus is as almost the same. As you know, almost the same as the original virus, right? There's only a few antigenic mutations, so that you can still recognize the virus with the same antibodies. Now, the issue is that if the virus in the meantime has actually evolved a lot or it did a big escape, in that case, this antibody would not be very good at recognizing the virus. So, in that case, it might actually be a better idea to, instead of having just a single specificity, to have a, you know, Specificity to have a, you know, do some sort of bed hedging and having many different specificities that are not very much centered around the virus that we initially saw, but that have a better chance of covering the SKPs. And so the best strategy will depend, of course, on the context, and that's what we want to study in a more quantitative way. So let me introduce some of the scales we're going to talk about. The cross-reactivity radius will be called R0. There will be the viral divergence. There will be the viral divergence. This is how much typically the virus is expected to jump from one exposure to the next, sigma v. And then this will be this diversification parameter, which is the spread of those red balls that will be sigma. In addition to that, we'd assume that if the immune system actually misses with its memory the next viral strain, right, then we still can still get a de novo response from the naive repertoire and the innate immune system. And the inadequate system, and that will provide some sort of basal background protection. So, the best strategy will depend on the context. And in our model here, the strategy will simply be parametrized by just two things, which is the number of different antibodies, antibody specificities that we create, called M, and this spread sigma, which I just introduced. This spread sigma, which I just introduced. So, to make sense of, you know, to pose formally the question of what's the best strategy, we need to say what does it mean to be best. And so for that, we define a cost function. And a cost function is essentially two contributions. One from the harm from the infection. And the second one is a metabolic cost. So the metabolic cost, we assume a very simple function, which just says proportion. Assume a very simple function which just stays proportional to the number of new memories we make. So the more memories you make, the more affinity maturation you need to power. And so that's carelinearly in our model. And then the first term, the infection cost, is the best of, so it comes from, if it comes from, it's an inverse function of the coverage, so C is the coverage, and it's the best of the two coverages. The naive coverage is this basal background protection. Coverage is this basel background protection. So that's basically what will be used in case there's actually no good memory. And if you do have good memory, then this C would be better. And this C is calculated as a convolution of the concentration of antibodies at that position with the cross-reactivity, which is a decaying function of the distance between antibody and virus. So that's almost in the definition of an antigenic space. Definition of an energy space that's the distinction should be decreasing. In addition to that, when there's a new infection, we assume that existing antibodies, so antibody clonotypes, will also react in response to that virus. So it's not just that we're creating new ones, it's that the existing ones have their own dynamics. And we assume, you know, do the simplest possible assumption, which is that they will be boosted. Will be boosted proportionally to how well they recognize the virus. There's also a basal decay rate. If they don't recognize anything, eventually they'll decay. So then the name of the game is just to do a mathematical optimization over our two parameters, M and sigma. And in fact, M and sigma are not just two numbers. They will be in our model functions of the infection cost with the idea that the immune system may choose to do different things depending on how. Choose to do different things depending on how hardly hit it was by the infection. And so this is the sort of result that we can get. As we vary the parameters, we actually find three broad phases. So by set parameters, here I'm showing as a function of two important ones. One is the viral divergence, so how fast the virus diverges. So this is sigma v. The virus diverges, so this is sigma v, by the way. Sorry, and the second one is how much background protection there is. And you can see that if the virus diverges too much from one exposure to the next, or if the de novo coverage is too high, in that case, it's actually not worth making any new memories at all. So basically, then you don't really, basically, that's the phase in which the affinity maturation or even the memories are used. Memories are useless, right? But then, so that's not the very interesting phase. But then, in the memory phase, we actually have two sub-phases: one which is a monoclonal response and the pronuclonal responses. So, let me show you small animations to show the difference. So the monoclonal response means it's basically the naive strategy I was telling you about a second ago, which is that you just center one antibody exactly where the virus is. And so, the sort of dynamics you get this way. dynamics you you you get this way is that uh you know at each so here in red you see the position of the virus and the antibody is put where the virus was at each time step and the virus is doing a random walk and you can see whenever the virus goes somewhere it is somewhere you know there is some protection here the color map actually shows the infection cost so it's a proxy for the coverage so that's the monoclonal response by contrast in the polyclonal phase what happens is that at each time step What happens is that at each time step of the virus, you create a ton of antibodies shown by the black dots, and with some scatter. And you can see that thanks to that, you can actually deal with pretty long jumps of the virus. So this will be a single precise memory. And this will be, if you like, a fuzzy memory or bad hedging, the fact that you don't actually put an antibody exactly where the virus was, but you allow yourself for some fuzziness. Allow yourself for some fuzziness. So you can see it again in the value of the parameters. If you take a cross-section of the phase diagram, how much diversification you should have as a function of variant divergence, it's an increasing function up to a point where it collapses and goes back to the no-memory phase. Same thing for the optimal size. And here you can see how much you will have to do a de novo response as a function of R divergence. Not surprisingly, it's an increasing. Not surprisingly, it's an increasing function. Now, the interesting thing is that these two phases actually have parallel correlates. In a way, that's something that the immune system actually does, because that's some detail I didn't go into. But as a result of affinity maturation, there's actually two different types of output. There's the plasma cells, which are really the end products of the affinity maturation, which are really the best binders. But it's been also shown that memory cells are being also output. Memory cells are being also output before these plasma cells are really well mature. And these guys are actually worse binders. So you can view them as really this kind of bed hedging strategy. And so that means that these two types of cells really realize these two types of phases to deal with different expected values for the viral divergence. Of course, these are called memory B cells, but Course, these are called memory B cells, but I should point out that even the plasma cells can be long-lived. So, in my model, they would both be considered memory. Now, what I've told you so far is I've just shown you the one value of M and one value of sigma. But as I said, the strategy in principle is to have a whole function and sigma of the infection cost. And if we actually look at the optimal strategy, Look at the optimal strategy, we find that the optimal strategy is not always to make new memories. What we find is that there's some sort of a threshold of the infection cost under which the immune system thinks it's probably not worth making new memories and carry the metabolic cost of it. So, in this phase, it would be worth it to make memories. It would then be worth it. And the prediction that comes from this is that if you already have good protection against the infection that The infection that affects you, then it may actually suppress the creation of novel antibodies that will be more specific to the current infection. And so that creates this sort of dynamics where this is the infection cost. This on the x-axis here is the index of the exposure or infection. And here is the infection cost. As long as you remain below As you remain below this threshold, basically, you don't make any new memories, you rely on existing memories and you back boost them. So you get a booster every time, but you don't create any new ones. But at some point, the virus will just escape and then you carry a big cost. And in that case, you actually need to make a new memory. And all of this is a prediction of the model. But what's nice is that actually next back to a known phenomenon in immunology, which is called a In immunology, which is called original angiogenic syn is a phenomenon that almost, I mean, almost exactly what I just described, which is the fact that if you're vaccinated against a strain B, the response to B will be worse if you were previously, before the immunization would be, immunized with A, right? And the reason for this is that instead of making new good memory, you will reuse the memory from A, which is worse, and you put it back. A, which is worse, and you bring back boosted. And this is, for instance, a result from an experiment in NICE. You can see that if you were vaccinated with A before, you get a worse response. You also get a back boost of A after vaccination with B. And all of this is predicted by the model. Another prediction that the model makes is that this effect of original antigenic syn, it should basically disappear as you have a larger and larger As you have a larger and larger divergence between A and B, because in that case, the immune system will actually not recognize the similarity between A and B and will try to do a new potential response against B. So now we can also look at the dynamics that underlies this. So, you know, it's a byproduct of the model, if you like. But it's basically the idea I was telling you about of this back boosting, which is that. Of this back boosting, which is that once you've created your specificities, these antibodies, these antibodies will always be boosted again by new exposures to similar viruses. And what we expect to happen is that as long as the virus, so here you can hardly see, but the virus is doing its random work here, shown in red, and as long as it remains within the cross-reactivity radius, the B cell carrying the receptors that recognize this virus will continue growing. Will continue growing. And so you get an exponential growth with the rate gamma, which is just the maximum rate, up to a point where it will start escaping. So actually, usually that's exactly what happens when the new specific seeds are made. But from the point of view of these old memories, this is also the point where they start decaying. And what we can show within the model is that the time, the residence time that this virus will stay with. That this virus will stay within the cross-reactivity radius of a given antibody is exponentially distributed with some characteristic time. And so that's the time it remains there is T star. And as a consequence, since during the whole time, this antibody abundance would grow exponentially, then this results in a parallel for the distribution of the antibody. For the distribution of the antibody abundances, right? And the prediction we make here is that if you look at viruses that evolve slowly, you should get a fatter tail in the distribution of antibody abundances. Not surprisingly, because in that case, they get boosted more and many more times. And in fact, you can actually look at B-Sa-receptor repertoires. And here we looked at one of the recent. Here we looked at one of the recent studies that did the high throughput sequencing of IgH, so just a heavy chain, that gives you a good idea of what happens for the whole chain, for the whole receptor. And we find that indeed we observe these parallel distributions in the distribution of antibody abundances. And so we can, in fact, use that to use the formulas in the model to make a prediction, an estimate for how much divergence. An estimate for how much divergence there is on average in the whole repertoire as a function of the dimension of the antigenic space, which we don't know, right? But like roughly speaking, we find that this divergence is estimated to be about one half of the cross-reactivity radius. So I'm more or less done. So just remind, just recall the tech. Mind, just recall the take-home points. So, we have a theory for optimal strategies of affinity maturation. One result is that we rationalize the maintenance of sub-optimal memory, so these fuzzy memories, which are implemented by memory B cells in the real immune system. We also rationalize the original antigening SIN. So, not really, in our view, it's not really a SIN. It's really a byproduct of being of the optimal strategy. Byproduct of being the optimal strategy, and we also show that we can explain the parallel behavior in the clone size distribution of antibodies. And with that, I'm happy to take questions from the room or online. Thank you. All right, any questions? Okay, so Thomas. Hi, Terry. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Can you hear me? Yes. I'm sorry, I sort of missed something completely basic. So over which time scales does your optimization work? Is this sort of an evolutionary time scale of the immune system seeing again and again? Oh yeah, okay. I mean, what's optimized over is really the parameters of the immune system. So that's set for the whole human race or mice. Right. To the whole human race or mice, if you like. Okay. So the scenario would be that the immune system knows somehow that the virus is optimizing it, a virus is evolving at different rate. So we propose this general theory where we assume that the divergence rate of the virus is a variable, right? And this is why we find different phases. And our argument is that the immune system, because there are System, because there are different viruses with different evolvability or mutation rates, it's actually evolved different arms to deal with the different situations. So that's why we think that in our phase diagram, we actually find cells that basically specialize in different parts of the phase diagram. I see. So you would get sort of the broad memory repertoire and the more. Memory repertoire and the more focused and high-affinity plasma cell repertoire, I would say, corresponds to your sort of monoclonal and polyclonal memory phases to some extent. Oh, yeah. Okay. Thanks. Hi, Terry. This is Paul. I really enjoyed the talk. I was curious if you thought about extending this model to include a sort of similar dynamics from the TFH compartment and how that might provide. And how that might provide sort of an additional layer of harm detection and/or memory drift kind of trajectories. Yeah, no, we try to keep it simple and
