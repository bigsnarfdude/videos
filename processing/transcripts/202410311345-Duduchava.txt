Yes, I will speak about convolution equations and there will not be factorization because, well, there can be factorization, you will see it. Because if we have convolution equations, we always have factorization there. But I will not speak about factorization. I will speak about new convolution equations. What is the main What is the main topic? I will explain something, very simple things about Lie groups and then show you examples of convolution equations on Lie groups. Many examples, there are many examples, but one example is most important nowadays. Perhaps there will be the other also important examples later. And then application to Then application to scattering problem in domains with angular points. Okay, let me start. First of all, what is the Lie group? A very simple object. You have a set where you have, which is manifold, and you have the group operation which, well, we have the identity element or neutral. Or neutral element, inverse, every element is invertible in this group. And it is very interesting that if you have all these, then you have uniquely defined R measure, so we can integrate on the group. You have Fourier transform, which is very important, you know, for convolution equations. And well, you have also different. Also, differential operators which we call generic differential operators, which are assigned to these particular groups. And they differ from the coordinate differentiation for different groups. Convolution operators, they are defined as in classical case. You take Fourier transform. Fourier transform, multiply it by some function, and take inverse Fourier transform. And this function can be from the Schwarz distribution. If you take function, original function from a Schwartz fast decaying function, then take Fourier transform, then multiply by distribution. By distribution, Schwartz distribution take inverse Fourier transform. This operator acts from Schwartz first decaying function to the distribution, Schwarz distribution functions, and this is convolution. And if this operator can be extended to the as a bounded operator in Lp, then this function is called LP multiplier. That's a classical, how to say. How to say classical case LP multiplier, and what we consider the groups which are homeomorphic to RN, and that's why the multiplier classes here are the same as in RN. So we don't need to look new properties of this multiplier classes, they are the same. Okay, since we have the convolution operator, we have to investigate. We have to investigate their invertibility because I will show you the important examples. We can investigate even not only simple convolution equations, but convolution integral differential equation. As I told you, to the group is assigned the group Lie algebra to Lie group has his Lie algebra, and the vector fields from this Lie algebra generally. Fields from this Lie algebra generate differential operators which are generic differential operators and which are convolutions also convolutions and they differ from the differential usual coordinate differentiation. And if we consider such an operator as is written here, the generic differential operators convolutions, which is written in this form with the group operation. So this is all together. So this is all together, this is the convolution operator. And for this convolution operator, we symbol, we can define this symbol. Symbol is the Fourier transform of the kernel and is defined here. And now we can, yes, that's about multiplier classes. For p is equal to, the multipliers are L infinity functions as usual. Functions as usual. And also, here, multipliers are also all functions in LPU, all functions which are thiswise constant on multi-tops. But, well, let me skip this because we have a lot to tell you. For this purpose, we define the generic vessel potential spacing. Yes. Of space. Yes. Sorry. It is important now to define the space which is best adapted to the investigation of our integral differential operators. And this is a generic vessel potential space, which differs from the classical vessel potential spaces, but is defined absolutely the same way as the vessel potential spaces. I mean, you take You take function, you take the Fourier transform, multiply by this function, and take inverse Fourier transform. So you take convolution operator with this symbol. And if it is in LP, we call it HSP. Definition is absolutely the same as in the case of classical Bessel potential space, but they are different because, well, Because well, as in the classical Bessel potential spaces, for the integer values of S, they coincide with Sobov space, Sovelov space, which is defined with the help of derivatives, but not the usual derivatives, but generic derivatives. So now we have the space, and now we have considered, we can consider convolutional. Convolution operators between generic vessel potential spaces. Since they are convolutions, and these spaces are defined with the help of convolutions, so everything is much easier to calculate here and to prove theorems. And well, okay, let me continue. And here is the theorem. Well, for the convolution equation to be practical, and if it is practical, it is always invertible. It is necessary that the symbol will be elliptic, elliptic. But it's only necessary condition. Sufficient condition is if Condition is if this symbol belongs to smaller class of, for example, the closure of multi-tops or in one-dimensional case, for example, functions of bounded variation. Then the ellipticity is also a necessary condition. But this condition cannot be sufficient in general case because there exists, yeah. Yeah, and the inverse operator is written as the inverse of the symbol. And Fourier convulsion with the inverse symbol is the inverse operator. If you consider it's on the half group, for example, not on the whole group, but minus one, one is the group, interval is the group, I will show you. And if you consider it on 0, 1 restriction, then you need factorization. Restriction, then you need factorization, of course. But if you consider in the whole group minus one, one, then the ellipticity condition is necessary and in some cases also sufficient. And but there exists Igari paradox. Igari showed that there exist continuous functions which are elliptic, but the But the inverse is not multiplier. Function is multiplier, is elliptic, and inverse is not elliptic. So that means that the condition cannot be, ellipticity condition cannot be sufficient in general case. Okay. Also, we can construct a fundamental solution of this generic differential. Of these generic differential operators. How? We take this as a convolution. We take the inverse operator and take the Harmander's kernel of the inverse operator, and it will be fundamental solution of this equation. If we have fundamental solution, when we have potential theory, and we can solve some boundaries problems in domains, not on the whole group, but on the domains. This representation of solutions. Representation of solutions and whole potential theory can be developed here. Okay, now we go to the examples. Yes. Most trivial example is the classical convolutions on array. When you have in the kernel, difference of arguments here. This is the most classical. RN is of course. The Rn is, of course, a group with respect to the taking sum. And well, the generic differential operators are usual coordinate derivatives. And the convolution is this operator. And this theory is very well known. Second example is the group R plus, half line, or you can take also the direct product of half lines Rn plus. And this is also good. Uh, and this is also grouped with respect to multiplication. Here, our measure is dt over t. Generic differential operator in this case is t d dt, derivative multiplied by the independent variable. And well, convolution operator is the Meline convolution, and the Fourier transform coincides with the Melin transform, and the convolution operator is here, and of course, it Operator is here, and of course, it has a lot of applications in mechanics and mathematical physics and so on. The third example is a new one that's a group minus one, one. If you define the group operation in this form, x plus y, one plus x, y, it is homeomorphism of interval into itself, and it is a group operation. And the hard measure in this case is. And the hard measure in this case is dx over one minus x squared. The Fourier transform is exposed here. Yes. And well, this is an interesting group. And in this group, you have a Fourier transform, this one. Inverse Fourier transform also. Fourier transform was in the previous slide. This is inverse Fourier transform. Fourier transform and the convolution operator. Convolution operator has a, as you see, such a form. It's not a difference argument, it's not the ratio of arguments, it's both of them. And this is the convolution equation in group minus one, one and well, generic differential operator, which is also convolution in this group. In this group, and well, and most interesting is here that there exists several examples of very famous integral equations which fall into this class of convolution equations. First of them is the airfoil equation of Prandtl equation. Prandtl equation is integral differential equation. integral differential equation has derivative, as you see, this singular integral differential equation. And it has many applications and it was investigated on the Fredbon property, on invertibility and numerical solutions, but nobody had written the inverse to this operator before because nobody guessed that it was a convolution operator. But it turned out to be convolution operator. To be a convolution operator, and here is this symbol of this operator. If this symbol is not zero, this equation is invertible, and the inverse can be written as a convolution with the inverse symbol. And the essential spectra is this line from minus infinity to infinity, essential spectra of this operator. Another example is trichomy equation, singular trichomi equation, which comes from Equation, which comes from the mixed-type Boundarow probes. And Tricomi derived it in the 30s, I think, or 20s. And well, it was also investigated on Fredgold property. It has, as you see, fixed singularity. Here, singularity in the kernel occurs when you have x is equal to y and that's equal to plasma minus one. And here is the usual cautious singular integral operator. And it also turned out. And it also turned out to be convolution on the interval minus one, one. And this symbol is here. And well, the invertibility you have at the end, if this symbol doesn't is elliptic, this equation, you can write the inverse of this equation. I mean, solve it explicitly. Here is the spectra of this operator. Operator. It has always essential spectra, no point-wise spectrum, and so on. And the third equation of this type is Labrento-Pizzada equation, which also arises in boundaries problems for mixed type boundaries problems. And it's also a singular integral equation. It's on integral 0, 1, but you can transform 0, 1 to minus. Transform 0, 1 to minus 1, 1, it becomes convolution on the interval minus 1, 1 on this group. And again, you can calculate symbol, it's written here. And well, the spectra is this line, vertical line. Okay. And well, my interest to this topic was attracted by the work of By the work of Petrov from Petterburg and Petrov Susleda. They have just used this transformation written here of the interval minus one, one to the axis and transform these three equations to the equation on the axis and it find out that it was convolution simply. But they don't guess that here was the group and you Here was the group, and you can consider it as the equations from the groups on the group. And well, they developed the spaceless setting and had written the conditions for solvability. But you can develop the full theory with multipliers and everything in the LP theory. They had mostly L2 theory of it. Okay, and my colleague from Dublin, Nukzar Shavlahadri, also solved the same transformation independently from. Transformation independently from petrol, also transformed the Plant equation with this transformation and find out that it was convolution. And well, we, with my colleagues, Mikhail Rozalski, Michael Rozowski, Ivan Cardona, and Arne Hendricks, they are in Ghent in Belgium. we we find a lot of examples of the groups we have found these groups found for them hard measures characters Fourier transforms generic differential operators and convolution operators for those groups but this work is ongoing and well also we have the results but we don't publish it yet Published it yet. And what those groups are: cuspidal cones, when you have cusps at the tips. Usual cones, of course. Also, what was for us surprising and any star-shaped domain in RN, not only on the R2, but in RN, any star-shaped domain is a Lie group. You can define the operation there. You can define the operation there, can define Fourier transform and everything. I don't know what consequences it will have, but I think it is interesting by itself. I mean, mathematically. But I think it will have also application, but we have to look for it carefully. And many other figures also can be such a cones and double cones and well cylinders and Cylinders and everything can be made in Lie group. For example, these waveguides, carved waveguides also can be defined as a Lie group. And okay, that's the first part of my talk. Now about, I want to tell you the application to the boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation. Value problem for the Helmholtz equation of the generic Bessel potential spaces. Because for these problems, when you have the angular points on the boundary of the domain, it is much more useful to consider those problems in generic vessel potential spaces than in usual vessel potential. We considered it first. We considered it first with my student Medea Zara, considered it in usual vessel potential spaces based on my results with Hidenko, convolution equations in vessel potential spaces. There are some conflict because convolution equations are usual convolutions, classical, and the vessel potential, I mean the convolution equations with mean the convolution equations which occur here are Maline convolutions and the Bessel potential spaces are defined with the help of classical convolutions so they they they collide there and not not it's difficult okay what we have done consider such a domain which has angular points goes to infinity and ignore this line here I had no other picture so I I had no other picture, so I picked up this picture. And angular points, T1, Tn, and well, domain omega. And we consider the boundary well problem components equation and mixed boundary well problem. I mean, on the part of the boundary, we have the Richley condition, on another part, we have Neumann condition. And well, it's usual Laplace equation. It's usual Laplace equation, delta. And well, let us dwell on this equation. Yes, we prefer to consider it in non-classical Senegal. I mean, in HSP, generic vessel potential species, but SPP different from two. Why? Because here it is possible to investigate deeper. Investigate deeper the behavior of solutions in this case. And okay, what we have done in this respect. We classify these knots where we have angular points in three classes. First is when the Dirichlet, Dirichlet condition, two Dirichlet conditions collide at this point. This point, Neyman, Neyman collide, Neyman conditions collide, or Drichle and Neyman conditions collide. Three types, and they have different answers in this case. Okay, what we apply here is the localization. We localize it, this problem, at the nodes and at infinity. At infinity, we localize it to usual Mutual scattering equation with k-square, but on half-line, half-plane. So the investigation there is known. Well, many results are known about it, but without angular points. But at angular points, they are localized to such angles. As you see here, this is the same angle here as at this angular point, and we have. Point, and we have in the three cases: Dirichlet-Dirichlet conditions, Dirichlet Neyman-Neyman conditions, and Dirichlet-Neyman conditions. And we investigated in this way. How we investigated it, of course, we applied the potential method and reduced it to boundar integral equations, boundar integral equations, which turned out to be some. Which turned out to be convolutions, Maline convolution equations. I will show you the one example of such equation. Yes, three types of equations, as I told you. Then you have this Dirichlet-Dirichle, Neyman-Neyman, and this third one, Dirichlet-Neyman, mixed type. These three and here also we have these two types of Two types of we have to localize it on the lines going to infinity. If on this line at infinity we have Dirichlet condition, then the locally representative is this problem here, Dirichlet. If one of them can be Dirichlet on another one, Neyman, then we have both of them to investigate, but on half plane. Plane and if it's Neumann, then you have to investigate only one Neumann condition, boundary one formula with Neumann condition. Okay, and here is the theorem. For the Fredgon property of this initial boundarial problem in the domains with singular points, it is Fredgon if and only if these scattering problems are solved. Problems are solvable, and these problems which we had rectangular points, localized problems, all of them are fragile. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for this problem to be fragile. And if this scattering problem is uniquely solvable, then there exists some interval of the some interval. Some interval, it's yes, here. Some interval for these parameters where this problem has a unique solution. Unique solution. And how we prove this? We just, here is the theorem. This is the condition when we have Dirichlet-Dirichlet condition at the point. This is the condition when we have Neyman-Neyman. Condition when we have Neyman-Neyman point, and this is the mixed point. I mean, when the Tirkel and Neyman collide at this point. Outline of the proof. Well, we apply the boundary, we reduce it to boundary integral equation, which is here is exposed only one in Dirichlet case. This integral equation, two by two, now it's only half axis. These integral operators are Maline convolutions. And we can write symbol and determinant of symbol is not zero, symbol is here, and determinant of the symbol is not zero. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for this equation to be uniquely solvable. And this gives you the answer to the problem. Okay? Public. Okay. With Duvan and Michael and Andre Arne, we also investigated several differential operators. There are some new results, some auditors results, but also the classical results of Calderon-Weilenko theorem and Goffberg's lemma on compactness of the pseudo-differential operators and so on. And we investigate. And we investigate observed differential operators on the weak group minus one, one. Well, this is this is not published, yes, submitted. Okay, this was what I wanted to tell you. Thank you for your attention.
