That's here. So, I'm talking about something, a joint work with Archon Sen. Archon was actually a high school student, but we did this to break a lot of him. He's great. And this is based on something that's already in the archive. And also, my slides are on my website. My name's quite unique. So you can look at your own pace if you want to pull this. So, this talk might be a lot like Danny's talk in the sense that we'll start. We've heard this a lot, but we're just going to quickly review how our But we're just going to quickly review how Markov numbers show up in cluster algebras just to motivate this different family of numbers that, from the cluster perspective, is kind of natural to look at also. So we'll go a bit quick through the clustery part. So it's, yeah, so cluster algebra people like Markov numbers because Markov numbers come from specializing the cluster variables in one certain cluster algebra. They can specialize their initial variables to one, then you get all the Markov numbers. Variables to one, then you get all the conclusive numbers. Magic is that this mutation holds. That you can find a cluster alt, there's a pointer. You can find a cluster altogether overall, the mutation looks like this, which is like one way to write the V. Also, the fact that we have the Gurant phenomenon in general assures us that when we specialize everything to one, they always get integers. So here it's, I guess, for Markup numbers, it's easy to see most of the integers. These are the things we have heard about. And as was also mentioned, at least in Dandy's talk, possibly other places as well. And I mean, we've all been talking about a once-punctured torus all week. This genuinely is the cluster algebra that you would come up with if you were just studying once-punctured torus. And in general, if you have any marked surface, so surface of some marked points, some could be on a boundary, some could be off, you can build a cluster algebra from that. A cluster algebra from that. So that the cluster variables correspond to the arcs. So arcs without self-curves without self-intersection whose endpoints are on the mark points. Triangulations give clusters. And the exchange graph of the cluster algebra coincides with a flip graph of the triangulation. And so there's two papers cited here because you can think about this sort of in a combinatorial way. I mean, exchange graphs, surfaces are a fun thing to play with already. Or you can think of this class. Or you can think of this cluster algebra, like these cluster variables, as lambda lengths measuring the decorated Tech Mueller space of the space. So there's a lot of meaning you can infuse. These are most nice cluster algebras, I can say, in my opinion. Okay, all right. As we said, this is the Markov cluster algebra. So the cluster algebra comes from the Lunch Puncture torus. So you get all sorts of nice correspondences between things in the Markov land, basic cluster. Basic cluster definitions and then geometric things on a torque. And yeah, one way you can see that the cluster algebra from the Lutz Puncture Taurus always has this sort of exchange relation. Well, a really nice feature is that every triangulation of Let's Puncture Taurus locally looks the same. That doesn't happen for a lot of surfaces. And when you zoom in, so that's a triangulation. And when you zoom in on the puncture, and you look at how all the arcs relate, for example, like X2 follows. For example, like x2 follows x1 twice in a clockwise order, and x3 follows x2 twice, and so on. That's how you could, if you didn't know about Markov numbers, but you just knew about cluster algebras, you would write down the 16 following on the other practice. And to finish our recap of all these different things, so if we're going to think about different, so of course, there's really only one way to triangulate a one's function torus, but you can do Chorus, but you can do flips and you get new things that look, they look sort of the same, but on top of the original triangulation, we cross lots of things. That's how we're getting more and more complicated cluster variables, infinitely many cluster variables. So we like to draw that on Z2. And we can keep, so we think of, well, when we do this, we sort of think about simultaneously flipping all the arcs that are lifted with the same arc in the charts. And then the slopes of those flips agrees with the berry sun. And then what? Sun. And then we have our corresponding cluster algebra elements, which we can compute either from mutation or with snake graphs. I drew the snake graphs just for the non-initials on the bottom. The initials are kind of boring. And then in between, we have the Markov numbers, which could be seen as specializing the cluster variables, or just counting for the functions. That's all the fun stuff we've been learning about. And now time to get to some orbifolds. So basically, I'm going to tell a parallel story. I'm going to tell a parallel story for something called a generalized cluster algebra for the orbifold. We'll get a different family of numbers, but it'll have a lot of similar properties because of its commentorial side. And, okay, there are some orbifold experts out there, probably. So when I say orbifold, what I mean is I'm going to take that mark surface that you can build a cluster algebra from, and I'm going to add the data of another set of points called orbifold points. They're always going to be on the curious surface. They're not going to coincide with marked points. They're not going to coincide with marked points, so my curves aren't allowed to touch them. When we triangulate the orbifold, we're going to have, for every orbifold point, we'll have to have a special arc that winds around it and just cuts out a monagon just with that one orbifold point. We'll call that a pending arc. You'll see that'll have a slightly different behavior in the cluster algebra. And then, okay, so every point comes with an order. So we should think of orbital points, some sort of like singularity point with a group action. So the order would reflect that. So, the order would reflect that. And what will come up is that there's an associated constant then. So, if you have order, so the order of some integer is at least two, and your associated constant is two cosine pi over r, the order means if you had some arc and it was winding too many times around the orbital point, it's isotopic just to winding like r less times. It's like a mod r action number. But we won't really care about arcs that self-intersect. Arcs that self-intersect because we'll care about genuine arcs without self-intersection. But that's sort of the meaning of the game of these points. Okay, so 2 cosine pi over 2 is 0. So if all your orbital points are order 2, you get genuine cluster algebra, not generalized cluster algebras. They're called skew symmetrizical. They're a little more complicated than some of the cluster algebra to be very doubled. But if you have some orbital points with order at least three, you're going to get something called a Get something called a generalized cluster. So you could follow Ryan's talk and put generalized in a lot of places, and that would work as a definition. The only thing that changes with these is that you're allowed to have longer exchange polynomials. But it's not just any exchange polynomial. So you can see the two types we'll have here. So we'll either have two term things which are gonna look like ordin, which will look like ordinary cluster mutation. So this looks a lot like the in Danny's talk, right? A lot like the in Danny's tongue, right? You set the square, doing mutation of the square. And we also will have exchange polynomials that have three terms, that look kind of like some homogenous symmetric polynomial or something. And then that constant shows up in the middle. So that's the place where you see the order of the orbifold point in this middle coefficient of your exchange polynomial. Okay, so, and we're really just thinking about these as coming from orbifolds. I mean, you could take a step back and define one with a quiver. A step back and define one with a quiver, or yeah, with a quiver and all that. But all we're going to care about in our mind is: okay, we have an orbit filled, we have some initial triangulation, and we give an initial set of algebraic variables. We can do flips on the orbit fold, and then we just do corresponding mutations like this, depending on what sort of arcs we can flip on. And that's our uh generalized construct. Are there any questions right now? This is prevalent to your question, Roger Bob, on a cover of this stuff. About on a cover of this stuff, that's where you kind of identify variables with map to the screen. Yeah, I took that slide out. But yeah, I mean, yeah, it basically should somewhat be like this. Though it can be very complicated to describe what that circumstance should be. But yeah, that's how you can get a lot of intuition. Yeah. For you, like the cone points, the orbital points, they have to be like integral. Like you're not dealing with cone metrics that are not interrogable. Dealing with coin metrics that are not. Yeah, I think that's right. It's not any, there's other types of orbital points that are not being by this. So like type C cluster algebra is right there's a D classification, type C are like having an order two orbital plane, but type B is like some other type of orbital plane. Yeah. So I think it's yeah, the first striped development. Okay, so we'll motivate why this gets the name and just assignment. Why this gets the name in just a second, but we'll define now the orbifold-Markov equation to be this. This has been, it's another yet, like a homogenous metric colony, set up in a way you can see that all ones solve such Xbox. There's an alternate way to write it below. Maybe some of you prefer this. And so at a base level, this works just a lot like the Markov equation, in that all solutions are reachable from the all-one solution by the Adaptation. Solution by V eta jumps, and you prove this. The proof just goes through slightly different numbers, the original proof. And okay, so the V eta jumps look like this. You can see our inspiration is that the V eta jumps look like generalized cluster mutation with mil coefficient one, so we can have order three things. And again, you can rewrite that term. So if ABC was a solution, you'd rewrite that term in another way. So you get this nice, like, oh, it's an integer, oh, it's possible. I always think that's nice. I always think that's nice. Yeah. So that's our orbifold-Markov equation, and so Orbifold-Markov triples and Markov numbers correspond to solutions here. Here's just the first two numbers. Some people like to see concrete numbers. Time committing at the end, we'll talk about. You know, we have like an analog of the branch that has Fibonacci numbers. So the one where you he'll hold one fixed, and then pick up a And then pick up a 3 and hold a 3 fix, we get an analog of telconics. In the previous slide, if you put other constants in front of the mixed term, the AB, the AC, and the B C, would you still have the same result? Yeah, so, okay, so there was another name, like Yasuaki Yoda has looked at these same equations, and then with a collaborator in Matoshida, they looked at with general co-equations. With general coefficients. And yeah, that stuff, stuff from the first slide goes through, and the stuff I'm going to talk about next goes through with just a little, you just keep track of the k's, of course. But everything works just fine here. However, what's interesting is if the k's aren't equal, the uniqueness conjecture fails. But there's no known counterexample to the uniqueness conjecture if the k's are equal. So, all k's being equal might be sort of nicer. It's also just easier. But yeah, a lot of stuff at a commentary level. Yeah, a lot of stuff at a commentary level still works with this general equation. Yeah, I'd recommend. They have like, yeah, this paper just has all these equations that are variants of the Markov equation. So if you like playing with that sort of thing, I'd recommend you can. That's the determinants which appeared in Girasanax 4. The Ki is on the diagonal, and you've got the K D Cymmetric matrix. Oh, okay, yeah, yeah. Yeah, not fully. Hopefully, yeah, that seems like a lifetime. He was asking questions about it. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, yeah. Good. Okay, well, hopefully, he's still on soon. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, you could see this, I guess, I mean, technically, so if the case, I like to think about them as integers. So, if the case can be more general than like a lambda r constant, but a lot of what works with generalized cluster algebra doesn't need that middle coefficient to be lambda plus lambda r. That's only really nice if you're doing research. That's only really nice if you're doing these self-defense. So, all of these can be interpreted with generalized cluster algebras. Yeah, and I could, it's not in the slides because it just makes them more notation heavy, but you can add k's throughout what I'm going to say and calculate it. And that's also either in this paper or maybe I'll follow up. But, yeah. Any other questions? Okay, so okay, we gave it this name and we did this preamble. So if there exists a generalized cluster algebra where mutations always look like this, then these orbitals mark out specializations of generalized cluster variables. And okay, I couldn't even have a cliffhanger for a slide. Like, yes. So the orbichold you want to think about, because that's the way we've really defined these generalized cluster algebra is just coming from orbicles, is this fidget spinner. Is this fidget spinner? So it's a sphere with one puncture and three orbital points. So again, there's really only one way you can triangulate that. You have to put a pending arc around each. And then, okay, you can do flips, but you get a new thing that just looks like that. And I was thinking, so Danny was talking about these angles, and I think you can look at the angles here and also see the equation, which I hadn't thought about before. This, so that's really nice. So like this, you know, you have these three angles that are between two things and the other one's on the opposite side. things and the other one's on the opposite side. So that would give the, that would give one, okay, can't do algebra on this one, that gives half the terms. And then what you want to think about with these, if blue was like x, oh okay, we're doing x, y, z here. If blue was like associated variable x, here you'd want to associate it with just 1 over x or something. Whereas this would be like z over xy. Okay, so I just thought about this earlier, but the angle thing would also work to explain simplicity. Happy to learn about this. Happy to learn about this. Okay, so an analogous slide to the Taurus case. I mean, right now it makes less sense to name these with like very sum. Raption bubble justify that a bit. But again, we have this orbifold. We can do flips. We can make cluster variables. They're longer, so I didn't really write it out. But we specialize and get the first few numbers. And next, we'd like to interpret these numbers combinatorially. And also, And also, it's quite cumbersome to write, to keep doing this. So it'd be nice to have a shortcut to understanding these without really drawing the windier and windier fidgets for this. So the motivation for the project was previous work with Elizabeth Kelly to give snake graph formulas for cluster variables, generalized cluster variables from orbifolds. This disintegration doesn't totally make sense. This disnotation doesn't totally make sense, perhaps, to some of you, but the idea is just that for the surface, such a formula was known where cluster variables can be interpreted as some sort of generating function of perfect matchings of a SNCAN graph. You have some SNAC graphs. And then this is just saying the same is true on an orbital. We describe how to build those SNAC graphs. And the motivation for these formulas is, first of all, giving proof of positivity. So positivity would be known for such generalized cluster algebra. And also, it's a good. Generalized algebra is. And also, it's a good computational tool, which I guess is what this talk is supposed to highlight. So, this means that our orbital Markov numbers can also be interpreted as just counting perfect matchings on graphs. Set things to one. Oh, and this, I didn't explain this, but this is a monomial, so set things to one. Okay, so how do we make one of these snake graphs? Let's take our windiest arc. So, the first way I see this is I'm just going to kind of cut open. This is, I'm just going to kind of cut open what that arc sees. So I'm thinking about everything. I've said I'm going to think about all these order close points as arc 3. I didn't say it before, I say it now. So each red pending arc I can lift to just like a triangle. So it's order 3, so I'm lifted with a triangle. And okay, let's keep track of what the purple arc sees. So it comes out of this on top of the initial triangulation. So I've left the dotted things, but I think about it on top of the initial triangulation. So it leaves this triangle. triangulation so it leaves this triangle with a it leaves seeing a blue and green and then I'm sorry if someone's not picking up the corners but okay it leaves and then it's crossing some things and then it's what is it it's as it travels it sees things to the right sees things to the right here it turns around so it's a slight ambiguity I just chose to think oh it's going to see things to the right and then on its return trip it sees things to the left so I can cut it open and now just to make a picture that looks like it's on a surface I mean just do Looks like it's on a surface. I mean, students think about this as on a polygon, which is always an easy place to work. So locally, its path just looks like it went through this polygon. So then you build this same graph. So I crossed, the idea is I crossed two x1s, so you make two tiles x1 and two x2s. And the thing you really want to pay attention to is, okay, it it passed through like it had four arcs in a row that shared an end point. Some people call that a fan. That gave me the zigzag shape of size four. Me that zigzag shape, size four. And then, you know, that's how long the fan was, and then also my zigzag stopped zigging. And then these, now we have a fan of size three on the opposite face at the opposite side of my direction of travel, so I got a zigzag of size three. Well, these zigzags overlapped here. So that explains the shape. And again, we, so I wanted to draw one of these, but really we just care about the number of perfect matchings. We didn't need all this information. And by a theorem of Ralph and Ilkit Chanachi, the Ilbitchinachi, you can use these decomposition to zigzag essentially to make this continued fraction. So you can recover that this orbital Markov number, it should have drawn into little L, would be 13, the numerator of this continued fraction. And really, we could have seen that from here. We could have just counted the fans and gone somewhere this way. You don't need. The snake graph is a guarantee that you'll get the right number, but you don't need to draw the snake graph. Okay, um, and then And then, long slide. So it'd be nice to even. What I really wanted to do was somehow compute these still using the lattice on Z2. Because it's kind of hard to keep track of things, drawing that orbifold shape. And then this is long, but my favorite punchline of this project is just a way to see how to compute these using the lattice, pretending I'm still in the forest, but I just keep track of extra information. Okay, so what I'm Information. Okay, so what am I going to do? I'm going to draw my. So I want to compute the Markov number associated with PQ. So I'm just forcing this labeling onto these. And we'll see that it still makes sense to use this labeling, using the fairy sums and such for that initial triple. So I'm going to draw my line. And I'm going to make a word in L's and R's, keeping track of the following two pieces of information in order. So this is like the first one's the new piece of information you wouldn't do in the ordinary case. You wouldn't do in the ordinary case. As I cross, each line I cross, I'm just going to literally keep track of whether, so everything's drawn straight. That I cross it closer to the right or the left. I cross it closer to the right, I write an R, otherwise I write an L. And then when I cross consecutive pairs, keep track of those, I cross closer to the right or the left. And if you just cared about ordinary Markov numbers, you would throw out this step and LDAS. Okay, and so there's always something funny you do at the ends. Ralph had to throw up tiles. We are just going to add an R at the beginning and L to. Just going to add an R at the beginning and L to the end. That makes it work. And then these A's are the lengths of consecutive subsequences. It may be easily in count. Okay, so our example with one half. Okay, here's my initial R that I had to throw in. I've highlighted the R's where we're keeping track of an individual crossing. So this R, like, okay, here I clearly crossed this red line closer to its right-hand point, where everything I'm, I have some direction of travel. Everything I'm, I have some direction of travel, so it makes sense. That's where that R comes from. These two share to the right, so that's where I get that R. Always, your very middle crossing is in the middle of that line signal. So you just make a choice. It's just like how there was ambiguity. That's where you turn around an orbital point, at the orbital point. And it doesn't affect the numerator, it turns out. So I chose an L because that's how I wrote those slides for. And then you do something. Then we have L for here, another L for here, and then we have to throw on an L because I told you to. On an L because I told you to. Okay, so then I get 3 and 4. Okay, so numerator of the 3, 4 is the same as numerator 4, 3. This would have been if I chose R here. So the way I did my example earlier, I got the opposite ordering, but it doesn't matter. You can swap everything and get the same number here. So I wanted to do this little example and compare it with before. So this extra information we keep track of, like with it here, that's like keeping track of. That's like keeping track of this consecutive cross between two lifts of the same arc. So it's kind of natural. I'm still very happy it works like this, but that's where that comes from. So each intersection in the last corresponds to two intersections of the oracle. It's like every line's a bit thick. So we just have double the information. And then here is a larger example with three-fifths. I think Ralph did the ordinary snake ralph of three-fifths at this time. That's this cost. Here we have what, yeah, here we have the orbifold version. Just to highlight what a longer one would look like. I'll pause here for a second. Are there any questions? For this example, if you change that L to an R that has the star above it, you'd still get the same numerator? Yeah. Oh, yeah, because it's, notice it's palindromic. Notice it's palindromic, otherwise. So yeah, so you would just be like flipping the entire thing. Yes, you see, we see, okay, we get numbers up to five, we have almost self-esteem drama. Okay, so these are properties of hole in general. Five is the biggest you'll see when you get really close to a lattice point, you get five. Okay, I guess the links of these, I hope so. The links are always. The lengths of these, I'm also sorry, the lengths are always even, but the lengths in the oracle case are the same as the length in the ordinary case. If you were to compare that with the lead fraction you'd get for normal 3π, it should be the same length. And it's palindromic, except at the middle, because you just have this slight asymmetry. Because you have this turning around point, it's going to be this asymmetry. Okay, and then I'll conclude by just talking about: this was a fun part of the project for me and for my student, my high school student. Just looking at some of these special sub-sequences, like what are the analogs? Look at the Nazi numbers and Pell numbers. This slide is probably well known, so we don't need to dwell that long. But right, in terms of the labeling, like the, so the branch where you always have a zero, so we have one over q's, that's what gives you every other Fibonacci number. And the branch where you hold one fixed, q minus one over q's, you get every other Pell number. And you can write these as sort of like the smallest. These are sort of like the smallest and biggest possible features fractions, since you only see ones and twos. So the analogs for us, here's the sequence of orbifold Fibonacci numbers. And they, so this is somehow like the smallest possible fraction, like numbers in the continued fraction you can see. You wouldn't see all ones no matter how hard you try in this case. And they have a recurrence like this, which you can compare in the markup. This, which you can compare in the Markov case, it's this. Asymmetry, yeah, we'll see the asymmetry shows up with these error terms, sort of. L numbers, they're a little more complicated, but somehow these are the biggest numbers, the biggest sort of sequences you can see in a continued fraction. So you couldn't get all fives, for example, even the five is the biggest number you can see, but this is sort of the biggest it gets. And again, they have some relation that looks a lot like the. Have some relation that looks a lot like the Markov one, but some error term. And then I was thinking a bit more: like, again, these are sort of, like, you're approaching zero and approaching one. And zero and one are kind of our extremes, but there's nothing, I think, terribly special about these. So I'll end just with this. Yeah, maybe other people see. I don't know if anyone else has looked at such sequences, or maybe they mean something very natural. Or maybe they mean something very natural in your language. But you fix any irrational number between 0 and 1. This is a fun game. You can walk along in the fairy sum tree until you first see it, and then it's going to be between two numbers. And then there's two ways to hold it fixed. You can either hold it fixed that it's the biggest number in all your triples, and some sequence so it's the smallest number in your triples. So now you get like a genuine sequence that's a bit easier to work with. And then, so in the Markup case, you can compute that on. You can compute that on, sorry, this holds with the primes too. I should have put some disclaimer. So, both without primes and with primes, they have this relation. So, here's that three, you have three times the Markov numbers. Threes show up everywhere. And yeah, and somehow, so I kept thinking this was a mistake when I was working on the project, but now I'm convinced it kind of has to be there. In the orbital case, it's like you get six times a Markov number minus one. Here's another place where this slight eight. Here's where another place where this slight asymmetry shows up. You have six times this minus one. And then, like, okay, with the Ki's, if we'd done general Ki's, we would have put a K here. So that one is like a K. I remember about the general K's. Anyway, so again, a lot of things. I guess the moral is lots of things work comatorily very similarly between these. Slight asymmetry. And that's all I have. Thank you. And that's all I have. Thank you. Questions for Astrick? So this orbifold is also a cover of the modular orbifold, like the modular torus. So these numbers are also related to lengths of sort of close GIS 600 modular or just different ones. Oh, yeah, yeah. Different ones. Oh, yeah, yeah, I suppose. Yeah. Okay. I've actually seen that actually. The question was going to be: like, is there, like, what's special about those GS6 birds here? I'd have to look at it a little closer. I'm afraid I can't think about that on the spot. But I'd like to take a look. At some point, you mentioned something when you change an edge. At some point you mentioned something, when you change an L and an R, you get uh so it's the same thing as reversing, and therefore you get the same sort of accomplishment, denominator, okay, four, two. So maybe I was wondering if this would relate to the other solutions of u squared equals minus one. So we know that the Markov matrix is A transpose A. Suppose the A itself was B transpose A. was a B transpose B. I don't know, maybe that happens for Markov numbers sometimes. So you would get a B transpose B. And maybe if you exchange the last letter of the B's, now you would get the other solutions to be I don't know, I'm just kind of guessing. Yeah, yeah. I think that, yeah. But I don't know if the But I don't know if the Markov matrices have that shape at all. If you could expect that Markov number, if it has K devices, then you can write it as Kevin Transperson matrix number. Yeah, I don't know either. Okay, well let's thank Esther again. So we have a coffee break at 3:15, and our next talk is at 3:45. I wonder there should be some problems. Yeah, perfect.
