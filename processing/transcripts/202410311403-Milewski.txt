Thank you to all the organizers for organizing this absolutely wonderful, wonderful conference. It's great to be speaking right now because Ben was my student, so it was nice to hear him and this is joint work with another student of mine, Matt Dury, who is now at Glasgow. So we're going to talk about resonant free surface waves and cylinders and Ben did a fantastic job, which will can lets me sort of run through the first half of my slides. First half of my slides in about two seconds, but I won't do that. And you'll hear it a different way. So, again, try to explain this to keep everybody along. What do I mean by non-linear resonance? So, non-linear resonance is a mechanism by which energy is continuously exchanged between a bunch of wave modes of your system. They can be sine waves, they can be other kinds of waves. And these wave modes resonate in a way that I will show. In a way that I will show. And the first nonlinear resonance that I think in fluids was found was this Wilton's ripples, right? And these profiles should remind you a little bit of what Ben drew. And in fact, the experiments were done at Penn State, so where I am right now, by Henderson and Hammock. So again, this idea that Wilton ripples are a non-linear resonance, but it's a much, much bigger But it's a much, much bigger topic. Any kind of weakly non-linear dispersive wave problem has this, right? So you don't need to think of just even water waves. Okay. It's been a topic for quite a while, non-linear waivers. So everything I'm going to say, so what Ben was talking about, we're about traveling waves. And I'm going to talk about time-dependent waves. And I'm going to talk about time-dependent waves. So, resonance in a time-dependent sense. And as Ben says, this subject really picked off in the 60s with Phillips, Hasselman, Benny Newell, Zakharov. We've all heard these names over and over. And in fact, it was so Hasselman got the Nobel Prize a couple of years ago. And in the citation for the Nobel Prize, this paper was cited. This paper was cited and talked about how his work in wave resonances. And essentially, the equations I will talk about today are essentially these equations where you actually take a very small number of wave numbers, right? A small subset of the four wave numbers. So, this is what you get if you take, say, Zakharov's equation, Zakharov's formulation. Zakharov also derived an equation. Sakharov also derived an equation like this, of course. But if you take a Zakharov's formulation and Fourier transform the whole thing, and then the nonlinear terms do an expansion, and these expansions will have these very complicated kernels, which look like collisions. That's why these things are called Feynman diagrams in Hasselmann's paper. They look a lot like the Boltzmann equation also. They look like collisions, and the collisions are localized on manifolds of resonances. So k1 plus k2. So k1 plus k2 plus k3 equals 0. That's the triad condition that Ben was talking about, omega 1 plus omega 2 plus omega 3 equals 0. And so this is the triad resonance, and this is the quartet resonance, and on you go. So, and it turns out that in gravity water waves, this Benjamin Fuhrer instability was discovered, and one of the potential And one of the potential, one of the ways to understand it is through a particular form of a quartet resonant of gravity waves. And however, this is only one of a very large family of a manifold of resonances of gravity waves, and these manifolds can be parametrized by these curves right here. So these, you know, if I could explain this, I won't, but that shows that there are lots of quartets possible. There are lots of quartets possible in a particular configuration of gravity fields. All right, it turns out also that the problem of gravity waves, as I'll talk about in a second, does not have triads, right? All the dispersion relations that Ben showed us had a minimum. This is a monotonic dispersion relation, it will not have a triad. Well, monotonic speed as a function of k, not omega, I think that's a bit. No, or maybe I think that's a bit better. Let's see. No, I need to press this button. All right. So, again, obviously, Ben was my student because the notation hasn't changed over the years. Consider an equation like this. This is exactly the equation Ben considered. And supposing that you have some symbol for the linear operator omega, which defines your dispersion relation. So again, if you stick k tang k, square root of k tang k there, you get the widow. Square root of k times k there, you get the Wittem equation. And the idea is you do an expansion, same epsilon as ben, and now you say, well, your leading order wave travels at some speed. Now I'm going to think of this A as it will be able to depend on time, right? So it will modulate this, the amplitude modulate the solution. And at the next order, I get an equation. An equation like this, which I need to solve, and the right-hand side of that equation has, because here this is a quadratic term, has a 2kx minus 2 omega t. And the question now is this, in the kernel of this operator, right? So in other words, does this rest, so this is where resonance comes from? I'm forcing a linear equation, a linear oscillator, with a frequency, right? A frequency, right? Does that frequency exist within the spectrum of the senior oscillator? Right? And it turns out that if 2 omega of k is equal to omega of 2k, that's the 1,2 resonance that Ben was talking about, then there's a resonance, and then if I would solve this equation mathematically, the solution u1 would grow like t. There would be a t growth. So at time, T growth. So at time 1 over epsilon about, this series that I wrote down would become nonsense, right? Because u1 would be size 1 over epsilon. It would be size 1 over epsilon times epsilon is size 1. This no longer makes sense as an asymptotic series. Right? So that's the idea. So the idea here is I've removed this idea of having a solvability condition and this kind of, well, it is a kind of solvability. Well, it is a kind of solubility condition, but the idea is to keep this asymptotic series well ordered in time instead of as a solubility condition for traveling waves. It's the same thing, really. So what do you do? You do what Ben did, or what Wilton did, is you include both A and B at the leading order if you have this resonance, right? And if you have this resonance, now the solvability condition to prevent Condition to prevent these two to grow linearly in time as time goes on requires them to solve a little set of differential equations here. And these are what I would call the degenerate triart equations for Wilton ripples. They're two sets of ODEs, but for complex values, A, so it's a four-dimensional system, but there's a Hamiltonian, very much related to what we heard from Raphael. To what we heard from Raphael earlier on. Okay, so there we have it for Wilton ripples, and this is called a 1-2 resonance Wilton ripples. Okay, so for 1-2 resonance, you have this case, but in fact, as Ben said, the more general case of a Wilton ripple is this. I've just put this K3 on the right-hand side, and sometimes it drifts to the left-hand side. And sometimes it drifts to the left-hand side, so please don't worry about this. And that the frequencies match. And just that the Wilton ripple is a special case where simply k1 and k2 are the same value, k. Right. And then there is a fourth-order resonance, a quartet or a four-wave mixing, or whichever field you're in, it's called a different thing. And that's when you have something like this, and then the frequencies add up like that. Add up like that. And then you, if you think about it a little bit, this kind of resonance will only occur at the next order, usually, and therefore it will take a time 1 over epsilon squared for it to overwhelm your original asymptotic series. So you will have to pick a different time scale for your ODEs so that the whole system is well ordered. Well-ordered asymptotically. Okay? Now, one thing that I want to talk about is these conditions, we now take them naturally, but in fact, we're going to forget about them soon. The important thing are these guys. When I talk to an engineer or a physicist and I say a resonance, it has nothing to do with K's. It has to do with the frequency that something is oscillating at. So these K's are just an artifact. Are just an artifact that I'm in an unbounded domain and I'm doing a Fourier decomposition. If I'm in now a bounded domain, k's don't mean anything. And this condition is just not there. You only need to satisfy this and something else which we'll call a correlation condition. Which is, in fact, much more generic to satisfy. So for free surface gravity waves, let me just not make any secrets here. Let me just not make any secrets here. So, for free surface gravity waves, this is Phillips' paper, you have a dispersion relation, which is root k, which is an infinite depth, and triadic resonances are impossible in this case, and then you have lots of resonant quartets. But the question is: suppose I have gravity waves alone, right? So, just gravity, can I now I now confine my ways, so I have a container, and will this give rise to triads instead? So that's the question I wanted to ask. And the answer is yes, but it's more fun than that. Okay, so first of all, this is not a new question. Again, no secrets. This is not a new question. Wilton ripple-like resonances had been found in a Been found in circular cylinder containers, right? So there's a work, Mac, Miles, Miles, Bryant. They all found a version of the Wilton Ripple in a circular container. These came in two flavors. Either the wave that was a standing wave of the surface would interact with a traveling wave or a traveling wave. Or a traveling wave would interact with its harmonic, just like in the traveling wave of the surface bench case. So sorry, either axisymmetric waves or traveling waves. So the axisymmetric waves would interact with the second harmonic of the axisymmetric wave, or a traveling wave would interact with its own second harmonic. And in fact, And in fact, so this will out me, but I was refereeing this paper. I didn't know about all this, right? I was refereeing this paper, which was a very nice computational paper computing some of these things to higher amplitude. And I realized, you know, these people are talking about 1-2 resonances, but 1-2 resonances are a special case of triads. So this would mean that cylinders, circular, right-circular cylinders, should have triads in them, right? Would have triads in them. And I was surprised. I talked to Matt, who was my student, and we searched, we racked. I'm still thinking someday somebody's going to come with a paper that says, well, here it is. It's just that nobody's ever read it. But we set out to find some more triads. Okay. By the way, there have been some experiments on these 1,2 resonances because you can force these waves using Faraday. Because you can force these waves using Faraday forcing. So there's an even more interesting question where you combine Faraday forcing, which is this kind of subharmonic instability, to then sort of in a second resonance, force these Wilton-like resonances. The question is: are there general triads in cylinders of arbitrary cross-section? And so whenever I talk Arbitrary cross-section. And so, whenever I talk about a cylinder right now, I'm not talking about a circular cylinder. I'm talking about, you know, just give me a domain D and depth H, vertical volts. And I just want to put some waves in here. So we all know the equations, we're not going to repeat them. And the boundary conditions that I'm taking are no flux Neumann boundary conditions on the base and the vertical walls. And eta is the free surface elevation. Eta is the free surface elevation, phi is the velocity potential, epsilon is the typical wave slope, and h is the dimension of stamp. Right. And so the main idea here, so we're kind of lucky because we're looking for triads. And triads, you don't need to go very far in your asymptotic series. You only need quadratic terms. So in fact, expanding, this is obviously a non-linear set of equations, right? Expanding these equations to quadratic terms is, you know, kind of Know, kind of a sort of homework at this point. So it's quite easy. So, in other words, you can think of doing this in various ways, but one way is you can write a Wittem-like model or whatever you want to call it. It's kind of a Benny-Luke equation, maybe, various names. But this is simply the dispersion relation of deep water gravity waves. Gravity waves, right? Sorry, of our arbitrary depth. So I'll tell you what L is in a second. L is the Dirac-related Neumann operator, right? But this is the linear problem for gravity waves. And then there's some nonlinearity. And if you do an expansion of nonlinearity, this is the first quadratic term that you get. So these quadratic terms. Where you can recover eta from this. And what the L that appears here is this Dirichlet-Nogman operator. Is this Dirichlet-Neumann operator that everybody's been talking about? So, u is the potential at z equals zero. So, I'm not doing any fancy expansion at all, because I don't need to do this kind of problem. Phi at z equals zero, and then L just gives me the Neumann data at z equals zero. The important bit is this is in this domain D, right, across zero minus H, right? And how will I solve this equation in this domain? Well, I'll solve this equation by essentially projecting onto the eigenfunctions of the Dirichet-Tonn operator. So essentially my u, you can think of it, is going to be a sum of these phi n's, which are which are, sorry, which are the eigenfunctions of this Neumann problem here. A Neumann problem here, right, together with whatever term I need in Z, which comes in a second. So in other words, the DTN gives me this multiplier. So this L gives me this multiplier. When I expand U in terms of these phi n, whenever I see an L, I just have this Fourier multiplier. This multiplier, which is not a Fourier multiplier, the K's are these ideas. The k's are these eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. Right. So how do I find resonant interactions? Right? So I find resonant interactions by first looking at the dispersion relation. Well, it's no surprise that the frequencies of the system are given by k tang kh, where the k's are the eigenfunctions of that Neumann problem on. Problem on the cross-section, right? And resonance conditions will arise when you have resonances in the omegas, right? So if I pick three different n's, for example, or two different n's here, so nj, so n1, j equals one and two, so I'm just gonna call those kj. These are the omegas, and what I need is And what I need is to have for a 1,2 resonance is I need to have omega 2 is 2 omega 1. Right? And there's a very simple test for that. So this is a theorem. If you can find two k's such that their ratio is between 2 and 4, then there is an h, a depth of your cylinder, for which that resonance occurs. Right? So all I need to go now. So, all I need to go now is look at my cross-section, find the spectrum of Laplace's equation on that cross-section with Neumann boundary condition, and find all the values of k's for which this is true. And then each of those values of k's, each of those instances, will have an h and it's unique. Okay, so what happens next? Well, Well, what we were after were triads. So let me let go of the cylinder eigenfunctions for a second because let me talk about triads. Forget about this for a second because this is for a circular cylinder, whereas this is general. So for a triad, you need to satisfy this. So it turns out that if you take your If you take your cross-sectional domain D and find its eigenfunctions, if you find an eigenvalue that is bigger than the sum of the previous two but smaller than this, then again there exists a unique value of h for which there is a triad. And you can actually kind of draw out these triads on the plane. So this is k1 over k3. This is K1 over K3, so K1 over K3, and this is K2 over K3, right? So this inequality says that you're to the left of that line. This inequality says that you're to the right of this line. And each colored line tells me essentially what my depth is. So along each of these lines, or my K3. Well, or my k3 normalized by depth, but I can pick the h so that I get the right value, the right depth. And this is in some sense the shallow water limit, and this is like the depth limit. So here are some examples of one, two resonances. So the old resonances of miles, for example. I can just look. I can just look, so now this is for a circular cylinder. So I look at the problem of eigenvalues on a disk with Neumann boundary conditions. So the eigenvalues are just the zeros of the Bessel functions, right? So these are the kth zeros of the Bessel function of order n, right? And I need to find two of them such that this one, such as the ratio is between two and four. Right? Now. Now, I said something about. Remember when we were doing Fourier triads, we had this K, this restriction on K's. For the cylinder, for the circular cylinder, because of the symmetry of the circular cylinder and that you are going to actually use a Fourier bell expansion, there is still such a condition. So, in other words, you not only need to satisfy this, but you need to have But you need to have m2 is 2m1. So, in fact, these two are correct, because 2 times 1 is 2, and 2 times 0 is 0, right? But I cannot have arbitrary relations here between m2 and m1, right? But there are depths for which these two things resonate. Now, that's only because it's a circular cylinder. If I had a shape. Had a shape without any continuous symmetries, then I think then you wouldn't need this condition. Okay, so now, okay, let's go to the new examples. Here's a triad for a circular cylinder. Again, same for a circular cylinder, same picture. Now I want to find a K3, which is bigger than this and smaller than that. Turns out that this works, and again. out that this works and again I have to have the m condition 1 plus 1 equals 2 right so that that's okay in general where does that condition m1 plus m2 plus m3 equals 0 or m1 plus m2 equals m3 come from it comes from this correlation condition what I need is that the product of the three eigenfunctions Product of the three eigenfunctions integrated over the area is non-zero. Now, if I have Bessel functions with e to the i m theta, it's clearly that when I do the theta integral, I need the e to the i m1 plus m2 minus m3 to be, m1 plus m2 plus m3 has to be 0, so that this integral is non-zero. That's where that correlation condition comes from. Right? But if these three functions are sort of arbitrary functions on a domain d, it's quite unlikely. Domain D, it's quite unlikely that this will be zero. Right. So it's also very easy to see with all this that you cannot get triad resonance in a circular cylinder, in a rectangular cylinder. So this was known. I mean, rectangular cylinder is just a discretization of the infinite domain with 48 wave numbers, but this is another proof of it because it doesn't, you cannot find any. It because it doesn't, you cannot find anything within that inequality. And then we looked at, well, how many of these are there? Right? Well, there's lots, infinitely many, right? But if you actually restrict these numbers to be less than three, the order of the Bessel function and the zero of the Bessel function, then here is an exhaustive list. And some of these had been found before because they're the degenerate ones. I'll tell you a bit. Degenerate ones. I'll tell you a bit about Michelle's experiment in a second. So these are the 1-2 resonances. 1-2 resonances. There's the one I was a referee for, also a 1-2 resonance. And I'll tell you about Michel Experiments if I have a second, because he had actually found a triad, but had not sort of connected the fact that there could be many of them, and so on. It was a paper that came. No, that was a paper that came up that we noticed when we were writing this one. So, once you've found your triads, I'm going to skip through this, but you can, you know, if you have a Wilton-Ripple, these equations are universal, and the interaction coefficients are given right here. So, everything is given explicitly. And if you have triadic resonances, here are the triad equations as. Triad equations, as we heard, and again the interaction coefficients are completely explicit here for any arbitrary cross-section of your domain. And this is the C is this correlation coefficient which occurs there. And if C equals zero, well, you don't have a triad. So then there is a, we looked at how strong the coupling coefficients were, so which triads would. So, which triads would be more likely to be strong and so on. I think I'm running out of time. There's also something that you can do with these triads is figure out stability of the other two waves with respect to one of the waves being larger. So, take one of the waves being large, or relatively large, it's a small ambient expansion, and linearize a system about. And linearize the system about that wave. And you can decide whether you have what's a so-called forward cascade or an inverse cascade in energy. And it turns out that in this situation here, we always have an inverse energy cascade, so cascade of energy to lower modes. We can show this from the system. There's some numerics here, which I don't have time. Some numerics here, which I don't have time to show you. I mean, all this is very well known. There's a nice new family of resonances here that I think we like. So, in particular, this is a triad where you have a standing wave that interacts with two counter-propagating rotating waves. And that's kind of a nice idea because it links back to something that's known in the literature. Known in the literature before of edge waves and of parametric resonance. So, those of you who know sort of coastal, you know, some models for coastal sandbar formation and coastal pattern formation, you can have a wave coming in from the deep, and that can excite waves traveling left and right along your shore that are subharmonic. Harmonic, right? And this is kind of the same idea. You have a standing wave and it excites counter-propagating waves. So to finish off, this is a picture that Matt found. And here are two bays, one of which is closed off and it has a nice beach pattern, one of which is not closed off and it doesn't have a beach pattern. This is not at all a proof of editing. It's just a It's just I think to show a nice picture. In any case, so the most important thing about all this is I think that we found all these new triads. So we all do things very often in unbounded domains, but boundaries change things considerably even at this level of just pure gravity waves, right? And we should probably think about this. And we should probably think about this. And there's lots more that we want to do in all this. I've been talking for a while to John Wilkening to try to get some simulation of these waves going. And we have all sorts of other ideas on how to use this kind of newfound framework for triads. Thanks a lot. Okay, thanks very much, Paul. Perhaps time for one.
