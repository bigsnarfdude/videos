All this week, so I hope you had a nice week. I'm going to talk about something that's not very knotted, or at least by design, we intend not to have any knots in these because we want to fold an RNA strand into a designed nanostructure. And so I'll start out with a brief introduction of RNA folding as an active process. So these are not RNAs that have been annealed, but that are assembled enzymatically. Assembled enzymatically. And I'll talk a little bit about modularity in folding and how we design nanostructures. And at the end, I'll point out some interesting insights that are sort of maybe a limitation to the way we might design RNAs. And so origami is a Japanese word, and it comes from two things, meaning to fold something and paper. But instead of describing the final thing that you get, The final thing that you get, it defines the process by which it's made. And I think it's really nice, this word is a process. And so the folding process is something that nature has really mastered. And in these micrographs, we're seeing ribosomal genes on DNA. And then these little Christmas tree-looking things are many, many parallel processes going on where lots of RNA transcripts are being produced. Of RNA transcripts are being produced, and as the RNA is produced, these little squiggly lines get longer and longer. And on this bottom one, this is the ribosome, and you can see these dark patches that are folded RNAs that are complexed with ribosomal proteins. And all of this assembly process is happening dynamically as the RNA is still being produced. So that at the end of the folding process, at least a lot of this secondary. At least a lot of this secondary structure has already been formed, and the structure is now figuring out how to pack 2D structure elements together to make the final 3D shape. And RNAs in nature, they're highly interconnected three-dimensional structures that are packed really tightly. But despite all this complexity that they have, their buildup is pretty modular. And if we think about the modularity of RNA, If we think about the modularity of RNA, then maybe we can learn how to build up complicated things from smaller modules. And so what we do in our lab is we design RNA transcripts. And so this is the idea, co-transcriptional RNA origami. We want to fold the strand into a target shape. And it needs to do so in this continuous enzymatic process where you just encourage. Where you just encode the RNA structure on a DNA, and as the polymerase is going, it produces helices, and the helices are mostly local structures, and then junctions, and then the long-range interactions are things which connect and stabilize a structure on a larger scale. And this is all enabled because the RNA is produced at a pretty slow rate compared to how fast. Compared to how fast the RNA is able to condense into helices and those helices condense into junctions. So we're talking about helices that form a microsecond time scale, whereas it's a couple milliseconds for each nucleotide to be added. So if things are designed very locally, they can condense very locally. And so I'll just point a little bit to this kind of artistic inspiration that I like to draw from the origami because we name our structures origami. Structures origami. Origami is kind of a traditional art, but a lot of development has happened in the recent years thanks to the help of computers, which are able to modularize the folds. And so essentially, all I want you to see is a basic process where you start with a tree shape, and everything can be represented at a simplest kind of like a tree structure. The computer is figuring out how to pack all of those folds that represent the tree into the confines of a Into the confines of a paper. And then it's up to you to fold the thing. And so, the way that this kind of works for RNA, though, is we'll start with maybe a conceptualization of what we want to build out of RNA helices. We might have angles or connections we might figure out. We can look in the PDB database of RNA structures to see three-dimensional shapes have bends and connections. And then we can put those onto our framework. And then we can put those onto our framework. And using computers, we can join all of these parts with helices. And then this is the part where the computer sort of designs the fold. It does a lot of optimization of the RNA sequence and sequence symmetry to figure out an actual sequence of RNA, which can fold into this target structure, which is really a node-connected graph that we're trying to produce out of a sequence. But then we run into this problem. But then we run into this problem: how do we choose the best strand routing? So, for this little heart shape, it's got two cycles or two circles here, and you have to make it into one strand pass. So, you have to put two kissing loops into this design someplace, but you, in fact, have many different options. And so, when we initially designed this, we were just kind of looked at all of them systematically and then tried to figure out which one had sort of the best nesting properties. But this is clearly a tricky problem and something more. A tricky problem and something more to approach computationally, especially as you go to much larger structures, it explodes kind of exponentially. But the question is really, how modular is RNA? And can we build any of these things, right? And this structure is in fact made from seven different types of tertiary motifs that come from ribosome or other 3D models. And we put them all into one strand to build these heart shapes. These heart shapes. And so, this was definitely possible, but it required a lot of manual work and it required a lot of thinking about the strand path. And to go forward, we wanted a more modular assembly strategy, something which is maybe easier to address. And so the core of the modular design strategy is this double helical tile. And this is also kind of the motif that was the genesis of a lot of DNA nanotechnology, too. Of a lot of DNA nanotechnology, too. So I think it's a really powerful paradigm for building. And the way this works is to make it out of one strand, it folds into this core that is locked together with one kissing loop. So this is a pseudo-knot, and it basically turns this unit into a ring shape. Now, this modular unit can be combined many of them together. So you can think of how a pleated sheet works. Like how a pleated sheet works, or how an accordion, maybe one fold of the accordion propagates to the other. So they interplay together. And this way, we can stack many of these modules together to build larger and larger nanostructures. And then these tend to kind of form cooperatively a little bit because as soon as one of these loops forms, it prepositions the neighboring helices to be in the right stacking order. And so this is a concept. And so, this is the contrast. On the left, we have sort of the DNA origami paradigm of thermal annealing. You have one long template strand and many, many staple strands that cross-link the bigger strand. But in co-transcriptional production, we just have a continuous production of one strand. And so, when we make the structure, we want it to kind of condense on itself as it's being produced. And so our natural structures on the left, like a ribosome, they end up looking very different from the type of things we design in origami. But that's because the type of interactions we use are a bit different. In nature, they're using these long-range connections, which are not really pseudonauts. They're kind of packing interactions. These loop helix interactions that are folding the ribosome, they're weak. Folding the ribosome, they're weak binding and they allow it to have faster rearrangements. So they're not very sequence-dependent, and that makes them hard to design because they're more context-dependent on the three-dimensional shape. On the other hand, in the origami paradigm, we use kissing loop interactions, and they have the benefit of strong binding, but at the cost of a very slow rearrangement. So, can co-transcriptionally folding designs, can they be transcriptionally folding designs can they be more reliable and in the first study in 2014 where we made four of these co-transcriptionally produced tiling lattices in fact the fifth one didn't really fold right and we were a bit limited because it wasn't entirely difficult to design the sequence and to design all of these long-range interactions within the compact strand um but a bit of thought going into But a bit of thought going into automating the process using computers and to use computers to three-dimensionally model the starting tiles so we don't make mistakes there. And then using computers to optimize the sequence symmetry of the RNA design, we're able to produce structures that now that are much larger. So in the next set, we went up to almost 2,000 nucleotides in size. So compared to the ribosome, we were getting quite bigger. We were getting quite bigger. And at this larger scale, of course, it also revealed kind of defects or weird things that occur during the folding of the RNA. For instance, like this 5-helix tile 5-HT is a bit propeller twisted, which helps us to optimize the parameters of our design to remove the twist. But also these bottom ones, they don't look quite the way we designed them. Look quite the way we design them. And that kind of leads to my next point: is what really constrains a folded structure, right? And I think all folded things, even the most simple one, have this basic property to them is that if you just take a paper and fold it into thirds, if you fold A or C first, you're going to get a different final structure. And so the order of folding events is. And so, the order of folding events has an important effect on the final structure. And I mean, of course, this is obvious, but if we go to a larger nanostructure, it becomes more confusing as to, you know, which kind of strand path design is more sensible. Is path one the right way to design a structure or is path two the right way to design a structure? And so, this is where I think it kind of relates a bit to knottedness, because this is, of course, either one of these are not knotted. Of course, either one of these are not knotted, these are pseudo-knots. But if we assume that these connections here become sort of links between the strand, you can end up in a situation where maybe part of the structure has formed, and then part of the structure, these orange parts, haven't duplexed with their partner yet. And now you're in a situation where, in order for this nascent strand, which is still linked to the protein, which is still linked to the DNA, in order for that piece to fold into the structure. That piece to fold into the structure, some of these kissing loops will have to open up. And that can create a barrier to folding. And what we noticed in the lab is that actually it has a real decrease in the yield, although we are still able to fold particles of both strand paths. It turns out in the strand path that was a bit barrier-laden, whoops, we did see visual distortions in the fold, and the yield was much lower. And also, we weren't able. Was much lower, and also we weren't able to get an ab initio reconstruction. Whereas, where we design things so that they cannot form any kissing loops too early during the folding process, we get a much cleaner product. And so here's some more designs that sort of really failed. And I don't have a lot of great images of them because they didn't fold well. But you can look at the red-colored regions, and these are regions that would form these kind of tricky loops. Form these kind of tricky looped-out regions, which they could be a barrier. So there could be a region in here where there's like a hole in the center. Maybe that part can't fold easily because it gets trapped within some bigger structure before its complementary strand is produced. And so, do RNA structures mature after the transcription? And the vision I had shown originally was that the folding was done. Originally, it was that the folding was done when it comes at the end of this transcript, but that's actually not true. It turns out that helices are done folding at this point, but the helices can be in a three-dimensional arrangement that is the wrong one. And it can take quite a bit of time for the compaction to occur and to the final fold. And so, when we did a study of these six helix bundles, the transcripts that were immediately after the transcription and put on ice and Transcription and put on ice and put into the microscope looked in one shape. And then, some sample that was left out on a workbench for a longer period of time, when that went into the microscope, it looked in a completely different conformation. So, in looking at these things, we realized that it's kind of analogous to going from a left-handed knot to a right-handed knot, in which I mean there is no way to go between these two unless you break the strand and put it together. And in this way, we have to do it. And put it together. And in this way, we have to break this connection here, the pink one. It has to break in order for it to rearrange into the final structure. And here I'll show kind of a morphing video between these two cry-OEM densities. And we can kind of allude that actually the intermediate will require the thing to become unconnected and reconnect. And so, just in a second, these left and right will be superimposed. Left and right will be superimposed. And you can see that the confirmations are really quite different. And so this is really the chirality of RNA at work. You can kind of do this in front of you too. If you clasp your left and right hands together and then try to reverse the order of your hand clasping, I mean, you can't do it without unlocking your hands, of course. And so we measured this transition, and we were really shocked that it was not only reproducible, but it was incredibly slow. And then it had a very sharp transition around six to eight hours after transcription. And we deduce it, it's probably lots of little microstates that allow the packing of these helices to become more and more tubular, and at which point it puts enough strain. Which point it puts enough strain on this crossing helix, which we call the clasp, and it puts this counter twist on the clasp enough that it finally breaks and reforms. And this step can go really fast, whereas a compaction step is a lot slower. With some collaborators at UC Berkeley, we sent these samples to them, and they have a new technique that allows them to look at individual RNA transcripts using tomographic slicing. So they'll image the same. Homographic slicing. So they'll image the same piece of RNA at many different angles and then combine those angles together to create a density map. It's really an incredible process. And I have a long video of it, but it's too long for this presentation. And I wasn't sure it would show on the Zoom. But you'll see that, in fact, 120 of these helix bundles were reconstructed. And then we were able to put them into groups. And we were able to put them into groups where you could see the early folding ones look kind of like your hand, and then the thumb and pinky kind of come together to make that clasp. And then as the structure starts curling up, you can see more torque and twist put onto the connector stem until it finally breaks, and then it becomes a nice six-helix bundle. And now I just have a couple more slides at the end that I wanted to show. At the end, that I wanted to show. Because we can use these RNAs for a lot of things, and we're not just studying folding, but we want to use them to scaffold protein bindings. And so this is just a kind of a cartoon showing some protein complexes that can bind to an RNA scaffold. And then we can do FRET on these scaffolds. And this is just a little experiment showing that the FRET signal we got was kind of related to the distance between the proteins we put on these scaffolds. On these scaffolds. And the most recent work that we've been doing is an RNA origami robot that is able to detect, activate, and signal. And what it is, is it's a little RNA origami that has these clasps that are a bit tight. And what they do is when they close, they bend the central helix. And by bending that helix, is embedded inside of it an abdomer. Embedded inside of it an abdomer and bending it is our way of turning on and off the structure of the abomer. And so in its off state, it has little arms that stick out that can bind and interact with trigger keys. And when those keys come in through strand displacement, they break the pink kissing loops open. And then that allows the strain to be released from the central helix. And that allows the spinach. And that allows the spinach abomer in the middle to fold and fluoresce. And then, if we add keys again to remove those, they're called anti-keys, then the kissing loops will form again and they will distort the loop. So, in doing this, you can see the ligand in the spinach abomer require sort of this straight oriented coaxial orientation of the abdomer. When we bend a thing, it distorts that binding site so that the chlorophore can't be there. And so the final point I have is that kind of do all folded things, do they really have origami-like properties? And this concept of modularity in RNA actually seems to be a greater concept of modularity of folded structures, and that we can pack. And that we can pack motifs together into a tiling type of system to build more complicated structures. And that these folded structures are also scalable and that we can, you know, with a small design, we can immediately make something that's three or four times larger. And because of the co-transcriptional production of the RNA, we have a way of deploying these structures in a very efficient manner. And so I think that the co-transcriptional So, I think that the co-transcriptional production of RNA is very advantageous, maybe for avoiding misfoldings, although it comes with its own limitations. And that is essentially that the strand, it really can't intersect itself. And in this way, we have to kind of consider the order in which some of the connections and contacts occur in three dimensions. And so, just as kind of a little teaser, I wanted to show this RNA satellite. Wanted to show this RNA satellite that we built. It didn't fold super great, but we got some pictures of the six helix bundle. Central helix was the satellite panel arms with some of our collaborators. And I think it just shows a vision for a future of really big, really sophisticated RNA nanostructures that can be active and sensing in our environment. And it's really due to our ability to design. Our ability to design these structures without getting tangled up. And I think that is the big thing that has allowed us to go further. But of course, let me just show again this, or is it this guy? This process was unexpected. And I think it kind of illuminates maybe one challenge that we're going to run into more and more as we try to make complicated three-dimensional structures is trying to stage when contacts in three dimensions occur. Contacts in three dimensions occur so that they don't impede the process of folding. So, I think with that, I'll just take any questions. Thank you very much, Andrew.
