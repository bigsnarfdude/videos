Three slides on relevant results for the Navier-Stokes equations in both three and integer dimensions. Then I will do a couple of slides on the summary of the multifractal model, but in its large deviation theory format. And then I'm going to put the two together. And what that will do, hopefully, is provide a lower bound on the scaling parameter H and on the multifractal. And on the multifractal sector T of H, which I will define later. And then, if I have time, I will discuss the consequences. So, let's go. I'm going to, you know, as a sort of amateur analyst, I'm going to define a set of what you call semi-norms, n gradients of the velocity field to the power 2m integrated over my dimensional volume. So, this is a semi- Volume. So, this is a semi-norm. And that makes actual. I know a lot of people will groan inwardly and say, Oh, yes, analysts and then norms, but it actually makes physical sense because M gradients, the greater the number of gradients, the more you're digging into smaller and smaller scales. A little bit like the standard notion of the cascade that comes up in the Uriel's book. You know, you're going small. Book. You know, you're going smaller and smaller scales. You want more and more derivatives. And then when you put it up a power like an LP norm, when M gets higher and higher, what you're doing is that you're taking the larger and larger spikes and you're basically picking those out and amplifying them. And what I'm going to do is basically take this norm here and Here and non-dimensionalize it. What I call f is, in effect, a dimensionless form of this thing here. And it turns out that this alpha here, labeled with m, m, and d, actually comes from the sort of scaling of the Navier-Stokes equations. And it actually appears here as an inverse. Okay, well, without proof, what I'm going to give you here is that this. To give you here is that this bracket means time average up to time t, and the result I'm going to give you is published in two papers of mine, 2018 and 2020. But the proof of the theorem is really based on a very beautiful paper by Foyasquiupe and Tamam in 1981, which everybody forgot about. And I spent the last 11 years advertising, telling people about it. Telling people about it, it's beginning to get through to people. That it's probably the best and the strongest weak solution Navier-Stokes result that actually we've had in the last 40 years. And essentially, the result is that the time average of this F to the power alpha multiplied by 4 minus D, which of course would be just one in three dimensions, it's uniformly bounded by Reynolds cubed. Bounded by Reynolds cubed with a constant that actually is a function of n, n, m, and d. And that actually encapsulates all the known, you know, there've been loads and loads of separate weak solution Navier-Stokes results. Some of them are based on the velocity field in L infinity, some on the gradient of the velocity field. And then there is the Fourier SGOP command result, which is n derivatives, but when m is one, Derivatives, but when m is one, all of those are actually special cases of this. This simply rolls together everything that everybody has known. Okay, now when you actually look in 3D and just take the standard lowest case of n is one and m is one, well, what you simply get is the energy dissipation rate bounded by Reynolds cubed, and that gives you the standard result that the inverse Kolmogorov. That the inverse Kolmogorov length is bounded by Reynolds to the three-quarters, which is what it should be. So the low, you know, the first line, as it were, or point on the chessboard of this thing is the inverse Kolmogorov length. Now, I have to stress: this is weak solutions of navigators. We don't have strong solutions. In this paper here, I actually demonstrate. Here, I actually demonstrated that if you wanted to turn this into a strong solution result, what you would need to prove is to have a factor of two there. And we don't have it. You see, in 3D, we have a factor of one. Okay. But what you do have, you would recover this and you would need that for regularity. We don't have that. That's what you would need to prove. And there's no evidence anywhere that a result like this actually exists. Like this actually exists. Now, I'm going to be heretical. You know, if I go in the community of Nairi-Stokes analysts, I would be considered a candidate for execution for actually saying that maybe there aren't strong solutions for Navier Stokes. Maybe weak solutions is all we've got, and that's what we've got to live with. But what you can see is that this is true if I put these two. You get the two here. Two here, um, and that basically means that the case T is two is the critical case, the division between fully regular and only weak solutions. So let's move on. Now, out of that, I want to define a set of length scales. And many of you in this audience have seen this before. So I simply take my H and I look at the gradient of the velocity field and I work out The velocity field, and I work out what sort of form of dimensional analysis do I need. And I need an inverse length to this power and a viscosity to this power. But that on its own is not enough. If I try and convert that to a length scale through that previous frame, I find the result isn't right. And then I realize that what I was doing wrong is that, of course, if you're going. Doing wrong is that, of course, if you're going to scale everything with a lambda, you should also scale the actual box length as well. So, if you put an L over lambda in front, then everything comes right. And from that, you solve for lambda, and it simply gives you this very nice, pretty result that L inverse lambda to the n plus one of these f's. If I raise it to the alpha, and I'm average. Average for Cody swarts to the left, and I simply get this very pretty result that you've got this sort of doubly infinite set which this. And if I point these three, m is one, m is one, this gives me three quarters, as it should. Now, the key point here, which will have consequences later, that if I take n and m to infinity, To infinity, this exponent is still finite. It doesn't go to infinity, it goes to three over four minus d. And that has very important consequences later on. So that's the weak solution, Navier-Stokes part over with. So now let's move to the, as it were, multifractal part, Euler equations. Euler equations. This is all well-known stuff. It's all in Uriel's book. The Euler equations have this scale invariance with some arbitrary parameter H here. So well-known results. Except, of course, if you go to the Navier-Stokes equation, H is now restricted to minus one. And you can find all this in Uriel's book, all the nice review by Benzi and Biferali in 08. So K40. So, K41 suggests that for a homogeneous isotropic Navius-Stokes flow, the p forwarded structure function should scale as R to the HP. But it also suggests that H should be a third if the energy dissipation rate is to be homogeneous in space and time. And so we've in effect got S P is R to the P over 3. And of course, what you get for exactly P is 3. Exactly, p is three. The right-hand side is actually equal to minus four-fifths epsilon R. And there would be a correction in terms of nu if you had the Navier-Stokes there. So now, this is my first slide of a summary of the multifractal model. So Parisium Frisch in 85 relaxed this enforcement, the K4. Enforcement, the K41 insists that H is a third to allow a range of values of H, provided the dissipation rate is constant on the average in some sense. And in the multifraction model's original formulation, we have this probability P of observing a given exponent H at a scale R, and that they computed this by assuming that each value of H belongs to a given fractal set. To a given fractal set of dimension d of h. Now, here the more modern definition uses large deviation theory. Now, I learned most of this from the notes that are on Greg Eink's website. I mean this in the best possible sense, Greg, because they're great notes. I think of them as the Cliff's notes of turbulence theory. If you don't know what Cliff's notes are, you can look them up. And essentially, And essentially, Greg goes into quite a bit of detail about how the large deviation theory method, basically you take your P to be R is C of H, and C of H is in effect like the co-dimension. It's in effect, if you think of it in the geometric original definition, the fractal dimension of a set at H plus this C would be the This C would be the domain dimension. And so instead of having 3 minus D, which you would find in Uriel's book, you've got C here. And this C is called the multifractal spectrum. And that's going to come up in a couple of slides. Okay. Now, in 1987, two papers by Paladin and Volpiani suggested that there ought to be a dissipation scale. To be a dissipation scale, which they call e to h, whose inverse should go like Reynolds to the one plus one over h. I won't go into the reason why. It's very simple. It's a sort of a back of an envelope argument, not scaling, as to why that should be the case. And it was at this point in my talk. Well, I gave a talk a year last December that was celebrating Uriel's 80th. That was celebrating Uriel's 80th. And basically, it was the first half of this talk on weak solutions of Navier-Stokes. And Beringer de Bruhl asked a question at the end saying, well, from your result and the Paladin and Volpiana result, shouldn't that give a lower bound on H? And we didn't come to really any conclusion, but we got in touch after my talk and started to talk. And we realized that if you simply compared If you simply compared this exponent with the one that I in effect back here, and this here, when t is three, this is three, it ought to give you basically a lower bound of eight is minus two-thirds. And that all sounded very good until we realized that actually that's not correct. And the problem is this, that the definition of the Reynolds number The Reynolds number that the Paladin and Volpiani used is the definition of the Reynolds number in Navi-Stokes are completely different. So you're comparing chalk with teeth. Lorioni's Reynolds number is based upon the enstrophy, and that's fine in a statistically steady flow, but that's not fine for a Navier-Stokes flow, because it's exactly that quantity that we would like to prove is bounded. That we would like to prove is bounded, and we don't know how to do it. So, what Beringer and I decided to do was to try and recover this h is greater than minus two-thirds that we thought was true, but go back to first principles. And so now is like first slight new work in this talk. We took the eta-h scaling and we took our h here and we basically constructed an equivalent. An equivalent h using eta, you know, for every gradient, there is an inverse eta, et cetera, et cetera. And there is the p. Okay, and so what we're really doing, we're taking Navier stroke and then we're injecting, we're really injecting into it, into this norm definition, material from the multifractal model. So we inject E to H and we inject, excuse me. and we inject excuse me we we inject probability p which gives us of course this r to the c now i i i i'm hearing an echo come up but never mind um i have to reference an idea proposed by mark nelkin in 1990. he wrote very pretty small bizarre Pretty small Miserate letter in which he suggested how that higher derivatives ought to come into the structure function estimates, but he wasn't actually able to carry it out because he didn't have any Navier-Stokes information on how to do it. So the way I look at what I'm going to do is like fulfilling Mark Nelke's program. So what we're going to do here in the spirit of Paladin and Volpiani is It's a heater H, it scales like nu to this, to this, and then we're simply going to work out what that is. And it essentially scales like nu to the chi, and this chi has m, it has n, it has c, and it has h in it, the c coming from here. And then we compare that, it's a comparison with the right-hand side estimates for this thing. Hand side estimates this thing that we had in our first theorem in my weak solutions of Navi-Stokes, and that simply tells you, after a bit of algebra, that t must be greater than this expression here. And now it looks a mess until you realize that as you take m and n to infinity, you're not going to get any finite probability. It will go to infinity unless this. Unless this thing is negative. And that puts the lower bound on h as greater than or equal to one minus d over three, which is exactly minus two thirds when d is three. So we sort of like recovered that result. We sort of got out of jail. So keeping this h min in mind as one minus d over three, we now want to go back and see what can we say about c? We say about C? What can we? How can we maximize this lower bound? Okay, and basically, what you find is that the maximum part of this lower bound simply comes from when m is 1 and n is 1. And when you, and all other contributions from higher n and m are basically negative. And so essentially, And so essentially, what you find is that T of H is greater than or equal to 1 minus 3 over H, which is exactly what you would have just from M is 1 and N is 1. In other words, it's no better than the four-fifths, what the four-fifths law would give you. So we have taken into account all derivatives, but they aren't basically contributing anything. And moreover, when you look at this C, its value is H min. Its value at 8 min is greater than or equal to d. Now, that would imply in the old geometric theory that your fractal dimension was negative. But actually, it's all in Greg's notes. Greg basically points out that this could happen and exactly here happens here. All it's saying is that because this is a probabilistic theory, the probability of this happening is just extremely low. Is just extremely low. That's all it means. So if we put this lower bound on C and the lower bound on H into a picture, so here's C, here's H running from minus one up to a third and then up to one. Essentially, there is one minus three eight. So you've got to be above this black line. Line and Beringer had some data. So the blue dotted line is the log normal model for a particular parameter that's there. And the red dashed line is the log Poisson model, okay, for beta is two-thirds, and that's there. So you can see all this touches around h is a third, but nothing actually goes below it. So basically, everything has to be to the left of this. Be to the left of this, sorry, to the right of this, so it's greater than minus two-thirds, and above this dashed line, and so you can basically be in here. And what we would actually like to do in the future is take various people's data sets and see actually where they fit on this picture. Okay, now I've only got one more slide. I've dashed through this quickly. You want to ask yourself, what are the consequences of What are the consequences of this? Well, if we now say we stick to three dimensions, the range of h is now minus two-thirds to a third. Now, essentially, what this is doing is saying that this lower bound is keeping us away from h is minus one. You can't, you can't, you bump down against. You bump down against minus two-thirds, you can't reach h is minus one. And if you look at this very distinguished and very hard paper by Caffarelli, Cohn and Nirenberg in 1982, they developed the idea of suitable weak solutions and they defined a singular set in space-time and they proved that it has zero one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. And the way they did. Dorf measure. And the way they see it was this: in that sort of mathematics, one normally covers a set with spheres. But in this case, they recognize that you're dealing with parabolic Navier-Stokes equations, and that really t scales like x squared, which in x t space is really like a parabola. And so instead of covering the Instead of covering the singular set of fears, they basically covered it in 3D parabolic cylinders. And they got their result that way. And what they did, they had lots of results in their paper. It's a very hard paper to read. But they actually proved that as you approach this singular set, the velocity field basically has to go greater than the constant over R. Go greater than the constant over R. And basically, I'm not claiming that this is a mathematician's proof because it's certainly not. It's more of a sort of physicist's rule of thumb argument. This r to the minus one lower bound, it really suggests a minimal rate of approach that corresponds to h equals minus one. And our lower bound is minus two-thirds. Bound as minus two-thirds. In other words, it says it's keeping solution away from this singular set. Now, like I say, that is not a proof of regularity, but it's a sort of suggestion that if you blend Navier-Stokes and the multifractal model, that it sort of controls, it controls your H and it controls your approach to the singular set. And essentially, that's what I wanted to say. I think I shall stop there. I think I shall stop there. Thank you, John, for a very nice talk. Paper is now open for questions, comments. Let me see if there's something in the chat. So there's a comment by Greg, which, if he's there, if he can say himself. Oh, well, that was, I mean, it was a minor comment, but I just think John was. But I just, since John was giving me so much credit, I want to give credit with credit due. But the part of my notes to which he refers were all lifted straight from Uriel's 1995 book. So indeed, I was the cliff notes for Uriel's book. Okay. Yeah, but they're very nice notes. They're very nice notes, Greg.
