I'm going to say this. Yeah. So feel it just a little bit. Yeah, just that. Okay. Alright, so this is my third time in years. Alright, so thank you, Canadian text players. Last time I was here, I guess 2009, when Lenin Brunimoj Pranjeter turned 60. Now I'm turned 60 this year, right? Then we plan to have a meeting back in March, but then because of the Russian invasion, you Of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, right? I didn't have, nobody had any mood to celebrate anything at all. And hopefully, next year, when Dimitri is going to tell 60, we will join the efforts. So you can see some familiar faces, Katrin Pikovsky, Virgin Buddhov, his wife, Hamin, Sinai, if you don't know all these names, right? Khudir. Yeah. Okay, so the teachers is talking. Okay, so the teachers are still. Huh? You're way up there, right? That's me. Yeah, I was there, I said. We're going to have a picture too, right? Yeah. So it's going to be all well documented. And the first time I was here, it was a meeting run by Marty Gulubwiski, and the emphasis was upon slow, fast dynamics, surprise, right, in a neuroscience. Neuroscience pseudo-neuroscience environment. Okay, so then I go back to my meeting, my talk. And so basically this talk is meant to be an illustration of research cases of my dad, passed away several years ago. His research on hermetline biopications. And you will see what he's doing. And you will see how these how can you verify have to do with slow-fast dynamics again. And to be honest, I don't really care about slow-fast dynamics except for if I treat, if they come from neuroscience perspective. Okay, so it's going to be an illustration of shield link of harmoclinic results in small fascist applications, smaller sex modes. Okay, but you will you will see familiar pictures. So basically, the idea is that this we're called bursting, this is called quasi-kinner disease here, and when neurons often on a borderline between stability activity types, like equilibrium states, biological gold is 20 spiking activity bursting, there is something going on interesting, right? And I do care about non when finish shell theory. Uh when finishel theory or but target theory fails to work, this is my favorite case. I don't care about normal habitat money holds it in this context. I want to, these number probabilistic conditions fail. Right, so this is interesting. I was contacted by these guys, Timothy Kopp, with his group from New York Tech. They study what's called motor neuron. So basically motor neuron is a neuron that gets a signal from It gets a signal from a central pattern generator, bulk. And that signal goes into the muscles. And the point is that normally, normally, it gets a signal, amplifies it, sends it to the muscle, muscle stretches, expands, whatever. But under certain conditions, and that's his research, and his animal model, I think it was chicken, what they see is that, okay, oxy is a It's all translational research. That's what humans get using the chemotherapy. And the idea is that the same cell, when it gets an application of oxidant or sepsis somehow, the NASCAS somehow through the blood, it stops doing its job. It becomes unreliable. And you try to push it, you apply positive pulses very, nothing. So basically, that's what you're going to see. And a good start. And a good start, and very likely what would happen is that you just Google, okay, chaotic sub-to-shoulder oscillations that allow my name popped up, right? And you ask me how far Jujitech is. It's about 10 minutes drive. Okay, that's what he came to me to my land to discuss what can be done. But my point is that in a floor fast system, such things do occur, but they occur in a very small region in the parameter space. There you can see this typical. They can see this typically, which means it's generic phenomena. So it's a typical phenomenon. You don't have to be highly skilled to find these logical systems. Alright, so let me just explain. So whenever you have in a phase phase of your module, you have a periodic orbit, it's gonna give you more or less periodic oscillations. This is voltage. And this is voltage we call bursting. This is what you should call bursting. And what happens in between is, in this particular case, then you're going to have a torus bifurcation in between. And therefore, you're going to see something like this. Most appearances here. And one way to study this, again, computationally at least, right, you can use return maps. In modeling dynamics, you can use, say, voltage minimum, massive, whatever. But in neuroscience, you shouldn't rely on In neuroscience, you shouldn't rely on, well, just mean Narkspan. You only rely on an individual. Because it depends on how well you poke yourself, right, and what the shunting current is. So you shouldn't rely on voltage chant. Because you know it's still between negative 70 and 30 millivolts, right? So no more. Alright, now the story of the story of uh tourist bifurcation. Tourist biification. So originally this idea popped up when Andronov and his student Weed studied periodically forced wonderful assertions. So that's how they developed the theory. So this is what this is in historically, these are not called Ardmann tons, these called resonance ones. And they can be strong resonances. Resonances, so how wide this cone is. And what you see is this torus, when the frequency of national frequency and the driving frequency, they're commensurable, then the torus that used to be become resonant. And you have a periodic orbit on a torus, it depends on, it has what's called winding now, it depends on how it moves around the torus. It moves around the torus. In this case, it's like one to three. And light-whoom torus is special, which means whenever you have a stable period of orbit, you should get a stable periodic orbit immediately, right? So because you're notorious. So you always have even number of stable or even number unstable curved codes. And I do remember when I took a class on oscillation theory, they told us about the They told us about this transition. And what you see, the borderlines, this corresponds to what's called a SNIC biopic nowadays. SNEC means you are on S1, you have a several nodes, and then it's called Hammock Sand mode, but you are on a sound node anyway. So you're going to re-inject back to where you started. And that was done again by Andreanov Reed, and then Andrew basically asked his wife, Lean Torish, to start the dissemination. Wife Leon Torish to study the cellular mode, the magnetic cell mode in the plane. And later on, my dad generalized this result for n-dimensional case. Because the anti-sheli on a one-parameter induced the region plane on the surface. So whenever you say it's neat, you don't need that. You have to prove that it's stable, contracting, and so forth. So and the point was that a fabulous and shiny gift. So African Shilnikov, they considered what's going to happen, or they studied what's going to happen if the driving force amplitude is above a certain threshold. And I do remember the number from period oscillations. The periodic force, the amplitude, this level is 4 divided by square root of 27. How do I remember this amplitude? I mean, it's meaningless number at all, but the point is that the theory is only valid here. So if you ask, Is only valid here. So if you ask, do they cross? Nobody can tell you, right? Because if they cross, they're going to cross above this line. Before that line, circulations all don't cross. And what Schilling and Aframoich suggested is that, all right, I'm going to get invariant circle, invariant curve, and then become what's called non-smooth. And I'm going to use trending, okay? And it becomes non-smooth because this table we are to call it on the torus undergoes a clear doubling defecation. A peliodoulin deffurcation. Not a cascade, but peli-double defecation. Okay, and then the amplitude for this oscillation grows so that stable manifold touches the unstable manifold touches the stable manifold. And you have a Promcaria homogeneic wiggles and hyperbolic onset of a hybrid subset. Alright. So first example. The irony of the story is that actually the Shenyas UK. Actually, Sheny Zukevich had an example in one of his papers, but he wanted to use train what's called elliptic bursting. Elliptic bursting when you have rise in the phase followed by a train of spikes, which change it differently. But the idea is pretty obvious, right? Upeak was called a Baubitin bifurcation. Bautin was a student of Antonov, and he studied the case when you transition from supercritical to subcritical bifurcation. And the point is that you're going to have not one, but two. That you're going to have not one but two periodic orbits. And the default here that you see, it's actually a stable periodic orbit continued in, say, third direction, right? This is stable one, so they create this kind of surface. And if you look at the equations, I mean, you can play using different methods, right? You create this pipe, this tube. So if you inside the tube, the vector field is going to suck it in. Field is going to suck it in, right? And then you go through. Tasso talked about the limited stability. Around here, you realize that I'm an unstable branch, I have to diverge. You can reverse this guy and start moving backwards because the vector field above the tube pushes you to the left. And if the diameter is large enough, you're going to stop here and we have a purotic core. And then you make the diameter smaller, and basically you push this purotical cause it. You would come closer to this fault, seven mode. Okay, as I said, at that time you have slower dynamics, and you have a fast dynamics and a slower time scale near the saddle mode. Everything goes wrong. And the point is that, under certain circumstances, you're going to get invariant sample. This is just a cross-section. So you can see this is the torus. The point is that, like people like the narrator, Some people like connectors, right? I don't really care about connectors, I want to break them down. So the question is, why is it stable? Right? Why shouldn't it be unstable? Can be a period doubling instead of torso bifurcation. And I guess that's the reason why one 10 years ago, TASA student, I forgot his name, contacted me, because he was looking at my applications and found that there is a fault here. But in this case, you're not going to get the toast. But in this case, you're not going to get the TOS wipe application. Instead, you're going to get PUW. Again, the question is: why is that? Hopefully, I will try to tell you why. But then, with Jeremy, we got interested in elliptic burst and something like that. And we looked at this simple example, the CSF-Hungar Gumman, also known as relaxation of selector. And then John Windold added another equation. And that equation basically did the following. Basically, did the folder. So you can produce Brusselsian escalations when the, let me say that, when this surface is transit to the solutions, right, and that surface is transit to the solutions. Or under circumstances, you're going to get a torus over here, or possibly you're going to get a torus there, right, on a fault. So you're kind of sucked, being repelled. And what you see is just a torus in that system. And I did. And I did discuss the toast bifurcation theoretically, how it can emerge on the fold in one of our earlier papers on that model. But again, we didn't get torus bifurcation and we just developed what is going on. And then later on, I happened to be a reviewer of One PRList Agnes by Mark Kramer and Nancy Papel. Nancy figured it was. Nancy figured it was me because I I I suggested to do this and that, so she figured it was me. And they haven't got pretty kingdom cells, working fast effect. So that's a slow motion manifold. So you see this familiar fold and according to Mark Kramer, this torus is stable. The trick is that the torus again both stable Again, both stable and settle. It depends. Boro, you have a saddle node bifurcation of two tori. But again, in this case, it's a real torus cannabis because given the time scale of the system. And basically what I'm trying to show is that with this Taurus that you see here, it's actually obsequent because you're in six-dimensional, six-dimensional phase space. Taurus has two-dimensional, stable, unstable. Two-dimensional stable stable manifold actually is stable. And either you get inside the torus or you stay outside. But eventually you're going to get inside the torus anyway. It goes to being orbit sitting inside the torus. Which means, be correctly, it's a certain torus. And then it basically is in charge of the biostability of the system. And all of a sudden, all this story bifurcation just started popping up. So was it. So that's a wrong reference. It was a Max Bajelev. It's very precise, accurate, which in Hashtag models they needed to study epilepsy. And the idea is that whenever all space is looking around, they know that epilips is coming. It's just around the corner. And what you see, this is the phase space of, or the projection phase space. You start over here, right? And then this is your SNEC. Right, and then this is your sneak. Now you're on a stable branch over here, you come to the fold, from fold, you collapse onto the stable branch on the top, and then transition through the level of stability, get to this point, which is actually self-focused. Spiral way to start the new cycle of person. And basically, by controlling some slow dynamics, right, basically, if you place this loop line over here, then This move platinum over here, then you're going to get the torso locations on the edge again. Then, old friend of mine for many years, Shura Neyman, got interested in what's called hair cell. So, these guys, they have an interesting hearing system. And the point is that, again, it's a Hochen Hassel type of model. And then they found that it can be a tonic spike, a burster, and this is about using point. And this is Baughsen point. Bausen point means that we have two limit cycles nearby, which means they can produce a fold, and they reproduce a fold, and you're going to get close by frequency. And what they found is called sensitivity analysis, their physicists, basically they deterbed by different frequencies, pure forcing and computed variations of trajectory or sensitivity. And then they found they had the most i interesting story going on right here, and that's where the torus And that's where the torus emerges. And again, that torus can be unfold, it can be stable, but if you slow down the slow subsystem, then the torus becomes of a settle type. Interesting, right? Still. And then you have best stability because Taurus is of a settle type. Inside the Taurus you have a stable pure clobby. And also meanwhile, if you are outside, you can use burst. Now we're going back to the Taurus breakdown. To the torus breakdown. And what you see is basically your cut transcript with the torus. And you have invariant circle. When it starts, it's round and nice. And then it starts increasing in size. Taurus starts increasing in size. And then you can see it becomes non-smooth. And this little thing that Right, and this little thing that you see, it basically means that the torus becomes resonant. You don't you don't so the trajectory doesn't feel densely the the invaded curve. Okay, now let's just illustrate what may happen, depending on where you cut through the torus biification. So, what you see here is if you were decorated, it is stable, then loses stability, and now we have a torus. You can basically tell what flucky multipliers are by moving. Tell what fluke multipliers are by looking at this figure, right? Just know. So the points jump like this: ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, spiraling onto the fixed point. So you know the angle in flacco multipliers. And then the torus becomes unstable, and now it becomes resonant, and you probably see a stable point, which corresponds to the periodic points of the stable periodic corpus of the torus. So you can say that how many is seven, so you can tell what the resonance is. And these are the resonances. And these are the resonances. So the this is resonance called one to three. When the angle, talking about supplies, is to pi over three. This is resonance one to four. Angle is pi over two. As you can see, you have a variant circle, and now it deshapes and becomes resonant. And then you have the TC period doubling. So basically, these two green branches means that it's stable throughout COVID and maturus undergoes through the doubling cascade. And then this is weak resonant. But the point is that where you can push multiplies too. They transition from one to one resonant, move like that, and then they stop here. And this is called one to two resonance, which means you have a P double qualification at the end. Which means the life of torre is short. They don't live long. Okay, so you can only transition from zero angle to pi, and after that, you only have, even though you have a vault, you don't have a turtle. You have a fault, you don't have a tourist biification, you have a PD double, which basically means that the slow subsystem is only two times faster than the slow transition through the cell mode. Only two times. Okay, so things matter. And then, for a breakdown, and then you have a bursting activity, your schaulting, and that's a return map, how it looks like. And you will see more return maps of the same shape in all these kinds of neuroscience models, regardless whether. Kind of a neuroscience model, regardless whether we have question cast type or phenotypological. And again, if you happen to be beyond the torus bifurcation, only transition that we can see is through the PW cascade. And then my first interest was in neuroscience. Again, I was given this model. Basically, it was a normalistic reduced model of a leach heart interneuron. It's a Kochikin-Hax near, this is its manifold. This is its manifold. And your control parameter is basically this called slow moonline. If you push it down, you have more chances to turn around this manifold before you reach the fault. If you move it up, you can get a private cover here. But the point is that it has interesting dynamics. So for example, you cannot manage a tangency on that manifold, basically on this battle. So trajectories that move around, turn around. That move around, turn around about the transition towards the end, and then they stop here, all about to stop here. This is called the blue sky catastrophe. So basically, you can make an orbit infinitely long here, and due due to stability, because you get contracted on the equilibrium branch, right, and you have stable periodical orbit. Or, okay, so you can see I pick two initial conditions over here, and then I have red trajectory, which corresponds to an expium and blue bursting. Tonic spike and then blue burst. And the question was why that happened. And this is a secondary question, but again, you use the turn maps. Now you can see how the screen stretch. So you pick this whole Marshall manifold, or some people call critical manifold. You pick a space curve in 3D here, which corresponds to a minima, pick a point, and then let them go after one revolution where they're going to land on the surface. They're going to land back at the same point you call the. Left back, the same point we call the fixed point. Okay, that fixed point can be stable if you can move in this direction, right? Because in that direction, it's stable like all Kochi-Haz-Tackle models. And that fixed point is actually unstable or settle. And or you have a periodic orbit like this. Point jumps over here, then comes back. So you have orbits of pert. And with return maps, you have everything, right? So you interpret this, okay, I have a single minimum, single stable fixed point. Single stable fixed point, it undergoes Kurdamikowski, and now you have Kovich dynamics. Why? I mean, because you see how the map looks right now, right? It has a basically becomes basically a 10-minute casper. Or there is another transition in a system when you undergoes period w period aging cascade, orbit of period one, or then becomes orbit of period whatever two. Of period whatever two. And the initial orbit, this one becomes unstable. And the point is that it may happen that all of a sudden the trajectory starts coming back to this unstable fixed point, which means you have a homogenic bifurcation of a cell periodic orbit in 3D. And with the maps, you have more control. You don't have to compute the stable, unstable manifolds of the orbit in 3D, because you can do it using the maps. And you can use symbolic dynamics, you can use knitting invariance, you can do whatever you want to. Use needing invariance, you can do whatever you want to quantify that kind of characters. But anyway, it's all due to trajectory scanning back to the original seven-fixed point. Okay, and then, as I said earlier, if you add noise, you can enlarge the parameter region where you have these transitions. Let me see. Or you can explain, say, by step. Or you can explain, say, by stability, because you see you have stable fixed points, the blue one at the top, right corner, and then you have, you would call it, and the basin of attraction on the fixed point bounded by this unstable repelling fixed point, and it becomes everything clear. So, but the story doesn't stop here, and then I'm going to talk about another bifurcation. So, Valiaro Ukianovi was a student of my dad in Like that, in kind of middle generation. And then it considered what is known as a non-central homoclinic. So imagine you have a cell node periodic orbit, okay, like 3D. This is called stable node region. This is unstable manifold. And what if it comes back along, not from here, like in the case of a loose catastrophe, which is good dimension one, and it comes back like that. It's still dimension one because you've got two two-dimensional surfaces and three G. Surfaces and 3G, they typically either don't cross or cross transfer square. Or they become tangent. And become tangent, it's good I mentioned here. So you use the turn maps or you use the cross-section and what you see basically is the following. So for example, when this unstable manifold comes on the right to the strongly stable manifold, then we have vice versa, you have bursting and turning spiking. If it comes If it comes back on the left, which means everything goes immediately after one cycle of birth, well, everything goes to the stable periodical. Otherwise, in between, you have a human vigilance, you can go n numbers, n times to the right, but eventually you're going to end up, it's not what I mean, but it's just a multi-tangles. And it's just an example. You pick some elemental condition, and as you can see, the system generates quite long. The system generates quite long bursts because you come back to the subperiodic orbit, you turn around it, and then you go to the right, and eventually you change your mind and go to the left to create the periodic orbit as well. So that's how you create, again, chaos at the transition between Twin Spike and Inversion due to high stability. I swore myself that I will never study individual models of neurals anymore. All of a sudden, I changed my mind because I have to. All the stuff I changed my mind because I have two new students in the lab, and this particular model happens to be fun. More importantly, it demonstrates co-to-behavior, still have transitions, but these transitions occupy pretty large stripes in parameter space, like the radiofill slide that I showed you. It's not just a tiny little interval, it's a pizza, pizza-large feature. Normally, okay, Normally, this is called plant model. If a plant is the last name, he derived this model to describe experimentally observed parabolic bursting in a neuron known as R15 in aplegia C-slap. So, and that neuron is supposed to get involved in an egg-laying process somehow. Nobody knows. But aplegia got in the But indirectly, at two model prices in neurophysiology on the flexis and neuron dilation. So, and this is a dissection of, it's a pseudo-projection of the plant model. It has two-dimensional flow subsystem, okay, and it's not just one way drags the fast subsystem. This is just pushing fast here, but they're connected reciprocally, so this can be fun. And normally, it produces regular bursting. Regular bursting and probably bursting, but at the transitions, the bursting behavior becomes guilty. And that's what we're going to study. That's the plan, as I said. The idea is that you use all arsenal of tools developed in my lab, like symbolic dynamics and scans, symbolic scans, software, and so on, to better understand. But the point is that. Better understand. But the point is that the driver of chaos in the system still a cell geologic orbit in that two-dimensional subspace in the system. Okay, it either gets inside, as you can see, you have a long transition, right, or the calc can become quite developed. And if you use what's called interval maps, basically this interval, between interval, that's how it's stretched after one developed. It's stretched after one evolution, and that's how 1D map looks like. And again, this is an interesting exercise. I'm not saying it's a big breakthrough, but it's a good exercise for a new PG sensing map. Alright, and then speaking of PD Dublin, I got to know PD Dublin when I met Teresa Che. She started, she proposed this model of Better Cell. She passed through many years of cancer. And then I got to know some. And then I got to know some work on the Hin-Marsh-Rose model, and we'll talk about this. But basically, as you can see, this voltage map, it looks pretty much similar to the map that we talked about. And now I go to the Hin-Mars-Rose model. Mathematicians interested in neuron science, for some reason, adore that model. It's nothing really special. So that's how the manifold looks like: S-shaped curve. And then we have started from Andronov top, end up with the Hamato-backed. And run the club and up through the commenting battery. But the trick is that it's, I mean, I propose not doing flow-fast dissection. The idea is that you just change the dynamics of the flow regression without changing fast subsystem, which means this manifold stays intact. So the idea is that, so basically, what you see here, this periodic orbit, if you cut through this manifold, right, and then you have a periodic orbit, and then you start loading these Start loading this log file, and we don't pushing pedological installed there. So it was a human bifurcation. And unlike many humans, the pediological would know a standard consistent action bifurcation theory. And it knows that the eigenvalues of the settle are such that it can't end up at the homotinine bifurcation. But it it can become a torus because intersection uh it can't disappear through the cell node because intersection is transverse and it has only one chance, right, period double. Has only one chance, right? Period doubling. And these things start to undergo period doubling verifications right now. And basically, this battery is known. I can recall this, usually we call this, it's called a change of the routine direction in the saddle. And then I guess both end, maybe Feedler, came up with the new name, it's called Orbit Fleet or Equation Fleet. I don't remember the story. But the point is that you have to. You can get, you have purety dynamics, and basically, in the singular limit, this map that is supposed to give you stability and only stable pure coverage shouldn't have a problem. It has this extra term, and that extra term is due to again inclination feedback or the feedback location. Alright, you can play a game, you can construct as efficiently things like this, right? So you can slow down, you band this. You ban this moot line to slow down trajectories on its manifold to get loose guy catastrophe, or you can get contrast amaclinics. And I'll just show, I always want to do that, but it's still up. It was a table so long, right? You know, David Turman, he proved that you have a smell host shoe at the transition from point spiking bursting in a spot where it bursts. Just illustrate. Just illustrate the meaning of the theorem because if you paper, it's long and long. Alright, so you have this on this manifold, and basically, all you can pick points on this Python manifold. And what you will see, I'm gonna run the trajectory starting so they how they move. Canal people call this maximal canals, but bottom line, what you're Can that. But bottom line, what you will see that circle, when it maps, so due to the slope transition to the plate itself, it's what I asked you this morning. One trajectory is going to go all the way up to this fold. And the idea is that when you take the cross-section, you will see that that circle has its continuity point and becomes a smell hold. And basically, this is a geometric illustration. And basically, this is just a geometric illustration of calculus one. And I guess that's it. I have more slides, but I'll let you stop. Thank you very much. Other questions? So I've asked you this question before, but I didn't like your answer. So I give you a second chance. I have some memory. I have shot men in the middle. So you're looking at all this example, I get total marketing, and then Joe Buchenheim and I looked at the case where you have this Slowfax time scale system. And if you look at the Frozen system or the reduced equations, then you see hop bifurcation, you have that inmats rose, for example, there's hook bifurcation. And then if you turn your epsilon on, And if you turn your epsilon on and you look at any other parameter, you still have a hop bifurcation. And we found that if the criticality of the hop bifurcation matches, you get peer doubling, if you have that one is super critical, but in the other it's subcritical, for example, or vice versa, then you're getting a torus biocrigger. And so you haven't talked about that case at all. I can give you the answer. So first of all, you have hot. You have hot for duty fast subsystem, right? And you can get hot for due to slower and faster, right? So the trick is that now a little bit of a story. Yeah, but there's a singular one. Heimer picked that up from Ilushenko. Ilushenka picked it up from Arnold. Arnold picked it from non-standard analysis from French group. So you see, that's how it goes, right? Because French group didn't know bifurcation theory, Arnold knew local bifurcation theory, right? Vocal bifurcation theory, right? And then they published a book with Ily Shenke of Hermovich, Mohammedan Shenkev, and then they have an interesting example. Okay, that's your example, Fischinar Numa. Okay, you have this thing. Clearly, critical point can cave up, can cave down. What makes this Limit cycle stable in a plane when it's repellent? Because ironically, you have the term, you have a cubic tool divided by three. If you remove that one thing, If you remove that one-third, all of a sudden my friend becomes supercritical. So, you have to, technically speaking, you have to find what's called Lapanov exponent. That's what Bautin was famous for. So, he derived the formulas to tell you whether bifurcation is going to be supercritical or subcritical. In a singular limit case, clearly, if epsilon is small, clearly the fast or the contribution of the fast subsystem is important. So, if you go to Kerrish website or British website or school meeting because I told him the story. So you'll see in the book that it says you have to find third derivative at the fall. That's not true. You have to expand the tail series, perform standard procedures, and find the Lapnot coefficient. Not the coefficient, but its sign. And then you will see the easy way of isolating. I'm talking about the torus bifurcation. Okay, as for the torus bifurcation, you guys love water. You guys love auto. If you go to auto manual, right, then Bordel said, towards bifurcation, don't trust me. So he knew that post bifurcation, you can detect when the fluke multiplies become complex conjugate and cross the unit circle. You can do that, more or less. However, can you continue to rush? No. Can you tell whether torus is going to be stable or stellible? Nobody knows the answer. It depends on. It depends on article things. So, which means people who like slow or fast decomposition, right, they have a big challenge in front of them. How to tell whether the tourist bifurcation, the use stable torus, one stable, is going to be resonant to us. It's a non-local bifurcation model, which means nothing you can do magic. Nothing you can do manually. And you have two tools, either Bart XDP, but I don't think it handles Torres. Ratification maybe does, I never used it. Then you have your old friend Auto, right, or MattCon. MatCon is pretty reliable. I checked it out several times to see whether it's going to give me the right answers. And it delivers. It delivers. But it has nothing to do with what. But it has nothing to do with your best cases I get according to your findings. The only hope verification that you you can have all hope to get the torus. So basically just an example. This is right. Remember, if I create the bus over here, then I'm going to get several node plus hop. And then you have Gubbenheimer and Gabriel together for cases. Together in four cases. Possibly, one of them can be the torus bifurcation in that. And I have two unpublished papers. It's my bad. I don't have the guts to get back to the paper on the torus bifurcation in a certain setup locally. But one day when I retire, I'll publish I'll try it. Okay, I suggest moving the remote the discussion to the discussion, sir. With the discussion. The discussion. You probably want to have a scale down, but maybe it's just you got it.
