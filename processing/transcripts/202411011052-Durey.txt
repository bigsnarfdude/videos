President tries to rapidly wait and compile. No, that's wrong. Yes, uh, other Zoom panels. Great. Well, thank you very much for the organizers, and thank you for the invitation. Can you hear me okay? Yeah. So this is joint work with Paul Malewski and Xia Yang, who was a master's student working with me this summer and did a lot of progress working on this problem as we moved away from into some more complicated. Into some more complicated combined basins, looking at resonant-triad interactions, which is similar to what Paul talked about yesterday, but with some new material as well. So, here we're looking at a fluid bath, which is being vibrated side to side. And what happens is you get these waves forming on the surface, which appears a lot in the sloshing literature. And this is driven by an external forcing at a natural frequency of one of these wave modes in the bar. And as you can see, it leads to a very pronounced amplitude of these waves. Pronounced amplitude of these waves. Now, this sorting can also appear in many different applications, such as the transport of liquid cargo. So, here we see the transport of liquefied natural gas on a ship, but these different ideas can also happen in the transport of fuel in tanker trucks and also in aeroplane wings, for example, where the movement of the vessel can cause a lot of the change in the shape of the or change in the evolution of the fluid, where maybe the goal is to minimize unsafe rocking of the. To minimize unsafe rocking of the ship or vehicle in this case. But one of the questions really is: what is the influence of the tank shape and the fluid depth on the evolution of this sloshing? And we also see that this sloshing can appear not just in industrial settings, but also more in geophysical settings. So here we have a wind-driven siche, which occurs quite often in the Great Lakes and North America, where the wind blows across the lake for a long amount of time, leaving a large-scale displacement. A large-scale displacement, and then we have this rocking of the water across the entire lake for hours or even days, leading to large changes in the free surface elevation near the coast. But that's all about external forcing through wind or shaking of the vessel. What about internal resonances? So these are intrinsic to liquid motion, but can also drive sloshing and involve a collective interaction of a small number of linear wave modes. Number of linear wave modes. But these resonance can lead to waves of relatively large amplitude and there's sustained interaction between these different wave modes. So resonant triads, as we've heard a bit about yesterday, are the collective resonance that drive the fastest energy exchange, whereas quartets are an order of magnitude slower energy exchange. Paul and Ben yesterday gave very nice explanations of tries. I'll try my best to give a slightly different one. So imagine here if we have three different oscillators. Oscillators just oscillating at different angular frequencies omega i. Then, what happens if you look at products of these different oscillators and you go through the calculations? And we see that we get terms which have oscillations of frequency omega 1 plus omega 2. And as you look at the different combinations of products, you'll see things like omega 1 plus omega 3 or minus omega 1 plus omega 3, so on. Now, what happens if we have a relationship between these different frequencies, such as the summation? Well, here now, Such as the summation. Well, here now we see that actually this product of two oscillators with frequencies omega 1 and omega 2 can actually pump energy into the oscillator U3. So if these are somehow coupled with quadratic nonlinearities, then interactions between modes 1 and 2 are going to pump energy into mode 3. Likewise, you can play this same game and look at products of U2 and U3, and its interaction will pump energy into mode 1. Pump energy into mode one, and finally, interactions between modes one and three will pump energy into mode two. And so, this is a sustained exchange of energy. And as we heard yesterday, I think I'm not the only student of Paul that Paul has taught that one plus one is equal to two. So when two modes in the triad coincide, a one-two resonance forms. So it's a special case of a triad. And as Paul said yesterday, resonant triads of gravity waves are impossible in unbounded domains. In bounded domains, the lowest type of resonance you get is a quartet. And in fact, we'll see later this also holds, and Paul said yesterday, when you've got a square or a rectangular basin, because the wave modes are still sines. And the question is here, how does combinement influence internal resonances? So we looked a little bit at this problem. Maybe I'll skip over this. We looked a little bit at this problem in the simple case of a cylindrical basin. So just to summarize all. So, just to summarize Paul's talk yesterday in a single slide, so we found that if you've got three different wave modes, you can look at the different wave numbers, and that will give you a condition as to whether there exists a critical depth to which you can fill this fluid in the basin at which three different wave modes will resonate. And if you plot these different contours of the critical depths, there's an existence region where the depth goes to zero as you approach to right of this region and goes to infinity as you approach to left. And you can also look at the To left. And you can also look at the long-time evolution of three different modes forming the triad, and they exchange energy over time according to the canonical triad equations. But as Paul said yesterday, we can compute these coefficients. And the key parameter here really is the correlation integral, which in the special case of having sinusoidal waves reduces back to the well-known condition of the wave numbers k1 plus k2 is equal to k3, but this is a more general condition. General condition. And we can also look at what happens if we've got two layer flows, also in a cylinder, where we've got a lighter fluid sitting on top of a heavier fluid. And again, we have a similar situation of resonant trias form, where here the black region is the one layer case for the existence region in the wave number space, and the gray denotes the two layer case. And actually, we find that as you increase the presence of the second layer, you can actually suppress the existence of resonant triads. Suppress the existence of resonant triads. So I didn't know when I started looking at this problem whether having a lighter fluid on top was going to increase or decrease the triad existence region, but actually it suppresses. And of course, as the two fluids become the same, then we have a rigid lid on top and on bottom, you won't get any resonances at all. But this is all for cylindrical basins. And in practice, whether you're looking at a lake or whether you're looking at some kind of industrial project. Lake, or whether you're looking at some kind of industrial problem, your basin is not going to be cylindrical, and it's hard to convince anyone that a cylinder is a good approximation. And so, over the summer with Ja, who worked very hard, we looked at what happens if you have wave modes in a partially filled circular tank. So, this is a 2D problem motivated by the 3D video that we saw earlier. But, nevertheless, you can still compute numerically the wave modes. I should emphasize that the challenge here is the fact that the horizontal. Is the fact that the horizontal and vertical directions aren't separable, so you can't do some of the nice analysis that you would do in a cylinder. So, as you vary the fluid depth, you can plot the frequencies of the different symmetric and anti-symmetric wave modes, and you can ask the same question, are there any critical depths at which resonant triads form? And the answer is a resounding yes. So, here are some of the triads that Jer computed, plotted in order of increasing depth. And we see here that And we see here that this was restricting the list of resonant triads a lot to maybe just the first four symmetric and first four anti-symmetric wave modes. But there are many different triads that can form. And in fact, there are a lot of them forming for very shallow cylinders. And in fact, as you increase the number of wave modes that you consider, you start filling in the gaps between all of these critical depths. And I would conjecture that maybe it approaches some kind of continuous. Approaches some kind of continuum in some sense, but have no idea of proving that. But the key thing to point out here is that a very similar situation emerged for vertical cylinders, as Paul presented yesterday. And so we seem to be seeing that whenever your tank is not, whenever you're not in free space and you don't have a rectangular tank, you're actually going to get lots and lots of resonant trites. So this is what we've been looking at now is trying to explain. We've been looking at now is trying to explore some other non-separable basins, so look at some more general shapes. But still, you can perform similar asymptotic analysis to derive the triad evolution equations. But now, because your eigenmoson eigenfunctions are the Laplacian, you can't make quite the same simplifications and derive the same correlation integral. But nevertheless, you get still some nice evolution equations. But this is quite limited, so, how does the theory come? Quite limited, so how does the theory compare to direct numerical simulation or to experiments? And this is something that we're looking at in the future. I'll be particularly interested about experimental results because here we're dealing with an ideal fluid. And so many of the effects of dissipation, either through viscosity or the action of the free surface moving against a vertical or curved wall, are not going to be captured. And finally, how do resonances evolve for moving containers? So that's a quick overview. So that's a quick overview. I just want to end with a couple of open questions because we've got quite a mix of participants at this event. So, in the spirit of trying to connect between different fields. So, I have an open question in terms of the existence of these different resonant triads. So, the basic statement of the problem doesn't matter if you're in 2D or 3D, but imagine you're solving the plastic equation in some oddly shaped domain D, where on the surrounding wall you have no flux through the boundary. No flux through the boundary. Well, the condition for having the wave modes basically results in an eigenvalue problem for the linearized Durich-Later Neumann operator, where k here is like the eigenvalue, but in the physical problem, it's related to the angular frequencies through this square root relationship. My question is, and I'd be fascinated to know the answer, under what conditions on the domain or to the fluid depth will you get three waveways forming a triad as you vary eight? It's forming a triad as you vary H here in this problem. Maybe the question is to fix H and to vary the geometry, a bit like we saw, it was very successful with proving things in the Wilton ripples. But I'd be very curious to understand this problem more deeply, but I don't think I have the skills to do so. But also now on the more numerical end of the spectrum, how do resonances manifest in large amplitude sloshing? We have weekly non-linear analysis for small amplitude, but we really need to need an efficient Reads an efficient numerical method for either 2D or 3D, such as a boundary element method for understanding what's happening in more detail. And finally, can resonant tries to be excited by partial confinement, but that's a maybe for another talk. So thank you very much for listening, and I'll be happy to take any questions. We already have some questions there, but maybe it's very short. Okay, thanks a lot, man.
