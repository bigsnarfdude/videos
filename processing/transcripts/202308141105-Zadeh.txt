Talking about the Mighty Moonshine and his model. She is presenting a book called Arwina Environment, a project group. Together with Kasha. And then it could be the second Tarcom music group that would be after that. So yeah, please. Okay. Thanks very much. It is such a great pleasure. Very much. It is such a great pleasure to be here. Thanks very much to all the organizers, in particular to Nejla and Anna for making it happen eventually. There are some years past. It's unbelievable that in the end we are all meeting each other here in this fantastic place and they have been in contact with us the past couple of years with all the updates, planning. This takes a lot of effort and they have done this. Lot of effort, and they have done this beautiful job many times. I'm very happy to be here for the first time at Ban Center. It's such a great pleasure. Also, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak today. So, I'll talk about the project which we have been doing in our group. As Nejula said, the title is Matthew Moonshine and T4 represent three sigma models. Hopefully, these words will. These words will find some meaning as we go through the talk if we don't have any now. So, oops, good. First of all, our group is as follows. Antarmina and Katrin Wendland are the group leaders, and then there is Kasha, Pudrik, Mava, Unguriano. Unguriano and myself. All of us are here physically, unfortunately, except for Mava, who couldn't make it here this time. And so I'll talk about the project that we have been discussing in our group. Let me start by just state the main goal that we have. Our main goal. So, our main goal is to So our main goal is to find all symmetries of particular families of conformal feed theories. These are two-dimensional conformal feed theories known as sigma models. These are two-dimensional conformal feed theories which are defined on a Riemann surface and they have a target space which is sub-manifold. In this case we are interested in K3 surfaces as being the target space and T41. Space and T4 mod Z3 are made the particular families of K3 surfaces, in particular what we call toroidal orbifolds, namely the Scotian T4 was some cyclic group. They are example instances of K3 surfaces. And this is a conformophyte theory defined on such surfaces. And we would like to understand the symmetries of such conformophyte theories. Of such conformal field theories. This is, in general, a complicated problem. It's not known. There is a huge family, as you will see, of such conformal theories and we will try to learn new things about them. And how are we going to do that? We construct some lattices from our life I'll describe more, basically the lattices associated with such a quotient. Such quotients, with such toroidal overflow. And what they do, these lattice is give the full description of the integral homology lattice associated with this particular K3 surface. And then the second part of the program is to map, to embed this lattice into yet another lattice, an immired lattice. So here, as we might have known, the integral homology lattice of K3 surface. Of K3 surfaces is an indefinite lattice with particular signatures, whereas Nimari lattices are definite, positive, definite lattices. And the idea is to learn about one, embed it in the other one, map it to the other lattice, and study the symmetries of lattices here, because this is much easier to do. This is very well developed in lattice theory. In lattice theory, one can study this part in order to learn about symmetries of K3 sigma models, which are not known. This is the basic idea. And what are our tools? The main tool is lattice theory, as already advertised. The idea is to use lattice theoretic techniques to relate geometry and symmetries. Now, Now, geometric symmetries of K3 surfaces are related to symmetries, so automorphisms of these particular lattices, these indefinite events. And the idea is to relate them to the symmetries of positive evangelical lattices of rank 24 in Marlattis and study the latter, as I mentioned, because they are well known, have been studied. They are well known, have been studied, categorized, and then to learn about symmetries of the K-X sigma models. The main technique here is played by a lattice theory technique called gluing technique. And this gluing technique is what connects the two types of lattices to each other. This is the main underlying technical part, which plays an important role here. And the idea is you. Here and the idea is beautiful and simple: is that well, take two even lattices, correlate them, and as such, construct an even circle lattice. Now, this, of course, correlation has to be defined properly. Even lattices might be familiar to some of us, for example, in the context of the algebra lattices. We might be familiar with them or not. In the AD series, we talk about the weight lattice. We talk about the weight lattice and the root lattice of particularly algebra. And if you're familiar, these lattices, the immune lattices, the weight lattice is a coset in terms of the root lattice. There are conjugacy classes. There are all these structures in there. One can take two of them, for example, and this correlation means correlate, relate these conjugacy classes somehow. One, we are going to define how this. We are going to define how this should be in order to obtain an eventual lattice. Basically, to colorlate them, what one does is to add new vectors to the lattice, yes? Namely, points, add new points to your lattice, therefore the word gluing. And you add enough of points such that you end up with an immediate self-law lattice. Okay? This is a very well-known and very known technique in lattice theory and has been applied. And it has been applied extensively in various contexts and also plays an important role in this context. So, this is the plan of our talks. With Kasha, we will discuss our project. We will mention the motivations, why to bother, why is it interesting, why we believe it's interesting. Why is it interesting? Why we believe this interesting? And what are the puzzles, what we are looking for? And then talk about this specific construction, as I mentioned. Also, the title of the talk is specific families of K3 surfaces, this particular quotient, and then mention future directions, questions that are still going to be answered. So, myself, I will mainly focus on the background and the most The background and the motivation part, and set the stage for Casha. Casha will go through more details about the specific construction, the ocean constructions, as well as looking into the future part. So, questions so far? Comments, clarifications? Of course, you would interrupt whenever you would like to. Yes, also our friends. Okay, so let us start by just putting ourselves on the same page. K3 surface is a simply connected complex surface with a trivial canonical bundle. The integral homology of a K3 surface X together with the intersection form, it forms an even circular lattice of the following. Lattice of the following signature, 4,20. And one might be familiar with such lattices. Indefinite, namely there is a non-zero integer, a positive integer here, versus definite, which could be either, for example, 0, 20, or 4,000. Indefinite even septal lattices are unique up to allomorphoses of the lattice. So therefore, this lattice. Therefore, this lattice is oftenomorphisms nothing but the following orthogonal sum of the following lattices. U is a hyperbolic lattice. If you're familiar with lattices, imosecural lattices, you know this. If not, then actually there will be a beautiful example about Kasha, which makes us more familiar with them. The point is that this is the unique evangepto lines. That this is the unique even septal lattice of signature 1,1u. It has a follow-up quadratic form, basically defines the scalar products, the norms of the vectors, and the product of vectors in the lattice. And E8 is the root lattice of the Lie algebra, E8. Here, minus 1 is just a convention to make a negative definite lattice. Basically, whenever we put any number here, it scales the bilinear form by that number. So, here one can see. Number. So here one can see u, four factors of u, therefore the signature 4, 4, and then 2e8 with a factor minus 1, 4 plus 16, which is 20, which basically builds the lattice, even simple lattice we are looking for. So this is the structure of the integral homology lattice. So I think the signature, this is a lattice of the total rank is 24. It's four forms, it's like four dimensions. I don't know the language, pardon my language, left or right, holomorphic, anti-holomorphic in physics. We use it, yes, four directions, four coordinates along the less holomorphic directions, 20 coordinates along the anti-omorphic direction. And it's, of course, by choice, we could have been 200. By choice, between that between no problem, those are also it's just a convention that we use. Yeah, okay, and okay, another piece, another important aspect are the symplectic automorphisms of the K3 surfaces, which preserve the complex structure and the color structure of the K3 surface. These are indeed then the geometric symmetries of the K3. The geometric symmetries of the K3 surface, whose action on the homology lattice one studies and tries to, in the next step, connect to the Nimar lattice synergies. Okay. Good. So, yet another aspect of K3 surfaces we might be familiar with or not. This is called the elliptic genus. This is called the elliptic genus. This quantity called the elliptic genus of K3 surfaces. This can be constructed from geometric considerations or conformal field theory considerations, the details of which are not important. The main point is that, first of all, it is a topological quantity, namely whatever it is, it is the same for any K three surface. This will be important for us, we will talk about it later. Talk about it later. And this has been computed. This was actually introduced and computed in Anne and Friends court. It is of the following form. So we might be familiar or not. First of all, this is a function of these two parameters, complex numbers, tau and z, where tau sits in the upper half plane. One also usually defines these parameters q and y q to the pi y tau. 2 pi i tau and y being equal to e to the 2 pi i z. And thetas are Jacobi theta, Jacobi-theta functions. I wrote down the expression for one of them. Others are similar. The point is that this is a nice object. The fact that this is a weak OV form of a particular weight 0, index 1, whatever it is, is that it has nice transformation properties under the. Transformation properties under the action of the modular group. And as I mentioned, this is a topological property, the same for any K3 surface. One can also expand this in terms of Q and Y and the expansion, blah blah blah. Just wrote it down for us to see. Now, what about this elliptic genus? The elliptic genus is a quantity which plays an important, a crucial role here. And they're always following. We are going now to discuss the phenomenon of mature moonshine. You might have heard about it or not. So, first of all, as I mentioned, this elliptic genus of K3 can also be considered as a quantity of the K3 conformal field theory. Yes, it can be computed using index theorems, a generalization of. A generalization of Witten's mix theorem, for example, for the K3 surface can be computed nicely. However, when we talk about K3 conformophyte theories, we have a conformophyte theory with extended symmetry. Also in the previous talk, we were mentioning the Geraso algebra, there are some enhancements. The symmetry is bigger, is enhanced with something called supersymmetry. There are fermions in the language. There are fermions in the language of conformal field theory, there are fermion fields added, which add to the super enhances the symmetry. And in particular, in this case, it has the maximum amount of supersymmetry that any two-dimensional co-homophyte theory can have, which is known as the Enigma's 4 supersymmetry. Just as for Virasora characters, the characters associated with this particular Supersymmetry has been computed and is known. Now, here is the idea. So, we have these characters, the generating functions of the superconformal algebra in this case. And there is also a quantity, the elliptic genus, which is the same for any conformal K3. So, first any K3, conformal K3. So, here was the idea which Was the idea which actually had been studied before, but in this work these people said, Okay, let us take the K3 ellipse genus and decompose it in terms of these characters, in terms of the genetic functions. Okay, they did this. This is a familiar exercise. You might be familiar with it. There are also other instances, like the J function and the monster group, whatever. But so one can do this exercise, decompose the elliptic genus of K3 in terms of the characters of the supernova algebra. And here was a strange phenomenon which was observed. So it happened that the dimensions of representations of Mathieu group M24 appear in the coefficients in this decomposition, decomposition, in coefficients in front of the. In coefficients in front of the supercomputant characters. So, as Anne refers to, the magic numbers appeared. For example, 90 is 45 plus 45. This is an irreducible dimension of an irreducible representation of the matrix group, M24, and the complex contrary representation. This is strange why such a thing appears. Yes. I think it's not high problems at all, but how long you can see when that nice is wrong? So for n equal to 2, basically that's what you have. The electogenesis is defined. So when you talk about n equal to 4,4, there are irreducible subspaces of that, which have n equal to comma 2, and the ellitogenesis associated with that. Without any supersymmetry, it goes back to the monstrous shy. Okay, the decomposition of the J function in terms of the Virstaro characters and reading all the so that's what I said. It was in the same vein, therefore called Mathieu Moonshine, another instance of moonshine. Okay, now a good, so okay, I wrote down these characters, again some ratio of data functions, that it can data functions define as such. That it can beta functions defined as such. And these numbers show up. Mathieu group is one of the family, is actually the largest member of the family of sporadic groups, simple finite groups. It's huge. The order of the group is of order 10 to the 8 or something. So it's a big number. It's a huge number which is showing up somehow here. And one would like to understand. One would like to understand it. And after this discovery, basically about 13 years ago or so, this has been a very active subject of research in both mathematics and physics, trying to understand different aspects of it. Is this the only negative coefficient that my colleague is? Yeah, yeah, it is. That's the only negative one. However, these 20 and 2, okay, one can call them mutual, matthew, chaga, whatever, blah, blah. Whatever, blah, blah, blah. The main points show up from 90 of words. So, here I wrote the decomposition. You can make sense of that right now: whether, okay, 20 times 1, 2 minus 2 is 2 times 1, minus 2, whatever. That's the important thing shows up here because these are the non-defiest characters of the um small angles for um to take on some hydrogen. These are the hyperbolic because of hydropop hyperbolic. Did you not get molly caddies? Er have a molly lattice? Oh, uh ah, okay. I can't relate it right here. I can't relate it on the spot. Because it's a supertrace, the the characters actually are supertraces. So your question is spot on. It's a miracle that these numbers are not negative. That these numbers are not negative. They're going to be all over the place. Right, it's just a minus one. It's not to say not office, not hyper one, it's just a minus one. Yes, that's right. So it's close also. Okay. Sorry, I missed your question. Okay. So I started five minutes late, yes? Yes. Okay, good. Yes? Yes. Okay, good. Okay, good. So here is an observation. Here's a discovery of the matter function moonshine. Next, well, so people have been studying it in various directions. First of all, various directions. First of all, from representation theory point of view, namely the decomposition, this decomposition of the elective genus in terms of Of representations of the material group and these numbers showing up, this is now well understood. This is proven that namely, any coefficient at any order, to all orders in perturbation theory, any coefficient which appears is indeed decomposed in terms of M24 material group representations. Okay, this is. However, the vertex operator algebra construction, which underlies Algebra construction which underlies the Matu N24 group is unknown. So, for those of us who might be familiar with the case of the Mazarin's moonshine, there it's very well known. The holomorphic vector software algebra or mass psychomorphic theory, it's nice. This is not the case here. This is still an unresolved problem and is one of the main, it's a beautiful and a very difficult problem, which has which is under study from various directions. Now, one might say that, okay, okay. Might say that okay, okay, the elliptic genus itself arises in K3 sigma models. It's conformal K3 and K3s. That's the elliptic genus was actually originally computed. Now, the question, okay, what can we learn about material moonshine from K3 sigma models? From the simplest possible place that one can look at a K3 sigma model, look at what can we learn about material moonshine from there. About Matrimocha Factor. This is one question that one can ask and try to answer. Now, first of all, K3 conformal field theories, as you mentioned, two-dimensional conformal field theories, also referred to as non-linear sigma models, defined on a remote surface with a particular target space. And this family of conformophylly theories, K3. Confomorphy theories, K3 conformorphy theories, they have a huge moduli space. It's AB dimensional, is of the following forms: metric space, as shown and very well known. And on each part, each patch of this moduli space, one can define coordinates and try to study. For example, as I've mentioned, the subsets that we have been interested in studying are where K3 surface is a quotient of the volume. Surface is a quotient of the torrent form Z2. Thorough orbit for conformal field theory is also from the perspective of nonlinear sigma models. Now, however, it is also known that there is no single K3 sigma model which has a two-group as its aldomorphism group. Okay, and even worse, many of the instances of K three sigma models have symmetries which are not even included at two M four. Are not even included at 24. Okay? Why am I mentioning it? Because from Cohovy theory, Istanbul, you said that, okay, there is this material group, a big group showing up. So I might expect naturally that this is a symmetry of the conformal feed theory, of the full conformal field theory. Somehow acts on the states. In a conformal feed theory, we have states, blah, blah, blah. This generating function, Cetitia function counts these states and they act on it somehow. This is not the case. This result is that this is not the case. Okay? That this is not the case. And this is not strange for the following reason: because the elliptic genus, the elliptic genus is a quantity, is a measure for not all the states in the conformity theory. It only counts a particular set of states. And this is also, again, not surprising because if you're familiar with the computation of indices, usually there is a minus one inserted. This means cancellations. This means cancellations in the Gardner Coventry theory, cancellations between states. So it's not at all surprising. It happens that states that contribute are particular states which are called BPS states. These are protected by this enhanced supersymmetry. It has strong, big supersymmetry. These are particular states which are protected by this supersymmetry, which contributes to this elliptic genus. So the fact that there is no single K3 sigma model which has Mathieu group M24 as its M24 as its symmetry group, it's okay. Fine, it's not really the end of the universe. Yes, originally it didn't have to be, okay, and it didn't turn out to be. But now one have this family of states, biggest states, and can try to understand the action of mathieu group on. The action of Mathieu group on these states. Okay, and there are various ways to approach this problem. There are approaches, geometric approaches, lattice theoretical approaches, also from vertex operator algebra, vertex algebra community, representation theory. Also, so this is also an important. So, this is also an important subject in the context of string theory. There are also conformal theories in the context of string theory we might not be familiar with and called worksheet conformal theories, where such even self-dollaticism and this phenomenon naturally arises there. And people have been studying it from that perspective. There are various ways that people have been trying to study in both mathematics and physics, this problem. I'm going to talk about a particular approach to this. Particular approach to this problem, which has been one of the prominent approaches to this problem because of the contributions it has made so far to this phenomenon, to this big puzzle. And this is called symmetry surfing. And this is a geometric, a purely geometric approach together with lattice theoretic tools is trying to understand properties, trying to understand, trying to Trying to understand, trying to shine some light on the material shape. This was proposed by Anne and Katrin, both of course you know are here. The idea is to combine symmetries from different points of the K3 virtualized space in the hope of pinning down the action upon 24. The novelty here is that one does not focus on a particular instance of conformality theory, okay, a K3 conformity theory. Profit here. And it's not there. We know that. Even the full set of states is not there for it. So there should be something else. And the novelty of this proposal is that, well, we can combine them, somehow ensembling points on the moduli space. And the point is to identify what it means by combining symmetries of different points. Okay? All I was sketching, the sketch, the steps that I was sketching at the beginning, understanding the homology lattice, embedding in M24, understanding symmetries of the, sorry, embedding in New Meier, that is, understanding symmetries of the New Mario lattice. The latter, namely symmetries of the Nemari lattice, which are very well known, allows one to come up with such With such procedures, namely combining symmetries, and therefore shed light on what one can see from the conformal few theory study. And this has been extensively studied in the case of the Kumar locus, namely the T4 model 2 locus on the K3 moduli space from various aspects, from lattice theoretic point of view, from representation theory. There have been conjectures about Conjectures about purely generic points of this moduli space, which have been also studied from the formation theory point of view. Of the modular space, this has been studied a lot and has shed a lot of light on properties of this moduli space, which one doesn't know much about it except for some patches of it. So, this has been successful, but still understanding the action of Matthew 24. Action of Matthew 24 is a big puzzle. And our approach, our goal, as I mentioned at the beginning, was okay, what about this is a particular locus. Of course, one can try to learn more about this. This is a huge 80-dimensional model of space. One can try to learn more about it. And we started, we focus on the toroidal orbital regions, in particular this one, and have Learn this one and have tried to study it, which Kasha will discuss with you various aspects of what we have done and what we would like to do in the future. So with this, I thank you for your attention and I wait for your questions. I'm not sure if I answered it correctly, but I'm not sure if I understood correctly, but I think what you're saying is you're going to look at a modelized space and hope to practice some points to explain an action as an extraordinary. Exactly. If you, I'm not sure if anyone has thought about this, if you do that with the monster, in which it wouldn't be necessary, I think, because you can still just see everything in one point, do you recover the VIA? Okay, this I haven't thought about. I said that what modular space are we looking at? What modularized this are we looking at in that? I have no idea. It's just, I'm curious about what this technique says about the modules. That's a very good point. I never thought about it. So there we are talking about SQL 24. Horn of the conflict. There are experts in the audience, of course. So what marginalized space we are looking at? I don't have something useful to say. It's a beautiful question. I will think about it. I will think about it, maybe try to. But of course, Z, whatever you might have. So Z2, does that mean that you're looking for an evolution in your lattice? Exactly. So this is a monster. If you monster, you take the leech lattice. Exactly. You take an evolution, leech lattice. So this is why the Z2 is on the home, and it's a very good question. It's the easiest K3 model that you can look at. So in some sense, that that's similar to the child. That's similar to the moonshine situation. You don't want the Toronto model, you want something that doesn't have these one-zero fields in it. So now you that's why you that's why you picked the Z2 orbit for the monster situation, so that you have something more complicated than to our non-conformity theories you would want to actually study. And that's actually the similarity to the KSV case, where you have these models, we have an abstract definition of what the KSV theory should be. Easiest finally that you could look at. The easiest family that you could look at is set to Orbifones, and it's actually a big family. That's why we can do many things with it.
