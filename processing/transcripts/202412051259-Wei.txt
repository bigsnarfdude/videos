There is a wave on Chinese liberty ongoing. Thank you. First, I want to thank the organizers, Jeffrey, Harold, and Jerome, and Penn Faith Wong for the country implementation. And I think I'm one of the And I think I'm the one of the uh people who travel the longest distance to come here. But this is a beautiful place. So whenever I receive an invitation for biofuel, I will also come. So today I will talk about compact theorem for the Q chemical problem. And so this is a joint work with Liu Wei Book, it's a postdoc, and see. Postal and see you Kim from Korea. Okay, so I will give some brief introduction, then I will introduce the two important ingredients in our proof, including the the conforming operator and the passing definitions of passenger uh projective forms and uh then I give out and run out of group. I give an outer and out of group, and finally, I'll give a summary and further process. So, first of all, I apologize that there will be a lot of overlaps with talks, this conformed geometry, with Jesus' talk, with Chingia's talk, and many other fields. I'm sorry about this because this is a component geometry, so I have to go through the order, conform or feta, okay? Conformal or failed. Okay? So we started with eye close, Riemann manifold, dimension anguish 3, and this is the rich capture. And this is the capture, and this is the Shorten concert. And this is the Laplace spectrum operator. So we have the conformal Laplace operator. And then the fourth order equation is called Q curvature. Equation is called Q curvature. This is the main subject of my study today. And the corresponding final paper, I call the PG, it's a fourth water, but with many other remaining terms. And so this is what I'm going to consider today: a Q curve here and the fund is all big. Okay, so all these operators are conformable environment. So for the conformable flashing, and so if you take this power, this is a conform factor, then you get this confirmed factor of m plus two over mx, which is the critical sombreropic exponent for second word equation. Now, for the time this operator, you can do similar uh uh conformal uh change and you get this operator, which is m plus two of m minus two. And this is the critical sublime exponent in Rn for the bi-harmonical operator. As the JSON also talked as this equation. Talk as this equation goes. Okay, there's also a sixth order, and then the general operator, which is the GJMS, this is a well-known operator. And there's also a fractional GJMS operator. And these are all the confirmed operators I know. So I just look here. Okay, so what Okay, so what what is the what are what is the my concern tape? My concern is the Q capital. So let me start with the Yamabi problem because this is all almost all problems have been solved with this for this component environment, the Yamabi problem. Okay, so And so we want to find a constant scalar capture in this conformal class. And so this is equivalent to solving this semi-linear PDE with m plus 2 over m minus 2. Positive, not you want positive solution. And for the existence of Yamabi, this value, this is a classical result, first tuning. out first the Tulinger 968 and if G has a non-positive scalar capture so if C is negative or non-positive and or band for n greater than six and this Mg dot locally come from frame and ratio is in 94 this is the final result for this existence is for any dimension in the remaining case assuming the parcel mass this And there's also another alternative proof by variation. Okay, so the main concern I'm consulting is the compactness for Q capture. So let me discuss the compactness for the marketing problem. Okay? And this is a conjecture by Rich Shung in 1980. By Richung in 1988, this will compactness conjecture for the young microphone. So let Mg0 be a compact Riemannian manifold dimension equal to 3, which is not conforming environmental standard fear. We know that on standard field, you have non-compact, you have a lot of family of solutions. So suppose MG0 is not conformally equivalent. Is not conformally equivalent to the standard sphere. So, the conjecture by Rick Shun is that the set of all possible solutions for the Yamatic problem is compact in the C2 set. So, it means all solutions, there's a constant C, so that all solutions for the above problem must be bounded by this constant C. So, this is a compactness problem. And this problem has been completely solved in the like almost 10 years ago, yeah, 15 years ago. And assume that in the machine end dash equal to 24 and there are lots of intermediate results by Li and the Zhu and Dua and Marcus, Di and the Tsang. But the final result is Curry, Marcus. Is a query market in 2009. And they proved the compactness for N less than 24. This is 24, it's a critical number that will appear many times in my talk. So I will state the result of a query. Marcus I'm sure the precise result in the next slide. And the negative answer. And the negative answer for n greater than twenty-five was proved first by Brando for N greater than fifty-two and then completely solved by Brando and the markers for n greater than twenty-five. Okay, so we have this 24, 25, and this is borderline. So we have compact face. And we have non-compact is okay for the young market problem. And we have, so this is a complete nothing. Okay, so let me now state the conditions for the query markers under the shown. Okay, and Okay, uh and uh the the summary of the components for the Yama. So for n greater than 5, greater than 25, you can find a metric on the on sphere, certify this assumption, and a sequence of functions solve the MAPI problem such that the maximum goes infinity. So this is the So, this is the Brando and the Marcus result for the non-compactness. And then you have this compactness for n grade 3 and 24. And this assumption, this is a classical assumption. But under validity of the Poisson Max theorem, which I will state the Poisson Max theorem for the Q capture. But under the Poisson Mass, and you have And you have all the solutions are compact. And there's also a wire-finished theorem. I will not state. So, this is the summary of the complex result for Jambaian problem. And so the Fayama problem, we have existence and we have compactness. We have a complete understanding of the Yamabi problem. So what I want to do today is to prove this uh theorem for the uh for the Q capture. This is what I want to prove today. And so this is the Y foundation. So if A greater 6 and 24, if this is positive, so then you have a compactness. So in other words, if you have a non-compactness, then you have to have wide. Then you have should have wire validation after this order, a minus six over p Okay, so let's now go to the Q curvature problem, which is what I want to study today. And so we start with smooth closed manifold, dimension equation three, and then QG is a Q curve, PGP is a pandemic operator. So for any So for A equals logic of 4 by conformal invariance, and for constant Q curvature problem is equivalent to this 17. And now so left side is the Pandit's operator and this is M plus 2 over M minus 2. And now for this problem, a big problem is this U is this positive T over U. This is the This is the biggest problem for the existence. Okay, for AX4, this is the new wheel problem, first order new wheel. And these are classical results by Shang Yang, Dadiati, and Macquiardi 2008, and the Li and the Liu. There's a fundamental difficulty for the existence theory for AE04 and And because I prefer maximized for the Pandas operator. So to find a good maximum principle for the Pandas operator, there are many results. First result by Qin Jie and Raspi in 2006, they proved the existence of compactness for locally conformed fight manufacturers. Frides manifolds with a positive Yamatic constant and the Pancreas exponent less than m minus 4 over 2. So in this case you have existence and the compactness. So you also have a maximum principle. And Gesky and McKelvy in 2015 they prove a maximum principle for the Hanis operator. And the existing results And the existing result for the Q curvature problem and the assumption that Q curvature is non-negative and QG equity positive somewhere and Rg equating the scalar curvature is non-negative. So this is an important assumption. So under this assumption, you can prove a maxim principle for the Hundreds of And what's your maximum principle? Maxim principle, then you can prove for existence following the same idea in the Yamagi problem. And they use the secretion composites of non-local flow. And later, Hai Fumbo and Paol Yang proved that if the Yambabi environment is positive, then you can show the existence of a conformity. Of a conformal metric with positive Q capture, this existence is equivalent to the fact that the Kerala is positive. So Pg is infallible, and the Green's function is positive. So if you know the Green's function is positive, and if you have the above invariant is positive, then you have isolation. So this is This is and the many other results are and Han and Yang in 2016. They also prove the existence result and the assumption the Q curve non-negative and the GG And the PG, which we have a Gwen's function, possible Gwen's function, and possible for Yama V environment. And the guessing Han and the Ninji, they show that this assumption is equivalent to scale capture positive for any greater. And there are also multiplicity results for the Q capture problem, and there are also some results on the path of mice. Results on the path of mice for the Q casual problem. So, this is the existence one. So, already the existence part is quite different from the Yama because we don't have maximum. So, yeah, okay, and so you have all the assumptions to make sure that your solution is positive. So, the main concern, my concern is that the concern is that the concern So the main concern, my concern today is very complex. The same question in the Fossil market. So let MG0 be a compact manifold for dimension ng25 with load conformity environment equivalent to the standard sphere. Then the set of all possible solutions. So, all possible solutions of the Q cash problem is compact in the C form. So, this is the complexity problem for the Q cash problem. This is the problem I want to study today. Okay, the first result is not a compact result. The first result is non-compact, which is Non-compactness, which is was obtained almost 10, 11 years ago. So with Tsao, we proved that for eight weeks and 25, so this is the same it mentioned in Yamabi. With the 25, we can find a metric on the sphere which satisfies this assumption. So the same assumption like Han and the Yang. And we found a And we found a sequence of solutions, possible solutions, solving the Q curvature problem such that the MySon goes 9. So this is a non-compact. So for any reason 25, we found a non-compactness for the Q cache approximately. So the question is, what about a compactness? For N less than 24. Is this 25, is the true critical? Is the true critical threshold? And for this question, for the compactness, the first result by Yeanyi and Jing Gan Shung in 2019 is five years ago. And the most last result by Kongdi again five years ago. So they showed for dimension n lessening to nine, okay, between five and nine. Between five and nine, under the assumption of a parcel max for the parallel solver, then you have compactness, okay, is simple. So the solve dimension five to nine. So this is by Li and the shoe and the puzzle mass that the UGSOs. And so the main question I want to give you, I definitely answer is the remaining dimension from 10 to 24. Can we get a compactness in this dimension? And what is the difficulty? Why you cannot push up to 24. And the answer is yes. We can get a complete compactness for the Q current problem after 24, from dimension 10 to 24. So this is going to work with Gong and Kim, and we should finish in a few days. So under the assumption for division index. And the assumption for division N next on twenty five, and the same assumption, the Parcel Mass theorem for the Punditson operator, which I will explain later what is the Parcel mass for the Pandits operator. Under this assumption, then the solution for the solution space for the Q culture problem is compact. So it's uh it's same result like the Yama. Underpositimize and you have a compactness, okay. And you have a couple of things. And we also prove wire varishing. So for n greater than equal to 8, less than 24 if the wire tensor is not 20 up to n minus 8 over 2. In the Jambabic problem, it is n minus 6 over 2. Over 2, and here is m minus 8 over 2. So, under this assumption, then you also have a compactness. So, basically, your compactness either you have parcel mass or you have the wire validation. And for division, that's in equal 2. Can you remind me in the mounting problem? Do you have that upper bound on the end for the corresponding segment? Yeah, this is the same. Yeah, this is the same for the Armabi. This becomes six. No, no, I mean the upper bound on the dimension. Yeah, so 24. It's 24. So if you impose that point-wise assumption, you don't get compactness. You'll also get a compactness. You don't get compactness in higher dimensions necessarily. Just let. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For the wire foundation, I need to check this. I need to check this. Yeah, okay. Uh for the wide finish, I need to check for this 24. So basically what we prove is the exact analog of Courier and the Marker solution for the Market problem. So we prove this for the Q cache problem. Okay, so in the very part, I will explain the proof and what is the key idea and why the w why the same difference uh appear. Uh the key idea proof actually is is very simple. Uh Actually, it's very simple. So, the linearizer equation associated with the Q curvature problem can be transformed into an over-determinate linear problem. It will be an over-determined linear problem. However, because we have some hidden architecture structure for the Pandits or theater, this open-dependent problem has a unique state, has a story. Unique solution. That's a solution. And this is the key. So we didn't see that somehow the pundits operator has some structure. Now for the Yamabi problem, what you get is not an over-determined problem. It's a determined problem. I will explain to you. But for the Q capture, you get an over-determined problem. Now, for over-determined problems, you need Determinable problems, you need some conditions. And you need some error, the condition of the error. And unfortunately, because of the punish or favor, the condition is automatically certified. So this is the key idea. Let me explain to you why how we fund this algebraic structure. Okay, so first let me give you some locations. Locations. So we've got PK is a space of a homogeneous polynomial of a degree K and HK is a harmonic homogeneous polynomial. And W is the standard tanality button for the Q capture problem. So 1 plus X squared minus N over 4. So this is the button. 4. So this is the button. And these are the some constants. k is m minus 6 and d is n 4 over 2 and there's some constant and these are some integers, the integrals. Okay, so let me now explain the positive for the Panisl operator and then I will explain the over-determiner problem. So by Funbo Han and Paol Yang as a result in 2016, so we know that if PG is invariable and if y tensor vanishing order larger or equal to n minus 2, then we have this expression for the green span for the Pandit operator. And so you have x to the 4 minus 7 and 1 plus And one plus, and here there are some functions here, some polynomials here. And then you have this constant, A. And these are the polynomials of a degree K, but they satisfy this condition. Satisfy these two conditions. And you don't have log terms because you have the Y vanish is larger than equal to. why vanish is larger than equal to m minus 2, d minus 2. So you have this expansion of the Green's function. So what it positive means that this A, this A, this constant here is positive. This is our assumption. We assume this constant A is positive. So this is the definition of Definition of uh uh positive mass. So we assume that A is positive. Okay. The A is positive. Okay, so let me now uh show you the key idea of the proof. And uh the the the okay, there are two key ideas. One is the uh using the conformity factor to solve the question term. To solve the correction term, to solve the overdetermined problem. And the second key idea is the possible definites, okay, for the Parkaza projection problem. And in the second part, you see dimension 24. And you see three dimensions. You're going to see 24, 28, and another 34, 32. But 24 gets But 24 gives you the optimal. Okay, so let me expand the rich capture locally. So suppose we have a choice frame symmetrical tortensor and G is exponential if some H and so the rich curve here can be expanded in if some and the E. In the ifsom and the ifsum square. And if some one, the first term is this, and the second term is this whole button. Now, you can also expand the scale capture. Scale capture will be much easier. So it's this term here. And you can use And you can expand the Pandit operator. So you can expand the Q capture and then you expand the Pandit operator. The difference between the Pandis operator and the biharmonic is epsom times L1, Epsom squared times L2. L1 is the most important term. This is the term that That if also the dimension. This is the term. This is the most dangerous term that we need to handle. This is A1HU. So this is the operator depend on H. And so this L1HU is this. So so that you have Lafross R1. R1 is the scalar capital. And you also have a L two operator. L2 operator. Okay. A comp so a company operator is this well-known definition. And interesting, you will compute the bi-half, computer the Pandit's operator, the bi-harm link, and you get a same expression in Brandos. Expansion in Brando's work for the convergence of Yamari farm. And you have this, and you say the L1 appears. The same orbiter appears. So the main problem is we plug in the bubble in and we get L1, L2, and we need to solve. And we need to solve the corrosion term with this L1 Hu. And so this expansion, we expand the Hj in the Harmonic polynomials. And so we get, if I take a video distribution function, you get L1HU is this. Okay? And for this harmonic, for this polynomials, we can do. For this polynomial, we can do decomposition in harmonic polynomials. For this function, we can do a decomposition in the harmonic polynomials. This P, these are the harmonic polynomials. Harmonica, spherical harmonic decomposition. This is spherical harmonic decomposition. And so we can put the edge, you decompose the edge in the spherical harmonic. Harmonics. And so in the end, you also decompose the Poci in the same spherical harmonics. And this is the equation you need to solve. This is a very simple equation. And so this is the Q curvature equation. Need to write a Q curvature equation. I need to write a Q-Capsy equation. And the right-hand side is L1R to some 2s. And this is a harmonic polynomial. And down. L1 is this ordering. So if you compute this, L1 and this is what I get. So this is... Okay. Now, the main question is: can we get a Russian assembly for this problem? I good assemblage for this. This problem. I got a solution for this problem. Now, in the Yamavi case, I'm going to explain to you, it's very easy. You get it right away. Okay? No D, you also have a good solution. But for Q capture, this is different. It's an over-determined problem. Why is this an over-determined problem? Okay. So I want to get a solution of this form. I write the function. Form. I write it a function, right? So I want to get a solution of a polynomial times 1 plus r square minus m minus 2 over 2. And so assume I have a solution of this type, then I get a so-called polynomial might. And this polynomial might, this polynomial might give a polynomial degree F. Polynomial degree F, the new polynomial is degree plus 2. This is for Q capture, you get plus 2 because they have biharmonic. However, for the Yamabi, you get the same degree. For the Yambi, you don't have the positive. So for the Yamabi, you can completely solve the problem. However, for the Q curvature, However, for the Q capture, this mic, this polynomial MIP, is this is degree F plus 2. So you have this difference. So originally we thought it's almost impossible to find a rational symmetry because the form you found is sort of like the overdetermined. It's sort of like an over-determined problem. So, let me show you what this is an over-determined problem. So, you plug in this, L1, this, and in this BI, one plus R score, and this. And you want to look for a solution of gamma j. Of gamma j of this. So you do the expansion, polynomial, the spherical polynomial expansion. And you see the difference here. The difference here is your right-hand side has S plus 4 parameters, but you can only use S plus 3. You can only use S. You can only use S plus 3 prime. You have 1 prime turn S. So, what you get, you plug in and you get a matrix. And this is your matrix. This is a matrix which is diagonal. And then you have one row of off diagonal. And this is one up diagonal. This one up diagonal. So now for the Yamabi problem, it's different. Yamabi is a square matrix. Yamabi is a diagonal. It's upper diagonal. It's just diagonal here and then you have an upper row here. Okay? So basically, what you do, you solve this one first. solve this one first, you plug it into here, you can get soft this one, and there you are. So you can get solved the linear system. But for the Q capture, you cannot do this trick. Because this last time, you have two times here. And you cannot, you cannot. And you cannot you cannot uh say I solved the last term and then pop it into this uh and uh and the solve. This is so this is like Jordan matrix of order one. And for the Yamabi, it's a diagonal matrix. And for Q capital, it's like a Jordan matrix, okay? Order one. And if you do Q6, you will be a Jordan matrix of order. You will be a geometric of order two. You're going to see more, okay, more times. All right, so we cannot solve this problem, you know, because this is an over-determined problem. And, okay, how to solve this over-determined problem? So, originally, we thought there's no way we can find a good solution. And okay, so since we know all the coefficients, so we plug in the coefficients and we compute all the coefficients and we found a recurrency relation between gamma j and gamma j plus 1. And so in the end, you see because you have s plus 4 equations, but s plus 4. Equations, but s plus three parameters. So there is an actual binary condition, a condition. You need to show this algebraical condition. You need to show that after all this, you have two coefficients, and this gamma one and gamma two must satisfy this condition. And there's a lot of computations. Of computations. Unfortunately, after non-computations, of course, you have to use the meta knife to do that computation. And you found the right constellation. Just this because the special structure of L1. And you plug it in, and you found this is the condition you need. Precisely this is the condition. Precisely this condition here. And with this condition, you can find a non-trivial field symmetry for this linear system. Okay? So this is the key idea. Now, once you have found this, so otherwise you can do the expansion of your solution. Of your solution. Because you can now solve, found all the solutions in the rational form. And so you can do the solution and now you can plug this one into the Parasov environment. And this Parson environment will give you some quadratic polynomials. And there will be three quadratic polynomials and give you the critical dimension. But this is the key idea. This is the simple. This is the key idea. This is the simple constellation algebra. And for example, if k is 2 and x is 0, and we solve this problem with this right-hand side, and you see that these two coefficients cannot be arbitrary, must be exactly this form, so that you have a good zonal, you have a rationalism. And fortunately, we compute the error for the Q capture. This is the coefficient you found. And this coefficient, precisely for these two coefficients, and you can find a rational solution. And for other coefficients, if you don't have if you don't have a good relation, the solution you found will be irrational. And then it will be impossible to compute. Be impossible to compute the possible identity, the path of environment. And so you get the rational function for the Posite 200. And now we use the Parsaf environment. And this has already been introduced by Jesse in his talk. This is the same one. This is the same one. You take a ball and you compute this boundary. This is the same pathos of invariant. And okay, so now what we do is we have a productive sequence and we expand the solution around the nanoparpo. And so the next order equation is. Is this process A, which solves this problem with L1, HK, W. And these are the harmonic problems, these are the summation, we can decompose this in harmonic polynomials. And for this one, we have a solution. I just showed you. We know how to solve this problem. We have a rational solution. So you found this solution and then you showed that with many terms can be controlled. The remaining term can be controlled. Okay, so now you plug in this one into your path of environment. You plug in this, you have organized to get the cojective form. And so you have basically Basically you you get get you you have three kinds three uh project forms uh uh L1 and L2 and L3 and and you can show as I'm going to show later these three polynomials are positive definite for dimension n less than equal to 24. So for dimension n less than 24 N less than 24, this coefficient, this coefficient forms non-negative, positive. And this precisely is the critical number, 24 APA. So maybe now show the computation of the cognitive polynomials. And so this you plug it into the definition and you compute what? What and as I said before, the reason we can compute all this explicitly is because we have a solution is rational. You know all the coefficients. So you just plug it into coefficients, plug it into the parcel environment, and you compute this project form. And so, okay. Okay, and I will not talk about this stability operator. So, this is some strange cancellation inside this quadratic form. So, and so we compute R2 and the rich times rich. So, this is the quadratic forms. And unlike the Jambaker problem, we have these three new terms come, which is L K, H K, L M, H M, and L. L M H M and Delta H K Delta H M Delta Square H K Data Square H M and to solve so in the inquiry markers and shown the identified factors for L K and the decay you can find by spectral commons. But they don't need to write down these eigenfactors because because uh uh uh they share the same argument. But for Q calculate problem, we have some some new terms which come like this almost like Laplace times Laplace and the gradient times gradient. This is Laplace times Laplace. And to do this, we need the expression of this eigenvectors and we use conformal KD factors to fund the And uh so you decompose uh the the polynomial stages space into three part. So one, so you see this one is the Lafassis where the is the almost like a Lafass equals zero here and this is a difficulty equal zero and so on. So this kind of decomposition of a symmetric total has been has Has appeared in many other works. Okay, so you decompose your polynomial into three kinds of polynomials, into these three spaces. And these three spaces give you three polynomials, quadratic polynomials. And for the first one, this comes from the hashing of the Hamilton function, and this one. function and this one is possible definite if n is equal to 34 32. So for n equal to 24 of course it's possible definite. And for the second one it's a possible definite for n less than 28 and for the last one is positive definite for n less than 24. So last one is diffusion 0. Last one is diffusion zero, diversion free. And this is exactly the polynomial that I use with the Saul in the construction. It's the same polynomial that pojo polynomial I use. And you see that for compactness, and you get this polynomial for non-compactness, you also use this polynomial. For non-compactness, you use the negative direction. Use the negative direction. For n greater than 25, and this one is no longer positive definite. So there's a negative direction which you can use to construct this solution. So and so this is a relation between the polypa construction, and this is exactly the Uh uh the relation and the our construction is exactly this form and the solution is the Hij is of this form for ngu equal to 25. Okay, finally some outer line what proof. This lot of standard tech standard technique like isolated. Technique like isolated scintillator and isolated simple problem. This all this is classical for the Yamabi and this classical for the Q capture and so on. And so this has been derived by Ni and Shung in 2019. So you just use the same idea. So you have find many isolated singularity and then you use the possible Use now. Here you use a positive max to exclude infrared value. And then you do local expansion. And so then you have the because we solve the needle rest problem, we get the wire finishing theorem. Okay, so and this you rule out the non-simple block using the Poisson math. So I will, because all So I will, because all this part is a standard, it's basically composed Yaba rep. It's similar to Yamba reproduction. Okay, and so for the last two minutes, let me just give you a summary of the results and some future problems. So we prove the C4 compactness for the solution of a Q creation problem. For the solution of a Q current problem for the region 5 and the 24. And for we end with the 25 and this is a non-compact, non-comparisons for the Q capital problem. And to prove the comparison, we establish the wire fanishing theorems for dimension and with 8 and 24. Now, Now, I can answer that question. Your question are now. Okay, this is still open for NGL25. Okay. So the fundamental obstacle to proving the OI variation is this low-gander solution in explicit form, especially if we only consider the analytical property of the inner problem. And we observe a heated structure for the panels of problem, which makes the solution directional. This is the The rational form. This is the main message today. The Paramus orphan has some special property, algebra property, so that the linear problem has rational forms. And the analysis of the Pahasa for projective form is more complex than the Yawabi. Some further questions. And so the idea of using conformal caning factor candidate operator. Kenny factor Kenny operator to solve the Nilras equation than the started energy species very robust. So we expect this kind of a similar cancellation to be, can also be seen in high-order Q curve, like six, like Q6 and the Q8, and also the boundary value problem and the fraction Yang RB problems. And one question is Is which we do understand is why this dimension 4 appeared for Yamabi and also for the Q calculation. The same dimension. It's the same dimension. Now, what's the relation here? Why this 24 appeared in both problems? Now, I want to show you that one result which we export this part. Export this part is for the fractional Yamabi, you can get a different dimension. Fractional Yamabi, you can compute. There's a number which is explicitly computed. And for gamma greater than this number, it's 24. And the critical dimension is 24. For gamma less than this number, the critical dimension is 23. 23. So one dimension less. Well, we don't have the compactness for this year. It's the non-compactness. So somehow if we go to the fractional MAVI problem, which is, again, is another compound factor, component operator. And now you see a difference of the dimension will decrease your gamma, decrease the fractional operator. And this gamma is the. And this gamma is the operator of your fractional dissenter. Gamma equals one is the Yama, gamma equal two is the Q capital. So this result says if you want to say different dimension, you should really, so because we say the Q capital and market they are the same. So really you have to go down and go down this number to say different. This number to say different. I think I time is up, okay? Thank you.
