Letting me speak today. So I'll be giving kind of an overview of some results from a series of what's now, I think, five papers, some of which is joint work with Loya Risa and Mark Cromford. And in sort of keeping with the theme of the workshop, I'll sort of try to give you a mix of some things that are sort of pure operator systems and flavor and then some applications that I think are kind of compelling. Think are kind of compelling. So Matt told us on the first day, he reminded us what the definition of an abstract operator system is. So you have a star vector space, and you have a family of cones that are compatible in a nice way, and an Archimedean matrix order unit. And I'll plug in a little advertisement that the field, if you take it to be the complex numbers, you get a complex operator. The complex numbers, you get a complex operator system. If you take it to be the real numbers, then you get a real operator system. So it's kind of the same definition either way. But for most of today's talk, we'll work with the complex numbers. I'll let you know when things are true in the real case, if we know about it. And then we have the Choiepros theorem, which says if you're an abstract operator system, then you're unitally, completely order isomorphic to a concrete operator system. Concrete operator system. So, in some sense, the abstract and concrete operator systems are kind of the same, but it's really only up to complete order isomorphism. So, a complete order isomorphism a priori is just going to preserve this structure that you see here. And maybe there's some other structures in your operator system that you would like to be preserved, but that's not necessarily going to be preserved by just a unital computer. By just a unit open the order embedding. So let me give you an example. Let's say we have a concrete operator system that contains a non-trivial projection. Well, we could forget the concrete embedding and just think of it as an abstract operator system. So if we just think of it as an abstract operator system, we're going to remember that it's a positive element, but a priori we don't know. A priori, we don't know if the fact that this rejection will be sort of remembered. And in fact, it's never the case that it's always remembered. So if we construct the universal C-star cover for your operator system, if you look through Kirschberg and Wasserman's proof of the existence of this cover, one way you can construct it is by taking the direct sub of all UCP maps into matrix algebras. And now, one way to get a UCP map into a matrix algebra is we'll take the one-by-one matrices, so just look at states. So if P is a projection, there's a state that sends P to zero and a state that sends P to one. That's a non-trivial projection. So if you take a convex combination of these, you can show that in the universal cover, the spectrum is the entire interval from 0 to 1. So that is not a projection in the universal cover. So there's always some C-star cover where you're non-trivial. Star cover where your non-trivial projection gets mapped to something that is not a projection. So that is not preserved by every C-star cover. But it is preserved by some. So another C-star cover we care about is the C-star envelope. So C-star envelope has the nice universal property that whenever I have some other C-star cover, there's a star homomorphism from that C-star cover down to the C-star envelope. Down to the C star envelope that sends the copy of S in this cover to the copy of S in the envelope. And because that's a star homomorphism, once you have some C star cover that sends this P to a projection, then you apply this star homomorphism and that's going to map projections to projections, and so you have a projection in the C star off. So that C star cover always remembers the projections. Okay. Okay, so the C-Star envelope remembers these things that are this sort of multiplicative structure that was forgotten by some of the other C-star covers. And so maybe one way to define a projection in an operator system is to just say, well, it's a projection in the C-star envelope. And unfortunately, it's not always super easy to know what the C-star envelope of a given operator system is. Sometimes that's not so obvious. So the question. Obvious. So the question that we're interested in is: can we identify those elements which are projections by just looking at the abstract data, just looking at the things that you get in the definition of an abstract operator system, positive cones and order units? And we have some reasons for thinking about this. There's some applications that I think are kind of compelling. So here's some examples. So here's some examples. One is we can give an order characterization, an operator system characterization, of the quantum and quantum commuting correlations. And this was sort of the main motivation for exploring this. So that's one thing I'll tell you about as we go through the talk. If we get to it, you can also reformulate Zauner's conjecture and the mutually unbiased basis problem purely in terms of operator systems. So these are open problems in quantum information. Problems in quantum information theory about projections and matrix algebras once you sort of reformulate them a little bit. So, we have a reformulation of that purely in terms of operator systems. And if you're interested in C star algebras, if you can characterize projections, it turns out you can characterize other kinds of things as well. So, if you're more interested in C star algebras than operator systems, there's maybe some interesting applications there. So, I'll kind of mention these things as we go. Mention these things as we go, depending on how quickly or slowly I get through the talk. Okay, so to characterize these projections, the place where we start, sort of the secret ingredient to this, is thinking about compressions. So if I start with a concrete operator system and some projection P, I can always take my system and compress by P. So I form the compression. form the compression of that system. This phi sub p is the compression map that takes the system to its compression by p, and it will denote that as just pvp. So this map has some kernel and so you could identify just as a vector space pvp with the quotient space v mod j. And the positive cone that you would want to put on this quotient space is the set of elements, the set of cosets, I guess. Elements, a set of cosets, I guess, for which this compression by the projection, or this will be the P's on the diagonal here, that compression is positive. So this is all concrete at this point, but we'd like to be able to somehow characterize this cone as kind of a starting point. Okay, so it turns out you can decide whether or not these kinds of compressions, these PXPs, are positive by just Pxp's are positive by just looking at the order structure in the operator system that you're given, assuming that P is an element of your system. So if P is an element of an operator system that happens to be a projection, then PXP is positive if and only if for every epsilon positive there exists a T positive such that this thing right here is positive. And the proof is sort of elementary. One direction is really easy. Sort of elementary one direction is really easy, and then the other is a computation you can't do in your operator system, but you can tell what the outcome is by just looking at the elements, the positive elements of the system you're given. Just an example to kind of motivate this odd-looking proposition. Let's say I'm working in the 2x2 matrices, so let's consider this element X and this projection. And this projection. Clearly, if I compress x by p, I get 0, which is positive. So the identity minus p, let's call it q, that would be this matrix. If I just add t times identity minus p, I get this matrix right here, which is never positive. But if I throw in an epsilon p, then I end up with this matrix. And if I choose my t large enough, this would be my t, I get this, which is always positive. I get this, which is always positive. So you can sort of demonstrate how the definition works in this toy example here. So all the little elements of this are sort of necessary here. Okay, so this relation gives you a way of kind of abstractly defining the compression of your system by an element p. So if I now have an abstract operator system and some positive Operator system and some positive contraction, which we hope is going to be a projection. We can define the following positive cone. So Q is the perp of my projection. So you look at the self-adjoint elements for which for every epsilon positive, there's a T positive, such that that's positive. And I'll let J be the, so this in general is not going to be a proper cone. So I let J be the span of the things that are both positive and negative. The things that are both positive and negative, and then I can define abstractly the compression of my system by p. So it's I take the system mod JP just as a vector space, and I give it this positive cone here, and p is now the unit of my compression. In the theorem, well, first theorem will look at if I do this abstract compression thing and I happen to know. And I happen to know that P is a projection in some representation of my system, then this quotient that I just defined is isomorphic to the concrete compression that you get inside of the of H. Okay, so we know how to detect when compression by a projection is positive. But up to this point, we're still kind of assuming that we know P is a projection. And well, you can play with this definition a little bit just to sort of see how it works. So, if you take your P to be the identity, for instance, and then you apply the definition, your positive cone is just this right here, which is really the positive cone you started with. So, of course, compressing the operator system by the identity shouldn't change anything, and so you get this quotient is just the space you started with. And likewise, if you took your projection to be zero and If you took your projection to be zero and you do this construction, you get a trivial space. Obviously, compression by zero ought to be zero. If you take a positive contraction whose norm is strictly less than zero, there's a little bit of work that goes into this, but then your abstract compression is zero as well. And that's kind of a good sign because if the norm of p is strictly less than one, there's no way. Norm of P is strictly less than 1, there's no way that this is actually a projection. So you would expect something to go wrong whenever you do this. Okay, so we have this notion of compressing. And now that we know how to compress things by a projection, we can figure out which elements of the system actually are projections. So, to motivate the definition, again, let's assume we've got an operator system. Again, let's assume we've got an operator system and an element p that happens to be a projection. So it's a concrete system. I'll let q be the perfect of my projection. And now if I take an element in my system, b of h, I can now decompose h as the range of p, direct sum, the range of the p pert. And then I can think of x as a 2 by 2 matrix in this way. And now I consider. And now I consider the compression of this 2x2 matrix where I just put x's in all the entries. And I'm going to compress by p direct sum p per. And you can check by thinking about this form right here that that gives you this. And then staring at this equation here and this equation here, you see that, oh, clearly, x is positive if and only if this compression over here is positive. So, whenever I compress this by this, I get sort of the same order structure that I started with. And this is sort of the key for identifying projections. So, this compression is something that you can do in an abstract way just using the order structure of the operator system. And that's going to give us our characterization. So, I'm going to call it positive contraction p. Call a positive contraction P in some operator system, now we're an abstract operator system. An abstract projection if this map is a complete ordering bedding where my map is I take X to this matrix XXXX and then I compress by P direct sum Q. And the compression is in that abstract sense I mentioned earlier where you do a quotient and you define that our common. So you're only using Common. So you're only using the data of the operator system that you started with, just the order structure. And with this definition in mind, we can prove the following. The following are equivalent to P is an abstract projection if and only if there exists a representation of the system in the sum P of H for which I of P is a projection. But then once you have a projection and some representation, as I said at the In some representation, as I said at the beginning of the talk, you can then push that forward to the C-star envelope. So, if and only if P is a projection of the C-star envelope. A little bit about the proof of this. So, in the proof, we sort of do this manually. We take a representation of our operator system and we tweak it to force the image of P to be a projection in this kind of manual way. In this kind of manual way. Let's say your operator system has two projections, P and P'. We have no idea how to sort of tweak the representation to make both of those things projections. We're not really sure how to do that manually. But it doesn't matter because once each of those projections, P and P prime, have some representation where they're projections, then they're both projections in the C star on board. So this definition gives you a way of sort of unambiguous. Gives you a way of sort of unambiguously identifying the set of elements in an operator system that are projections. And then another advertisement, you can do all this with real operator systems as well. The definitions are the same. And we do it all through complexification. So you start with a real operator system and you complexify it and you check that the complexification satisfies this theorem. So this can be done in the real case too. So, this can be done in the real case too. Okay, so now that we know what a projection is, we can start to build up some of these applications that I talked about. So, just knowing what a projection is, it turns out you can figure out, you can sort of abstractly characterize the quantum commuting correlations purely in operator system language. So, I'm going to define a QC operator system to be one that's spanned by abstract. One that's spanned by abstract projections in that system, which I label as QABXY, the same way we label correlations. And I ask that the Q's satisfy the non-signaling correlations that we always sort of impose on our quantum correlations. So if I fix X and Y and I sum over A and B, that gives me the identity of the operator system. And I have well-defined marginal operators. So if I sum over A and B, and I, So if I sum over b here, that gives me an operator EAX. And this sum does not depend on the choice of y. And similarly, over here. So I ask that my projections in my operator system satisfy these non-signaling conditions. It turns out that once you have this, it's automatically the case that your QABXY decomposes as the product of EAX and FY. Product of EAX and FBY, and these elements commute with each other. So that's using the fact that these are projections. So it's kind of a little exercise to just sort of write it down. This is a PVM, so each of the QABXYs are mutually orthogonal. And so then you just write down this sum times this sum, and you see that all you're left with is QABXY. What is commutation? Oh, that if I, in the C-star envelope, let's say, this decomposes as the product of these operators. And these are things inside the system as well. Okay, so that's how I define a QC operator system. And it turns out that P is a quantum commuting correlation if and only if there exists one of these QC operator systems and a state. These QC operator systems and a state on it such that PABXY is obtained from the correlation in this way. So we have an operator system way of defining quantum correlations. And another advertisement, you can do this in the real case as well. So you can abstractly characterize real quantum commuting correlations. And it's sort of using this kind of definition, you can easily check. This kind of definition, you can easily check that the real quantum commuting correlations and the complex quantum commuting correlations are the same. Yes? Can you represent projections in the same? Yes. So you do this in the C star envelope. And that's important that you can do that, otherwise you're kind of stuck. So there's one application. Now that we know about a projection. Now that we know what a projection is, another thing I'll just say briefly, because I haven't really done anything with this, so maybe last week or something, Vern Paulson pointed out to me that once you know what projections are in your operator system, you also know what the unitaries are. So if I have an operator system with an element u, I could form this matrix inside of my operator system at the second level of my operator system. And that's a projection if and only if u is a unitary. So if you're interested. Is a unitary. So if you're interested in the unitary elements of your operator system, you can characterize them through this projection machinery. And you can play with this trick and characterize other kinds of things. So let's say you're interested in Kuntz algebras. Let's say if you have a family of isometry satisfying the Kuntz relations, well, those relations are hold if and only if this is a projection where this SI vect. Where this SIVEC is the row matrix S1 through SN. So you can characterize things like that. And you can modify this trick and maybe identify other interesting things like Kunz-Krieger E-families and stuff like that. So I haven't explored this much, but this might be interesting to people to think about C-star algebras. Okay, so, and so on. Now, I said that you could also talk about quantum correlations. So, with a quantum correlation, you need to know that you can implement the correlation with operators in, let's say, a matrix algebra. So, I need some kind of machinery to sort of restrict the dimension of the Hilbert space that my operator system acts on. And one way to do this is by going through k-minimal operator systems. Operator systems. And I'll kind of tweak the older definition of k-minimal system in the following way. So fix an integer k, and you can define what I'm going to call a k AOU space. So a AOU space we learned on the first day is just a star vector space with a positive cone on the permissions of the first level and an Archimedean matrix order unit. Matrix order unit. A K-AOU space, instead of having a cone at the first level, you have just the cone at the k-th level. And it has some compatibility, so if I conjugate by scalar square matrices, that keeps me inside the cone. So that's a K-AOU space. And if I start with a K-AOU space, I can define canonical maximal and minimal operator system structures on packs. So I can define the rest of the cone. The rest of the cones, and it's not unique, but there's sort of a maximal way to do it and a minimal way to do it. And one way to get the minimal structure is to look at all the elements with the property that whenever you compress them to the kth level, so you're starting at the nth level, whenever you compress to the kth level, you get something positive. So that's the k-min structure. I could tell you the k-max structure, but I won't be using it today. Today. By the way, you can do this in the real case too. And as David mentioned, you actually have to be very careful here. If you have a real operator system with a skew adjoint element, then for k equal 1, so the minimal structure, you don't necessarily get a proper matrix of merging. So this is why we don't have a min functor on real operator systems. Okay, so we have this k min. Okay, so we have this k-minimal structure, and this is equivalent to the k-minimal structure defined by Ixophili and collaborators in her thesis. So let's say I start with an operator system, so I have all the matrix levels. I'm going to call it K minimal if it's isomorphic to the K min of the KAOU space I get by just forgetting everything except for the kth cone. And a theorem, which is really Zobli's theorem, we just relabeled things. V is k minimal if and only if there exists a unital complete order embedding of v into the continuous matrix-valued functions on some compact Hausdorff space. And well, really, all we do is we show that this K-A-O-U space thing I defined earlier in the K-min cones is the same as this O-min structure. It's the same as this O-min structure that Xablé defined in her thesis. And then we use a theorem that she proved. But one thing you can do with this, once you know that this happens, you can think about the C-star envelope. So we care about the C-star envelope because that's where all our projections live. For instance, if we want to think about correlations. So if I have a, sorry, I shouldn't say KO space, if I have a K-minimal operator system. A K-minimal operator system, well, I guess that's here. The C star envelope, turns out you can embed that into an L infinity direct sum of matrix algebras. And there's sort of a uniform bound on the size of the matrix algebras. They're no larger than size k. And now we can use this to talk about quantum correlations. Quantum correlations. So if I start with a quantum commuting operator system again, let's say it happens to be k-minimal, I have projections inside the C-star envelope, but I can think of those projections as living in here. So they're direct sums of projections on some small matrix algebras with a uniform output. Okay, so I'm going to define a quantum operator system to be just a QC operator system the same way I defined it. QC operator system, the same way I defined it earlier, but I ask that it's k-minimal for some k. And we prove that a correlation is a quantum correlation if and only if there exists a quantum operator system, a k minimal QC operator system, and a state that gives you the correlation in this way. And again, I'll advertise this. This also works in the real case as well. So you can do this for real quantum correlations. Correlations and compare the, you can easily show that the complex quantum correlations are the same as the real quantum correlations by looking at these structures. This is the same as taking your original one for quantum commuting and then doing co-inspective? Sort of. Well, not so if you start with a quantum commuting correlation. Start with a quantum commuting correlation and you take o min k of that, you might lose your projections. So instead, what I'm saying is I have a quantum commuting operator system that happens to be k minimal, that happens to equal omin k. So one use of this, so now we have quantum commuting and quantum correlations, and we're interested in separating those sets. And we're interested in separating those sets. So that was the big consequence of the MIPSTA, one of the big consequences of MIPSTAR equal RE. We know that there exists a quantum commuting correlation, which is not a quantum correlation. So we should be able, what this reformulation says, is there should exist some quantum commuting operator system that can't be approximated with these quantum operator systems. Quantum operator systems with these K-minimal QC operator systems. So there's some way to think about this in terms of operator systems. A couple of more applications, some more recent things that I've thought about. So there's an open problem in quantum information about seek POVMs. So this is maybe not the usual definition of it, but an equivalent formulation is. Equivalent formulation is: you have a seek POVM in dimension D if you have projections P1 through Pd squared in the D by D matrices, which satisfy these relations. So when you do this sum, scaled by 1 over D, you get the identity. And if you take one of the PJ, let's say, and conjugate by one of the other projections, you get a scalar multiple of the projection on the outside. In the usual definition, you In the usual definition, you take these to be rank ones, and so when you conjugate rank ones like this, you're going to get a scalar multiple of the thing on the outside. But you can check that this is equivalent to that formulation. And it turns out you can characterize or sort of reformulate the problem in terms of operator systems using this abstract structure we've defined now. So there exists a seek POV. There exists a seek POVM in dimension D if and only if there is a D minimal operator system V spanned by projections satisfying these same relations here and here. And this relation on the bottom, okay, so these are abstract projections. So that's one thing that you need this machinery for. Once you know that you have abstract projections, you know they're projections in the C-star envelope. C-star envelope. And so we know how to compress elements of our system by projections. So relations like this are also things that you can determine by just looking at the order structure of your operator system. So all of this is just looking at abstract operator system structure. And I guess I should have said, since not everyone may be familiar with this problem, this was conjectured around 1999, I think, by Zauner. By Zauner, that a seek POVM exists in every dimension, and it's been checked for a lot of dimensions. So they can write down what they are for like, I don't know, 200 dimensions or something like this. And then they've done numerical experiments. They think they must exist up to, I don't know, d equal 1,000 or something like this. But there's no proof that they exist in every dimension. There's not even a proof that they exist in infinitely many dimensions. So this has been. Dimensions. So, this has been one of these sort of embarrassingly hard problems because it's just a problem about matrix algebras. But we can reformulate it in this language. And there's a similar theorem about mutually unbiased bases. So I'm not going to describe that problem. But there's another open problem in quantum information about projections satisfying similar relations. And in this case, it's known that there's a solution in each. It's known that there's a solution anytime the dimension is a prime number, a power of a prime, so p to the alpha for some prime p. But any other dimension, it's totally open. So in particular, they don't know if in dimension d equals 6, if this is true. And they've been working on it since the 80s, so it's hard for some reason. But you can do a similar thing and characterize it all in terms of operator systems. So, the last thing I'll mention: you can use this machinery to construct sort of universal examples of quantum commuting operator systems. And the way you do that, so this is a single quantum commuting operator system, which gives you all of the quantum correlations in a particular scenario. So, you fix the number of questions for Alice and Bob, and the answers. Of questions for Alice and Bob, and answers for Alice and Bob. You apply states to the generators of the system, and it gives you the entire correlation set. And you can construct it from kind of basic ingredients as an inductive limit of these abstract operator systems. So we have a way of constructing this thing without dealing with tensor products or C-star algebras or anything like that. It's a little bit intractable, of course, is the problem. Of course, is the problem. So you can follow the definition, and there's basic ingredients there, but they're put together in a complicated way so that it's not so clear how to calculate something once you have this. But in any case, you can construct it. And you can do a similar thing with the quantum and quantum approximate operator systems. There's sort of a universal quantum approximate operator system. You can construct something, well, a family of things that kind of play that role for quantum correlations. Kind of play that role for quantum correlations. And so in principle, if you want to find another solution to zero-sense problem, you just have these two operator systems that you need to compare. So it'd be nice if there was a way to use that to come up with a new proof of that separation. But like I said, this inductive limit gives you something that's a little bit intractable. So it'd be nice if we could sort of make this a little bit cleaner and easier to analyze. And you can do the same thing with. And you can do the same thing with the seek POVM problem and the MUB problem. You can do this inductive limit process, and it gives you a matrix-ordered operator space, which satisfies the conditions of this theorem right here. The only problem is I don't know that that matrix order space has a proper matrix ordering. So it's not so clear that at the end of this construction you get an actual operator system. You get an actual operator system. If you do, or if you can prove that it's always possible to get an operator system from this construction, then you solve the CPOB problem. So it's, I think, kind of an interesting idea that maybe there's a way to solve this intractable problem by just proving that they exist through constructing these operator systems. But there's still more work to be done if that route has any hope of working out. That's all I have. Thank you for your attention. All right, thank you. Travis, does anyone have questions for our speaker? Yeah, so do you have examples for example of operator systems for which you don't understand the system, but for example but using your machine learning you can say that there are no non-trivial projections inside of them. I haven't tried to think about that. Oh, good. This is like a common question since I wasn't sure. Yeah, yeah. That's a good idea. So the other quantum correlations are typically written as these objects as this max tensor for OBM algebra. Is it kind of saying the states or the spaces are the same for these two objects? Is that right? Yeah. Yeah, this universal thing that I construct. I construct, it doesn't involve tensor products or anything at all, but it ends up being the same operator system as that tensor product that's used. That's an alternate construction of that tensor product, I guess. But the US's question, so could you think of an example where you don't have any non-trivial projections in your operator system, but you do in the system? Yeah, I don't know. I don't have any, I've never not really thought about along those lines before. Maybe the consistency to this to this matrices and this BCBC. Yeah, maybe if you um do the C star algebra trick I talked about with the matrix that gives you isometries, maybe that that does it for you. That does it for you. Are there any other questions? If not, let's thank Jeff Sean. And the next talk starts at 4.15, which is in nine minutes. I think we're going to be a shorter time. Yeah, no, I think it's last time. I mean, perfect time. Yeah, I'm just curious about some of these projection stuff with respect to non-compromising problems. Maybe there's some ways to use other problems. Yeah, I'm not convinced that my definition is the most tractable definition because you get one way to characterize the model. Characterizing the bottom. When you have to do that, get more. I guess we have a few months right now.
