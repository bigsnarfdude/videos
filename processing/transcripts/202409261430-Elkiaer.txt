This will be based on joint work with Sanas Toya. I'll talk about two different flavors of rigidity. Does it work? Yes. Oi, I love the lunch. Alright. I'll talk about property T and weak property T, both with respect to a class of finite spaces here denoted by curly E. So what's that? So for group, property T is the property that whenever I have an isometric representation on a space in the class, any net of almost invariant unit vectors must approach the solution. Invariant unit vectors must approach the subspace of invariant vectors. And here, by almost invariant, I mean that how much the vectors fail to be invariant tends to zero in an appropriate sense. And by approach, I mean that the distance to the subspace tends to zero. Weak property TE is then the property that whenever I have an isometric representation on a space in the task E, then which admits a net of almost invariant in the vectors, then there has to be a non-syllabular vector. So property TE was introduced in this setting of groups equal to Manic Bases by Bada Firm and Galando-Noneau and has received a lot of attention since then. On the other hand, for weak property TE, you'll not find a lot of interest in the literature or the books acting on Banner spaces. It is, however, interesting because it's sometimes the same. So as the name suggests, we always have the property t implies weak property t. When the converse implication holds, that depends on general on the class. General class. One condition you can put on the class that ensures that that condition or that behavior false is that the class is stable with quotients, so that covers in particular the class of Hilbert spaces, in which case we'll recognize these as equivalent definitions of cash drain-hilfer T. It does not cover the class of LP spaces for P0 equal to 2. But I'll just mention very briefly that when the group is countably discrete, this implication does hold for the class of P by recent work of Peisl. So what I did was an So, what I did with SANAS is to replace groups with Banach algebras. So, when we talk about Banach algebras, instead of isometric representations, we'll talk about essential bimodals. Instead of almost invariant vectors, we'll talk about strictly almost central vectors, and instead of invariant, we'll talk about essential vectors. So, then property TE for Banach algebra A reads: for every essential A by module on a space in the class, any net of strictly almost A central unit vectors must approach. Central unit vectors must approach the subspace of A central vectors. And the big version then is that whenever I have an essential A bimodule on a space in the class, which admits and strictly almost A central net of unit vectors, then there has to be a non-zero a central vector. So these definitions, they build upon and generalized definitions by Becker and Unf of property T for C-star algebras. And the meager version here goes back to work by Kant on property T. So now a natural question to ask is if property T for a group is the same as property T for an appropriate Banach algebra. And we showed that the answer to that question is yes. In fact, we have this perfect correspondence that a group has property T if and only if its E pseudofunctional algebra has property T and similarly for weak property T where here the E pseudo-functional algebra G F D of G that's the completion of the one with respect That's the completion of the one with respect to all of the isometric representations on a space in a cluster. So that generalizes and solved by Beggar, showing that root has Kachran's property t, if and only if it's universal boots, this algebra has property t, respectively, root property t. Now to go from left to right, actually any pseudo functional algebra can do, so we can put in any class E prime here, is coming from right to left, that's the difficult part, and here it helps if E prime is big enough. If E' is big enough, to be precise, if E' contains E, then we can go from right to left. Now, we are particularly interested in the class of LP spaces, in which case here on the right-hand side, rather than looking at the pseudo-functional problem with respect to all isometric representations on any LP space or even a larger class, it would be really nice if it would suffice to look just at the left regular representation. To look just at the left regular representation of P of D, which would give us here the so-called P pseudo-functional algebra. So, by what I just said, if D has property TLP, we get that the P pseudo-functional algebra has TLP. The question is if we can come back, and we show that the answer to that question is yes, when we put this discrete, which again generalizes a result by Becker and Un, showing that at this week group has advanced property T if and only if its reduced group salgebra has property T. And so, with that, I'll just leave you with a very, very short glance at the relevant references highlighting here at the bottom the paper on which this talk is based. Thank you.
