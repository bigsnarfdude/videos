And so, my talk will revisit some early developments in the new language that offers this double zero property. And I'll also try to give some unexpected results and some maybe new and tentative consequences of this property, this double zero. I will start by I will start by briefly revisiting in the continuous case the definition of the variational principle and how to get from the variational principle to multi-time order like orange equations. And I'll show two different routes. And that will slowly start to bring the exterior derivative that Frank mentioned repeatedly, this closure property, and then the double zeros into the picture. Then I'll Then I'll emphasize how to use this to construct examples. So, these won't be new examples, these will be some of our earliest examples, but I think by framing them in this double zero language, the construction makes a lot more sense. I'll mostly work on the continuous side. I won't mention anything that's fully discrete, but I will also mention the semi-discrete case where also this construction using double zeros is quite relevant. Using double zeros is quite relevant. And then finally, I want to show you some surprising connections. By comparing these two roots to the multitime or Lagrange equations and by emphasizing the double zero, I think there are some interesting consequences from the multi-ton theory. So let's start with the basics. I will do my theory for the one-form case in the continuous sites. Continuous sites, sites. So you can think of this if you're used to the Hamiltonian side. You have a Liouville integrable system with a lot of commuting flows. So each of these flows gets its own time variable. Here on the image, I have just T1 and T2, but there could be more. And because the flows commute, it makes sense to think of solutions as being a function not just of a timeline, but of this space spent by all the time variables, multi-time. And as far as And as Frank says, in hindsight, the logical way of combining Lagrangians in this setting is to combine them into a differential form. So if we somehow have Lagrangian's Li representing each of the individual flows, so Li corresponds to the Ti flow, then we combine them into one form, Li, dTi, and some overall i's. And then the variational principle, which I've labeled clearly Lagrangian principle. I've labeled clearly Lagrangian principle here because there's no closeness yet in the picture. So I think for a multi-form, it's kind of an incomplete definition, but it is a very good variational principle to start with. It's to say, well, if we take any curve in multi-time, like the dotted line here, then we have a one-form. We can integrate it over this curve. So this must always be a critical point with respect to variations of Q. So Q is our. Variations of Q. So Q is our function that takes values in multi-time and maps into the configuration space. So if you take variations of Q only, this must be critical no matter which curve we choose. And then there are some obvious choices of the curve. We could take a horizontal one here. So in the Ti direction, then the integral sees only the DTI component of the one form. So if we choose a horizontal curve, we get essentially the usual classical action. Usual classical action of L1, and similarly, if we take a curve in a different coordinate direction, we get all the individual actions of each Li. But of course, most curves are not straight lines in coordinate directions. So clearly, this variational principle is stronger than just taking the individual Lagrangians. And this is reflected in the multi-time or Lagrange equations. So I like writing them in terms of variational derivatives. Of variational derivatives. And I like writing partial differential derivatives of Q with this multi-index notation. So sometimes I will just write Q with a subscript I or a subscript di, that's the partial derivative of Q with respect to this variable. But a lot of the time, I will write Q subscript capital I, or you should think of this capital I as a multi-index. It represents a string of TI variables. So it could be. Variables, so it could be a very high mixed partial derivative, or it could be empty. If i is the empty string, then qi is just q and then the variational derivatives. Well, those are essentially the usual Euler Lagrange expression if you have Lagrangian depending on higher derivatives. So, if there's, if I here is empty, if this is just with respect to q, then this sum is the usual Eural Lagrange expression in one dimension. Like an expression in one dimension. And the delta operation or the delta over delta has this subscript i to emphasize that in this case we're only adding derivatives in the ti direction. And so the multi-timorial agrange equations that are equivalent to this variational principle from the last slides, they come in two in a set of two types of equations. Of two types of equations. The first are the usual Euler-Lagrange equations where you have just one variational derivative equal to zero. It can be with respect to Q or it can be with respect to certain derivatives of Q. But I think all of those are essentially the usual Euler-Lagrange equations. And then you get some additional conditions that express to a certain degree the compatibility between your LI and LG. And Frank mentioned, well, showed one way very briefly how to derive them and mentioned this other approach of stepped surfaces, so stepped curves in this case. So the reaction principle says for any choice of smooth curve, the action should be critical. Now that's a lot of curves to consider, but you can vastly reduce the set of curves you need to consider by doing approximation of. Consider by doing approximation arguments. In particular, you can approximate any smooth curve by a staircase curve. And if you make the steps finer and finer, visually it converges, and also the action integral will converge. So if you have criticality on all of these stepped curves, then this will imply criticality on all other curves. And you can do another simplification by observing that it's always sufficient to take variations on a very small support because you can combine a lot of those variations. Because you can combine a lot of those variations into a bigger variation. So, really, we need to look at this locally. So, all we need to consider are corners of stepped curves, like L-shaped corners. And then we can more or less do the usual calculus of variations considering these two straight pieces forming the corner separately. So, first, this is for Si, so the piece in the Ti direction. So, the piece in the ti direction. We take a variation of L, just by Leibniz rule, we expand this where i goes over all derivatives that contain are contained in l. And then we don't want to do integration by parts, but we can only do this in the ti direction because that's the only direction we're integrating. So, if that's why I expand the sum here to consider. To consider only those multi-indices i that do not encode any ti derivatives, and then I manually add in the sum over the ti derivatives. So the derivatives written explicitly here are the ones we can integrate away. And then we get the boundary term. And usually in the calculus of variations, you throw away the boundary term because you set variation zero to the boundary. But this point labeled C, it's not the boundary of a curve, it's just an internal. Boundary of a curve, it's just an internal edge, so we can't set the variation to zero here. So, it is at those corner points that we need to make sure the two contributions from the two straight pieces match up. And that's where the second type of Euler-Lagrange equation here comes from. Whereas the first, as usual, you just read off from the integrals. So let's look at an example of this, or rather, a class of examples. Rather, a class of examples where, again, I mentioned if you're coming from a Liaville integrable system, this should be quite straightforward. And if you have canonical Hamiltonian systems, what's even more, you assume they have the usual kinetic energy. So then your first Lagrangian is kinetic energy minus some potential. And you put the rest of the Lagrangians to have a kinetic term that is the T1 derivative. The T1 derivative of Q times the Ti derivative, and then minus the Hamiltonian representing that flow. And in fact, there's no reason to write those separately because under the Legendre transform in this case, the L1 is actually of the same form as the Li if you simplify this. And then we get this set of multi-time Aurio Lagrange equations. So the first is the usual Auri-Lagrange equation for L1. For L1. So you just get that the second T1 derivative is minus the derivative or the gradient of the potential. So that's just your Newton's equation. The second one looks maybe a bit less obvious, but if you think about the Legendre transform in the simple case, where the momentum is just Q1, then this becomes the I derivative or the Ti derivative of P. derivative for the ti derivative of p, so it's one of the Hamiltonian equations for the qi derivative. And this guy here is the other of the Hamiltonian pair of equations. So these Euler Lagrange equations are in perfect analogy here with the Hamiltonian equations. And then the final type where you match the two creation derivatives, it's actually trivially satisfied. But that doesn't mean that these equations are meaningless or empty. Equations are meaningless or empty, it just meant that we were smart choosing or defining the li in the first place. This first term of the li is chosen exactly because it makes sure the final equation here is satisfied. And now let's start to pivot to the other perspective. We'll stay with this example for now. So we have the multi-time Moi Lagrange equations, which are essentially Equations, which are essentially these two Hamiltonian equations. And if we keep them in mind and look at the coefficient of the early exterior derivative, which is this difference of derivatives, then we recognize a lot of instances of these two equations. So this expression, if you write it out, you can then almost factorize. So you have one term or two terms here that Or two terms here that factorize as a product of Euler-Lagrange equations. And then you have a few terms left over, basically from multiplying together these partial derivatives. But then you recognize, oh, these leftover terms, they are exactly the canonical Poisson brackets. So if our Hamiltonians are an involution, then these extra terms are zero. These don't matter. So then you find not just that the exterior derivative is zero, but Derivative is zero, but it has a double zero on solutions, in the sense that each of its terms is a product of things that vanish on solutions. And Frank said that the discovery that dl is zero was a key point in multiform theory. And I mean, of course, I agree this is essential, but I think even more it believes it's essential that this is a double zero. And I would maybe. And I would maybe go as far as suggesting this as a definition of a multiform. I don't know if I would be keen to hear what Frank thinks of it. Maybe a multiform is a differential form such that its exterior derivative has a double zero on a consistent set of equations. And so, double zero, I mean that's like in this example, each of the terms. Each of the terms is a product of two things that vanish on the Euler-Lagrange equations. So it's not just zero on the Euler Lagrange equation, it's a product of things that are zero. So it's just like a polynomial, a parabola has a double zero, it's that sense here, but on the equations. And something that Frank also explained already is regardless of whether it's a double. Regardless of whether it's a double zero or simply zero, it has a very important geometric interpretation. If the exterior derivative vanishes, it means that the action not only is critical on all possible curves, but actually is the same on all possible curves. Because if you look at the difference of the action along these two curves, well, the difference in these integrals by Stokes' theorem is the integral over the area between them of the L. So if the L is zero, then this difference is zero. Difference is zero. So, this is an extra ingredient compared to just the Pourier-Lagrangian principle, and that you also have this invariance with respect to variations of the geometry. And more important for my story today is that this exterior derivative also provides another route to derive the Euralechnology functions. Because in the first approach, we Because in the first approach, we said: well, if we are critical on all stepped surfaces or stepped curves, then this implies criticality on all curves. I'm just going to steep a bottle of water here. And in a similar way, if we reduce our attention to closed curves only, that's also sufficient. If the action is critical on all closed curves, then it will be critical on all curves. If we consider closed curves, then we can again apply Stokes' theorem. So, taking variations of L along a closed curve is the same as taking variations of dL along the thing that that curve encloses. And we can make these closed curves very small. So the only way this can be true for all closed curves is that if delta dl is zero everywhere. And this comes back to the double zeros in the sense that, well, if you Sense that, well, if you take a variation of a double zero, the variation has a kind of Leibniz property, so it only acts on one of these factors, and the other ones will still be zero. Just like if you take the variation of your parabola or the derivative of your parabola, it will be zero where the parabola has its base. So by varying the dl, you get a different root to the Euler Lagrange equations, and you have this key property. And you have this key property that if you have some equations that make your dl a double zero, then these are sufficient for criticality. So they imply the Euler-Lagrange equations. And the derivation becomes even nicer by an observation, which I think is mostly due to Duncan Slay in collaboration with Franken and Vincent, is that Is that well, we name the coefficients of dl pij here. And if you take variations of L and or sorry, of dl and require them all to be zero, that means that variations of p must all be zero. And it also means that the variational derivatives of p must all be zero. And through a slightly tedious calculation, but with a very beautiful result, you can find an expression. You can find an expression for these variational derivatives of p in terms of the variant derivatives of l i and l j. And this notation of i backslash ti, i without ti, means that you take one ti derivative away from the set of derivatives that i encodes. And if i did not contain any ti derivatives, then the corresponding term just becomes zero. And this distinction means that this form And this distinction means that this formula where we have the difference here, depending on which derivatives i contains, either reduces to a single variational derivative or has both. So it's depending on what i is, reduces to either type of Euler Lagrange. And this generalizes to forms of k forms of arbitrary k. So we can do this from one forms, two forms, or whatever you like. And in theory, the step surface approach also generalizes to arbitrary forms. For two forms, it's still quite doable, although the calculations also become quite long. For higher forms, it is still possible, but it loses the benefit that you can really visualize what happens to the surface. So I think this is an amazing benefit of taking variations of dl to derive the Euler-like Kaunch equations that you can. Crange equations that you can really easily generalize it to any dimension. And just as a particular case, I've put here also the Euler-Lagrange equations for the two forms, so where you take integrals of a two-form over arbitrary surfaces. And then instead of using stepped curves, you can use stepped surfaces and look at the corner of a cube. You can't really see the back panel here. Cube, you can't really see the back panel here, but it's supposed to be the corner of a cube. So then you have three types of equations, which in the stepped surface approach we can think of as belonging to a side of the cube belonging to one of the edges or belonging to the corner points. But as I said, they also easily come out from taking variations of the exterior derivative. Right, so I've shown you two ways of deriving multi-time Lagrange equations, and I've been emphasizing this double zero property as maybe a potential definition, but also a very useful tool in one of these derivations. Now I want to also use it to construct examples. And I think this is what we have been doing all along in many of the examples. Of the examples. But so, what I want to do here in the first example is it's basically the potential KDV slightly generalized, but unlike how it's been published previously, in part by myself and Jury Zuris, where some of the choices maybe have seemed a bit arbitrary. I think now with the double zero property, it becomes much more natural. So we start from So we start from coefficients L1i. So in the hierarchy like the KDV, the T1 is what we usually call X. It's a space variable that all flows have in common. And the I is the Ti, the time variable of certain flow in the hierarchy. And so I'll assume in this example that the kinetic term, so Q sub now becomes V's, just a matter of convention. I'll assume that the kinetic term is V1 times Vi. And then we suppose. times vi and then we subtract something you can think of as the Hamiltonian and I'll make a simple simplifying assumption that the Hamiltonian doesn't actually depend on v itself it only depends on t1 derivatives of v and its traditional Euler Lagrange equation is this guy here and using this assumption that h does not depend on v this Euler Lagrange equation is actually the T1 derivative of this evolutionary equation One derivative of this evolutionary equation. And both of these will be part of the system of multi-time overall conjugations. And what we want to do to construct the full two-form, because we don't just need L1i, we also need Lij, where i and j are both non-zero. And so we want to find Lij such that this double zero property of the exterior derivative is. Well, we don't know yet what Lij is. Don't know yet what Lij is, so we can start computing with the other two terms and try to repeat the idea from the previous example. So we try to collect terms that are zero on these Euler-Lagrange equations, or on what we suspect should be the Euler-Lagrange equations. And so again, we can find two terms that nicely factorizes. And now there's a bit more clutter. The second line here, exactly. The second line here, exactly as in the previous example, that's the Poisson brackets. It actually, well, it kind of looks like the canonical Poisson brackets here, if you think of Vi as P. Actually, I would say it's equivalent to the Garner brackets rather than the canonical Poisson bracket because we're now in infinite dimension. But either way, this is the Poisson bracket. So if this Hamiltonian is commutes, then that becomes zero, so we can disregard it. Becomes zero, so we can disregard it. And then the final line, it's a bit of a mess, the general formula, but the important bit is a start here. This is a total T1 derivative. So if we want to make this double zero property hold, we just name whatever is inside the T1 derivative Lij or minus Lij to make the science work out. So if you take this big thing as a definition of Lij. As a definition of Lij, then by construction, this computation shows, assuming the Poisson bracket is zero, that the exterior derivative will be a double zero on these equations. And if you then take this two-form and calculate the multi-timorial Lagrange equations, then you get both versions of the equation. That's both versions of the equation, the mixed derivative 1i and the evolutionary form where you just had the tier. Which, when we first had this two-form, but didn't realize that we had a double zero rather than a zero of the L, this was a magical surprise. It was very unusual to see an evolutionary and first-order equation coming out of a relational principle. But if you do the construction this way, then you can just read off the Euler-Lagrange equations from the factorization. Equations from the factorization. So, from this perspective, well, of course, these evolutionary equations are part of the system of Euler-Lagrange equations. It's immediate from the construction as a double zero here. So, I think keeping double zeros in mind when trying to construct examples is not just helpful to find examples, but also explain some of the things that seemed miraculous at first. Yes. So if you only know the L1i, you could take the usual Euro Lagrange equation, just in the 1i plane, and you get this one. And then you might observe, oh, we. Observe, oh, this is a full T1 derivative. So you can guess this is well, they're not equivalent, but this is a consequence of that one, or up to a constant, they're equivalent. So you can guess that the second one might play a part as well. And then if you start trying to factorize this, it becomes very natural to use both of them. And then you're there. Yeah, you're right. In some examples, you might be missing. You might be missing some information if you're not aware of all the equations that might be part of the system of Euler contributions. And so, yes, I wanted to make a bit of a literature commentary here that some of the earlier works or more recent works actually fail to appreciate this double zero property. So, this is the paper where we first constructed. Where we first constructed the KDG example, and where it was completely miraculous that we got these evolutionary equations. We knew we had to look for closeness, but we didn't appreciate the double zero. And even more recently, this paper where I tried to make more explicit connections to the Hamiltonian sites, I failed to appreciate these double zeros. So I think this could have been a much better paper if I had really known about this. But they really started up here. Where they really started appearing is where we considered variational symmetries. This was done more or less simultaneously and independent by me when I was still in Leeds and by the Sybil in Berlin and by the Leeds group with Frankenfenson. So I think these are some of the papers where this double zero property started to come more to the forefront. Just a brief note that you can do the same with a more general kinetic term. So the first term doesn't have to be V1 times Vi, which corresponds to the Gardner-Poisson brackets. You can put different kinetic terms, different momenta. Maybe that's a bit of abuse of terminology. You can put a different form for the first term. Then your Poisson bracket that comes out depends on inverting this operator. This operator. So dp is the shared derivative of this p that defines your first term. And you can do the same kind of calculation. And I'm just putting this here to justify not showing the calculation because the end result is this complicated. So you can imagine that the calculation is unpleasant. But it's exactly the same idea as what I showed on the previous slide. I think there are a few questions here. Well, we need to invert this operator. So when This operator, so when is this inverse operator applied to the variational derivative well-defined? And can we classify somehow for which p's and which set of h's we actually get commuting flows? And in an ideal world, maybe the answers to these questions are the same or very similar, but I think probably that's too much to hope for. But yeah, either question would be interesting to see answered, I think. Right, so that was a bit of an aside to show that. So that was a bit of an aside to show that we can generalize these things beyond what I showed in previous few slides. Now I want to do some of the same on semi-discrete Lagrangian multi-forms. I haven't actually checked, but I assume that you have the double zero on IJK. Yes, it would be an important thing to check, but I haven't found this on the general one. Yes, that's a good point. Right, so briefly on the semi-discrete case. So the case I'm working it, you can generalize this. The case I'm working it, you can generalize this further, is where you just have one discrete direction and everything else is continuous. So you get these slices of some continuous space indexed by z. And then a discrete or semi-discrete surface has two-dimensional pieces inside these slices, but also one-dimensional curves. And you should think or think the way. You should think, or I think the way to think about this is that the curves represent where the surface makes a jump to a different value of sets. In particular, if in this example that I show here, where there's a curve exactly where the surface jumps, the way we define the boundary of such surfaces makes that this is an example of a surface without bound. So if the curves are where there jumps, then you have no boundary. Then you have no bound. So, yeah, in case that picture was a bit hard to see, you see that the curves here in pink line up with the jumps of the surface. So, this is our multi-time, this set times Rn. And so, our Q will be a function of multi-time. Sometimes we want to emphasize the lattice position where we are at. So, we write this Q. We write this q superscript k to say that we are at point k in the lattice. And then, just like our surface contains one and two dimensional pieces, so if you have a d manifold, it would have d minus one and d dimensional pieces, the d form will have, or a semi-discrete d form is part d form and part d minus one form, so that we can integrate the d form parts over the d-dimensional parts of the. Over the d-dimensional parts of the surface, and the d-1 forms over the d minus one-dimensional parts of the surface. So it's all a bit more complicated to write down, but we have all the usual concepts. We have a notion of boundary that I mentioned, we have an exterior derivative, and they combine to form the Stokes theorem as usual. So we can apply all the usual techniques that we want in this chart. And the relational principle is again the same. We want to take. Again, the same, we want to take arbitrary semi-discrete surfaces and make sure that the action is always critical. So, important example here is the Toida lattice or other systems that you can think of as particles moving on a line and with some continuous symmetries that give you the extra continuous time variables. And again, if you have some Hamiltonian structure to them, so by Hamiltonian densities, I hear I mean Hamiltonian densities are here. I mean some local expression that, if you sum all the shifts off, give you the actual Hamilton function. And if you have some Hamiltonian expressions, Hamiltonian densities that give you equations of motions, then a sensible way to define your zero i components of the Lagrangian is by this expression. The zero here represents the discrete direction. So i and j will be all, can be all the continuous ones. The zero is the discrete. ones, the zero is the discrete. And well, I've written down just for the sake of concreteness, in the example of Toda, you have these two as the first two densities. So note that they contain some derivatives. There's a TR1 derivative here, but also lattice shifts. The Q bar denotes a shift to the next lattice. So in the same way, if we start with this guess for L0I. For L0i, we can try to find Lij such that we have the double zero property of the exterior derivative. So we start by cross-differentiating this. We factorize the terms we can factorize. And again, there is some, there are some additional terms. For the second line, it looks like the Poisson brackets. It's actually the density of the Poisson brackets. If we sum all of its shifts, we get the Poisson brackets. So if these Hamiltons are in evolution, So, if these Hamiltons are in involutions, then maybe this is not zero, but it must be a difference of some other function because all of its shifts sum to zero. So, you can get a telescopic sudden like that, sums to zero. So, this might not be zero, but we can be sure that it is the difference of something. And the final two lines, well, you can see the delta operator outside of it. So, this is manifestly the difference, what is inside of it. So, we can use what's inside of that delta operator. What's inside of that delta operator and the Fij coming from the Poisson brackets to define our Lij that plays nicely with this 0i and 0j that we proposed. So computations again get slightly more complicated, but exactly the same idea. You look for a double zero and this gives you, without really any choice, this gives you algorithmically the LIG. And if we do this for And if we do this for the toy daltics in particular, and just with the first two flows, so the L01 and L02 are obtained by taking Q1 times Qi, or in the first case, Q1 squared, minus the Hamilton density I showed earlier. And then the L12 shown here is what comes out of the huge definition from the last slide. From the last slides. And now there is a second step you can take, which is no longer algorithmical. This is just based on trial and error or a flush of insights, but you can, from this L12, you can separate another thing that will be a double zero. So maybe it's not entirely obvious because it kind of mixes the two flows here. You have the Q2, which the second flow gives an equation for. Which the second flow gives an equation for in the q11, which is given by the first equation. But this combination, this expression, vanishes by virtue of these two equations. So its square is a double zero. And so we can actually leave out this double zero from the definition of L12 because the exterior derivative of it will still be a double zero. So we can use as L12 only this first. Only this first bit. I noticed that this expression contains q bar, q bar, and q bar, but not q itself. So it only contains instances of q at one single letter sign, which means in particular that if we take the fully continuous Euler Lagrange equation, L1, 2, which is part of the semi-discrete system of multi-Euler-Lagrange equations, then we get a PDE because this continuous equation is equal to equation we get a PDE because this continuous multi-monager equation doesn't introduce any letter shifts. L12 contains only one letter site, so you get a PDE. I mean strictly speaking you would get it at the Q bar letter site, but we get it everywhere, so we can just shift it back. And because we constructed this multiform on the basis of a double zero, so by construction, the exterior derivative has double zero as soon as the differential difference equations are satisfied. So if we have one and two. Are satisfied. So if we have one and two, we know we have criticality. So this PDE coming out of the multi-time Lagrange equations must be a consequence of one and two. And you can verify this on the level of the equations, but this is a very hard calculation, especially if you don't know the PDE in advance. It's extremely hard to eliminate both of these lattice shifts for one and two, and the multiform gives it for free, which Gives it for free, which I think is a very surprising and very beautiful result. Now, this is not entirely new, it's quite well known that there are deep relations between integrable PDEs and differential difference equations. And this particular equation is also known to be integrable. It's a Bucinesk type equation that you find in classifications such as this one. And one way towards seeing that is. And one way towards seeing that it's integrable is that actually the equations of our toddler lattice, the differential difference equations that we started with, if you rewrite them a little bit, they're actually equivalent to the set of these two equations, which each contains only one lattice shift. And so this system actually then gives us a backland transformation for the PDE. So from the differential difference equations that we started with, we immediately get some integrability attributes for this PDE. Attributes for this PDE as well. And I don't think this is very general, but we have at least one other interesting example where this can be done, which is a potential version of the Volterra hierarchy. Well, these are the first two equations of the hierarchy. It's not that hard to come up with like branches for these equations individually. It's L01 and L02. L01 and L02. They now have a different kinetic term. There's this logarithm in there. Again, the same IDs go through Noado, also with this different kinetic term. And then out of the algorithm, out of the double zero procedure, comes this L12. And again, with some hard work, some trial and error, we can split off something at the end. There's a square of an equation that vanishes on the first two. On the first two. So the last term here is a double zero. And everything else only depends on q bar, not on q. So this as well gives us a PD, which wouldn't fit on one line of the slide. And so what I show here is actually, if you take the Euler-Lagrange equation of L1, 2, the one that still contains two lattice sides, you get this system of equations, which is actually a known system. It's called the Levy system. System, it's called the Levy system sometimes, and it's also known that it is compatible with the Volterra hierarchy. But the second form of L12, it gives you a big PDE, which is equivalent to this Levy system. So again, the multiform allows us to eliminate the shift from the system of equations, where it's highly non-trivial to do this by hand on the level of the equations. So, as I mentioned, I think this is probably not entirely general because at each step, Entirely general because at each step, the final step of making sure Lij does not contain any shifts is done by hand on a case-by-case basis. And especially if you look at examples where your Lagrangian coefficients have more shifts, it will become increasingly difficult, maybe increasingly unlikely that you'll be able to do this. So, several interesting examples, definitely, but I'm guessing not completely generally. Now, for the final bits, I want to show you a different curious connection that the two perspectives give, just like the PDE appeared as a curious connection to the differential difference equations. And this is actually mostly based on observations by Genia Feratontov, and also related to some of the Lagrangians that Frank mentioned earlier this morning. And so I think Frank mentioned this. And so I think Frank mentioned this one as one of his examples. It's also one that appears in the very first Lagrangian multiform paper from 2009 by Frank and Sahelo. And as Frank mentioned, this one, the exterior derivative, will factorize on certain equations. I actually want to look at a simpler case. So I say set n1 and i and nj to zero. I do this because I just want to get rid. I do this because I just want to get rid of the second term. I mean, I think Frank won't like this because it destroys a lot of connections with the discrete world. But for the sake of a simple example, I want to simplify this as much as possible. And also, it doesn't really matter in the calculations, but for the sake of connections, I want to make this autonomous. So instead of ti minus tj, I put constants there. And then the exterior derivative factorizes into two factors that are nice. Two factors that are nicely symmetric and recyclic permutations of one, two, three or Ijkm. On the other hand, if you look at the multi-time Euler Lagrange equations, it's two forms, we have three types of multi-time Euler Lagrange equations. Well, the third one's reasonably nice, but the first two are quite a mess. Although, well, in particular, the first one looks complicated. It looks complicated, but as always, if you just take the usual Euler-Lagrange equation, it doesn't introduce derivatives in new directions. So, this first one has I derivatives, j derivatives, but no k derivatives. Whereas the factors of the exterior derivative, they are the two equations from before, both of which involve i, j, k, and we know that they're equivalent by the double zero property. So, again, this gives us a bit of an unusual way of eliminating a Unusual way of eliminating a variable or derivative from the system. What might be even more interesting is that both of these equations at the bottom have a geometric interpretation. The first one is sometimes called the Veronese-Rep equation. It has some connections to algebraic geometry, but also to differential geometry related to general relativity. So if you take a U that satisfies this equation, then you can construct This equation, then you can construct a metric, a one-form, and a connection on a three- or higher-dimensional space, but in particular, three-dimensional is interesting. And this is a so-called Einstein-Wall structure, which is a slight relaxation of Einstein's equations that still gives a rich structure into D. In a sense of time, I won't go into details. But the point is, the solution to this equation gives some interesting geometry that seems Some interesting geometry that seems entirely removed from the initial one form, initial multi-form, two form. And the other equation, the B1, also has differential geometry interpretation. It's related to Yegorov geometry, which considers potential metrics. So potential metric in the series that u is the potential and the metric is the T1 derivative of U times DT1 squared plus similar components. And this equation says exactly that this metric constructed this way. This metric constructed this way, it's different from the previous metric, but the metric constructed this way has diagonal curvature. So, of diagonal elements of the curvature tensor are zero. Both of these have this kind of random geometric connection, which could be a coincidence, but people often say in integrable systems there are no coincidences. So it would be really interesting to see if there are more examples like this, to see if we can find out a deeper reason for these equations. Reason for these equations appear. Right, and I think with that, my time is over, but I'll take 30 seconds to summarize. So, I've shown you two approaches to getting the Euler-Lagrange equations, step surfaces and varying the exterior derivative. They're both quite effective, maybe some more in some situations, but overall, I think it's a matter of taste which one you prefer. But the factorization of the L, the double zero property, that one is really key to how we. That one is really key to how we construct many of our examples. And in some examples, like the semi-discrete case and this curious connection, it leads to actually very surprising relations between the equations that factorize your exterior derivative and the multi-time or Lagrange equations. And I think this is a potentially very big application of Lagrange multiples. So thank you very much for your attention.
