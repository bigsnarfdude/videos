Here, as I think everybody in this room knows. The title is a little bit of a lie. I think I'm not the first one at this event to have that. So I was hoping, I was expecting that Vera was going to talk about small amplitude waves, but she's not. So then I figured I should do that as well. So I'm going to start by talking about what happens for small amplitude waves and then going on to extreme waves. A lot of collaborators, some of them in the room, Ryan already pointed out there's Room. Ryan already pointed out there's a typo here because Ryan is no longer at the University of Washington, he's now a brown. So, the people I really want to single out for, especially the last part of the talk, are Sergey Dioshenko and Anastasia Seminova. And if anybody is looking for a brilliant numerical analyst, Anastasia is on the job market, and you could do, well, I have a heart imagine you could do better. Okay, so why do we? Okay, so why do we study water waves? When I look at this slide, the question is: how could we not study water waves? I actually had to change the slide this morning because Rosa Maria used one of my pictures, so I didn't want to have too much overlap. So you've seen this one before, that's near the coast of Peru. This one is of an island on the very northern tip of New Zealand, and to me, And to me, these crests are so well defined that when you know you showed the Bergen picture this morning, I mean, maybe there's more of that going on here. I don't know. This is near Duck, North Carolina, and you look at the scale of these waves. The gray stripe that you see right there, if you can spot it, is a four-lane highway. So, a very large scale. This is pretty large as well, if you think of the circumstances. This is a This is a harbor model of the San Diego Harbor, of what became the San Diego Harbor, built by the Army Corps of Engineers in the U.S. And when the Army Corps of Engineers build something, they don't mess around because if you were standing here, you'd be about that big. So this is a very large scale model. But you see that they try to model this under all kinds of circumstances. You have nearly one-dimensional wave sphere, you have, in fact, a one-dimensional wave resulting in two-dimensional planets. Fundamental layers resulting in two-dimensional patterns, and so on. And then, of course, I'm probably not going to talk about anything that's relevant to these pictures right here. So, this is Calvin. I put up Calvin there because, according to Craig, Calvin was the first one to actually write down the other water wave problem, as we know it. So, there he is. The main, I'm not going to go over the details here, you've seen too many times now. The one thing I'm going to point out is: I've written this down. I'm going to point out that I've written this down in one spatial dimension, one surface spatial dimension. If you want to know more about what happens for two-dimensional surface event, Vatakchi is giving a poster about that later this afternoon. Okay. So we don't want to deal with a free boundary value problem with nonlinear boundary conditions. So there's a lot of equivalent formulation. I've written down three here that we have on occasion used. We have on occasion used. There's the Zakara for XMM approach, which you've already heard mentioned. The Abos Focus Muslimani approach, which we've done quite a bit with, and most recently, especially when it comes to the extreme amplitude stuff, we've been using the conformal mapping approach. And so we've been looking at Stokes waves and then their stability, so traveling water waves and then their stability. The traveling wave solution satisfies simpler equations. If you use the AFM formula, If you use the AFM formulation, then you satisfy this equation. Nice, okay, good. And I'll have to use that for small amplitude waves. And if you use a conformal mapping approach, then we've already seen the Babenko equation and I'm respected. Okay, so the idea is we're going to solve these equations, and then we're going to take our water wave equations in some formulation. We're going to linearize about these traveling wave solutions. That gives rise to a linear problem. Gives rise to a linear problem, which is actually autonomous in T, so we get to do a separation of variables in T. That gives rise to a spectrum problem, and then we investigate the spectrum of the resulting linear operator. And we are interested in if anything happens in the right half plane, leading to instability, and so on. But everything I'm going to say about stability is going to be spectral stability. Okay, so first about the Stokes wave, Necrosoft, and Library. First, about the Stokes wave, Necrosoft and Levachivita proved their existence in infinite depth structure that had finite depth for small amplitude waves. Toland, Potnikov, and then Ermik Frankl-Toland proved that for all depths, including infinity, the steepest wave has an angle of 120 degrees at the crest. That's not going to be relevant for the first part of the talk, but for the second part of the talk, we'll try to get real close to that. And I also want to point out that it's not simply 150 degrees. It's not simply 120 degrees and damn. There are ripples near the corner, and this very nice paper by Ditchenko Herr and Slantiev illustrates that very well. Okay, and that's, I think, I have no proof of that, but I think that's related to some of the stuff I'll say at the very, very end about these phenomena that we're seeing. Okay, so Stokes waves, you know, for small amplitude waves, you can do a numerical continuation method. You can do a numerical continuation method. You start from flat water, you numerically continue up this branch. And if you're in shallow water, then no surprise, these periodic waves, all my waves will be periodic, and I will typically scale them to have period 2 pi. And so in shallow water, you're not surprised that for reasonable amplitudes, you get things that look very much like KDV conoidal waves with relatively sharp crests and then large drops in between. Great. If you go to deep, Great. If you go to deep water, that does not happen, and you get harder to tell these waves apart from their linear counterparts. By the way, I am showing different amplitudes here, but for the sake of seeing the very small amplitude waves, I've rescaled all of their amplitudes. We'll come back to this later. If you get very close to the steepest Stokes waves, so you have this 120-degree corner, that looks pretty good. Corner that looks pretty good if you zoom in. We're using a Fourier-based approach. We don't actually get to 120 degrees, of course, but we get really darn close. Okay, so some of these simulations involve millions of Fourier modes to approximate this. So it's a natural question to ask whether these waves are stable or unstable, and that story really starts in 1967 when. In 1967, when Benjamin and Widham both looked at the instability of waves in deep water. So they came up with this number, which is the root of an equation involving hyperbolic functions. They found out that these waves in deep water, so the depth, the dimensionless depth greater than this number, are unstable with respect to the modulational instability. And we now call that dimension in fear instability. That dimension of inference ability. That was, those were formal calculations, and really, what to take away from their calculations is that in the origin of the spectral plane, you have this X shape at the origin. The first rigorous proof using spatial dynamics was by Bridges and Milke quite a bit later, almost 30 years later. And then it took almost another 30 years by Gwyneth Strauss. By Gwyn and Strauss to extend their proof, which breaks down an infinite depth, to extend that to infinite depth. Okay, that paper was actually on the archive about three years earlier, I believe, so not quite 30 years. And then Vera and Yang also provided a rigorous proof using Evans functions in finite depth. Now, that's all of this is about establishing this x empty origin. In 2011, with Katie Oliveras, this was a big part of her PhD thesis, we computed the entire stability, some part in the complex plane. We computed the stability spectra. And so, for instance, if you're in H equals 1.5, so this is fast 1.363 dimensional clear cutoff, then you get a picture like this. So, this is a spectral plane that looks like a bunch of flat lines. If you zoom in on this one right here, You zoom in on this one right here. Notice the scales here, right? This is minus 1.5 to 1.5, this is 10 to the minus 6 on this axis. If you zoom in on this middle part right here, which looks like it's on the real axis, it turns out it's not on the real axis, it is a relatively squashed, well, I should say relatively squashed because it's still on the horizontal axis, figure eight. And I believe that's the first time that in the context of the water wave problem, the figure eight was observed. But there's other things right there. There's other parts to the spectrum, and if you zoom in on those, those turn out to be isola or bubbles. I'll probably call them bubbles more often than not. And I'll talk a little bit about those as well. Okay, together with Ryan, we used formal perturbation theory to approximate this figure 8. And I hope that you can tell. So, all the dots here, I've got Ryan to change this convention. I got right to change this convention. All the dots here are numerical, and all the cell lines are asymptotic. The orange line here is the lowest-order approximation or low-order approximation of the figure A, and then the green curve, which matches the dots very, very well, is higher-order asymptotics. And then there's these other figures. You can look at the real part and the imaginary part, the different colors here, as a function of the Foucault exponent, because this whole figure A, in general, for spectrum. In general, for spectra in the complex plane for these periodic solutions, they are parameterized by the flotet, by the flotet parameter. How the asymptotics matches the real and imaginary parts of the spectrum. As you increase the amplitude or the steepness of the waves, the range of floquet exponents that parameterizes the figure A changes. And that's shown here. So this is the floquet exponent. And that's shown here. So, this is the floquet exponent, the range of the floquet exponent is symmetric, only showing you a half as a function of an amplitude parameter. And again, the higher-order asymptotics captures that pretty well. I'll skip that one. This one has to do with capturing the most unstable mode. Okay, so that's all formal perturbation theory. It was fairly convenient to go to higher order. But then there were proofs. Birdie, Masperio, and Ventura. Bernie, Masperio, and Ventura used Cato's methods, augmented with symmetry considerations in this Hamiltonian setting, to rigorously prove the presence of that figure eight that you have. Okay, so not only cross at the origin, but the actual whole figure eight. Okay, so they managed to prove that, and just because they could, and because it's interesting, they also decided to investigate what happens at the actual critical cutoff branch. Critical cutoff parameter. And you can do this, and there's also Benjamin Fury instability. There's a figure eight, although it's a more skinny figure eight. It's a higher order calculation. Okay, so that's about Benjamin theory. Let's go back to what I'm calling these high-frequency instabilities because they're located higher up on the imaginary axis. So, right after 67, well, maybe not prevailing, but a commonly held belief. But a commonly held belief in the literature, you know, you can find this in the book by Albertson Seeger, for instance, is that waves in shallow water are stable. Because there's no Benjamin fear and we don't know of anything else. So we believe that waves in shallow water are stable. And as a matter of fact, Joe Hammack used this to partially design wave tanks. If I want to have a one-dimensional wave tank, let's make sure that I can avoid the battery interference stability. There's nothing else I have to worry about. You design the wave tank. We design a wave thing. But that turns out to be not the case. So when we did these calculations with Katie, at some point was, let's recover this figure that you see in the literature where, as a function of the dimensionless depth, you plot the maximal part of the eigenvalue of largest real part. So here's that real part. And then you see nothing, and then you get benefit. And then you see nothing, and then you get Benjamin Fear. The idea was to recreate that, and that's not what we found. We found, after quite a bit of work, that there's this other thing right here. And that other thing turns out to be these high-frequency instabilities. By the way, the reason that this becomes so large is this is all done for a fixed small amplitude wave. And of course, as you decrease the depth, that becomes increasingly nonlinear. So, back to these high-frequency instabilities, this is deep water. So, there is Benjamin. This is deep water, so there is Benjamin Fear, but then you have these isole. And if you have shallow water, in this case, there's two isole, and but maybe there's three, there's something right there. And g one, two, three, clearly your conjecture is there's an infinite number of these things. You know, what can be done? Before I discuss what was done, these things are numerically. You okay? Yeah, I think so. Okay. These things are numerically very. These things are numerically very hard to capture because it turns out that the width of floquet exponents, understandably, the width of flowet exponents that parameterizes these isolates is 10 to the minus 4. So it's very easy to completely miss them. And this had indeed happened. McLean, in his paper on 2D instabilities, transverse instabilities, if you looked at what happened for the case. Looked at what happened for the case of zero transverse wavelength, you can actually see them, but they were actually not remarked on in this paper. So, and then also, as you vary this amplitude, this very small range, which is already hard to hit, drifts rapidly, and so that makes it humidity quite a hard task to get these things. But again, asymptotics can do a very good job. But again, asymptotics can do a very good job. I don't know why this slide is cut off. What is this top part? I want to make sure I give Vera credit. Right there at the bottom, her and Yang were the first ones to prove the existence of the first high-frequency bubble, the one closest to the real axis. And then this year, Bertie, Corsi, Maspera, and Ventura, and a paper. In a paper that I still have a hard time believing exists, we're able to prove there is an infinite number of these things, and they have approximations for them as you go up. It's really an amazing piece of work. I find out that this work existed while we were on a research retreat, and that kind of then dominated the research retreat. Okay, so let's switch to near-extreme waves. So, I want to talk about large amplitude waves. We're going to switch to the conform. Large amplitude waves, we're going to switch to the conformal mapping formulation. Everything so far was using the FM formulation, at least from us. We only have computational results. But I'm going to give you lots of conjectures. So if you're an analyst, get your pens ready. We're going to use conformal mapping. We're not going to talk about the high-frequency instabilities. They are there. We're going to focus at what happens elsewhere. And everything will be in infinite depth for two pi-periodic waves. If you want to know about finite depth, Ellie Burns sitting right there will present. Ellie Burns sitting right there will present a poster about that later this afternoon. Okay, I also don't have time to talk about the numerical approach, but it's due to Anastasia and Sergei. Anastasia in her PhD thesis already looked at the co-periodic perturbations of these near-extreme waves, following up all the work by. Following up all their work by ranking on the names now. So, but that was just co-periodic. That was for periodic perturbations of the same period as the Stokes weight. And so we wanted to add floquet to this. We wanted to add the possibility to look at subharmonic perturbations. So now this method that was used, this control mapping approach, had to be extended to include the Which had to be extended to include the 4k parameter. And then the other thing is, I've told you that in order to look at these near-extreme waves, we're using millions of Fourier modes. We don't want to create a matrix-based approach where we'd have to deal with a million squared matrix entries that would have to be stored. So one essential piece of progress was the development of this matrix-free method that allowed us to avoid that and just basically deal with ten to the six degrees of freedom as opposed to ten to the twelve. Of freedom as opposed to 10 to the 12. Well, degrees of freedom parameters. Okay, what are you looking at? So, this is a Stokes wave, which I've shown you before, near the peak. What you're looking at here is the Hamiltonian and the velocity. This is a Hamiltonian problem, and if you're given a Stokes wave, you can plug that into the Hamiltonian, you can evaluate the number that you get. And as you increase the steepness of the Stokes wave, Steepness of the Stokes wave. It turns out, so then the Hamiltonian increases, it starts at zero. And then if you get very close to the steepest Stokes wave, it looks like there's oscillations. And this is a cartoon, this is not the actual numerical plot. The oscillations are damped very, very quickly. This is also a logarithmic scaling on the steepness so that the steepest wave is out there at all the way at plus infinity. The red curve is Is similar but for the velocity. As you numerically continue up the bifurcation branch, the velocity as a function of steepness also oscillates. And these oscillations are going to play a big role in what we have to say next. Okay? Okay. Let me talk about all of this. You start with a zero amplitude wave, flat water. The first thing that happens immediately is you get a figure 8 forming. This is an infinite, remember? Forming, this is an infinite, remember? You get a figure eight forming at the origin. That's the best of fear and stability. That figure eight grows. And at some point, the two tangents that you have at the origin coalesce and are parallel to the imaginary axis, or only imaginary axis. That's when you get this hourglass. After this value, the value is written down right here. I should say, by the way, the steepest wave is at steepness 0.1401. 0.14016 or something. So, you know, this is getting quite steep. After the hourglass, this separates. Continues to drift away from the real axis. And then, at a specific value that I'll talk about, there's something else that happens at the origin. At the origin, you get an oval of eigenvalues or spectral elements getting bigger. This random figure eight eventually gets reabsorbed into it. Gets reabsorbed into it. This oval, by the way, all of these are on the same horizontal scale. Also, notice there's no 10 to the minus 6 on these axes here. These are the actual numbers. All on the same scale from there to here, that's just a rescaling. This is the same figure that just rescaled. This oval becomes bean shaped. At this point, these remnants have been absorbed. And then this bean shape becomes a figure infinity. That figure infinity. Figure infinity. That figure infinity forms exactly Lange-Haggins and Panakawa names I was looking for when you are dealing with when you're at the first maximum of the Hamiltonian. I've colored these two points. So green is a co-periodic corresponds to a co-periodic mode. Red corresponds to a subharmonic mode of twice the period. Okay? So this figure 8, the figure infinity, unlike the figure 8, the figure infinity, figure 8, persists for a range of steepnesses. The figure infinity is formed and immediately split. Exists for isolated steepness. And then what happens, these different lobes drift off. If we follow the right lobe, you get this. So again, two times the period, one times the period. So again, two times the period, one times the period, a switch. But notice that in this switch, nothing else becomes dominant. It's always red or green that's the dominant instability. Things keep on changing. Switch again. Let me stop looking because it becomes hard to look. Notice that my final statements here is really quite close. Steepness here is really quite close to the steepest rate. Here's some of the eigenfunctions that you get. We call this branch of everything past the oval, we call this the localized branch because the eigenfunctions are very much localized near the crests of the wave. This is a co-periodic eigenfunction. This is the same color convention as before. This is a two times the periodic eigenfunction. You see the effect that they have on the wave profile. You've seen that before? Here's the big moral. Everything I've just shown you, especially all of this, happens again. So as these things separate, you keep on increasing steepness, another figure eight is formed at the origin. All of this happens again. These things separate again. Things separate again. Another figure eight is formed at the origin. We've been able to track this up to three times. Okay? So let me show you some illustrations of that. But basically, yeah, the big picture is we see this recurring behavior, what I'll show you, is really self-similar behavior of these spectral components. This is the same cartoon, but different color coding, which I'll talk about. Different color coding, which I'll talk about. So here is the green region. That's figure eight, the original figure eight from Benjamin Fear. Here is where the next figure eight gets born. The figure eights get born at the extrema of the velocity. So at zero, right here, right here, and so on. Whatever happens in between these extrema happens over and over again. Of course, this conjecture depends on the fact that the velocity does indeed have an infinite number of. And in front of oscillations. For the figure eight, if we look at the one that has the largest real part, maximal real part, and the one that has the hourglass shape, the first one and the second one look quite different. The second one and the third one, virtually identical. And if you quantitatively compare it, you can see that if you overlay these, these are definitely in the eyeball metric the same, and then you have an error that's like 10 to the minus 3. And then you have an error that's like 10 to the minus 3 or something for the second and the third one already. That's more about that. Let me say a little bit about the eigenfunctions. The eigenfunctions for the first one are this purple line. And so you have this behavior from the modulation instability. This is for the spectral element right here. If I do that here, I still have this modulational behavior, but as we said, the eigenfunctions are much more localized neutral. Are much more localized near the crests. And that's also true for the third figure. The oval appears every time that you get to what Shanna Safan would call a class II bifurcation, where you get a bifurcation to waves of that would have two peaks per period. Which may be not surprising given that we find that the dominant eigenfunctions there are the ones that have twice the period of the wave. The period of the wave. And finally, the recurrence of the figure A, figure infinity, that happens, as we said, at the extreme of the Hamiltonian. Already the first two are virtually indistinguishable. Let me finish with a bunch of conjectures. These two are not ours, but they're red because they're important. If these two are false, everything else is going to make sense. Okay? Make any sense. Okay, so we're assuming, and hopefully somebody can prove, there is already an asymptotic theory along the Higginson. Okay, but there's no proof that the Hamiltonian and the velocity have an infinite number of local extrema. If that's true, Anastasia already in her thesis has a very nice illustration, the Merkel, that the maximal growth rate approaches infinity, which is maybe not surprising. As you get close to the steepest Stokes wave, surface tension will matter. Okay, and you need to. Okay, and you need to add this extra effect for this problem to make physical sense. We conjectured that there's an infinite number of these manual inferior figure eight instabilities. They come out of the origin and they persist for a range of values. And they detach and then they go through that behavior as I'll show you. We conjecture there is an infinite number of figure infinity instabilities and they exist at these isolated points. The figure eights and the figure infinities. The figure eights and the figure infinities alternate in their behavior. Another way of saying that is at the extrema of the Hamiltonian and the extrema of the velocity interlates. For Stokes wave with a sufficiently large amplitude, we see that the most unstable mode is either periodic with the same period or periodic with twice the period. I don't know why that was a really big surprise to us. And we noticed that there's an infinite, well, And we notice that there's an infinite, well, we've seen three of these interchanges between the co-periodic and the subharmonic of twice the period most unstable modes. We think there's an infinite number of them. Right? And here's a list of references. Thank you.
