Enjoy sharing this event with you. I would like to thank Harold Oberhauser and the Hauser organizers for inviting me. So, I'm going to talk about signatures and expansions of functionals. Actually, it's quite related to different works of Harold and co-authors because it's linked to the functional uto calculus. And Harold himself has been developing some Tagar expansions. There are expansions based on this. So I will try to review all that. So the outline of this talk is first basic things on signatures. It will be in a simplified case. So it means just one spatial variable plus time variable. So some people call it a one-dimensional augmented one. Then going back to some basic facts about the functionality of calculus. About the functionality of calculus and showing the different expansions of functionals that we can have with one that we call the intrinsic value functional, which seems to be novel, but I would not be surprised that it's well known. So maybe this assembly here will be a very good one to tell me. So the whole work is a joint work with Joint work with Valentin Tissodaguette, who's a PhD student at Princeton, and he has been interning with me twice. He's a Bloomberg Fellowship. He's recipient of a Bloomberg Fellowship PhD, yes, college grant. Okay, so signatures, it's a simplified case, as I say. It's just one-dimensional augmented one. So, as you know, signatures are started of each iterated integrals with respect to those variables. So, here, we have a very simple alphabet because it's two letters, t and x. T for time and x is the spatial variable. We will look at words in this alphabet tx that we recode by a zero and one. T would be zero and x. T would be zero and x would be one, so it's more familiar, sort of binary strings. A typical example of a signature here for a five-letter word. So, as you know, it's disordering of the different iterations, the different variables of integration. So, to make it very clear, and I think we are not never clear enough. So, the difference between this augmented signature. Between this augmented signature compared to a two-dimensional signature, it is that one of the variables is the time, so which never goes backwards, what we have on the left-hand side, as opposed to the two-dimensional one, which could loop like this. This is important because it makes it easy to have a reconstruction formula, and we don't have this issue of the tree-like equivalence. Like equivalence, which creates some problems when you know the signatures and you try to reconstitute the path. So, just very quickly, a simple visualization of the first words, interpretation in terms of different areas. So, if you have a pass, which is in this solid orange curve, so we can see, we can build this triangle which is split in different areas and identify. areas and identify the different to map the different worlds into the areas of those different sizes here. So I go quickly to the reconstruction problem. So if you have a certain path, let's say regular enough to have a signature well defined, later on I will show Later on, I will show that for our purpose, what matters is mostly to have paths with quadratic finite quadratic variation. But so if you have a path, you can compute the signature, which is depicted on the right-hand side, just ranked according to the length of the words. And the question is to know if we just know the signature, can we retrieve the past? So, as I mentioned. So, as I mentioned, usually we cannot in the multi-dimensional case, because essentially an excursion which is traveled forward and backward will be cancelled, and so it cannot be seen by the signatures. Here it's quite simple. If we just look at a subset of words, so we call them the Legendre words because it's linked to. Because it's linked to some polynomials. So if the worlds are just one, a single one followed by, let's say, k times zero, so it means if you prefer x and t k times, then we can easily compute the signature for a given pass, and it appears to be a weighted average of the path values with. With a polynomial scheme here. So if you do it for different powers of k, it gives you a complete system. And so the knowledge, if you want, of the L2 dot product, L2 product of the past times those function of times, it's enough to rebuild the past. So now I move to a primer on functional etocatinus for the people. Functional eto calculus for the people who are not necessarily familiar with it. So essentially, it's an extension of the eto calculus to functions not of the current value of a process, but of the path of the process and of the path so far of the process, as opposed to the Mariam calculus where we look at path on a well-defined fixed time interval. Here it will Here it will be applied to the current path, which is basically growing between today and tomorrow. So plenty of things we can do with this function ito calculus. It is to have extensions, basically non-Markov extensions of the classical results like Ito Formula, Feynman Cats, and Black Schultz PD. So for the people interested in options, essentially and thus. Options essentially under some regularity assumptions, it tells you that the classical trade-off between what traders call the theta and the gamma, so the time derivative, and the convexity with respect to the price. So this trade-off is respected for path-dependent options and path-dependent formula, sorry, path-dependent dynamics. What I would like to say is that. What I would like to say is that past dependence is very important in many applications, in particular in finance, where it applies sometimes directly, explicitly through the contract of the option for past dependent option and also through the dynamics. A lot of work has been done on, for instance, past dependent volatility. So it can be used also. So it can be used also to analyze the super replicating portfolios, so to have a model-free dominance. And it leads to a refinement of the crank of decomposition into a positive process being decomposed into two positive processes, increasing processes that never increase at the same time. So we have interesting problems. We have interesting properties due to the fact that the functional derivatives do not commute in general, and this is very linked to the signatures where the integrals obviously do not commute. And we will use this combined effect. We can get also characterizations, characterization of attainable claims. So, when the traded wants are easier. ones are either just dynamic strategies on the stock holding the stock or static position in vanilla options. It's linked also to the optimal transport problem. And also, and very importantly, actually, that was the initial motivation of the work of the functionary calculus, was the decomposition of the volatility risk through different strikes. Risk through different strikes and maturities. So now I have a simple slide here, but it's a very important one to distinguish between two different concepts. On the left-hand side, you have, so actually it would be can lag here, it's examples that are continuous and smooth, but basically its path defined on a fixed time interval. Fixed time interval 0t of all the same lengths. On the right-hand side, it's examples of paths belonging to the union of the sets of the first type for different maturities. So you see essentially it's different paths of different maturities and expressing the fact that as information is revealed through time, a path grows from where it was and into something it will become, but without. Will become, but without changing what it has, the path values. In terms of notation, so capital X will denote a path as opposed to small X, which will be the value of the path at a specific time. So we build the two, we define the two notions associated to this path of fixed lengths. Paths of fixed lengths and paths of varying lengths. So the first one, it's a capital T functional. If you look at the path of capital T maturity, so it will be a function that associates to any such path a scalar, a real value. So basically, it's what would be called functional in many classical setting. A classical setting. So it can be seen as a random variable in the Venus space or as the final payoff of a path-dependent option. So this is to be contrasted with a functional which is defined on the union of this path of different lengths. So it means it applies to any path of varying of smaller. Varying of smaller lengths, a certain value. So, to connect it with what I just said, as the example of the t-functional being the final payoff, so that the contract that tells you what you get according to the realized path. So, typically, a functional here will apply to the path so far. So, for instance, if you're midway before the maturity of the option. Before the maturity of the option, and you have a pricing measure, you can compute the price of the final payoff conditioned on the current path so far. And this defines, so typically it would be the price of an Asian option knowing the path so far. So, to give you an example here, so if we have a functional which would be, for instance, the running maximum. Here we have two paths that are depicted, that are displayed on the horizontal plane, and the z, the vertical axis, would be the value of the functional. So you see for any, if you stop at any time before, yeah, it tells you what is the value of each one. So, important things here: it's the functional derivatives. How do we Derivatives, how do we define the notion of Greeks in the option lingo for path-dependent options? Or more generally, how do we define differential derivative in the case of a function that depends on the path so far? So we do something which is quite natural here to define the space derivative as the impact on the value of the function. The impact on the value of the functional of a small bump of the current spot value. So, as I said, the past of the path is not going to change. And we just apply a little perturbation of height h and as usual we divide the impact by the amplitude of the bump and we take the limit if it exists. We do something similar for the time derivative. For the time derivative, except that it is extending the maturity of the past with freezing the current value, looking at the impact on it and dividing, normalizing by delta t and taking the limit. So just some examples here of different functionals on the upper row and the values, the functional values. Values. Maybe to make it simple, so if you have a mark of functionals, that means its value depends on the other current spot and price, spot and spatial value, then the functional derivatives correspond to the classical partial derivatives. But something which is interesting, it is that the derivatives, the functional derivatives are not commuting. A typical example, it is the integral so far. The integral so far, so you can check that actually. Sorry, you can check that it has the two derivatives are not commuting. In some sense, it's a characterization of path dependence or more precisely of instantaneous pass dependence. So now we have the Ito and Svatonovich formula. To my knowledge, actually, it was Actually, it was Harold who did the Stratonovich formula, but mostly is an important contribution he made for the functionality of calculus. It was to loosen regularity assumptions on the functionals. So here we have, we follow Filmer. There are some technical difficulties because we have to show that some Because we have to show that some integrands actually can't be written as the derivative of something else. But so, what we get is, so essentially we fix a partition, a family of partitions, converting here with a mesh going to zero, and we define a path which is basically a finite quadratic version along this sequence of partition. Along this sequence of partition, if the sum of the square converges. So, Ramakron and the co-authors have been working on it and showing a functional pathwise Ito formula. So, we, yeah, with Valentin, so we did the same thing for functional pathwise Stratonovic formula. And yeah, so basically we Basically, this is the former stuff, so it's a bit technical. It's to show that it can be done. So, something which I think is quite interesting is to look at what happens when we compute functional derivatives of different integrals. So, obviously, for signatures, it will correspond to the third case, the last case, the straton of each one. So, for the first one, the Riemann integral. First one, the Riemann integral, there's no specific surprise. If you differentiate with respect to time, you have the integrand to the variable, you get zero. It's the other way around for Ito and the Stratonovic. Just for Ito, it is the X derivative is actually the integrand valued at T minus. And this is important because it means that, for instance, the It means that, for instance, the second derivative will be zero as opposed to Stratonovic, where it will have what we would expect in the classical calculus. So we can apply it recursively together for signatures. So we can compute. Actually, we establish an interesting property. So essentially, the computer. Essentially, the conclusion: so the last but one line: it is that the functional derivative with respect to a word gamma applied to a signature corresponding to a world alpha, an element of the signature. So it will be non-zero if and only if actually the world alpha is ending by gamma. And in this case, when you differentiate it, so you essentially. So you essentially eliminate the last letters of each word are cancelling and you're left with S beta. In particular, if the derivative at an initial point x0, so of a length 0, it's non-zero only if s beta of x0 is non-zero, which means that Which means that beta has to be the empty word, and the two words alpha and gamma were equal. So we will apply it for when we study the signature spanning. So if we fix a maturity T, we look at two sets of words, so a kids would be the space generated by the elements of signatures. Elements of signatures of words of length at most k and b k it's when it's exactly equal to k. So actually they generate the same space and yeah as we can see for instance the s01 which is the integral of t dx can be by integration by part expressed into terms of a two Expressed in two terms of two other ones. So when we look at the letters, the words of Lancashire exactly equal to k, then the two to the k corresponding signatures are linearly independent, but the short words are basically covered by the long words. Still, we will see that when we do not fix the maturity T. not fix the maturity t then it's not true and actually all the words generate are independent and their signature are independent but for a fixed t so we have different ways to generate bases so we have to pick two to the k worlds and in the in the worlds of In the world of length lesser than k. And if you want to have an incremental basis, basically you have a couple of different ways to do it. But a nice choice that we pick, it's actually the words that finish with a one. So it has some virtues. So here it's the fact that the signatures are linearly independent. So if we have a Independent. So if we have a here, we do it with a finite combination of signatures being a zero for all paths. So to show that, it means that the coefficients were zero. So when we do, so if f is, which is a functional, actually, is equal to identically to zero, so it's a derivative, functional derivative with respect to any word beta as well. To any work beta as well. And so we apply it, we distribute it in the sum, and we use what we showed before, which is that the beta derivative of the signature alpha is equal to zero unless alpha is equal to beta. And so it means that it extracts only the coefficient of alpha in the sum, and it has to be zero. So it was identically zero. Okay. Zero. Okay, so now we move to the functional expansions. So I would like really to clarify in this pictorial slide the difference between different cases. On the left-hand side, a classical case, let's say, a function of one variable. So you start from a certain value x and you look at what happens when you apply a certain displacement delta x. You may do it for different delta x's. Delta x's and you essentially iterated the fundamental theorem of calculus to get the Taylor formula. In the case of the T functionals, or some people call it the static expansion because it corresponds to paths that are all the same lengths. So I would like to make it clear that an expansion which will mean to have a different To have a different around the path. So, if you have a reference path, which is the blue X path, so the different extension, the perturbations will correspond, for instance, to these three examples of the red deformations, as opposed to the functional case, which is dynamic, which applies to paths of varying lengths. So, typically, it will be So typically, it will be a deformation after a path. You have a current path X, and you look at what happens when you append to it different continuations, which may be of different lengths. So I just go very quickly through the classical Taylor expansion for the one-dimensional case because essentially the logic will be the same one. So you have the fundamental. So, you have the fundamental theorem of calculus on the top line. And so, if you apply it iteratively, so you see multiple integrals appearing with iterations also of the derivatives. Eventually, you have the well-known formula there. And so, what is interesting is that it's essentially a sum of terms where you differentiate k times and you integrate k times. And you integrate k times. So it will be the same thing in general here. For instance, just you have two minutes left. Yeah, okay, that's a challenge. Okay, so in the wiener chaos expansion, so you start actually from the martingale representation theorem, which was obtained by applying the functional util formula, for instance, to the conditional expectation. And you iterate it and you get. And you iterate it and you get a Veno chaos, so with a certain kernel within the interval. So you have the same kind of, it's only iterations with respect to X. And what you obtain eventually, so another way to write it, it's the other integral will be an expectation of the multiple Malayalam derivative. I think it has been established by stroke. So this is a new thing. Stroke. So, this is a new thing here now. Maybe it's not. You will tell me the questions, maybe. So, if we apply, so the idea is to apply iteratively the E2 formula or the Stratonovich formula to something simple. So the Stratonovich formula has just two terms. It's integral in dt and in dx. If we apply it to something called the intrinsic value of a functional, you get Value of a functional, you get actually the cancellation. Delta t is equal to zero, and delta x is actually a myama derivative. So it's something very simple, a single integral that you iterate several times. And eventually we get this formula here, which is the sum of the iterated integrals with just a single and the iterated Malayalam derivative computed on the flat paths. Of on the flat paths. And now I finish with the Taylor expansion. So it's based by iterating the Stratovich functional formula, which has the two terms. And so when you iterate, it doubles the terms and generates a summation of all the words. And what we get, it is related again to the work of Flies and the literature of Oberhauser. Flis and the literal Oberhauser, but here it applies to so it's a pathway formula that applies to a concatenation of paths and with a different slicing and actually of the summation. It's remarkable because it really splits between something that depends purely on the functional by the derivative at on one path and the signatures that would apply to any path. That would apply to any path of any length that you add up, that you concatenate on it, which can be used for cupid or hedging. But as we are running out of time, yeah, I switch, I take this one off. And this is a summary of the different expansions here that you can compare. So, conclusion. So, signatures are very useful in finance. Useful in finance and other applications because it's the building blocks of past dependence. And it means you can approximate any functional with them. And people can use this in deep hedging, for instance. And yeah, essentially, here we showed two things for the expansions. So one is for the static case. So based on the intrinsic value, where we get this multiple integrals with respect. Multiple integrals with respect to the iterated derivative, and yeah, the pathways functional Taylor expansion. Okay, I'm going to stop here here. So here was the different references, and maybe we have time for one or two questions. So thank you for your attention. Is there a question? Okay, maybe I have a quick question. You have this, I think in the slide just before the final slide, you have these three expansions or that is one. So you say when would you use, for instance, the one with the signature rather than the ones? Yeah, actually signatures appear explicitly only in the Appear explicitly only in the functional tailor expansion. So the top one, the vener chaos, actually is quite specific because it's the expectation under a certain measure. For instance, at our Black Shores model, we have a certain volatility. And as soon as you apply it, it doesn't work path-wise in general. For instance, if you apply it to a path with a different volatility, it will not work. It's only for the path of that volatility. Uh, volatility. As opposed to the intrinsic value expansion, the functional Taylor expansion, which are really path-wise for any path, I mean, with this quality variation along the sequence of partitions. So, as you see, the difference between the two, it is that in the intrinsic value, you have an integrand in this multiple interval, and the iterated strata of each interval. And the iterated strata of each interval is only with respect to the x variable, as opposed to the functional Taylor formula, where actually it's a linear combination of signatures. So it means without integrand, it's directly the iterative structure of each integral, but with words which may have t and x. Actually, we have other results to connect essentially the Results to connect essentially the intrinsic value and the functional tailor, it's a bit less clear to connect it with the Vener chaos, actually. Okay, thank you. There's no other question. I have one quick question, if I may. Sure. Hi, Bruno. Nice talk. Thank you. When it comes to Stratonovic and Kadlock, it's actually Kudlak, it's actually quite a subtle combination. So, most people think that the correct way of combining Stratonovich with Kudlak is something that's called Marcus canonical, where you don't really have jumps, but you put in straight lines and somehow make it work. Do you intend to combine Tadlak and Strugdonovich here?
