So, since it came up already when I wrote the title, if there's something that I write on the board that is unreadable, that is very likely to happen, so please just yell something out. Yeah. Okay, so first, of course, I want to thank the organizers. This has been a very sort of interesting interdisciplinary workshop, including physics, math, wine, everything you could be interested in. So I was very, very happy to be here, and I hope that I can sort of tell you something interesting. Sort of tell you something interesting. I think I should close this, right? Okay. So in the first few days, I noticed that there were lots of discussions on the topics of quivers or 3D mirror symmetry, Higgs and Coulomb branches. So I thought I would structure this talk around this sort of circle of ideas. And you can sort of tell from the title, the generalization is going to be to something called non-Lagrangian quivers. Called non-Lagrangian quivers, which is something we talked about in the discussion session on Tuesday. So hopefully I can say something helpful. Okay, so the main arena where we will work today is a collection of quantum field theories with this is a fantastic pen, with a 4D n equals 2 supersymmetry. So this is a big collection. So, this is a big collection of things. There's a lot of data and so on that goes into defining this thing. But conveniently today, we'll only need sort of a very small sort of subset of this data, which I think is very easy to get a hand on without too much trouble. So, what do we need to know? We need to know a way to construct these things. And we would like to know some of the physics of these things. So, what are some of the physical properties? And then we can play all the games we like if we just know these things. So, first, I'm going to tell you some of the properties, and that's going to go to explain the first part of the title, where I write A equals. Where I write A equals C, which I expect not too many people have to understand immediately. So let's start with properties. So one of the most sort of important things about quantum field theory is its global symmetries. So if you have a 4Dn equals 2 theory, you have a global symmetry group. I guess the bosonic global symmetry group is SO2, 4. uh so times su2 times u1 times possibly some remnant part so this thing here is the thing that tells you you have conformal symmetry these two guys uh go under the heading of the our symmetry and this last one this f this is some This last one, this F, this is some extra thing. It can be there, it can be not, it can be different groups, whatever you like. And this is the flavor symmetry. So I'm just saying these to introduce this terminology, which I will use at various points during the talk. So this thing all together, this is the global symmetry of the QFT. Uh, of the QFT or the SCFT. Um, and the reason this is an important physical property, if I can just say it in one word, is that um, everything physical, so all physical observables. It's hard to write low. I presume no one can see it if I write low anyway. So, um, let me just say all of the physical observables of the theory form themselves into representations of this group. Representations of this group. So that tells you all sorts of things about the physical, the physical objects. They all have to form into representations of this group. Now, there are some other more quantum aspects to these global symmetries, which give you some numbers, and those numbers characterize the quantum field theory in a certain way. So if you take a 4dn equals 2 theory, If you take a 4dn equals 2 theory, usually you might think of the space-time as flat space. Usually think of it as R1, 3, and then everything here makes sense. But if you replace space-time with an arbitrary 4-manifold, non-compact, I guess, M4. Non-compact, I guess. M4. Then the conformal symmetry, this guy is broken. This guy, well, this guy contains SO13, and SO13 is the isometries of R13. And this gets broken if you put it on a general format fault. Okay, so conformal symmetry is broken. It's broken. And the way that conformal symmetry breaks is capture. That conformal symmetry breaks is captured by two integers. Actually, they don't have to be integers, two numbers, two rational numbers. So these are the A and C from the title, and these are called the central charges of the theory. So these. Um, so so these two numbers they're really an intrinsic property of the SCFT. The way I've presented it here, you could worry that they depend somehow on which space-time background you put it on or whatever. But these are some intrinsic properties of the CFT. So that's two objects that go to the physical properties. I also mentioned the global symmetry. And then if you have a flavor symmetry here, F, it also has an associated number. Has an associated number, which is often called K sub F. And this is called the flavor central charge. This is also a rational number. So, I'm not really telling you what these are physically. These are some correlation functions of, well, this thing here is the correlation. Well, this thing here is the correlation function of the flavor symmetry currents and so on, but it's not so important for the. Is it just one number or like one number for each? One number for each simple factor inside of F, exactly. So I will sort of suppress that because I'll only really consider things with one factor, but in detail. So in fact, we'll just take this tuple of data A, C, F, and K F. I think there will be one example where f is actually a product, and I'll tell you the two different kfs. And this is all you really need to know about a 4DN equals 2s CFT for the purpose of this talk. It's a Lie algebra and three numbers. Okay. Now, this data does not uniquely specify. Okay, I should be careful. This data does not uniquely specify a 4D supercontroller. A 4D superconformal field theory. Although it's surprisingly close. So, actually, tomorrow Monica will give a talk about some work about precisely what kind of discrete minimal set of data you might need to fully capture a 4DN equals 2 SCFT. And this is part of that data, but it should be extended. So on. So I encourage you to see her talk tomorrow for more explanation of this kind. Talk tomorrow for more explanation of this kind of physical properties that capture the theory. But for us, we'll just focus on these four pieces of data. Okay, so the motivation for everything that I will tell you today is to look at a set of theories where these two numbers are the same. Okay, why do I care about this point? There are a whole bunch of theories. All of these different things can be different numbers. Why do I care about the case where they're the same? Well, these things are kind of interesting. These things are kind of interesting because they behave like they have more supersymmetry. So, when you have more symmetry, what happens is there are quantities that you can compute, and those quantities simplify when you have more symmetry. And so, these theories, they don't have more symmetry. And so these theories, they don't have more symmetry in the sense of having supersymmetry, but the fact that these two central charges are the same means that there are a whole bunch of quantities which behave in exactly the same way as if you had more supersymmetry. So this is sort of an interesting corner of the 4dn equals 2 set of theories where you can actually compute things. And I think one of the nice sort of physical things that we would like to understand is precisely why these A equals C theories behave in this way. Theories behave in this way. They behave like n equals 4, y. You get sort of, I think, miraculous cancellations of different things that make these two things be the same. But I'm not going to talk about that today. I'm just going to tell you this is the motivation for considering the non-Lagrangian quivers that I'll spend most of the time explaining. Okay, so as I say, this is all you need to know about 4DN equals two series. So, if there are any questions at any point in time, please just yell out. I'm very happy to have some digressions on whatever, as long as it helps make things a little clearer for people. So, I said I was going to talk about quivers, but actually I'll talk about this thing here, non-Lagrangian quivers. So, these are some natural generations. So, these are some natural generalizations in a way that we will see of the quivers that we have seen throughout this workshop. So, there's a question for all of the mathematicians in the audience, which I think is nice to keep in mind. Which I think is nice to keep in mind while I'm explaining this, which is the kind of quivers that we saw before, they have a nice mathematical interpretation. In fact, there's sort of an independent mathematical theory of these quivers that is a priori unrelated to physics. Although, of course, it is. So an interesting question to keep in mind is this kind of generalized quiver, does this give rise to some interesting mathematical structure? And in what way can those kind of statements? And in what way can those kinds of statements be made precise? Okay. So, just to set the notation, I'm considering 4D n equals 2 S C F Ts. And you will notice that in most of this workshop, when we talked about quivers, we were really thinking about 3D n equals 4 S C F Ts. Maybe we were doing so silently, but if we were in the null, we knew this is what we were doing. However, there's a nice simple way to say you start up here and you compactify it on an S1 and you get some 3DN equals 4 theory. And this theory up here, well, it has a Higgs branch. I said I would talk about Higgs branches. This theory has a Higgs branch. And this theory down here, it has a Higgs Higgs Higgs. Here, it also has a Higgs branch, and well, it also has a Coulomb branch, and all of these things are hypercaler. And in fact, when you do this procedure here to create a 3D theory from a 4D theory, this Higgs, oh, I have color, this Higgs branch here is just the same as this Higgs branch here. And what we'll generally consider on this side are these non-Lagrangian quivers. Quivers. And then we have 3D mirror symmetry. And that gives us another 3D n equals 4 SCFT. And now you have, I'm going to swap them around. You have a Higgs branch and a Coulomb branch, and the Higgs. Branch and the Higgs branch here becomes the Coulomb branch over here, as we saw many times. Okay. And typically today, this thing here, this will be a Lagrangian quiver. So the usual thing that we're used to talking about. Now, on this side, you might have difficulty talking about these objects because. Talking about these objects, because you have to have some way of extracting this data from whatever this non-Lagrangian construction is. And that can be hard. But of course, if you know that there's a 3D mirror, which is a Lagrangian quiver over here, you can use the usual techniques. Antoine Julius mentioned them a few times, like the monopole formula to compute things, like the Coulomb branch here. And then you learn what the Higgs branch is of this weird, strongly coupled non-Lagrangian thing over here. Here. So, yeah, we want to take advantage of this. Okay. But now, before jumping into it, I should probably tell you how I'm defining this object, this non-Lagrangian equipper. I should emphasize that the concept of a non-Lagrangian quiver is not something. non-Lagrangian quiver is not something that you know I came up with it's something which has been known for you know a long time 20 years maybe maybe but before I tell you what a non-Lagrangian quiver is I'm going to tell you what a Lagrangian quiver is in such a way that the generalization is obvious okay so to describe a Lagrangian quiver you can describe a Lagrangian quiver, you kind of need to know what are the fields, the quantum field theory, right? What are the fields of n equals 2 S C F T? Well, you have vector multiplets. And these are really just, you think of these as your gauge fields. You know, these are the photons or the gluons if you. If you have some familiarity with sort of particle physics terminology, this comes with a choice, a choice of Lie algebra, simple Lie algebra G. Okay, so in Quiver language, I'm going to write this just as a node with G. With G. And in the other River language, you would write this again as a node with G and a self loop. Okay. Okay, that's the easy one. The other thing we have to talk about is hypermultiplets. So these things, in sort of typical field theory language, you know, these are the electrons. Electrons, the quarks, et cetera. So these come with a choice of a whole bunch of groups, G, I, R, I, and a bunch of representations. I don't know what the best way to write this, but you have a whole bunch of groups or a whole bunch of algebras and a whole bunch of representations. There's a little technical condition, which I'll just tell you, which is that these Ri need to be pseudo-real representations. That's something which follows from the n equals 2 supersymmetry. So for example, for example, let me give you a really simple example. Take a hypermultiplier with g equals su, let me do 2k. 2k and the representation is just the fundamental plus the anti-fundamental. And that gives you enough data to define a hypermultiple. That's going to happen many times, isn't it? So this thing here in quiver language is sort of a stupid quiver because it's just a framing. It's just this. But for But for, I don't think there's sort of a general prescription for an arbitrary representation and so on, what you should write in the quiver, but mostly we'll be thinking about these things with fundamentals, in which case you write them as little boxes. Okay. It's a good start. Yes. A little key. Yes. So I am. There is a very unfortunate convention. A very unfortunate convention, and I didn't want to change everything to little g's here because some of the notation really only looks sensible with the capital G's. But I agree, yes, I was going to make the comment, but I thought I could let it slip by. These are all algebras. They should all be little g's. And the unfortunate convention is people write big G's. But I will only ever talk about algebras today. Well, you could specify the group, and that comes like with picking a choice. Picking the global structure of the group involves picking some higher symmetry groups. And so you can have a vector multiplet, which is the same Lie algebra, but it has G or G mod the center of G and so on. You can do that. That's perfectly fine. But it's not going to affect any. But it's not going to affect any like local local operators of the quantum field theory. So I forget about it today. If you were to care about like line operators of the quantum field theory, of course, you would have to specify this. But if you wanted to give the Piggy flow one, for example, it's very important to specify the structure because it changes much that it does. Okay, just as a comment. Yes, yes. No, no, it's certainly true. You support this presentation. Yes. Then support the specific yes, yes, I agree, I agree. Yes, yes, precisely. Precisely, you can almost sort of see that here because if you have a global structure here, that tells you something about lines up here, and you can wrap a line on an S1 to get different kinds of particles down here and then change the story. Good. So, the thing to note, which is sort of a very obvious fact, but a Is sort of a very obvious fact, but a hypermultiple on its own, a free hypermultiplet, like this box here, is an S CFT. Okay, it's a stupid SCFT because it's not an interacting SCFT, but it is itself a superconformal field theory. And it has a bunch of global symmetry. And it has a bunch of global symmetries. So it has global symmetry: G1 times G2 times whatever is here. Okay, so what is a regular quiver? I shouldn't erase that one. Yes. I mean, it's sort of stupid because once it's free, you know, you could write down an SUK times SUK symmetry, which is really just an SU2K symmetry. But at least, I guess what I really mean is that there is a global symmetry which at least contains this as a subgroup. It's probably the correct thing to say. It's it's probably the correct thing to say. Okay, so let's write this quiver. This is one we've seen several times. And again, and I'll say it precisely once in the more in the other language. This is this. I'm not going to draw dashes. It's this thing, but I will not use this. I don't know, Mickey Mouse, but I will use this thing here. So, what is this? This line it's a hypermultiple in the representation as in SUN. As in SUN with the fundamental, SUN with the fundamental plus fundamental bar, I won't write it. And then you gauge the two SUN symmetries. So I could say I take, I start with this guy with SU2N. And then what I do is I gauge out two SUN factors and I get this thing. So this is gauging. Aging global symmetry. And then SUN, SUN. So the way you construct a quiver is that you start with a superconformal field theory, which is the free hypermultiplet, and you gauge subgroups of the global symmetry. So, for example, here's another example. Say I start with three of these guys. Three of these guys. I take three conformal field theories, and I again do some gauging, and then I can create a theory which looks like this. S U N, S U N S U N And that's a nice regular quiver. Okay. Okay, so what is the procedure? Build a quiver. So you take a collection of SCFTs with flavor symmetries. Symmetries. In this case, you might say the collection of SCFTs, one option is that it's free hypers and gauge. But now, an obvious question presents itself to you. Why are you restricting yourself to just considering gauging global symmetries of free hypers? You could take Free hypers. You could take some other arbitrary 4dn equals 2 superconformal field theory with some arbitrary ACFKF. And as long as it has a global symmetry, a flavor symmetry F, then you can start gauging bits of it. And that's a new 4DN equals 2 theory. Okay, there's a technical condition I'll get to in a minute. But in general, the picture I would want to say is I start with a theory which I could call X of G. So this is some 4DN. So, this is some 4dn equals 2. It has AC. The flavor symmetry here now is G, and it has some flavor central charge. And then I can construct a new theory, which I could draw as a sort of pseudo-quiver, like this. Where all I've done is I've gauged the flavor symmetry of the SCFT. And this will be sort of the prototype for what we call non-Lagrange. Sort of the prototype for what we call non-Lagrangian corpus. Yeah, indeed. Okay, so this is a non-Lagrangian curve of X itself. This is a non-Lagrangian superconformal field theory. You could also make X itself, by the way, an interacting Lagrangian superconformal field theory. This is a perfectly sensible thing to do. But then, of course, you just write the full Lagrangian. But then, of course, you would just write the full Lagrangian quiver and you would sidestep all of this discussion. Okay, so are there questions about the sort of overall picture here? Because now I will dive into defining some axes of interest and then constructing actual theories. So, yeah. So, I guess you're going to engage in several approaches, right? Yes, yes, precisely, precisely. Yeah. Uh yeah, G tilde inside of G. But yeah, after you do it, the theory is not necessarily compatible anymore. Indeed, indeed. So I will write the condition, I think, on the next slide. So there's a condition for making the theory conformal, and it just means that basically all of these kgs of all of the different theories that you gauge together have to sum up in a particular way. So, this example, actually, regardless of what you put here, this is basically never a conformal. But the more general examples we'll get to are. I can't see anything in the page, so it chooses the both flavors of the code. Yes. I think that adds to this negation of both flavors. Yes, precisely. Yes, precisely, precisely. I let me just redraw. And I just draw like this. Of course, I could have chosen to gauge a subgroup of G instead, but this is just a sort of prototypical example. Okay, so what should we replace the free hyper with? So I told you at the start that 40n equals twos are a big world and that all we need to do is give you some way of constructing them. If you have some kind of family of theories, you can start playing interesting games. So the ones we'll think about today are the ones that Max also discussed yesterday. And these are the class S theories. Uh, and these are the class S theories. So, a class S theory is a 4dn equals 2s C of T that you construct in the following way. It has oh, I have color, it's fantastic. So, I have uh let me write something and then you don't like the color? Okay, okay, I will just do purple. Okay, so I write it very schematically like this, and each of these objects is something. So this, this S of G, this tells you that you start with what's called the 60 two comma zero S C F D of type G. Of type G. Now, there's a nice notation here which I can't quite capture with my pen. This G is math frac. This G is not math frac. I hope that's entirely obvious today. So this is some six-dimensional quantum field theory. All you really need to know about it for this discussion is that G is some AD Ely algebra here. These are a factor of the. Algebra here. These are a family of sort of, well, very complicated but very simply classified theories where they're really just labeled by an AD Ely algebra. So you take that theory that's in six dimensions. This tells you you do what's called a twisted compactification. On Genus G, Venus G N punctured Riemann surface. So this takes you down from six dimensions to four dimensions. The twist tells you you can preserve n equals two supersymmetries. It's just a construction. And then you have to get all of this data. This is the data describing the punctures. Punctures. So, the data describing punctures, which you could put on these things, is basically classified. So, there are regular punctures, in which case this data is just nilpotent orbits of simple Lie algebras. Simple Lie algebras. Or you have something called irregular punctures, which actually Max also talked about. So I shouldn't need to say too much. I'll just kind of say in quotes, these things correspond to wild holes of the hitching system. I haven't told you where a hitching system or anything comes in at the moment, so I'm just putting this in ports so that you don't. So, I'm just putting this in bolts so that you don't ask me any questions, and these guys are tame. So, these things: so, this gives you a 4D n equals 2 s cft. And the good thing about this construction is that you have a lot of geometrization. So, geometrization means that a whole bunch of the physical properties of this theory, which might be this non-Lagrangian, strongly coupled, difficult to get a handle on in the usual ways, theory. Usual ways. Theory, a lot of these properties can be extracted just from knowing that it comes from this construction. So the data of a nilpotent orbit, that's very much under control. The data of a Riemann surface is very under control. And you can write, for example, especially this tuple of data here, AF. You can write all of this information just from the information that I've written down on the board here. So you can read off all of these. Board here. So you can read off all of these physical features very easily. Okay, let's look at an example. So I take a genus zero. So, I take a genus zero human surface with three punctures. I'll draw like this. It's a surprised man. So the axes refer to a maximal, what are called maximal punctures. Actually, I got it the wrong word. Let me call them full punctures. And these things in the Nilfolden orbit language that I told you describes. Putin orbit language that I told you describes these things just correspond to the maximal milpovan orbit of G. And now I'm mixing notation. Capital G is the same Li algebra as math frag G. Okay, and this guy, this is what's called the simple functor, which corresponds. Which corresponds to what's called the subregular and you'll put an orbit. So obviously I have to pick the G, and then I specify the Riemann surface, the genus, the punctures, the different descriptions of the punctures. So this theory, it has some A and C, which I won't tell you. It has a flavor symmetry, which is G left times G right, where G. Where g is g, and it has levels which are kg left is two times the dual coxsetter number of g and k g right is two times the dual coxsetter number of g. Okay, so you mean sub-regular level or the minimum level? Uh I think I mean sub-regular. It's the one that one before the bottom. And the other is here. Bottom. This puncture is zero. This puncture is G of A1, I think this is what it's usually called. It should not be the maximum equal point. It should be that zero. Yeah, so there's an unfortunate convention going on here. So if I draw, you know, in the hazard, I draw the next picture. The next video, okay. That's not what I want. Exactly. It cannot be maximal subject because maximal is regular. Okay, I want to write like this then because I don't want to try and figure out the name. I want the dual of the subregular nilpotent orbit, which is the one just below the bottom of the Hasse diagram. Probably what I want to say is this is the Hitchin subregular nilpotent orbit, and this is the Naum maximal nilpotent orbit. Maximal, they'll put an orbit. Next to minimal. So the minimal one means no puncture. Ah, perfect. Yes. So yeah, so this guy here is corresponding to the partition one to the n, and this guy here is the partition n minus one, one. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. This is what we call it trivial and subregular, but okay, it's a trivial matter. Yeah. Okay, but it's a proofless math. Yes, yes, exactly, exactly. Okay, um, in fact, this theory is a perfect example because when g is equal to su n, this theory here, which I now just draw like this, and you remember it's this construction, this is just equal to a free hyper. It's actually this. SU2N. But when G is not SUN, it's an honest interacting quantum field theory. It's a non-Lagrangian thing. So you can see why you could suggest that this thing here is a generalization of a free hypermultiple. It's a generalization of matter. So sometimes these things go under the name of conformal matter because they behave like matter, but they're not matter in this conventional Lagrangian. All matter in this conventional Lagrangian sense. Okay, so now let's just play our game. Let's call this theory T G G. And you can start asking about gauging some of these G's. So what I want to do, I got rid of the example, but I can say take T, what I want to do. Let's take three of them. TGG, TGG, TGG. G and then I can gauge together like this: G G, like this. And this is a new 4D. In fact, this is a superconformal field theory, as I'll explain in just a moment, with the flavor symmetry G times G, because you see there are two G's left over. I've gauged both of these, and one and one. So we can start building these kind of non-Lagrangian quivers in this minute. So now I will just. So now I will just quickly come to Andy's question and spell out one important condition that's needed for this, for the kind of quivers that you write down to be conformal. So let's say we have a non-Lagrangian quiver where we take a bunch of superconformal field theories, and let me call them x1g, x2g. And let's say I gauge together a little n of them. Then the condition that this be conformal implies that for every gauge node g, you have to satisfy the condition that the sum over i is 1 to n k g, the i s for the i s x i. This has to be equal. Xi, this has to be equal to four times the dual Coxider number of G okay. This is just this is just a requirement of conformal symmetry. For those in the know, it's the condition for the one-look beta function to vanish. And you can see that this example here works because I told you that the level of each of the flavor symmetries here is two times hg. Here I've gauged two of them, so two times two hg is. 2 times 2Hg is 4Hg, which is 4Hg. So this thing is indeed a good conformal cover. Okay. So one of our building blocks, one of our strongly coupled SCFT building blocks, will be these guys here. Let's consider another example, which will be our second important building block with irregular punctures. Okay, so these are actually forced to be class S on spheres, where the irregular puncture I'll draw is the square. And as Max also said yesterday, an irregular puncture is associated to an integer p, which is greater than or equal to 2. And this one will also take to be the same maximal point. To be the same maximal puncture. So, just like we introduced this notation TGG up here, these things typically go under the name of a DPG. And they have, again, I don't write down A and C, their flavor symmetry contains G. And the flavor central charge is 2p minus 1 over p times the dual-Coxider number. So, this is another set of theories that you might want to think about sticking in quivers to construct these kind of non-Lagrangian quivers. So, here's a challenge for you. Yes, please do. With non-magnetic labor, we would start with a non-hydration theory, but if it's just the free hyperbole, it's the non-hydration. Well, yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is. So, so I'm sort of incorporating Lagrangian quivers as trivial examples of non-Lagrangian quivers. So, there's no fundamental difference here, right? The point is there is a building block that you can stick in. And usually, when you talk about quivers, you assume that those building blocks are free hypers. You could replace that free hyper with any SCFT. The fact that it was a free hyper was sort of not important for the construction of the Quiver. For the construction of the quiver. But after you do this procedure, you get something on the primary. Yes, yes. So, of course, here, if G is SUN here, this is precisely the equiver with two gauge nodes and two flavor nodes at the side. So, yeah, there are cases, there are also cases here where these theories, they're generically non-Lagrangian, but sometimes actually they are Lagrangian quivers, and then the whole thing is Lagrangian again. But that's sort of a very special subcase. Special subcase and same question for you just checking whether it's performer or not. Because it looks like checking the beta functions here, that it's performal. Yeah, well, okay. What I should have said really is this. If this is satisfied, then it is conformable. Yes, thank you. I'm not going to tell. I'm not going to tell you off the top of my head. I could maybe. Oh, okay. So they basically have two contributions. So in this case, the contribution is sort of there's a global piece, which is like G minus one, where G is the genus, times some, let me just call it group theory stuff. And then they have contributions from each of the punctures. And there's some contribution. Let me call it just delta A of the puncture. And the same thing here. Of the puncture. So I labeled the puncture, it's gone, but as like Y. And so each puncture has some contribution. So that just comes from you. So that just comes from you take the puncture associated to some poles in the Hitchin system, and there's a computation you can do that tells you precisely what these numbers are. And the same thing, of course, is true here. And it varies over delta C. So the nice thing, again, about the class S construction is everything sort of factorized. You have a contribution from the curvature of the geometry, and then everything just sums over the punctures. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then let me give you the challenge. So I forget, was this a one-hour talk or a 50-minute talk? Wow. Oh, fantastic. Fantastic. Okay. So take a collection of these theories TGG. And a bunch of these theories d p i of g and construct a non-Lagrangian quiver a quiver with no flavor symmetry Okay, so I've given you all the tools you need to solve this challenge now. So I'll take a break and then in five minutes. No, so this looks like a rather arbitrary question. Why would I ask this? So it turns out that this is interesting for the reason that I told you at the beginning. When you do this construction, the construction, which I will tell you in a minute, has a very interesting structure. And almost all of the theories that appear in this way, they have identical central charges. In this way, they have identical central charges. So they behave morally like n equals four superyang mills, at least in certain respects. So it turns out that this rather strange seeming question, you might ask, why did I choose these particular theories? There could have been other theories I chose. But if you look at these theories, which are sort of prototypical examples in class S, and then you just ask this question, you get a very interesting answer. And it's a fun little comment. And it's a fun little computation that we can do live on board. Okay, so this is the things to remember. That this kg is two times the dual-cox sitter number here, and the other one's written over there, so you don't need to remember. Okay, so let's start. Let's say that the colours are going to be a very important thing. Okay, so let's start. Let's say I take TGG. I'm just going to do this by exhaustion, because it's remarkably straightforward. Okay, and let's gauge one G here. And obviously we have to gauge the other G on the other side too. Okay, but now the number that you have here is not four times the dual-Coxhatter number, but two times the dual-Coxhatter number coming from these. So that condition there is not yet satisfied. So one thing I can do. So, one thing I can do is I can put another TGG on the other side. Okay, and then I have to keep playing this game. I have to add gauge it away, but then this one is not conformal. And eventually I have to draw this kind of circle. Okay, and what does this look like? Well, this looks like the affine A to. A Dinkin diagram should capitalize Dinkin's name. Okay, but that wasn't all I could have done, right? I could have taken, I don't want to do it, I could have taken G T G G okay, and I have to do G again here. But instead, you notice that if P is equal to 2, if P is equal to 2, this number is just a If p is equal to 2, this number is just a single hg. So, what I could do is I could do this: d2g d2g. And then I can play the same game along this line. End up with a g, and I can have the same, the same thing I can do on the other side, d2g and d2g. And that looks kind of a lot like the affine d-type thinking diagram. Diagram. Okay. And you'll see that those were the only things where, if you have a connection to one of these conformal matter theories, which contributes 2Hg to this number, then those are the only things you can do. The other three options are you have G, D2G, D4G. I'm hoping someone is. I'm hoping someone is doing this little bit of algebra in the background to make sure that I'm actually going to say the right things. There's a 236 as well. It's coming. I did them in a weird order. D3G. And then there's one more, which is D6G indeed. D3G and D2G. And that's the only way you can satisfy these conditions. So I said this was affine A, affine D. This thing you should think of as affine E7. This thing is affine E6. And this thing is affine E8. It's not clear why I chose to label them like this just from the fact that I drew them like this. So in So, there is a case, a very special case, where what happens is that each of these strongly coupled theories is Lagrangian. It's a special case, but it happens sometimes. And precisely when it happens is you get precisely a Lagrangian quiver in the shape of an affine E-type thinking diagram. So, these are sometimes called the Douglas-Moore quivers. So, that sort of motivates the naming. So that sort of motivates the naming, and that's it. That's everything you can do. So we sort of started calling these things gamma hat g, where this is some ADE, and then this is also some ADE. So this is a collection of 4DN equals two theories. They're realized as non-Lagrangian quivers. And they have nice properties. So let me write it somewhere up here. So if So if you only have the DPGs and the GCD of all of the Ps and the dual Cox center numbers is one, then this implies that no one can read this, right? This implies that the theories have identical central charges. This means they're interesting. No one can read this right. Okay, so that's the game you can play. And that's the game you can play. So, I haven't said anything yet about Higgs branches or Coulomb branches or 3D mirrors. I've just set up some non-Lagrangian quivers. So, now I'll tell you how to compute some things. And I will tell you how to compute some things for this thing where you have where this node and this node are the same. Yes. Yes. Generically, no. Generically, no. But on occasion, the 3D mirror is Lagrangian. In fact, sometimes even the S1 reduction is Lagrangian. But I don't think there is an S-dualization that gives you something purely Lagrangian. I was thinking of pendulums result with Tachika and Gay altogether, but that one has. But that one has flavor, or they took SUF3 with six flavors and they acolize it to Minahan and Shanzi with a weekly gauge assumed two. Ah, yes, yes, yes, right. I guess it's a generalist preferred. Precisely, yeah. So, so indeed, I don't think so, at least based on the they're based on the examples here which have class S descriptions, like alternative class S descriptions, I don't think it's, I don't see that happening, but it That happening, but it could. I mean, there could be some example somewhere where there is a Lagrangian frame. Oh yeah, actually, Monica gives a great example. There is a really, a really stupid example, which is like in D-type class S, it's just a Lagrange incorporation. Exactly. It's just a Lagrangian quiver, exactly. Uh, I'm gonna have to apologize because I think I broke your pen. Oh, no, I fixed it. Okay, but I fixed it. It's okay. I have $100 left at the store, so I can get you many pen. Okay. Okay, so in fact, this theory here: D2 SU3, SU3. SU3 D2 SU3 D2 SU3 E2SU3. This theory has an alternative description. It's not Lagrangian, but it's useful. It's also a non-Lagrangian quiver, which is, let me draw it. Let me draw it in sort of classic nice language. And now I want to draw these like this. So these are the now simple SU3 twisted punctures. Punctures. So this means they correspond to, well, okay, it's not so important. There's some partitions. But these two blobs are now strongly coupled SCFTs and there's some gauge theory in the middle. And this thing, because there's a class S description directly in this way of this theory, you can actually see what happens when you compactify this thing on a circle to get a three. This thing on a circle to get a 3Dn equals 4 theory. And there you get a quiver that looks like this. It's a nice star-shaped quiver. U1, U1, U1, U1. And in the middle, we have SU3. Okay. Now, if we think about what Julius told us yesterday, you can compute the balance of this node in the middle. The balance of Of this node in the middle. The balance of this node in the middle is 4 minus 6 is equal to minus 2. So, this is what Gaudo and Witten call bad. So, what this means is that in this theory, there are some operators, monopole operators, whose R charge under the R symmetry that I told you about at the beginning appears to be negative. So, that signals there's something pretty sick going on. It signals actually that you don't have the R charge you think you have. You want to ask something. So, really, as you feel, you Is now will you su because for su the balance should get a plus one? Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but but yeah, right. In fact, you're right, because this thing is actually ugly, not that exactly. That was back on. Yes, yes, it is actually ugly, indeed. Um, Saria, another question. Why are the functions simple, as you feel? I thought there should be the regular functions indeed. So, so I don't know of a way. Indeed, so I don't know of a way to say to go from this description to this description. It just so happens that this theory here, so this three-punctured sphere here, this is a strongly coupled theory, it's actually a product theory, and it's the product of two of these guys. I don't have any understanding for why that happens. No, no, it holds it holds for SU2N plus one, the same the same construction with simple twisty beats. What it really does, the on its own will never actually have a class as the structure. So you need to by twisting and twisting it. Yeah, yeah, these are twisty. This is this screen is difficult, but yeah, yeah, it's twisty. That's all the trick. So this thing is ugly. It says four minus six is minus one. My arithmetic, at least, uh, perhaps, should be correct. Okay, and now you can take. Okay, and now you can take this thing and you can compute the 3D mirror of this thing. And this thing looks like it's SU2 with four flavors. So this is a SOE. And this thing, this thing, we understand what the Coulomb branch of this thing is very well. This is just basically an FI metaphor. So we understand the Coulomb branch. We understand the Coulomb branch over here. And so we can feed our way through and we can say, well, actually, we understand what is the Higgs branch of this. Good, good. So that's the ugly part. So it's actually this plus hypers, twisted hypers. But the interacting part is this thing. And this thing doesn't contribute to the Higgs branch on the other side. So then you understand, it's a good question. So then we understand the Hicks branch of this theory. And the Hicks branch of this theory is particularly interesting, which I will just say because I don't want to explain it, but because the SU3 gauge group on the generic point of this Higgs branch is actually not broken. So you get a whole bunch of fun statements where one of the techniques that you would use to compute the Higgs branch is you would compute something called the The Higgs branch is you would compute something called the Hall-Littlewood formula in terms of this data, and it turns out that fails in this case because the SU3 is not completely broken. And this is something you learn by sort of walking through this path of dualities and so on. Okay. Can you explain how you do the S1 and your violence? Ah, ah. So basically, you know the S1 reduction of this guy is U1 with six flavors or four flavors, so you can't remember. So you know the S1. So, you can't remember. So, you know, the S1 reduction of this guy is some 3DN equals 4s QED. So, that guy has a Lagrangian reduction, so you know how to do the gauging of the. We've got a paper by Aldai, Sicily, and Very Bonjour. Oh, it's in there, Benini. Okay, good. That's the reference. Very good. good that's that's the reference very good thank you um yes okay so i wanted to say one more thing which will maybe take another two minutes um so this i just wanted to explain that these kind of non-Lagrangian queries they appear everywhere they're actually the generic form of a 4d n equals two gauge theory and the Lagrangian case Um, and the Lagrangian cases are special sub cases, so there should be interesting structure going on here that I think is good to understand, and there's lots of interesting physics. Uh, this connection with n equals four and a equals c has a lot of fun things that I can tell you about later if you're interested. But I want to tell you about one generalization. So everything that I said was not really restricted to n equals two. Really restricted to n equals 2. This condition was, oh, it's gone. The conformal condition there was restricted to n equals 2, but you can play the exact same game for n equals 1. And the only difference I'm going to take is I'm going to say that my ingredients are the same n equals 2 theories. But instead of gauging them with an n equals 2 vector multiplet, I'm going to gauge them with an n equals 1 vector multiplet. So the difference here is essentially. Difference here is essentially that instead of writing the vector multiplet I told you was this guy in the full notation, I just replace that with an n equals one vector multiple where I write this guy. And now the loop is not implicit, the loop is not there. In fact, you can play other games where you can build things with multiple loops. You can build up to three with this picture. Picture. And so you can build all sorts of queries like this. You can ask to solve exactly the same challenge that I asked there for what is the condition when you want to gauge with n equals one symmetry. And in the end, you get a bunch of nice quivers, which look something like this. For example, you could have, say, DP1 of G, DP2 of G, and I draw it up to five because the constraint is that it goes up to five. constraint is that it goes up to five dp4 of g dp5 of g and then you have a g here and then you can have a bunch of these little loops at the front and you get a bunch of bunch of n equals one on the groundian quivers that look like this these are these are nice these are kind of comet shaped quivers um as opposed to kind of the star-shaped quivers which i drew before uh so this is also an interesting generalization that one can do and and these are very That one can do. And these are very ubiquitous in the landscape of these kinds of theories. Okay, I've run over time. So thank you. I hope I convinced you that this generalization of quivers is interesting. And I'm always happy to talk about these things more. So yes, thank you. So thank you very much. I feel like already. There are still already many questions, but is there a few more? Hi, about the incomplete Hicksing. So for these non-Lagrangian theories, do you have any way to tell whether there would or wouldn't be incomplete Hicksing? Because you could compute, as you said, how little would, and it gives you the wrong answer, because there you assume there's complete Hicksing. Well, no, no. So you can compute how little would, and it gives you the wrong answer in a way that tells you. And it gives you the wrong answer in a way that tells you there's incomputing. So if you compute the whole Littlewood formula, you'll see that there are minus signs. And there you see that this corresponds to some d multiplier on the expression. Okay, I have a very short question since the mic passes. I just didn't get if all the theories have able to see in the in almost all. So the ones that satisfy, I wrote there's some GCD. ones that satisfy, I wrote there's some GCD condition between the yeah, yeah, you wrote it, you wrote it. Yeah, yeah. So it's so if the GCD is not one, then what's happening? So if the GCD is not one, then basically one of these DPGs becomes either a Lagrangian or partially Lagrangian. So in that case, you don't have A equals C. So the A equals C case is only in the case where the things I wrote down are really like non-Lagrangian in the strongest possible sense. Strongest possible sense. So, for example, I wrote down the case. So, you wrote the E7 case, for instance? Yeah, exactly. So, there was D4, D, D4, D2. And so, okay, this is a bad example. Well, okay, this is a fine example. So, if I take G to be S u 2n. 2n, then the dual Coxeter number between 2n and 2 or 4 is not 1. And what actually happens is that d2 and d4 become these Lagrangian quiver tails. And then this thing actually is a Lagrangian quiver in this case. Yeah, sure. And it does not have A equal to C. It does not have A equals C. So the ones that are Lagrangian, at least on some legs, so sometimes some legs become Lagrangian, not the others. If they become Lagrangian on some legs, they don't have A equal to C. On some legs, they don't have A equals to C. That's just what this DCD condition tells you. Thank you. Other I was just hoping you would give a partial dictionary for a mathematician. So you computed the Higgs branch there. Say I wanted to compute the Coulomb branch. I should get some modular space of Higgs bundles. The Coulomb branch here? Yes. Okay. Of the 3D Coulomb branch, exactly. Yes, yes. But like even the picture on the left where you did the class S surface thing. So like. S surface thing. So, like, it looks like I do P1 with four punctures with these like simple parabolic points. What does the line in the middle mean in terms of Higgs bundles? So I'm not sure if I, okay, I'm going to say the words. I'm not sure if this is going to mean anything in terms of Higgs bundles. I have a feeling Monica might translate for me. The thing that goes on here with the gauging is something called Drunfeld-Sokelov reduction. Called Drunfeld-Socklewal reduction. I don't know if that means anything, but those are mathematicians. But when you do this gauging procedure, what happens to like the Higgs branch when you gauge these two things together is some, yeah, there's the words are Drinfeld-Sakal of reduction, but I can't really say very much. Maybe Monica has more to say. Okay, what he means by that and Drinfeld-Sakala reduction in the And Drenfell Soccola reduction, and you can have the cohomology that gives rise as a charges, as a PRST cohomology charges. And those are the ones that are spanning over to give rise to the correct the cohomology structure that we need to have to build the hinge system over. And what he's really implying that is you're doing that computation on the 3D mirror side. So the alternative description, like that one that he wrote, is 40 equals to Higgs branch. And the reduction, you're still getting the ugly. Reduction, you're still getting the ugly Hitchin system with the, you're looking at the Higgs branch, which is not good enough. You're looking at the 30-mirror side, and that's where we're computing the Coulomb branch, which also has the Hitchin system description. The Coulomb branch here. Oh, that one. The Coulomb branch here actually is not even hypercaler. The Coulomb branch here is some complex space. Yeah, that's 4GN equals 2. So it's a. You want to compute the Colombian here. Oh, you can definitely do it. So, so that you can also. How about I can tell you actually? Yeah. Yeah, with the board. I mean, modulo the problem with the ugliness, you can use the usual formulas because it has a Lagrangian description in this special case. Thanks. I really love the talk and lots of lively discussion. So, this is good for the end of the day. So, this is maybe like an even more basic form. Like an even more basic form of Sebastian's question, just again on the mathematical side. You know, we're talking about associating various kinds of geometric objects with this. It's clear that there are some fleshed out known Higgs branches and Coulomb branches here. He just said, oh, in this case, Coulomb branch is not hypercaler, for instance. But just kind of going to fundamentals here. So suppose I take one of these quivers, one that's decidedly non-Lagrangian, not one that reduces. Decidedly non-Lagrangian, not one that reduces to a Lagrangian. And I want to define a variety associated to it, what I want to call the non-Lagrangian quiver variety. Yes. What is the exact definition of that? Like what quotient am I taking? If I'm honest, I don't even know if anyone has written down a tentative definition of such a thing. Okay, so by the end of today, we will have that. Exactly what we're saying. So when I posed this, I posed this question at the very start that, you know, hopefully mathematicians. Very start that you know, hopefully, mathematicians can keep in mind that this is a structure, and what you can say about the structure could be interesting. I think if you can do some like Nakajima generalization for this kind of object, that should be interesting, but I don't think anyone has but maybe it's worth you already have at least you know something that it's like the court and agreement. Right. It looks like Antoine has a comment too. I don't know if it's not an answer, but I don't know how much you can compute the vertex operator algebra from this class S theories, but then in From this class S theories, but then in principle, then if you know if you can construct this, then the associated variety would be the Higgs brand. So would be the answer to what you ask. For each of these gaugings of dpg that I talked about, I think we understand the vertex operator algebra. So then that would be the answer. This is the associated variety to this. So I didn't tell you something cool about the vertex operator algebra, but let me do it. I said several times that there's this connection to n equals 4 supi-mils. The point is that the vertex operator algebra of these DPGs. Vertex operator algebra of these DPG theories or of these gaugings like this, when they have A equals C, the vertex operator algebra is basically the same. In that sense, I mean there is a gradient vector space isomorphism between that vertex operator algebra and the vertex operated algebra of n equals four super n mils. That's a really truly important case of E6 hat S2. Yeah, that's all yeah, the only case that's been explicitly demonstrated and shown was E6 hat S. Demonstrator and shown was E6 hat SU2 case. None of the rest. We are working in progress at the moment. We can't, we don't know yet. Okay, the even more correct statement, which Monica wants me to say, is that if you compute the sure index, which is the character of the VOA, then the statement I made is true. But of course, you have to still actually verify that there is an isomorphism between the VOAs. And those are still for the 4DN equals 2 one, the gamma hat G there's not the 4DN equals 1 type. The comma shape quiver, like these are not. The column-shaped covers like these are not well. That was actually the answer. Although, although I have a super basic question, if you don't use the Gaioto curves and it's not Lagrangian, how do you define gauging? We usually associate that to adding a term, you know, J coupled to a some gauge field. Oh, yeah. Lagrangian. Here, you don't have that, and you don't want to use the Gaelto curve, or you can't always. So, why do you say? Always sorry, why do you say can't use that? There is an effective Lagrangian of the gauge theory which contains a coupling of the flavor current to the new vector multiple. You mean away from the SCFT point or what do you mean? So DPG, so this theory as an SCFT, I mean, maybe I don't quite understand. So this theory as an SCFT, it has a moment map. The moment map is a perfectly good operator of the Is a perfectly good operator of the SAFT. So I can write down an effective Lagrangian involving the newly introduced vector field that just couples that to J. Is there some subtlety I'm not thinking of there? So it's an IR infective theory. Well, it's a conformal gauging. It's a conformal gauging. Right. So I'm free to write it down. If you do the n equals one case, you have to worry a bit more about this. Adding a Lagrangian term to something that didn't have a Lagrangian to begin with. I didn't have a Lagrangian to begin with. That's what's got me confused. Well, that's okay. The Lagrangian just couples things together. It doesn't make it Lagrangian, it's just a coupling. There's still an effective action. There is an effective action. Well, maybe it's incomplete. Maybe it's not really describing the full theory. I think Andy wants to know. It's not about having an effective Lagrangian, right? We do this kind of thing. Having an effective Lagrangian, right? We do this kind of thing all the time. Sometimes you have a non-Lagrangian theory and you want to make a deformation of it. To make the deformation, you need a marginal operator. Sometimes people informally say that you add that operator to the Lagrangian. That's nonsense if you don't have a Lagrangian. But nevertheless, it makes sense to talk about deforming the theory by that operator. Again, the same way, if you have a theory that has a global symmetry, you can talk about gauging that global symmetry. It's not a global symmetry of a Lagrangian, but there's no Lagrangian because there's no Lagrangian, but we know what we mean by a global symmetry. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's what I was saying. You take the action, but you don't really have. S not integral of some action, not some s if you don't know, and you put in principle though, and then in the past integral, you add a j integral. I'm not at all sure whether that's true that there is an S and we just don't know it, or whether maybe there isn't. I think there should be an action. The action should be. It's just there's not a Lagrange. Well, okay, yeah, indeed. Well, one could maybe worry, indeed. But I think it's our, I think we're somewhat comfortable with the idea of you take a global symmetry and you gauge it, even without having a question about whether correlators may have a really a functioning imagination. What if you consider to gauge? Ah, okay. Narrowly, it should be this. Yeah, no, I think the statement is sort of more. Yeah, no, I think the statement is sort of morally you would write down a coupling and J what J coupled would be. And I will leave it with that statement. Probably one can make this more precise and talk about precisely how this enters in vertices and so here it has parametric transit. Sorry for the physicists. So the mathematicians are actually held hostage here. So now I think I Now I think I'm pleasing everyone before I say that this conversation can continue over the coffee break. So we thank the speaker again.
