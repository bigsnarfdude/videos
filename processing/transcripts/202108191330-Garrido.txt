I'm getting an echo. What did you say, Michael? You did or you did not? None. Okay, great. Yeah, I think we're good now. Okay, so the first speaker of the afternoon session is Alejandro Garrido from the Autonomous University of Madrid on how to make simple, totally discounted. On how to make simple, totally disconnected, locally compact groups. Thanks very much, Colin. And thanks very much to the organizers of the workshop and indeed to all the staff at Beer's for making this still happen, even if it's online. Thanks to all of you for tuning in at all sorts of different time zones, wherever you are. So as my title slide said, As my title slide says, I'm going to talk about, I'm going to give a general recipe for making simple TDLC groups. And this is a joint project with Colin Mead and David Robertson. So we're still, I'm going to present the stuff that we've done, and there's still more things that we like to do with it. Okay, so let's start with a little bit of motivation. Motivation. There are various reasons why we are interested in the following class of totally disconnected locally compact groups. It's a class that I'm going to call S for simple because we care about simplicity. So we want our groups to be topologically simple. So that means no closed normal subgroups. In other words, no continuous quotients other than the obvious ones. We want our group. We want our groups to be non-discrete, so it's perhaps fortunate or unfortunate that every discrete group is also totally disconnected and locally compact. So this is something that we're going to have to deal with. At some point, we're just going to shrug our shoulders and go, ah, discrete is too much. We're not going to deal with it. And we want our groups to be compactly generated the same way that we like our countable groups to be finitely generated. Okay, so this is the Generated. Okay, so this is the class S that we're interested in. And a question you might ask yourself naively, especially if you're, I don't know, a 19th century scientist, is can we classify things? Can we put everything into a little box? Like we did. Well, I didn't, but others did. For the finite simple groups, great achievement of the 20th century. And it means that we can have this beautiful. We can have this beautiful periodic table of finite simple groups, each of them in their families. And apart from the sporadic things, you know, lots of things are known about them. So we can pretend that we can do chemistry with finite groups, finite simple groups. Well, we can't, for the groups in S, totally disconnected, locally compact, compactly generated, non-discrete, topologically simple groups, it looks like more. It looks like more than chemistry, we're going to be doing biology. And in fact, we're still at the early stages of biology because we already know that there are two to the Aleph node non-isomorphic groups in S. That was a result that Simon Smith proved some years ago. So there's no hope of classifying them like we did for the finite simple groups. So perhaps the best that we can do is. The best that we can do is come up with some sort of taxonomy. And here's the, and I've chosen this picture from a 19th century book on biology, and this is one of the first trees of life that appeared in the literature. So, if you Google Tree of Life, you'll get one of these pictures. And I've chosen this to give an idea of what stage we're at. What stage are we at? We're still very much at the beginnings of this theory. So there's a lot that's being done, and there's a lot of possible separation into classes or kingdoms or whatever they are. But we're still out looking for more examples and more things to put in our tree of life. So that's the motivation. We're looking for more things to put in our tree of life of groups in S. Let me give you an example that you might find in the zoo. Zoo. And lots of people have talked about this group already, so I'll try to be quick about it. So, Nereton's group or the group of almost automorphisms of a regular tree is an example of a group in S. In fact, it's one of the prototypical examples. It was introduced already in the 1980s by Narratin. At the time, he only knew that it was totally disconnected. He didn't even know that it was locally compact. I'll explain the trick later because it will be. I'll explain the trick later because it will be important. And its simplicity was proved a decade later by Capujan. It's actually abstractly simple, not just topologically simple. So no normal subgroups, closed, open, other than the obvious things. So the point of view I want to give you here is not that it's almost automorphisms. I want to tell you that it's a piecewise full group. Other people use the word. Other people use the word topological, topological full group, but we deal with topological groups in the sense that they're groups that come with a topology that's compatible with the group structure. So I want to avoid that confusion. And we call them piecewise full groups. So how does this go? Well, it's the, what is this thing? It's the group of homeomorphisms of the boundary of the tree, so the Cantor set, such that you can find some finite clop and possibly. That you can find some finite cloak and partition of the canvas set, which will be finitely many subtrees hanging off from some finite tree that you remove. You can find finitely many automorphisms of the tree and you restrict each of these automorphisms to one of these subtrees and you see where that goes. So one goes to that green one, the orange two goes to that orange two over there. The orange two goes that orange two over there, and so on. And you see that whether if you can, whether if you try doing all of them together, you get a homeomorphism of the boundary. And if you can, you stick it in this set. And this is a group. Okay, let me just give you an example very quickly. I've cleaned up the picture a little bit. So something that you might do, and also to show that the GIs can be completely different and that they will not in general. And that they will not, in general, give you back an automorphism of the tree, even though, of course, ought t is included in this group. So, let's say that at one and three, we make this that I've highlighted. So, you see that definitely preserves adjacency. So, one is still two edges away from B, and three is one away from V. But maybe at four you could do something else. Maybe at 4 you could do something else. Maybe you could do a reflection, an edge inversion around this edge here, so that the 4 goes where the 3 was before, right there. And maybe at 2, at this sub-tree 2, you could do this translation by distance 1, one edge along this red right that I've marked out. And that will take that vertex here to the next one along, which is exactly this one. Okay. Okay, and it turns out that you can do all these things and still get a homeomorphism of the boundary, so that's great. You stick it in the set of you stick it in the full group. If you're wondering how does this match with the other definition of almost automorphisms, well, you might notice that I just said things like rotation. So that takes that vertex, that green vertex. Takes that vertex, that green vertex one to that green vertex one. But of course, I didn't tell you what happens in that rooted subtree there. So, of course, I can change things by an automorphism of this rooted subtree and still get something else. That's why sometimes people define it as, and equally with this two thing, right? I just said it's a translation by one. Okay, so that takes that very takes over there, but I didn't actually tell you what happens to the rest of that subtree, which. Of that subtree, which goes there. Something might have happened, and we're allowed to do rooted tree automorphisms. And so that's how the two definitions match. Okay, and so now I remove the tree, and I remember that its boundary was a contour set, and instead of looking at automorphisms of the tree, I look at anything that acts on the contour set, which I'm going to denote from now on and forever by x. So, you take your group that acts by homeomorphisms on the Cantor set, and to make it a piecewise full group, you do exactly the same thing. You take a partition of the Cantor set into finitely many clopens, you take finitely many group elements, you restrict their action to these finitely many parts, you see where they go. If, when you try to do all of that at the same time, you still get a homeomorphism of X, then you stick it in there. You stick it in the piecewise full group. Stick it in the piecewise full group. And we'll say that a group is piecewise full if it's equal to its own full group. By the way, ask any questions and interrupt. Just turn on the audio if there's any questions. Okay, so more examples. People know these, the Higman-Thompson groups are already full. So things of the sort, well, you take, you know, you. Well, you take, you know, you take some finite leaf set, like that one: one, two, three, four, five, six, and you take it to, I don't know, maybe, maybe that one. One, two, three, four, five, six. So it's basically the same definition that we had for Narrington's group, except that we're not allowing anything, we're not allowing any automorphisms down here. We've somehow Down here. We somehow give every ray an address and we keep the same address on the tail when we move this thing over there. So this is already a piecewise full group. It's not hard to see. If instead of another example of a piecewise full group that people have already encountered, even though they didn't know it, is if instead of looking at all automorphisms of a rooted tree, Automorphisms of a rooted tree, you only look at the ones where you keep, as I was saying, these addresses fixed. Then, when you take the full group of that, well, what do you get? You need to preserve the levels, but you can do whatever you like on every level. So you get a symmetric group on that level. And you can do that for every level. And so what you end up with is this direct limit of symmetric groups on. And you can maybe convince yourself that the correct copy of V. Of Vdk contains that locally finite group. Similarly, this is a subgroup. If you do the same thing for the whole subgroup of levels, when you take all these restrictions, if I take a restriction of a rooted tree automorphism, then it needs to preserve the distance to the root. So when I take its full group, the most that I'm going to. So, when I take its full group, the most that I'm going to be able to do is perhaps break their relationship between vertices at the same level. Maybe they were siblings before and afterwards they'll be cousins or something. So, the same thing. Okay, and it's perhaps, no, not that one. And it's you can perhaps convince yourself that this thing sits inside this thing. Sits inside this thing sits inside A or T. In fact, this is the group O that appeared in Chinese talk. Okay, so this is just to tell you that you already know examples of full groups. The other thing that you might notice about all of these groups is that they are either very close to being simple, and there's a reason why. So they satisfy this mild assumption that we will see in a theorem later. In a theorem later, that says that when G satisfies these mild assumptions, then the full group has a big simple subgroup. Okay, and this is why people have studied topological full groups or piecewise full groups in the past, because they're sources of interesting simple groups. And two famous examples were first a paper by Kate Yushenko and Nicola Monot, where they came up with the first examples of finitely generated, infinite, simple, and Generated, infinite, simple, amenable groups. And then later, Volodya Nikrushevich, he actually developed a lot of the theory, and his name is going to appear later on. He also used full groups to come up with finitely generated simple groups that are also torsion and intermediate growth. Okay, so these are the point is full groups is a place where we might find animals for the zoo. So here we are. So here we are. I'm not sure where they're. There we go. Here we are observing animals to put in our tree of life. Okay, so we're in the full group Safari looking for new simple groups. Okay, but we care about topological groups, so I need to tell you something about topology. And the first And the first thing is: okay, so this is just one slide to serve as a warning that if you choose the wrong topology, you will end up with something, okay, and you want your group to be locally compact with respect to that topology and also piecewise full, then it will never be a group in S. And what is the thing that you can do wrong? Well, you might do the most naive thing, which is choose the naive topology on your group acting on the cancer. Your group acting on the Cantor set. Well, you choose the naive topology on homeo X. So that's the compact open topology, and it's the topology that says that two homeomorphisms are close if they do the same thing on a big clopen subset of the Cantor set. Okay, if you use that topology and you assume that the group is locally compact with respect to it and also piecewise full, then the only thing that you're ever going to be able to get is a group which is countable. Is a group which is countable, locally finite, and residually finite, which is terrible. It's the absolute opposite of S. Okay, so this is telling you that you shouldn't use that topology. You shouldn't use the most naive topology. But I can hear, I can probably, I'm guessing that behind those little boxes, there are a lot of people scratching their heads and going, but hang on, people told us. Their heads and going, but hang on. People told us that you just told us that Neratin's group is a group in S. So, where is this topology coming from? Okay, well, this group does admit a non-discrete TDL group topology. And the reason why is because it commensurates some compact subgroup. It commensurates the stabilizer in OT of some vertex. And of course, this is nothing other than. Than the group of rooted tree automorphisms, this thing, which is, of course, a compact group, it's a prophyla group. I just put this reminder of what it means to commensurate something. So it means that for every almost automorphism, the intersection of the original group and its conjugate by this almost automorphism is an open subgroup of the group that you care about. And this is exactly what an open group does, right? What an open group does, right? If we wanted ALT to be locally compact and we wanted this stabilizer to be an open subgroup, then this is exactly what would happen. So if this is an open subgroup, then you conjugate it. Its conjugate is also an open subgroup. The intersection of two open subgroups is still open in OT, so it better be also open in the stabilizer of V. And it turns out by general theory reasons that this is also if this group satisfies. If this group satisfies this condition, then this is enough to induce a topology in Ott that makes this stabilizer of the vertex open. Okay, so what are these opens that we care about? Well, they are exactly the stabilizers. So let's look, they're exactly the stabilizers of finite subtrees containing V. So let's say here's a finite subtree containing. Here's a finite subtree containing V. And it so happens that in Ot T, the blue, the stabilizer of the blue tree actually decomposes as a direct product of rigid stabilizers. So that's all the stuff. So let's say this is U, that's all the stuff that only acts on this subtree rooted at U. Subtree rooted at U. Yep, so you can see that in OT, I can pretty much choose whatever I like on all of these subtrees, any automorphism, I can stick them together, and that's going to be exactly the stabilizer of this blue thing. Okay, so maybe I might try to give you an idea of why this is true, of why this, of why AOT commensurates. AOT commensurates. Well, what do we have to show? We have to show that the conjugate of STV by some almost automorphism contains the fixator of some subtree. They claim that the subtree that does it is the one in the image under G. So this one in the picture. Okay, so why is that? Well, I can take something in this fixator, right, and I can write it as a direct. Fixator, right? And I can write it as a direct product because of this thing. So I can write it in this form, ki's, where each of the ki is in one of these subtrees. And let's see what happens when I conjugate it by g inverse, right? So if I conjugate it by g inverse, I want it to end up in STV. Well, let's see. If I take some vertex here, what does G do to it? Well, it acts by G3, right? Because we're in the thing. Right, because we're in the thing labeled by 3. So G3 takes it somewhere. And now we can act by K3. Something in the rigid stabilizer takes it somewhere. Oh, and but we're still in this red thing labeled by 3. Okay, so now we can take it back by G3 inverse. So in general, what we see is that this conjugate is exactly the conjugates of the Ki's by Gi GI inverse. And the key point is that this is still inside the stabilizer of V. Why is that? Well, because at each stage, we've just conjugated by some automorphism of T. And what do automorphisms of a tree do to rigid stabilizers? Well, they just take them to other rigid stabilizers. Okay, so I took this rigid stabilizer here and This rigid stabilizer here and conjugating it by G3 inverse took it to this rigid stabilizer there. Well, that's step one: the fact that conjugating by this, the fact that conjugating by the thing that we're taking the full group off brings us back to some rigid stabilizer. Step one. Step two, I can stitch all of those rigid stabilizers together and get an open thing. Right? Stitching together all these rigid stabilizers gives me exactly the place later. Gives me exactly the fixed data of this subtree here. Okay, so this is exactly in there. Great. If you follow that, then you probably agree that this is the right definition to make to get the right topology. So we'll say that a group acting on a canto set is locally decomposable if whenever we have to do this for every single partition, right? Because remember that this has to work for every single almost automatic. To work for every single almost automorphism or every single element of the full group, and each of those comes with its own partition. So, for every partition of the Cantor set into clopens, we must have that the subgroups that are of the form rigid stabilizers of parts of the partition must be basic identity neighborhoods. So, this is saying that locally around the identity, so in an open neighborhood of the identity, So, in an open neighborhood of the identity, that open neighborhood decomposes the direct product, is where the terminology comes from. Some examples. Well, any discrete group, I said at some point I was going to have to shrug and go, mah, discrete groups. Any discrete group is locally decomposable because in a discrete group, the identity is open. Everything is open. So, it doesn't matter what these things are. These things can be trivial. These things can be, these are stabilized, they can be trivial, they can be finite. These are destabilized, they can be trivial, they can be finite, they can be whatever they like, they will always be open in the discrete topology. So, okay, this is not very good for discrete groups. Non-discrete groups that are locally decomposable are anything that adds on a tree with property P, T's independence property. This appeared in at least Simon's talk, if not others, as well. This is this sort of independence property, which is exactly the Property, which is exactly this, even. And more generally, you profine a branch group. What is a branch group? In case you don't know, well, this is basically the definition. It's something that acts on a tree, something that acts on a rooted tree. And we ask for two things. One is that the action be locally decomposable, and the other one is that the action be transitive on each of the levels of the tree. Non-examples, well, p-adic numbers, for instance, acting on themselves, after all, Acting on themselves. After all, it's a compact group, it's a profinite group. So, topologically, it's just a contour set. When it acts on itself, it can't have a locally decomposable action because the rigid stabilizers cannot be above. So, you know, it forces them to be trivial. Okay, if you followed the proof in the previous slide, then you should believe this proposition, which says that if we start off with some locally decomposable group, and then Some locally decomposable group, and then we have to chuck in some things that commensurate it. This was the whole thing about when we conjugate a rigid stabilizer, we get another rigid stabilizer. Well, okay, we can get away with just getting something open in a rigid stabilizer. If the group is locally decomposable, then the full group of the thing generated by maybe this G and this extra stuff also commensurates G for the reasons that I explained. So commensurating. So, commensurating by the thing that I said before means that we can take the topology from G and induce it up to a topology on the full group. And that's what it means for this G to be open. In particular, if you put the whole commensurator of G, so all the homeomorphisms of X that commensurate G, if you put that into this statement, you get that it's piecewise full, which I thought was pretty nice. Okay, that this is the only uh sorry um sorry what I mean is that okay we're gonna go yes exactly conversely it turns out that this is the only thing that you can do at least when you make the reasonable requirement that your TDLC group be psych and countable so psych and countable means that there's a countable base of neighborhoods of the identity Of the identity in TDLC world, it's like asking for it's like asking for countable groups instead of any groups. Okay, so it's a reasonable requirement to make if you're one of these people that care about Polish groups. So, TDLC Second Countable is exactly the Polish groups that are locally compact. Okay, and so the theorem that we can prove is that when we have the same setup, if you start off with something that acts on the Cantor set, you can maybe enlarge it to some bigger thing that contains it and commensurate and take its full group. Then that full group will be a TDLC group, which is also second countable. Second countable by lifting the topology from G if and only if the topology that you started off is locally decomposable. The topology from G that you started off with is locally decomposable. So this is an only if, and in fact this is the unique such topology that you can put on these two groups. On G and on it's the full group. Okay, so we've got the locally compact. Great, we've got the TDL. Great, we've got the TDLC and also the non-discrete if the group that you start putting in, if the group that you start with is non-discrete. So let's do simplicity and compact generation. So let's start off with simplicity and consider two of the examples that I gave you. So the Higman groups and this Diric limit of symmetric groups on those levels of the tree, they're both limits of symmetric groups. They're both limits of symmetric groups. One is actually, I have a technical way, an actual technical way of telling you that it's a limit. For Thomson's group, okay, maybe it's more of a hand-wavy thing. And as limits of symmetric groups, you might hope that they inherit some of the characteristics of the symmetric group, in particular, having a big simple subgroup, namely the alternating group. And this is indeed the case. So if you take alternating groups instead of symmetric groups in this direct limit, In this direct limit, you indeed get a simple group. And okay, and there's some alternating version of the Higman-Thompson groups that basically gives you a simple group. Okay, so now we're going to do exactly the same thing. So this definition is due to, I think, Polody Nikrushevich, as well as the next theorem that I'm going to show you. And I don't know where his inspiration came from, but this is, it's probably this. This is it's probably this, um, so okay. So, we make this definition of the alternating full group of a group acting on the Cantor set. It's the thing generated by all the even permutations of partitions. So, what is this thing? So, you take your Cantor set, as I had before, and how does the full group go? Well, you partition it into finitely many clopens. Infinitely many clopens, and you're supposed to act by elements of G on each of them. Okay, well, I'm going to ask that these elements preserve this partition, and moreover, I'm going to ask that the permutation that they do on the parts is even. So, this might be an example. Okay, and so you choose all of those and use them as a generating set. And so, the theorem that we've already approved is that if you make this mild assumption that the group that you start with acts minimally, so that means no closed G-invariant subsets other than the obvious ones. People say, you know, there are no, all orbits are dense. You pick a point, you look at its orbit, you take its closure. Pick a point, you look at its orbit, you take its closure, you get the whole Canture set. If you make that assumption, then the alternating group is simple. In particular, so for something, so for tree action, so for rooted tree actions, rooted tree action, this is the same as acting level transitively, transitively on all levels. Aha, okay, so that was definitely part two of our definition of branch group. Okay, so in particular. Of our definition of branch group. Okay, so in particular, if you have some profinite branch group, then its alternating group is simple. And so when we take its closure inside this full group, which we've already ensured that is locally compact, we get some topologically simple group. Great. Okay, so we've got two out of three. What about compact generation? Compact generation. Well, okay, so let's go back to the discrete examples. Thompson's group, famously finally generated, it's even much more than that. Finally generated will do. This is a big direct limit. It's of course not finally generated. What's the difference? The difference is that basically this one preserves levels. This one, I'm just going to do it in rough terms. The main difference. Rough terms, the main difference is that for Higman-Thompson groups, you have what I'm essentially going to call translations. You have these dynamics, you know, where you can shove things up and down. Okay, so the theorem is this whether it explains the difference or it exploits the difference. So in In countable world, in countable groups, we have this theorem that Volodya proved that if you have some finally generated group acting on the Cantor set and the action on the Cantor set is expansive, I'll tell you what that means in a second, then the alternating group of the action is finally generated. What does it mean to be expansive? It means that no matter there's a fixed distance. There's a fixed distance, there's a fixed number, such that no matter how close you take two points on the contour set, there's a group element that separates them. That might be something, for instance. And this captures very well this idea of V having translations and this. And this thing, not. And so, what is the key? Let me tell you what the key is. The key idea is that this full group is the group of invertible elements of some bigger inverse monoid of partial homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. So, what is it that we're doing? We're taking what is it? We're taking the Cantor set, you know, partitioning it into parts and taking all. Partitioning it into parts and taking all of these restrictions, right? We're taking the restriction of G to this part, maybe U1, the restriction of G to this other part, U2, and so on and so forth. So we have this bigger thing, this bigger bag of restrictions of to clopen sets, of group elements, and we multiply them if and when we can, you know, if the range and domain match and we invert them, because we can, because they're still homeomorphisms. Because they're still homeomorphisms. And then the only extra thing that we have is that we're allowed to stitch the pieces together. Remember, at the beginning of the definition of Neritan's group, of the full group, I said that, you know, if we can stitch all of these restrictions together and still get a homeomorphism, then we put it in this bag of the full group. So we're allowed to stitch all these pieces together so long as that makes sense, so long as that gives. So long as that makes sense, so long as that gives us still some partial homeomorphism. So, the idea is that this monoid, this inverse monoid of multiplying restrictions together when you can and stitching some of them together, this is finally generated as a monoid where you just are allowed to multiply things and then maybe perhaps at the end stitch them all together. This is finally generated if and only if the group that you started with was finally. That you started with was finitely generated, and the action was expansive. So, the point is: you only need finitely many elements, and this was the point of the translation: you only need finitely many generators of your group to get you down to whichever restriction you want. Okay, maybe that didn't make sense, but at least I've said something. Okay, so we. Okay, so we actually have to deal. Well, the first thing that we had to deal with was translating from groupoid language to monoid language. That was interesting because I don't speak groupoid. And the other thing that we had to deal with was we had to deal with topological inverse monoids. So, okay, this cool, interesting theory here, but I won't explain the details. Okay, so what do we actually Explain the details. Okay, so what do we actually prove? We prove that if you start off with some group acting on your Cantor set, which is compactly generated, it's TDLC, and it's locally decomposable. And suppose that the action is minimal. Okay, so minimal means topologically transitive. Locally decomposable is this thing with the rigid stabilizers being open. And expansive was this thing about. And expansive was this thing about different points being separated some fixed amount. So the action of the group is expansive if and only if this closure of the alternating group is compactly generated. But this turns out to be also equivalent, and this is via some TDLC theory. And so a lot of it comes from stuff that Colin did with Pierre Manuel Capras and George Willis. This already tells you that this thing is open. Sorry, that the alternating group is already open and therefore closed. So in fact, we didn't need to take the closure if the action is expensive. So this way, we get that this alternating group is compactly generated, simple, abstractly simple, forget, not just topologically simple. Okay, and it's an open subgroup of the full group. A comment: if you were thinking, okay, we can use this to maybe find amenable groups in S, which is an open question, then you can't, because if the group is not, the group that you start with is not discrete, then this alternating group can't be amenable. In fact, it's highly paradoxical, which is a big difference. Which is a big difference between the discrete case and the non-discrete case and the previous cases for discrete groups. Okay, so this in particular means, right, that this group, this AG, is an S. Great, so we found our recipe. Here's the recipe. You pick some compact group acting on the Cantor set and you make sure that the compact group, that topology, Group, that topology that makes it compact is locally decomposable. For instance, pick something like a branch group. Maybe you need something that commensurates it in order to ensure maybe you need to enlarge it by something that commensurates it in order to ensure that the action on the Cantor set is expansive and minimal. I should have written here that we need to take this thing to be compact. Compact, at most compact. If it's finite, then that's even better. That's definitely compact. Then abracadabra, apply the theorems. The alternating group that comes out of this machine is some element of S. And it will be non-discrete. Okay, so it will be an S if what you put in was non-discrete. So I have a few minutes, I think, to give you some examples. To give you some examples. Okay, I've been talking about profinite branch groups a lot. So that's basically what a lot of the examples are. Okay, so I said that you could pick any profinite branch group. Maybe let's pick something acting on a three-regular tree. So we already know, and I already told you, that if the that because the action is minimal, so transitive on every Is minimal, so transitive on every level, then the closure of this alternating group is topologically simple. That just comes from choosing the right topology, from being locally decomposable, and from Volodia's theorem. We didn't need to do anything except for the topology. But this is never compactly generated by our theorem because the action is never expansive, right? The action of the full group of Right, the action of the full group of a branch group preserves the levels. So we need something compact that commensurates the branch group such that the thing that they generate together is expansive. Okay, you can probably do better than this in a lot of cases. Doing better is something that we're working on. But the following suffices. So we have this observation that Klaus Rovin made. So he did it in a discrete case. So he did it in the discrete case, but everything follows through. Suppose that your group G that you start with, your branch group is regular branch over some K. What does that mean? Well, it means that there's some subgroup K which is open in G and it acts on the tree. It acts on the three regular tree and the three regular tree is self-similar, so I can put another three copies of K there and take their product. Acting on each of these three Acting on each of these three sub-trees. You can take their dire products. Okay, that's something, that's definitely some subgroup of tree automorphisms that stabilizes the first level. Everything still is in G and not just in G, but also in K and open, we'll say that the group is regular branch over K. Okay, so then it means that I can keep doing the same thing all the way down the tree. Okay, so Klaus Moever's observation was that this means that G is commensurable with K. So K is open, right? So it's commensurable with G. And K is commensurable with three copies of K, which is commensurable with three copies of G. So we've got a group which is commensurable to, in this case, three copies of itself, and therefore the observation is that. Therefore, the observation is that the appropriate copy of the Higman-Thomson group commensurates the group. In fact, in this case, you can actually do everything inside the tree. Okay, so this is enough for our purposes. So we can chuck in this copy of the Higgman-Thompson group to get an expansive group, an expansive action. This thing is still compactly generated, right? Because G is compact and Right, because G is compact and again Thompson's group finally generated, so the alternating group that we get is something S. Great. We don't, so for a lot of cases, so for some cases, this is already studied. So in that influential paper by Barner, Schof and Weigel, this was already done for the Grigorj group, or rather, it's Pro2. Or rather, its pro2. In fact, it was done for its closure inside the binary tree. And other people have studied these groups as well without necessarily thinking about abstract commensurators of things. In fact, it turns out that for the Grigorcher group, this thing is virtually the whole abstract commensurator. But this is probably not the case for most. not the case for most brunch groups. Okay, let me give you, I only have three minutes according to my, or two minutes according to my phone. So I'll just quickly, I'll just mention this without doing it in detail. Okay, you can do the same thing. It's basically the same idea, still branch groups. You can do universal groups, U of S, Berger Moses Universal Groups. They appeared in Simon's talk. Period in Simon's talk, and I think they might, I'm not sure whether they have appeared in other talks. And look at the stabilizers of a vertex here. So for instance, here if we take, say, U of A4, what we end up with when we stabilize this vertex is something isomorphic to the inverse limit of, well, what do we have here? We've got A4 acting at the top, and we've got. At the top, and we've got the stabilizer of a point in A4, which I think is isomorphic to C3. I've got copies of C3 acting all the way down the tree. So I've got C3, wreath wreath, wreath, C3, inverse limits of that, all of that stuff, wreath A4. Okay, this is definitely a profinite. Okay, and it definitely acts minimally. Great. So now all that we need to do is maybe chuck. Do is maybe chuck in some edge inversion here, something like that. Since I've chosen this thing at the top to be transitive, I can take this edge inversion to the other edges at the top level and then use the other use the other group elements to do these yes, and then use the other elements below to take that edge inversion everywhere else. The bottom line is that the thing that we generate is u of f, unless I've made some calculation error, but it's definitely expansive. So this is just another way of constructing u of f and saying that the alternating group of u of f is a group in s. But of course, this was already known to Pierre-Manucapras and Tom de Metz, who actually calculated what the abstract commensurate is of groups of this type. Commensurators of groups of this type is. So, this is just to say that this fits into, and they show that a lot of them are simple. So, this is just to show that this fits into our framework. And the last thing I will do is mention Walt Howe Ledene's colour narrative groups because I think they're fun. So, what you do is the following thing: you take a graph, like one, maybe let me. Maybe let me call it gamma. And it's a directed graph, and okay, and it's got arrows of different colors. Okay, and then what you do is you take the path space of this graph, and that gives you this tree, right? So what are the paths that you can go from from this circle? Well, you can do first, you can do blue, and then you can do two greens. The green you do triangles. So you have to do the past that you can do from triangle where you can do two reds and two oranges. Oranges and the red takes you back to triangle, and the orange takes you back to circle, and you keep going. This gives you a tree. Let's call it T. So you can take your group to be rooted things, right? If you choose the graph correctly, this will also be minimal and locally decomposable. This will also act minimally on the boundary and have a locally decomposable. And have a locally decomposable topology. But there's also some Higman-Thomps group thing going on here. There's an appropriate Higman-Thomps group going on, and we call it V gamma. So by chucking in the appropriate V gamma, which will be finally generated, if you choose the graph correctly, you can take the alternating group of that and get a group in S. And I think Vansproud had to actually. And I think Van Skroud had to actually. You can show this by hand, is the point. I thought this was a really cool construction, and okay, and this fits into our framework. And I'm sure that you can do other things and there are possibly all sorts of different things that you can choose instead of the whole Hitman Thompson crew to make sure that the action is expansive. And I'm sure that there are many other examples that we should be able to find. Maybe other people could try and find them as well. So I will shut up. Well, so I will shut up and thank you all for your attention. Thanks, Alejandra. Any questions? I guess just speak up. It's the easiest way. Let me ask if you said you are sure there are many other examples. Can you give some, can you specify some that you haven't seen, that haven't been seen before or some ideas about where you think you might find them? Well, the question that I've been asking myself is what do you need? Let me go back. So, for this example, I use this observation here that if the group is regular branch over something, then you can just chuck in some copy of V. But maybe you can get away with less. Maybe you don't need a Higman-Thompson group to make the action expansive. So, the whole point is that you need. So, the whole point is that you need this thing: the profinite group that you start with, the compact group that you start with. Okay, let me start again. You need to start over with a compact group, which is locally decomposable, and then adding only a compact set of things, the group that you obtain should have an expansive action. And the question is: what is the least that you can get away with? The least that you can get away with. And so, a question I've been asking myself is: well, what things commensurate a branch group that are not just, okay, the Hayman-Thompson group. Can I do something smaller? Or will everything the same sort of will everything give me the same group? Is this inevitable? I come from graphs that we call capillary graphs. So they're not trees, but they look a lot like trees. They have enough of a tree-like structure so that we can look at their automorphisms and their automorphisms. Yeah, but we're still working on those. Anyone else? Doesn't look like it. Okay, let's thank Alejandra again. Thank you. And the next
