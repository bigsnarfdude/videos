So, if you're familiar with this term, then it's more like just an introduction to what notations I use. But if you are not familiar with Dirichlet forms, I'll give a more classical example that will better illustrate what I mean. So, the standard setting is that we have a metric measure space XM. So, here X is So here X is locally compact and separable, and M is a radon measure with full support. So there's also a metric that I didn't write here because we won't use it explicitly. Next, I'll just fix some notations for Dirichlet form-related stuff. So I use EF to represent a Dirichlet form with domain F. Domain F. To define local weak solutions, we need like a local Dirich form, and I only consider a symmetric Dirich form here. So for the corresponding Markov semigroup, I use H T to represent the semi-group. And for the associated infinitesimal generator, I use negative P. I think some people use like L to represent the generator. To represent the generator. So, this is what, in the most classical setting, these objects are. So, associated with a Dirac form or with its generator, we have this parabolic equation or what we call the heat equation. So it's d dt minus the generator negative p applied to some function equal to zero. So, this is in the most classical setting, it's the most classical. Classical setting is the most classical heat equation. Okay, so our goal is to define local weak solutions for this heat equation. So in general, for weak solutions, as you know, it's like we define it in terms of integration by parts. So that makes this space a natural space to look candidate functions from. So this is if we So, this is if we fix some open time interval and we look at the L2 function space from the time interval into the domain of the derivative form. So sometimes I just call this space the f space and I write i cross x to represent the time space cylinder we consider. So this space, as a reminder, it is a Hilbert space and the inner product on it is On it is given by this formula. So we have an L2 integral part plus the integral of the Dirich form over the time interval. So up to here, it's good enough to define like what weak solutions are for the heat equation. Especially if we pick different domains for the Dirichlet form, we will be asking for different boundary conditions for the weak solutions. The weak solutions. But here we want to consider local weak solutions. So essentially, we want to only ask that the functions to be locally in this function space. So that's where we need to define these two more function spaces. So f log essentially means that the function locally can be represented by some function on. Some function on in the in the good f space. So, in other words, we want a locally L2 function, and for each pre-compact open subset, we have a good representative that agrees with the function on the subset. So, if we put a function that's in f log here, to make sense of this integral, we would need a function that has compact support. So, that's why we also need this f C. And that's why we also need this FC space that essentially has functions in the F space but with compact support. So these are basically the notations and concepts we will be using in defining local weak solutions. Okay, so I wrote definition in a slightly more general way that we don't really need to consider the whole space X, but we could just take an open subset omega. So if we fix So, if we fix some time-space cylinder like i cross omega, and we could define that a local weak solution of this heat equation on this time-space cylinder is any function u that first of all should belong to f log of i cross omega. So that just means for subsets of i cross omega, u is represented by the functions in the f space. Functions in the F space. And you should satisfy that for test functions, this heat equation is satisfied in this integration by parts form. Okay, so now I'll just give a kind of classical example of heat equation and illustrate what local weak solutions mean here. And the theorem I'm going to present is. The theorem I'm going to present is already interesting in this example. So let's consider a divergence form differential operator with just measurable coefficients. And we assume that this coefficient matrix is symmetric and uniformly elliptic for simplicity. So, because these coefficients are just measurable functions, Functions, we have to interpret this equation in the integration by parts sense. So, here the form that corresponds to this equation is given by this explicit formula. And I just put a subscript A to say that it depends on the coefficient matrix A. I'll also mention that we often call this integral like an integral of gradient. integral like an integral of gradient square or gradient so we call this integrand part the gradient square and sometimes we write it as gamma of the functions involved okay so for this particular heat equation what we mean by local weak solutions is that oh for simplicity I just take the whole space to be an open subset of Rn so Rn. So a function should first of all be locally in the F space. So in this case, it's the L2 function from the time interval into the domain of the derivative form. So in this case, it's the W12 space of omega with Dirich boundary condition. And second, the function U should satisfy that for any test function, so we could take smooth, compactly supportive functions in this case. This integration by parts form of the heat equation holds true. So, I think this is a good example to see more clearly that actually here there are more choices than just this domain to put here. So, I wrote here, for example, we could put w12 instead of w120. And locally, in these spaces, they are the same. So, that so in particular, there's no boundary condition. There's no boundary condition or initial condition required for local weak solutions. Okay, so for this particular example, it is known that local weak solutions are holder continuous in time and space. I didn't put like any people's names here because I guess this is covered in like the Nash Moser to Georgie. The Georgie class because it should be treated, it can be treated, for example, by the parabolic Harnock inequality. But I'm not exactly sure like who to attribute it to. But natural follow-up question for this holder continuity would be whether local weak solutions are actually differentiable in time. Or a more proper way to ask is whether the distributional time. Whether the distributional time derivatives are also like locally in this F space. And if the answer is yes, we can then ask whether the time derivatives are local weak solutions of the same heat equation. So in the next slide, I will write down or I will show you a theorem that says yes to all of these questions. Okay, so this theorem is written in the more abstract form, but it applies to that particular example. So we have these standard setting, as I said before. So we have a metric measure space as before, and we fix the time space cylinder as before. Here, I further assume that the Dirac shape form is not only symmetric and local, but Only symmetric and local, but it's actually strongly local. And another natural assumption to make is it's regular. So this is like a more restrictive version of the theorem. So basically for strongly local Dirac shape forms, we can define a notion called intrinsic distance. I'll put its definition below later. So it's a non-trivial assumption to make that. Trivial assumption to make that the intrinsic distance has these nice properties that it's a continuous metric that induces the topology of X. So if we make this further assumption, then we can conclude that any time derivative of a local weak solution of the heat equation is itself a local weak solution. Okay, so. Okay, so here is the definition for an intrinsic distance. Essentially, you could see from the definition that we need to consider functions with bounded gradient. So I wrote this in some previous slide that for this particular example, the gamma is given exactly by this sum of Aij Ddi V D D J V. So you could see from this definition that it's natural to guess that this distance function has nice properties is related to the existence of enough many colour functions with bounded gradient in this sense. And these results are offered in Professor's Offered in Professor Strom's paper. So, in particular, the previous example is included in this case. But I also want to mention that this is actually a pretty strong requirement that, for example, fractal spaces are not included in this class because the intrinsic distance is a trivial distance, so it's like zero. Trivial distance, so it's like zero for fractal spaces. Also, for some, like for some Dirichlet spaces on the infinite taurus, we actually have intrinsic distance to be like almost everywhere infinite. So, that's also not something good that can be treated by this theorem. So, we have like more general versions of this theorem to cover those cases. Okay, so lastly. Okay, so lastly, I'll just talk about a straightforward application of this time regularity result to some structure result for ancient local weak solutions. And to be a quick application, I'll just talk about it for this particular example we've been looking at. So the statement is pretty short. It's just this one sentence that any ancient local Any ancient local weak solution of this heat equation, which is of polynomial growth, is polynomial in time. So in other words, it has only finitely many derivatives in time that's non-zero, and all the rest of the time derivatives are zero functions. And here, Asian local weak solution means that the time interval is from negative infinity to some value. Value. So, this is a this result is like a generalization of some result by Professor Kohling and Professor Minnikozi. I'll just say a quick word about why our result about time regularity has anything to do with such a structure result. So, essentially, in their paper, a key step is this inequality that controls time derivative of. Controls time derivative of u by u's like L2 norm. And they would repeatedly apply this inequality for powers of, I mean, different order of time derivatives of u. And to do that, we need that the time derivatives of u to be also solutions of the heat equation. So it's clear for their examples, but for this particular example, it needs the result of our theorem. The result of our theorem that ancient local weak solutions, time derivatives are again ancient local weak solutions. And then it's possible to try to run their arguments to obtain this result. Okay, I think I'll stop here. And yep, thank you very much. Thank you. Let's all give an applause. Is there any question for Chib? Yes, Marshall, please. Yeah, so it's just out of curiosity, the color of functions for fractals, are they different from things that people looked at before? Or? Yeah, so we actually wrote down. Actually, we wrote down so for facto this is or more general than that, we just make this assumption of existence of cutoff functions that satisfy this inequality. So in particular, many fractal spaces have cutoff functions satisfying this property. So essentially here eti represents like a cutoff function and v is just any function in the domain. V is just any function in the domain of the derivative form. And instead of having just like kind of bounded gradient that would produce this term, if the cutoff function just has bounded gradient, it would produce this term. And we add one more part to it. So this is pretty standard for fractal spaces. And they have a more concrete expression of C2. Expression of C2. I think it's usually C2 is like C1 to some negative power times some distance to another negative power. So yeah, this is like more general, but it includes fractal spaces. Thank you. Oh, yes, Lorenzo. Hi, well, for sure. Hi. Well, first of all, thank you for the nice talk. I have a couple of technical questions, so it is a very fair answer to tell me. Just read the paper. But the first one would be, you don't require any continuity for the cutoff functions, if I understand correctly. Yeah, I don't really use that they're continuous.
