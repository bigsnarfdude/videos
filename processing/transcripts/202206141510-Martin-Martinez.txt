Elardo, please go ahead. All right. First, thank you very much for your invitation to this great workshop. I have had some technical issues joining, but I've been able to be in several of the talks, albeit briefly. I enjoyed Harius's talk particularly, and it's going to be very helpful for me. Also, Rafael's talk, right? Rafael's talk right before mine. It's going to be also very helpful for mine as well. So again, thank you. As well. So, again, thank you very much. I'm so sorry I couldn't join you in Mexico. I would have loved to be there, to be completely honest, but because of bureaucratic issues, that was impossible. So, thank you for indulging an online talk. And let me talk today about what I call here space-time geometry from quantum measurement. So, this is a work, a recent work that I did in collaboration with my PhD student, Talis Rick Birch, who, I mean, is this person right here. I have to acknowledge, too, of my slide. Acknowledge too: of my slides, there are six of them that you will probably recognize because they're certainly the most beautiful ones that are his design. So, he's really good at making slides. And I have to confess that I actually couldn't do better than he did in six of them. So, probably many more, but six of them I actually reused. So, just to give credit, for example, this one, right? Or this illustration. Now, general, let's talk a little bit about general relativity. So, in essence, general relativity is or the General relativity is, or the philosophy of relativity that Einstein takes, is the existence of local rulers and clocks. It's about measuring space, local spatial separations and time intervals. And we can, I have here since rule rule function. Since raw function basically is quantifying the affine length of the geodesic connected to events, be it time-like, novel, then affine length, or space-like. So it would be proper length between. Like, so it would be proper length between the two events if you want, or a proper time you could say between the two events. And single function contains all the information about the space-time geometry, obviously. You could reconstruct the metric from a measurement of lengths around the surrounding of an event. This is a mathematical expression of this philosophy that Einstein took. Always know, I mean, Einstein really wanted to be an operational twist to the theory and talk about measurements of time intervals and local. And local small separations. And indeed, out of Sangeet World function, which embodies this notion of separation between events, you can reconstruct the metric in the coincident limit, right? In the limit where the two events are really close to each other. All right, that established, let me just emphasize the metric can be recovered from classical measurements then of lengths and times around the surroundings of an event. All right. All right, so that established. Let's talk about QFT a little bit. So, hopefully, you can see everything in my slide. If not, just let me know. All right, so I'm going to talk about a work that maybe Aachim Kemp will talk tomorrow, and he may talk about this. I don't know because I didn't see the abstract. I don't think it's on the website, but there's a chance that he talks about this. The vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field on some space-time have information about the background. Spacetime have information about the background space-time geometry. So, what does Ahim mean by that? So, let me summarize a lot. I'm not going to get into detail because, again, he will give a beautiful talk about this. I think it's a beautiful work. Ahim showed Ahim and collaborators as well. I should have maybe cited the other paper too. There's another paper with Sirbas where there were three collaborators, but this paper is the most recent one where Ahim summarizes the whole story and put together, join the dots with the big picture. The metric can actually remind that you have a scalar field. Can actually, remind that you have a scalar field in an arbitrary curved space-time, the metric can be reconstructed as the coincidence limits of the Feynman propagator. So the Feynman propagator as the time order expected time order two-point function of the field has full information about the metric, right? Then philosophy a little bit is that quantum fields, even in vacuum, let's say, or especially, and we understand that especially later, have all the geometry encoded in them, right? Have all the geometry encoded in them, right? Of course, the vacuum in a way captures the symmetries and the geometry of the space-time. Now, question number one: Could you write this a similar expression using the Weinman function, the vacuum Weinman function, the two-point correlator of the field, the two-point function? Well, the answer is yes, and it's very trivial from Akim's result on the Feynman propagator, right? In the coincidence limit, in fact, the Feynman propagator is the same as the coincidence limit of the one. It's the same as the coincident limit of the Weiman function for the vacuum, right? So, indeed, you can have the same expression and reconstruct the metric from the vacuum Weitman. But the vacuum, what we call vacuum is a bit restricted. Let's look at a bit more general family of states. Let's look at Hadamard states. So, in general, a Hadamard state, row, satisfies that the Weimann function can be written as this. I made it particular now for not to have so many gamma functions and geometric factors and particularized to three plus one dimensions. Particularized to three plus one dimensions, okay, four-dimensional spacetime. Now, these terms, we have a state-dependent term that is regular in the coincidence limits, that will change depending on the state that you consider. And then you get a state-independent term. That state-independent term is singular. This is this delta here is the van black determinant. And this term, this whole term, this here is a power series on sigma in flat spacetime would not be there. In flat spacetime for the vacuum, for example. In flat space time for the vacuum, for example, but in flat spacetime will not be there. But in general, this term is singular, it's state-independent, it's geometric in a way. If you want, it's the vacuum white man, and indeed it is the vacuum white man, and it's singular in the coincidence limit. Now, in the coincidence limit, indeed, the van black determinant to leading order in sigma in the inchangeable function between the two events you're taking the limit is one. And indeed, in that limit, And indeed, in that limit, the first man dominates, it's the most singular one, the one that dominates in that limit and gives you the singular behavior of the white man. That goes like that in the coincidence limits, of course. That means that tilde here, even though I didn't explicitly write it, I mean in the coincidence limit. And that means that in the coincident limits, I can think of Sangeet's wall function in the coincident limit as going like this inverse of the Y man. Of course, this is a distributional statement, but what is nice But what is nice is that the sing-wolf function can indeed be written as this, right? And indeed, as we saw before, for any Hadamard state, so not only for the vacuum, for any Hadamard state, in the coincident limit, we can write the metric as derivatives on the inverse of the Weyman function. Okay, hopefully, right. So, one can define. So, this is the paper that we wrote, also citing Achim because. We wrote, also citing Aachim because the philosophy kind of is coming from Aachim, right? The philosophy that one can define, one can talk about space-time geometry in, for of course, when you have a background geometry and you quantize a field in it, then this is inherited from the geometry. But one could think of defining space-time geometry in regions where QFT may be valid, you may have a QFT, you may define the endpoint functions of the field, but you don't know about GR, what GR might be. Okay, so we have a notion of metric coming from the All right. Now, the idea here is now to use some previous work together with Achim's results to change one of the fundamental, or modify a little bit, one of the fundamental tenets of VR, and replace the local clocks and rulers with measurements of quantum fields. Of quantum fields. Now, measuring quantum fields, it's tricky. We've seen a couple of talks that have, well, at least one Harris's talk that has talked a little bit about that. I'm going to very briefly summarize without getting into much of it. But the measurement problem is complicated. And in QFT, it's more complicated than in regular quantum mechanics, non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Now, again, maybe we want to do something like we want to measure localized observables of the field, say, I Field, say, I want to measure the electric field in my room during the duration of my talk. And if you measure it, it is not unthinkable that you get a definite reading. Say, for example, 42 volts per meter, right? I can have a sensor and have that. Now, can you use idealized measurements in QFT to implement the effect of that measurement? Well, the answer is no. As Rafael actually in 1992 pointed out, you cannot actually, not going to get into the details, but you can. We're not going to get into the details, but you cannot consider idealized measurements in QFT for several reasons. Now, this has been after this first work, many other people have looked into this problem. So I refer to this more recent reference, where they analyze in more detail what are the problems that we have when we try to do even localize, idealized-like measurements, or maybe like even blind POVMs on quantum fields if we are not careful. Quantum fields, if we are not careful, we may be at odds with the relativistic nature of the theory. We may have violations of causality, faster-than-light signaling, retrocausation, and breakdown of covariance, general covariance. So now what? There are several different ways around this, ways around meaning like what are people exploring in order to talk about measurements in quantum fields. We heard a little bit about Harris. We also, there's also Christie. There's also Chris Fuster as well, and with Fuster Verge formalism, in which they use detectors, quote unquote, that couples to field here and the quote-unquote mean because those detectors are also quantum fields. And there's a third approach that is the one that we're going to try to talk about here in this talk. Now, let me, and it's okay to interrupt if you want to. I don't want to lose anybody or bore anybody. I know this is the last talk of the day. I know this is the last talk of the day. So, what do we want from a measurement theory in QFT? So, let me lay out some things that I would like. And maybe if you disagree, please interrupt me. I want it to be able to produce indefinite values, as in I have a sensor, say something like this, and it gives me a 42, for example. And I want the measurement theory that I use, the formalism that I use, to be compatible with the fact that I have definite measurements, definite values, as a particular case of experiments that I carry. Case of experiments that I carry out. It needs to provide an update rule, and that is necessary to ensure compatibility of successive measurements. This is what the Copenhagen School in quantum mechanics tried to accomplish with projective measurements and the collapse, quote unquote, of the wave function, giving an update rule. So we need one of those. We cannot be cheeky with it in QFT, but we need one. It definitely needs to be consistent with the theory. For example, if it's QFT, right? If it's QFT, right, in curved spacetimes, you need to respect general covariance. It needs to be causal. And of course, it needs to be connected with the experiment. We don't want a formalism where we talk about objects that carry out measurements that are not connected with the experimental results. All right, so there are alternatives to idealized measurements. As we talked about, there are different people doing different alternatives to it, which I believe are all complementary. The one that I'm going to try to sell. Gonna try to sell today a bit for the results on this talk. It's that we the formalism of particle detectors, and we'll talk about it. And I have this phrase that I brought in several of my papers that in the end, fields are never measured directly. You don't really access directly an observable of a quantum field. The only way we have to access quantum fields is through something that couples to it, a controllable quantum system that couples to it, something for which non-relativistic approximations are okay to make. Approximations are okay to make, something like an atom, hydrogen atom, something like a photo detector in the LHC, or the retinas of our eyes. Now, modeling particle detectors is something that goes back very, very far back, right? I mean, we have these papers from the 70s and 80s by Andrew and Walt and others. Before that, there were other people like Miloni and others, people looking at the light-matter interaction. Particle detectors, I'm going to define as localized non-relativistic quantum systems, and by non-relativistic, Relativistic quantum systems, and by non-relativistic, I don't mean they are not fundamentally relativistic, but I mean that a non-relativistic approximation is enough. There's regimes in which we access those detectors where a non-relativistic approximation is enough to describe them, but still they couple to quantum fields locally. All right, so the simplest model is the so-called Andrew DeWitt model. Now, I have this reference, of course, the Andrew DeWitt model is older than me by a lot. By a lot. So, why do I have this reference here? Because this is the particular formalism that we're going to use. So, consider a detector as a system, it's a quantum system that undergoes a trajectory set of tau moving through space-time. And it's localized by some, you prescribe a Hamiltonian density. And of course, there's assumptions that you have to make in order to be able to prescribe this that I won't get into now, but you prescribe a Hamiltonian density telling you the interaction of the detector with the field. You have the interaction of the detector with the field. So you have some space-time smearing, some region of space-time where your detector is interacting with the field. Then, some internal degree of freedom of the detector, in the case of the Android-DeWitt model, is a monopoly moment, and then the field, which in the case of the Android-Witt model is a scalar field. Those are, it's not limited. You can have any quantum system as long as it can be approximated by a non-relativistic quantum system and has an internal degree of freedom that is non-relativistic internally in nature and couples linearly. And couples linearly to the field. All right, so again, this is in flat space-time, for example. I mean, with a detector, we always have to assume, make some assumptions, the detector is very small, perhaps point-like, you could do it point-like. It's very small, it's Fermi-Walker rigid, and there's a frame in which you can factor in the proper frame of the detector, you can factor the space-times mirroring into a switching function and as mirroring functions you can integrate with respect to proper time, to respect to the foliation. To respect to the foliation, the spatial, sorry, proper time in the foliation of the that comes associated with one of the Fermi-walker frames of the detector, and you get a Hamiltonian that generates translation with respect to proper time, and there you can separate it in terms of a switching and a smearing function. Anyway, so that's the underweight detector model. So if you have any questions, please, again, I want to give room to ask them because Give room to ask them because I'm going to rely on you being okay with everything I said in order for you to believe what comes after, otherwise, there's no hope. All right, if there aren't any questions, now we can analyze these four tenets of a measurement theory in QFT for QFT that I would desire. Let's see if this we can build a measurement theory based on particle detectors or something similar to a measurement theory. First of all, let's go with number four because bad ordering. Because bad ordering, right? Yeah, the Android detector has been, so some of my research has been into connecting how people in the lab describe light-matter interactions, mainly because some of the experiments that involve relativistic quantum information relies on laboratory implementations. And the connection between the light-matter interaction models and other high-energy physics models that people use to predict outcomes of experiments are associated. Are associated. In fact, typically the models used are simplifications over the simplifications we already have in quantum optics, for example. So indeed, it's a good model. It mimics well. And it can be also complicated to mimic properly, to use the predictive models that people would use in the lab to predict outcomes of experiments when you have relativistic setups, even though those are not that explored. But indeed, the ambulative weight model does connect. But indeed, the Android Width model does connect with experiments. So, I'm not going to try to convince you much more than giving you references for it, but I'm open to talking about it if you want to ask about it. So, it's not an idealization, really. The Android Width model is a model of things that are pretty real that can happen in laboratories. It's really connecting with measurements that people can carry out in the lab. All right. Now, the next step is to ask whether using particle detectors is consistent with the QFT that we have in the sense that, all right. That we have in the sense that, all right, you have something that is internally non-relativistic. Surely you're going to mess up the relativistic nature of the field. You're going to have a kind of a sorting problem, if Rafael allows me to call it that, of signaling when you make a measurement between two actions that are localized in space. And yes and no, so I'll talk a little bit about it. I had, there are several, so the two, the two issues that I've looked at in different works with different collaborators, one of them. The different collaborators, one of them here, by the way, is the issue of general covariance. As unlike the predictions from those detectors cannot depend on the mathematical coordinates you use to describe them, you have pick different infoliations of space-time, the predictions of the models should be the same. And even though that seems that it's going to be trivial, it's not that trivial when you try to localize detectors in space as well. So you have a localization that has contains space-like separated points. If it's not a point-like detector, this is something that is not guaranteed. This is something that is not guaranteed at all, and in fact, not true in general. And the other issue we would have is, of course, we cannot allow the theory to allow for FTL signaling or to have a sorting-like problem, if you allow me to call it that. Now, these two things have been looked at in these papers. The issue of general covariance is looked at above all in the second paper here, the one in 2021. And the sorking-like problem has been analyzed in detail in this last article with again with this. Article with again with this. These are my students, Tales Ricbert, Bruno, Bruno Torres, José de Ramon, and Maria Papayojiu, who's also a student of Haris. And we've looked at the problem of impossible measurements, and we gave two things. So we first showed that a leading order in perturbation theory, if you do predictions of leading order in perturbation theory, you're fine. Any impossible measurement problems in most scenarios would happen at higher order. And also, of course, point light detectors are okay. So, of course, point light detectors are okay. And when use near the detectors, what that imposes is imposes fundamental limits on the resolution that you can actually claim to have in order not to have the problem that Raphael pointed out with idealized measurements. So I know this is a bit of a leap of faith, and this will be a talk in its own rights to talk about in what ways we could get around the problem that Rafael pointed out in 1992 using particle detectors, which is a very interesting problem to talk about. Which is a very interesting problem to talk about. It's not the talk that I have here, so I will definitely be happy to ask to be asked questions about. But this is something I need you to believe, accept for now. All right, the next step, it's being capable. This is a tricky one as well, right? Okay, sure, the interaction may not, but what about when you actually try to extract classical information from the field? What about, for example, you do an experiment of entanglement harvesting where you actually Of entanglement harvesting, where you actually have two space-like separated detectors, and space-like separated, the space-time engineerings are space-like separated. They see the field only in space-like separated regions, and they start in an uncorrelated state, and they get entangled through harvesting the correlations, swapping the correlations that exist in the field. Well, if you're doing a problem like that, this matters. How are you making, if you want to violate the inequalities, how are you making the measurements on those detectors? And if I modify a little bit the setting and I send information to somebody else. And I send information to somebody else. How is the effective state update that I need to apply in order to incorporate the information of the measurement of the detector? Can you create really a measurement theory with a state update rule for the field that is free from the problems pointed out by Rafael? And again, without getting into it, because this is preliminaries that we need, this is what we did in this paper with Josepo Gomez and Luis Garai. Josepolo is actually here, I say him now. And it's where we We argue that we can build a measurement theory, a complete measurement theory out of particle detectors. You can call it effective because indeed it's particle detectors as localized non-relativistic systems that couple to quantum fields. And we talk about how we implement both selective and non-selective measurements. Non-selective ones is just the dynamics of the detectors, of course. But what if I know the outcome of a detector and then I have another in the future? How do I implement it? In the future, how do I implement the POVMs associated with selective measurements on particle detectors? And how do we do the state update? Or if you formulate everything in terms of endpoint functions, if you want to go the path of algebraic QFT, how do we update the endpoint functions of the field when we extract a classical bit of information from the detector? Again, this would be a talk in its own right. But unfortunately, we've gotten to the point that I can talk about what I came here to talk. That I can talk about what I came here to talk. But I really would love if you have questions, please do stop me and ask because I'm going to get to the next step, which is replacing rulers and clock by particle detectors in GR. All right, well, if there aren't any questions, then let's move to what we came here to do. Now, these are a couple of works, one with Jose de Ramon and Luis Garay. Jose de Ramon and Luis Garay, and one with Talis Ricperte, one I'm talking about here, where we show that Android detectors with sufficiently localized interaction, think of Nassen delta localized detectors, that let's make them point-like to be crisp, right? Or not point-like, but close to point-like, can be used to recover the correlation functions of quantum fields. You can actually, from readouts of detectors, reconstruct the Weinman function of the field. For time-like separated events, you can use for time-like and light-like separate events. For time-like and light-like separate events, you can actually reconstruct the Weinman function like this. The singular nature of the Weinman function gets reconstructed that you get to the limit of the detectors being closed in interaction. So you do capture it in a nascence distribution kind of way. But you see, you can actually understand the Weinman function as a difference between the excitation probability after interacting at two points, one detector interacting at two points that are time-like connected, minus the Minus the noise, the local noise that you get, the excitation probability after interacting only at one point. When you have space-like separate events, you can actually use the correlations that the field has, because the correlation that the field has is actually harvested by two detectors that are space-like separated. And indeed, you can, the Weitman function approaches, this is done in the second paper here, the time-like one is done in the first one, space-like one in the second one. The Weitman function can indeed be written in terms of the two-point function. Written in terms of the two-point function of the detector, the internal degree of freedom of the detector, again, as an assembly distribution kind of way. And I'll show you how it works actually, how it works for what I want to do. Now, detectors can measure the Weinman function. And if the detectors can measure the Weinman function, we know now that we could reconstruct a space-time metric by we can reconstruct space-time metric. We can reconstruct space-time metric by the Weimmann function, by having the Weiman function. In fact, as we said before, imagine that we have this. This is the expression that I told you about before. And imagine that I consider a lattice of detectors placed around in space-time. And we use them to make measurement of a quantum field that lives in that spacetime background, so as to probe the Weiman function at different points in spacetime. Now, you can replace the derivative. Now, you can replace the derivatives here by finite distance, by finite, but finite differences derivatives and go ahead and express the Weiman function in terms of the observables of the detectors. And these are some examples of what you can get. These are some two examples in which we fix the space-time geometry. We quantize a field and we choose a particular state of the field, in fact, a particular vacuum here. Remember, this will be true no matter. Remember, this will be true no matter what state we can discuss that, but this is state independent in the sense that it's any Hadamard states will actually give you this. The UV, whatever the particulars of the state are lost in the UV limit, that is the coincidence limit, right? As you detectors are getting closer and closer to do this experiment, you stop seeing the non-well, if it were the Minkowski, the background, you will stop seeing the non-Lorentz invariant parts of the state, and you will see only what the vacuum part of the wineman will tell you. This is true for all background space-times. For all background space-times. The UV, if you have a Hadamard state, the UV behavior is actually for a Hadamard state, again, I insist, has to be regular, right? But the UV behavior is dominated by the geometric part of the Weymann function, the state-independent part of the Weymann function. Now, here you see in Minkowski how this comes out of, I mean, I didn't have all the expressions because it's long, but this is the effective metric reconstructed from the measurements of detectors. And then you can tell. Detectors. And then you can tell, this is with a massive field, just to give a scale. And you can tell that how as the distance between the detector goes down, you recover the coefficients, the imaginary parts of, of course, in general, when you are very coarse in your derivatives, when your detectors are very far apart, you don't recover the metric, but as the detectors get closer and closer to each other, you recover the right coefficients. You do exactly the same in, if you consider accelerated detectors, you can put them in the sitter. In the sitter, you see how nice this. In the center, you see how nice this all of them go to zero except for the ones that the RR that you have here and the eta eta that track exactly the function, the conformal function that you have in the citr and actually very early on. And you could also do it. This is done with point-like detectors, but you could also do it with finite size detectors. And you get the same, but of course you cannot get them too close. This is when things start falling apart. This is when you will start having relevant. In relevant problems because you localize the detectors, you make them too fat if you want. But indeed, you also just get a little bit blurry, but you do recover with finite size detectors, you still recover the space-time geometry. Now, I wanted to do a little bit of discussion about this, and maybe I'm being a bit fast because I do have a lot of time, and maybe we can talk more about other things. But the one thing that the philosophy The one thing that the philosophy that we would hear is that, okay, so we have rulers and clock to define general relativity. How about we now talk about quantum rulers and quantum clocks? How about we use quantum objects, quantum objects that are localized and under control, quantum objects that we use as particle detectors, say hydrogen atoms or something smaller than that, high-energy processes that we use as detectors as well. How about we actually use them? Actually, use them to define geometry. And the idea is that we could reformulate the geometry of spacetime in terms of the outcomes of these measurements of quantum regression clocks measuring quantum fields. Then, of course, that means that particle detectors, we saw that when the metric background is fixed, particle detectors can indeed be used to determine accurately the space-time geometry through probing those quantum fields with those detectors. Those quantum fields with those detectors. Of course, if at some point, if your measurements are very accurate, if you put those detectors together too much and you have very fast switchings, then you're going to start getting noise that gets in the way if the resolution is increased too much. That's not necessarily bad because this gives you an idea of an ability to determine a minimal scale, a kind of blurriness that is related to the fluctuations of the thing that you're measuring in how you're measuring. In how you're measuring. So, the regimes where quantum noise plays a role may result in effective quantum theory for spacetime if you reconstruct it out of the measurements of quantum fields through detectors. So, I don't know. I think that I could stop here. I can talk a little bit more, but this is mostly what I wanted to present. We can talk about the technicalities now, if you want. But the idea here, we only showed that indeed, out of the outcome of a lattice of particle detectors distributed in space-time, Detectors distributed in space-time, you can accurately recover the spacetime geometry through measuring the correlations in quantum fields through the state-independent part of Hadamard states. Now, the point here is that what if we don't imagine that we don't have a space and geometry, but we still have experimentalists with detectors that are equipped with detectors. And those detectors we can explain pretty well with quantum mechanics. Perhaps there's a, you can, and that experimentalists can label the detectors when they're doing. Experimentalists can label the detectors when they're doing experiments and doing this detector and assigning it a label that you can associate to the instant the experimentalists make the experiments and where in space labeled in a way in the lab, a lab labeled if you want, that the experimentalists can give, can you get effective dynamics? Can you get something? Can you express a theory of space-time based on measurements of detectors that is not only kinematical, as we say here? Can we actually talk about the dynamics of those measurements? Can we modify as the Of those measurements? Can we modify Einstein equations? Can we get something like Einstein equations at leading order? But then at higher orders, when the detector separation starts to be non-negligible, can we get some new effects, some new equations of motion for the space-time geometry? And if so, can we rewrite all the dynamics of space-time geometry out of just measurements, direct measurements of quantum fields or measurements of particle detectors, rather to say? So, anyway, this is what I wanted to tell you. I think that. What I wanted to tell you, I think that we could go to discussion. If nobody has questions, I can say some more things about measurements. But in principle, let's have it to the discussion, perhaps. Thank you. Thank you, Eduardo, for a nice talk. We open the floor to questions. I don't see. Okay. Rafael, please. Rafael, please. Sorry, me? Yes, that's yeah, I usually have too many questions, but I'm not sure in what order to take them, but I'll take maybe the order that you gave in your talk. So you said that you had worked out a measurement theory for quantum field theory. You just and you said it would be another And you said it would be another whole talk, but maybe you can just sketch what it is. I mean, what are the does it tell you which variables can be measured, what the update rule is, and so on? Definitely, yes. So the measurement theory we proposed, again, in this paper, is it works the following ways. So we have access, we assume that experimenters have access to particle detectors. And out of particle detectors, they can measure the field through coupling. They can measure the field through coupling the particle detectors to the field, perhaps the field amplitude, perhaps the field canonical momentum, linear couplings. And the measurement outcomes that they have are through idealized measurements of the detector. So the detectors first couple to the field. And after the coupling finished, the experimenter makes an idealized measurement on the detector, internal degree of freedom. That yields an effective POVM on the field. Field, uh, the effective POVM. So, if we want to update the state of the field with the information we obtained, we obtained some classical information out of measuring that detector, and that yields a POVM on the field. And the POVM on the field is the one that's compatible with the time evolution of the detector coupled to the field, then post-selected to the outcome that the person obtained. Those POVMs, those family of POVMs, are of the family that don't have the impossible measurement problems. Impossible measurement problems. So, well, and there's some regions for the detector. Of course, if your detector is huge and space-like, big, right, it's going to have this problem. But if your detector is point-like or it's localized sufficiently so, it's one of those POVMs that are, we think, the ones that they talk, Ian Job and others in this paper that I have here. Yeah. Borsten, yeah, of course. How could I forget? Borsten, John, and Kelstock. Here, this is the family of POVMs that they identify. The family of POVMs that they identify as being compatible with the coastal structure of the field. There's a particular case, the one that you obtain through classic idealized measurement of detectors and then updating the field according to the POVM associated with the outcome you got in the idealized measurement of the detector is of this family. I see, can you? It may be in this paper, and I didn't notice it, but can you say sort of without Sort of without talking explicitly about the detector, what these POVMs are, you know, just describe them in terms of the field itself. You can. So the part of the detectors, we keep it. Yeah, indeed, we do have, of course, what we have in the NR, there's the family of POVMs. But the detectors are nice for number four in the sense that you can connect it with something that can easily be connected with something done in the lab. Yeah, I'm not the POVMs are once you get the POVMs, you can forget about the detectors and have the POVMs indeed. Yeah, so can one say in some simple way or even complicated way, except saying that whatever you get from the detector is the POVM? I mean, is there some more direct characterization of what the POVMs are? I don't know if the question is clear. It's complicated. Yeah, because the question of translating a message. The question of translating a measurement of an observable in the detector to a feature of the field is complicated. One will have to do data processing if you want. You can, in principle, in fact, we have other papers that show that. So let me tell you a good piece of evidence that it would be possible to talk about information in observables of the field in terms of the outcome of detectors. One of the ways we've approached the problem of translating, so once you have the outcome of the detector, of course, which in the end, the outcome of the detector, if it's Which, in the end, the outcome of the detector, if it's qubit detector, so it might harmonic oscillators, but to make it simpler, qubit detectors. Those detectors, of course, you're measuring a two-dimensional level system. And a measurement there will give you one bit of classical information, either zero or one, when you measure that with an idealized measurement. Now, you can have many measurements, and you will have a sequence of zeros and ones, and you want to translate that into something about the field, some particular feature of the field, to know exactly what you're measuring. So, we have a What you're measuring. So, we have a paper that we put on ARICA. We didn't send anywhere, but we're finishing a new version now where we use because it's difficult to do it analytically. You can do it analytically for some easy cases, obviously, but it's difficult in general to translate. You have to be very good at designing the experiment. What we use, just to show that it's possible, we identify four or five features of the field that we want to know about. For example, the presence of a boundary far away, a temperature. The temperature of a KMS states, also distinguishing between a Fox state and a coherent state in the field with the same first and second moments, coherent state as things like superposition of coherent states. And what we do is just a sequence of ones and zeros using this kind of setups of particle detectors. And then we use machine learning. In a way, so a computer, the computer can tell us if the information is there, at least. And the computer can figure out. So the computer is cleverer than we are, sad to say, but the computer can figure out the Can figure out the observables that you want from the field out of the data, the ones and zeros. Now, and that gives us hope that you can indeed actually write analytical expressions and figure out what these POVMs are measuring specifically in the field. We can in some cases, of course. For example, in a case of entanglement harvesting, we know exactly what we are doing. In a case of entanglement harvesting, we know that the entanglement acquired by the two detectors is literally the entanglement in the space-like separate. In the in the space, like separate, it follows area laws and it behaves in the way that it has to. Uh, and we know it's directly capturing the entanglement in the areas of the field that it's capping to. But in general, it's a complicated question, yeah. Of course, I mean, entanglement is not directly an observable. No, I agree. I agree. Uh, so features, let me say features of the field. Like, if you want to say one observable, so if I want to measure the amplitude in this region, I only have the ones and zeros from the detector, can I trace it back? And zero from the detector, can I trace it back? My answer would be yes. Is it easy, analytically easy to write? My answer would be probably not. Thanks. I mean, I have a couple of other questions, but I think I should leave a chance for someone else. Okay, thank you. We'll come back to you, Rafael. Okay. Robert. Hi. Very nice talk. Thanks. Thank you, Paulo. A question about so when you showed the slide with a reconstruction. When you showed the slide with the reconstruction of the whiteman functions, yeah, let me so there you had two cases depending on space-like or time-like. So, does it mean that in this approach, when you want to reconstruct the space-time metric, you do need knowledge about the causal structure beforehand? Oh, sorry, sorry, go ahead. Sorry, sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, it's a really good question. I got excited because it's a really good question. We can discuss it. I'm going to say no, but there are some people who disagree. So let's talk about it. Let's see. So you just need to label experiments, right? So you need a notion, in a way, a notion of experimentalist. The experimentalist should be able to label the events and place them in a lattice. And place them in a lattice. So, in mind, you have how you assign the labels in a lattice according to an experimental protocol. So, in a way, you assume that there is something related to causal structure that images this in a practical way, not in theory. So, the experimentalist is living their life and they're doing experiments. And they start doing experiments where they have four or five detectors here, and they start measuring them. And they measure sequentially. They have a notion of, for them, of arrow of time. For them, of arrow of time, a notion of a process that comes after the other. And that comes from some causal structure that, of course, exists in the universe that he's measuring. But I would say that for the experiment, for the reconstruction, you wouldn't need to assume any particular causal structures. There would be one for sure. And that's what allows the experimentalist to label the events in a way, in some way, that he's doing the or they're doing the experiment. So, what do you think? Yes or no? Yes or no? So you're saying that these labels are used in the reconstruction, right? I mean, what is what the experimenter says is later that influences how you reconstruct and not just the measurement itself at that point. Is that correct? It's kind of, yeah, and this is kind of one of the features in a way because it's a relational way. In a way, if you In a way, if you use clocks or quantum clocks and rulers, you're not going to be able to get rid of that. Even if you assume you have a background, imagine in the case that we assume we have GR as the background costal structure. In that case, even if you start doing these measurements, unless you go to Planck scale resolution, the moment you get to Planck scale resolution, you're not going to be able to get GR. You're going to start being dominated by noise in the measurements that you're making. You're going to have huge quantum fluctuations that you're going to be seeing. So even if you had GR, detectors are not going to be able to. Even if you had GR, detectors are not going to be able to tell you. But if you do all your experiments by sending light, measuring time, you know, the kinds of things that Einstein was thinking of operationally to characterize relativity, you would be subject to whatever fluctuations your detectors would have. So in a way, the detectors are the best. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but would be like the best approximation to whatever causal structure you're measuring there. Yeah. Okay, thanks. I have another question, but maybe somebody. Maybe I should but maybe somebody else uh can I just make a comment on Rob on the previous just throw something in um you know if you do get it's it's probably relevant here that if you do know the causal structure you know almost the entire metric so there's an there's a you know there's a significant coupling between the question of whether the causal structure is presupposed Is presupposed or is read out. In the end, I think you'd want it to be read out, or else you're fixing almost almost from the beginning fixing the metric entirely. I fully agree. It is read out, but the reason why I worded it like I worded it is because of the next step. Like, for example, you can interpret this in two ways. One, I think, is uncontroversial, and the other one is wilder, if you want. The uncontroversial one is. One. The uncontroversial one is, yes, there is a background. Here, I'm assuming I have a QFT, and that's what I'm doing for the examples that I showed, right? I'm assuming I have a background space-time, and then I place detectors, and I'm going to check if truly the detectors capture that causal structure. So the experimentalist may not know what it is, but through the experiments can determine it, indeed. Now, the other wilder one is: okay, so if I can write the causal structure exclusively in terms of localized measurements. In terms of localized measurements, can I define now a causal structure instead of assuming that this is derived, that this is measured from something that exists, can I have a formalism that talks about causal structure only out of outcomes of local measurements? And that is the ones that, of course, there's a long path from what I'm presenting here to that. Because the first question you have is, okay, what about dynamics? This is, you're not going to have an Einstein equation for or equivalent or Einstein equation plus quantum corrections or something in this. Plus, quantum corrections, or something using this. But this is exactly what we're exploring right now. Yeah. Yeah, just a little, if I can ask a question related. If I understood correctly, you have two procedures. I think this is what Robert was talking about. Two procedures for measuring space-time separations. And one of them involves two detectors, right? Which you use to measure space-like separations. But is there But is there anything stopping you from simply applying this procedure for any pair of points without knowing what there is space-like? And then I guess you just could try to interpret that as some sort of measurement that gives you also when there's a time-like separation. So then it wouldn't be deciding a priori whether you're measuring a time-like or a space-like separation. Separation. You are completely right. I don't know who you are because I'm only hearing the voice, but Michael Reisenberger. Yeah, really good question. Yes, indeed. So the reason I wrote it like this is because it's much cleaner in the space-like case. You could write something like this, quote unquote, for this one here, but it's a bit more involved. And the reason is that in here you have. You have, if they're space like separated, the white man is just the symmetric part, the real part, right? The anti-commutator, if you want, of the field. The commutator doesn't get in the way. In the time-like one, you get contributions from both. And the geometric part is in the... So, so it's cleaner to do it like this. You are right. You could do something like that. The protocol is a bit more involved, but indeed, you just need to filter out for the local. It's similar to this. It's kind of what we're doing. So, this is kind of. kind of what we're doing so this is kind of this it's kind of the same procedure actually but filtering for the for the contribution that is due to the cell signaling of the detectors if you want to call it that yeah we the reason why they look different and there's two different procedures and as you say is because of it's super clean to do it with space like it's less clean to do it with time like but you are right there's one universal way i can tell you an experiment that i can tell you that will be valid for whether there's space like or not That would be valid for whether there's space like or timing. Very good question. Okay, the next question is from Harris. Yes, I have a technical question. Hi, Hedo. I have a technical question, more than technical, right? So, I mean, in the detector, you usually integrate over time, right? When you the Weitman function in order to get the excitation probability. So am I? Am I right in assuming that you take a delta function for the sweets in here? NASA and delta. So we don't go to the divergent. Well, this thing would be regularized. So when we measure these things, they would be regular, those quantities. But still, yes, it's a NASM delta limit. So we don't assume point like from the beginning. We assume something regular. And then we make sure that it's safe to take the limits. But yes, you would be right. But tell me. But tell me, right? Yeah, it would be delta in all, actually. You could almost do delta in all. Yeah, right, right, right. That would be interesting to see. I mean, you know, physical systems probably do not allow strict localization. It would be nice to see, you know, the quantum nature of matter, what is the how difficult it makes it to compute exactly the metric. So a limit localization you can have. You can have time, right? But this is one example where we have finite size in space and time. Well, I think this one is just in space, still point like in time. But yeah, basically, you cannot get too close, right? It poses a limit to the resolution you can get, right? Yes. I mean, there are some fundamental limits in the resolution from quantum. And that would be a feature, right? That's not a bug in a way. In a way, it's a feature because. A way, in a way, it's a feature because if you well, I don't know again, this is a bit sci-fi, but uh, if you expect somehow if you reformulate, and this philosophy doesn't necessarily require detectors, right? But if you somehow think of the philosophy where you look at a causal structure out of local measurements, right? Right, yes, that's going to be how you do those local measurements, no matter what approach you take, there's going to be a fundamental limit of resolution, right? Yes, yes, and perhaps that's when VR doesn't work anymore, you know? Yes, yes, all right. All right. Really good questions. Thank you. Thank you. So perhaps we can break now and leave any further questions for the discussion session. So we thank the speaker again. Thank you. Is it okay if there's a student of mine that I see joined? Is it okay if he joins for the discussion session too? Because technically he's
