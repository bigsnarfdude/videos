Um so I changed the title of my talk. I said I was going to talk about cross-immunity, but I didn't make as much progress as I thought. And I don't feel like I have very much to say, but I do feel like I'm going to say about an interesting topic. So with luck, I'll say it reasonably quickly and we'll be able to talk a little bit. So I've been thinking about models of cross-immunity and in particular the way In particular, the way we model cross-immunity has decreased susceptibility, probably since about the youngest person in this room was born. I was influenced by a series of influenza cross-immunity models by Julian Gogg, and I was hoping to get back a little closer to that sort of coexistence multi-strain COVID model by now, but I didn't. So here's a link to Julia's stuff. Irina will eventually tell me where to post these slides. These slides. And so I've been interested in these concepts. Mike keeps asking me questions that he typically needs the answer to yesterday, and I always try to go back to the foundations. And then another young person who was around the lab at the time decided that recasting this formalism was a cool idea, and he did a lot of work, and everything is cool. So I'm going to start by talking about vaccines. I'm going to relate it to cross-immunity and many. To cross-immunity, and many of you are familiar with the idea that a vaccine might be leaky or it might be polarized. We do a vaccine efficacy trial, and we say the vaccine is 80% efficacious. And what do we really mean by that? Well, one thing it could mean is that you're protected 80% each time you're challenged. The other thing it could mean is that with an 80% probability, you go into this perfectly protected box. Neither of these are exactly. Neither of these are exactly correct. And before I lose track, a bugbear of mine when other people do it is to talk about protection without worrying about what we mean by protection. You read in the newspaper, this vaccine is 70% effective, this one's 90% effective. No vaccine is ever effective except against a specific endpoint. And coming from influenza, I have a very strong bias that the answer can be very different indeed. Different indeed. An influenza virus with 5 or 10% effectiveness against infection may have a 90% effectiveness against death, right? These are all different. And so what are we focused on as modelers? We want to be intentional about the kind of assumptions we make. And all of these things are things that you've thought about, and I'll add another one. When does a vaccine prevent us from making a natural immune response, which might turn out Natural immune response, which might turn out to be more protective in the future. So, Julia Gogg's original framework, which inspired me, is very analogous to the leaky and polarized. And it's the question, it came up earlier in a model that I was blanking on which talk it was, but there was a two-strain model and then the overlapping model. What do we keep track of to understand an individual? Keep track of to understand an individual's immunity. And the two major paradigms are: we keep track of what they've had, or we keep track of what they think they're going to do next. So either the history-based approach, I've seen the Fujian strain and the California strain, but not some other strain, or the status-based approach, I'm going to get sick the next time I see the Texas strain, or I'm not. And there's a natural mapping between keeping track of history and the idea of leaky immunity and the idea. Linky immunity and the idea of keeping track of status and the idea of polarizing. Uh-oh. That didn't happen before. Okay. I mean, that's not how I wanted to show the talk, but as long as it clicks, it's fine. So here are some models. Here are some little model diagrams drawn by Daniel with lots of colors. And we imagine that people are originally susceptible and they might. Susceptible and they might get vaccinated. And in a leaky model, everybody who's vaccinated goes to the same place, and then the next time they meet the virus, they might get infected, but they're less likely to get infected than if they hadn't been vaccinated. In a polarized model, once you're in a box, you no longer care whether you've been vaccinated or not, except that the SV here aren't going to be vaccinated again because they already think they're vaccinated. Because they already think they're vaccinated. What happens instead is that we decide the question of vaccine efficacy at the moment that you're vaccinated. The polarized approach has been criticized mostly by people who were in a hurry and wanted to keep using their old models by saying, well, I'm sorry. I should have said much of the time. I have no idea if it's most of the time. Well, in a polarized model, I'm assuming that 20% of the population is. I'm assuming that 20% of the population doesn't care at all that they're vaccinated, and that's unrealistic. But I'm going to say that that's not really the only way to get to or close to a polarized model. Conversely, the leaky approach, the failed challenge never happens at all. You'll notice that people go to the bottom left, and then with some probability, they're going to get sick if they see a challenge. But with the remaining Challenge, but with the remaining probability, 80% if we have an 80% effective vaccine, they don't care at all, right? They're challenged by the new flu and they beat it off because of the vaccine. They would have gotten sick otherwise. And then their immune state doesn't change at all. Next week, they're challenged by the same exact flu and they get sick again. So both approaches have conceptual problems or difficulties. And so we can look here at the leaky versus polar. Here at the leaky versus polarized. And we can say, well, what if we imagine that these people aren't, that these challenges aren't just disappearing? These are literally, in our conceptual model, these are literally challenges that happen. People are wandering around. They're mixing. We think of vaccines as mixing exactly as they would. They're mixing. They're meeting challenges that would otherwise affect them. And they don't care. So, what could we add to this is some idea of something else that happens to this remaining proportion of the population. Proportion of the population. And the simplest thing to conceptualize is that they don't notice, but they do get an immune boost. And so, this is what we call the leaky model with boosting. We also have a full model which has leakiness and boosting and polarization, and who knows what all. And here's back to the polarized model. And sorry, if you do dynamics, and particularly if you do stochastic dynamics, you might recognize. Dynamics, you might recognize these, and here 100% of the boosting challenges are effective in boosting. You might recognize these as actually the same dynamical one. Here, I get vaccinated, and then when I'm challenged, I pick a random number to find out whether I go to IRR. Here, I get vaccinated, and then I first pick the random number to find out what's going to happen if I get challenged, and then later, bear it out. There's actually a tiny little difference here in terms of time. Difference here in terms of time scales depending on how Markovian you're being, or whatever. But these are fundamentally the same model, and probably in some simple implementations, exactly the same model. And we can show this by simulating. So here I have on a log scale covering eight orders of magnitude, so it doesn't look like the leaky vaccine is doing very much, but of course it is. It's reducing for these parameters the peak incidence by about a factor of three, which is nice. Which is nice. But what's happening here is that, well, I'll talk about it at the next slide. But one of the things that's happening here is if you have a big epidemic, that somebody with a leaky vaccine will get challenged and beat off the challenge, and they'll get challenged and beat off the challenge, and they'll get challenged and they'll get ill. And if R0 is large enough, a leaky vaccine is almost no vaccine at all. The conceptually pure leaky vaccine is almost no vaccine at all. Vaccine is almost no vaccine at all. The polarized vaccine, for these reasons, with the same measured efficacy, does much better. It lowers the epidemic peak further and it keeps the incidence lower on the way down. We can also implement a leaky vaccine model, but add perfect boosting, watch carefully, and it looks like this. And I did not just change the header. I made two different graphs from two different simulations, but it's not clear that I needed. But it's not clear that I needed to. So we can summarize this. This is the slide I said I was going to wait for. If we have a classic leaky vaccine and a large R0T, so I'm showing here the final size in a perfectly mixed population and lots of caveats that have already been covered for me earlier today, thankfully. But in this conceptual model, everybody gets sick when R0 is large, but as we introduce a lead But as we introduce a leaky vaccine up to 40 or 50% efficacy, as long as R0 is still above 4 or 5, basically everybody's going to get sick. Because there's going to be a giant epidemic and you're going to be challenged four or five or six times. And with a vaccine efficacy of 50%, that means you're going to get sick. If we add boosting, then these curves move down and eventually move to a point where the vaccine effectiveness. Effectiveness matches the efficacy, which is also exactly what we would get in a polarized model. And I'm going to show you two graphs. I'm going to show you two graphs. I'm very frustrated by this. I'm going to show you two graphs that contain no information if you've been following me up until now, which is that if I add some polarization to my model, then these two curves are going to move towards this curve. And if I make a fully polarized vaccine, Make a fully polarized vaccine. Again, I did draw all three of these curves, but you can't tell because it's all the same. The leaky model with boosting and the polarized model, if you do it right, have the same incidence dynamics. Or, depending on your details of time distributions, very, very slightly different incidence dynamics, full disclosure. So, we can think about what this means in terms of the kind of inferences we're going to make. I'll talk a little bit about efficiency. Make. I'll talk a little bit about efficacy and effectiveness. Efficacy is often used to say what would you see in a trial. Effectiveness is what are you going to see in the population. And we can ask how that interacts with our two or three modeling paradigms and how it interacts with how we estimate effectiveness. Effectiveness is most commonly estimated as cumulative incidence. We follow a population for a certain period of time and we say, you know. We say, you know, who got the illness in this time period? Were they vaccinated or not? If we're being a little fancier, we might try to estimate the instantaneous hazard. We might assume that somebody who gets this year's strain of flu isn't going to get it again, and we do a coaching for that. And what you find, I don't know why I find these pictures confusing, because I claim they're not. So here, they're not confusing to you, only to me. So here, Q is the proportion of boosting, which would be the same as how polarized our vaccine is. And if we're looking at incidence-based effectiveness, if we're looking at incidence-based estimates of effectiveness, I don't know why it says efficacy here because I tried to change it. What we see is that the polarized or fully boosted value. Polarized or fully boosted vaccine has the effectiveness in the population that you would estimate in an efficacy trial, right? Whatever proportion of the population is protected is just protected. And since we know the leaky vaccine is working less well, it's not surprising that as we lengthen our time window and people get challenged more than once, the effectiveness of a leaky vaccine is less than the perfectly measured efficacy. Than the perfectly measured efficacy. Conversely, if we measure hazard, it's actually the leaky paradigm that matches the hazard perfectly, right? Because the leaky paradigm is I'm 70% protected, means that anytime my hazard is down by 70%, I don't care what's happened to me before. And so now the leaky paradigm matches and the other paradigm, the polarized paradigm, actually has a higher effectiveness in the population than you would estimate from a trial, and that's because. From a trial, and that's because these people are permanently protected and the hazard paradigm doesn't get them. So, this has real practical implications for measuring and evaluation, and it has real practical applications, of course, from taking the measurements and projecting them. I'm going to go all the way back to here because I might have been so excited about the concepts as not to notice to mention that this is a big deal, right? Like, you could have a vaccine, and if you think this is the R-naught, and And if you think this is the R0 and this is the efficacy, you don't know whether you're going to be protecting 30% of your population or 3% of your population, which you might, sorry. 30% of your population or 90% of your population, and you care. Am I going to finish quickly? Hard to be sure. Cool. So I said this, and that's sort of what I. And that's sort of what I know, but I'm going to talk for at least another five minutes, so don't get disappointed when I do that. I want to talk a little bit about infection-driven immunity. I want to talk about what our vaccine or our cross-immunity is protecting against. I'm going to talk a tiny bit about immune waning, and I'm going to revisit the question of leakiness versus polarization. Versus polarization. And first, I have to sum up something that I thought I had summed up already, which is if you believe roughly in boosting, then the polarized model should be pretty good, right? And I said the idea of the polarized model is it's 20% of the people get the vaccine and they don't even care that they got the vaccine. They're going to get sick anyway. But the other way to look at the polarized model is that the vaccine, if the vaccine is perfectly leaky, 80% effective on anybody. Effective on anybody, but there's perfect boosting, then it's the polarized model that's going to give us the right dynamics. And so I've been coming for decades to the idea that the polarized model, which is not what we usually use, is your best first take. And I still kind of think that's right. Oh, and here's another advantage of the polarized model, which is, oh, I gave this away. So here's our full model. And what I was going to say is, I was going to quiz you, and maybe I will. To quiz you, and maybe I will. So, if we imagine that what the vaccine protects against is transmission reduction, so we imagine that the vaccine is leaky, but that the people who are protected by the vaccine are going to be less likely to transmit. And the quest, And the question is: a vaccine that protects only against transmission reduction, is that better modeled in the leaky or the polarized or the boosted paradigm? And the answer, if you're doing it deterministically at least, is that it's matched perfectly by the boosted paradigm. If this is a deterministic model, then the idea that 100% of the people are going to get infected but transmit 50% as much in deterministic dynamics. Much in deterministic dynamics land is identical to the idea that 50% of them are going to get infected and transmit normally and the other 50% are going to bypass. Again, there's a tiny detail about time dynamics. But basically, if we're trying to model transmission reduction, the boosting paradigm works well for that. So I feel like I didn't say that as clearly as I had planned to, and I apologize. Clearly, as I had planned to, and I apologize. We can talk about it later. So, what do we mean by leakiness in a broader sense, and why am I coming back to it? Well, leakiness we can define as any gap between efficacy and effectiveness. And while I was preparing an earlier version of this talk, a very mean person called something to my attention that I hadn't thought of before, which is that not every challenge is the same. And if we imagine different strengths of challenges instead of Strength of challenges instead of only different number of challenges, then that can break this paradigm in ways that I haven't addressed up until now. This is assuming you think I've addressed up until the things I think I have. But we can be thinking about those dependents and we can also be thinking of how do we know whether we've had one challenge or two or three. You know, if I meet David, Irena, and Caroline, and they all try to give me a flu one week apart, I think I know how to model that. Or if they're all trying to give me flu To model that, or if they're all trying to give me flu now, I think I might know how to model that too, although it's different from the paradigm I've shown you. But what if one of them tries to give me flu at breakfast and one of them tries to give me flu at coffee, and one of them tries to give me fluid lunch? Is that three challenges or one challenge? Don't take it personally, or else don't sit in the front row. That works. And the reason I got so scared of this is a study, and I need to remake this graphic. And I need to remake this graphic because it makes me very sad. But as a graphic, but the information is very interesting. They studied the protectiveness of vaccination in prisoners, and they studied different levels of exposure. And they found that with high exposures, basically regarding the minimum geography of prisoners, with high exposures, you have a higher hazard ratio. That is to say, the vaccine is less prison. That is to say, the vaccine is less protective. So that's leakiness in a dimension that I hadn't understood. And as I already gave away my slide, we think of challenges a week apart as likely to be antagonistic to each other. If you challenge me with flu Texas today and I win, then I'm probably safe from flu Texas a week from now. And so that's polarized-like. Challenge is an hour apart. Challenges an hour apart or a minute apart are probably very different. I could be overwhelmed by two or three challenges by the same flu-texis if they come too close together. And I encourage everybody to ask Jane, who's fortunately talking next, how within-host people think about things like dose dependence and dose schedules. One way to think about it here is to simply change the picture. So here we had. The picture. So here we had vaccine efficacy as a constant. But if we take now roughly my new favorite model, so this is some, this is a vaccine where we remember that you had it in one way, but we consider lumping boosting-ish stuff and polarizing-ish stuff into this same arrow, which works dynamically. And now we could just imagine at different levels of forces. At different levels of force of infection, maybe the protectiveness of the vaccine might change, right? If the force of infection is very high and it's COVID, then this pie might be less than the canonical vaccine efficacy. The boosting paradigm is also really good for getting back to the interacting strains model because people have been doing interacting strains models like this for decades, in part. For decades, in part because putting polarization into here is kind of tricky. But putting boosting into here is less tricky, right? We just imagine here, I assume this is roughly clear to everybody. Somebody showed a diamond-shaped version of this same graph today. But you can get one strain or another strain, and the one strain puts you in a box where you're somewhat protected from the other strain. But we could imagine that some of this goes through boosting. Goes through boosting as well. And we can ask, first of all, what's the evidence if these dynamics are leaky-like, or boosted-like, or unboosted-like, or boosted-like. And then we can ask, what are the implications of that for the kind of questions we've been asking before, COVID or influenza, drift? Finally, all of this is foundational to the questions that people like Michael are asking, which is how do we make a practical model of COVID? A practical model of COVID with different kinds of immunity, right? Natural immunity, which is waning, vaccine immunity, which is waning, hybrid immunity, and then eventually we take models like this. So here's a model of different levels of resistance, whether you've been had a natural infection, and another set of different levels of resistance when you haven't. And then we're trying to shoehorn that model using techniques like NATO. Using techniques like Nate's technique or Steve's technique, and hopefully, Nate and Steve are going to be friends, and we're going to have really good software soon. To shoehorn things, sorry, like this into models like this that sort of realistically think about challenges with different strains in an environment where people are also getting vaccines. And I'm just going to skip over that and thank you all for your patience. Patience.
