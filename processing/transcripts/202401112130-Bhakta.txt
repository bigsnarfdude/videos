Okay, so I'm very pleased to introduce Subham Bhakta, who will talk to us about arithmetic statistics of modular degree. Thank you for the introduction. And yeah, so I am feeling great to be back here because, yeah, so I did my bachelor's and master's here at CMI and I spent like five years of my life. And yeah, I am feeling great. And yeah, I am feeling great to be back here. And thanks again, the organizers, for giving an opportunity to talk. As the title suggests, this talk is about modular degree. I understand that this might not follow the exact theme of the conference, but I hope that it will also not bore you. Okay. You okay, so yeah, and uh, this is based on joint work with Shilakshmi Krishnamurti and Sunil Pasupalati, who is already sitting right at the back in the audience. Okay, so in this talk, I'll be mainly focusing on modular degree. I'll like give a short introduction to the growth and To the growth, and mainly I will be focusing on Watkins conjecture, which is about the relation of modular degree with the rank. And in the end, I will be talking about some approaches to solve Watkins' conjecture for elliptic curves with prime conductors. So we have an elliptic curve E over Q and the modular curve X naught which is Naught n which is obtained by the natural action of the modular congruence subgroup gamma n on the upper half plane H. Then it is now quite well known that E over Q is modular. That is, there exists a surjective morphism defined over Q from X naught n to E and what we are interested in is the modular in is the modular degree, which is the minimal degree of which is degree of the minimal parameterization. In the sense that in the isogenic class of E, there will exist an elliptic curve whose degree is the minimal one. And we are considering degree, we are saying that modular degree to be that degree. And we'll be first talking about the growth of modular degree ME. modular degree ME in terms of the conductor n of E. I am not writing like N with subscript E because I mean I'll be using many times this N and this will be understood that this N is, yeah, this N depends on E. And the growth conjecture that we are interested in is the following conjecture of Freya, which predicts that the modular degree grows like The modular degree grows like n over 2 plus epsilon. And we'll be more focusing on the following conjecture of Watkins, which he predicted from Cremona's table. And Cremona's table is also made out of modular symbols because there is a way to compute these modular degrees in terms of modular symbols. And this is the conjecture of what case that I will be talking about, which says that if R is the rank of elliptic curve, I mean over Q, rank of the Q rational points, then R is at most the two valuation of modular degree. And not just the numerical evidence, there is also a heuristic of Dumingan given in 2006, which is given. Which is given like in terms of, I mean, so I mean, his heuristic was that we can capture the model group inside a suitable subgroup of the Selma group of symmetric square of the two torsion points. And that can also be further identified as a tangent space of appropriate deformation ring of. Deformation ring of residual Gallio representation modulo 2. And conjecturally, that deformation ring also can be identified with certain ring of Hecke operators. And then we can get the connection with modular degree using Weil's numerical criteria. But yeah, in this talk, we will not be focusing on deformation theory or Deformation theory or stuff like that, but we'll be giving some analytic perspective of the conjecture, like why we can expect this to be true like this. Okay, so first I'll be talking about growth. And to talk about growth, we need, we first of all need faulting site. So recall that, so yeah, let us recall. That so, yeah, let us recall the faulting site. So, faulting site can be written as the in terms of delta, which is discriminant of E, then in terms of the Ramanjan tau function, I mean delta function, and where the tau E is the point correspond corresponding to E on the upper half plane. And then we, yeah, okay, so for our purpose, I mean, we have to do some computers. I mean, we have to do some computation, and for our purpose, it will be helpful to know that the Paul Tings height of E is close to the height of the J invariant associated to E. And in particular, like, yeah, in the semi-stable case, it is really close. But in the when the, I mean, by semi-stable, I mean that when the elliptic curve has multiplicative reduction everywhere. Okay, and when we are not. Okay, and when we are not in the semi-stable situation, then we have so-called this gamma. I don't know. Yeah, so we have this gamma. This is called unstable discriminant. And we have this extra factor here. And this unstable discriminant actually captures the information of the primes of additive reductions. So we can guess that it will be, yeah, some factor related to gamma will be here. Factor related to gamma will be here, and this is precisely the factor. And we'll also need what is called Manning's constant, which is obtained by taking the pullback of the invariant differential to the modular curve. And it is conjectured that the Manning's constant is like uniformly constant. But it is currently known to be true when E is semi-stable and also. Stable and also over all the families which are semi-stable outside a finite set of primes. That I'll come back to later because that we'll be using very soon. And then, yeah, at least for the growth purpose, we'll be using this identity of modular degree in terms of volting site and Manin's constant, where the norm of F is the usual one. Is the usual one. I mean, this is the Peterson norm defined on the space of new firms. At least for the growth purpose, we will be using the result of Rankine, which gives the growth of this Peterson norm of F. And here, yeah, and here, okay, so here AP is the associate, I mean, the new form which is associated. I mean, the new form which is associated to E. And for the whole talk, not just for the growth purpose, we'll be using the well-known notion of the height, which is defined as follows. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay, so this is a result of Ramurti Byakin. Of Ramurthi back in 1999, which says that under the ABC conjecture, the degree conjecture is true for elliptic curves of this form. And this is also vice versa. That degree conjecture for this curve implies ABC conjecture. But one, I mean, I mean, one issue here is that the family that we are considering here is really a thin family. Considering here is really a thin family. I'm saying thin in the sense that all of these electric curves have a two-torsion rational point, and that family is really thin compared to the set of all electric curves. Yeah. And that's why we are, I mean, we are aiming to prove something like whether the conjecture holds for almost all the elliptic curves or not when we define with respect to the most well-known height. Most well-known height function. Yeah, so to start with, we take any finite set of primes S and we define ES to be the set of all elliptic curves which has semi which has multiplicative reduction outside S. That is, it may have additive reduction, but if it has, then it has to be only at the primes coming from S. Yeah, and then this is a And then this is a result of past 10. Yeah, I forgot to write the year, but I also don't remember now. I think, yeah, maybe within 10 years or something. Yeah, which says that the Manin's constant is uniformly constant. I mean, yeah, over the family of electricals, which are semi-stable away from a finite set. And then it is an old result of. And then it is an old result of Haubri and his collaborators, which says that the Spirus conjecture relating discrement with the conductor holds for almost all the elliptic curves when we arrange with respect to the height function. And then with doing some small adjustment, we get that height of the J invariant is bounded as we want outside probably a small. outside probably a small set of density about O epsilon and then if we yeah if we look at the neuron code classification of fibers over singular primes then it turns out that the semi-stable discrement that we are interested in is also uniformly constant over the family years Yes. And also, I mean, given any prime P, the proportion of periodic curves which has an additive reduction at that prime p has a density about 1 by P square. So in particular, the density of E S is at least 1 minus some over 1 by P square, where P is not coming from S. And then use. Then, using the identity here and using all this information, we immediately get that the modular degree is bounded by n over 7 by 6 plus epsilon for almost 100% of the electric curves. So, there is one catch here that why is, I mean, why 7 by 6 is coming here, but the conjecture is. conjecture uh yeah but the conjecture while the conjecture predicts the degree to be n square per n over two plus epsilon this is because i mean original spiros conjecture says that delta is is bounded by n over six plus epsilon but how do and the others proved this thing for almost all electricals with the exponent one and that's essentially why we are getting seven over six not the not two not 2 yeah it's basically 1 plus 1 over 6 and 1 by 6 is coming essentially because of this okay now I want to go to the main main topic of today's talk which is the Watkins conjecture and before yeah before going into Watkins conjecture I would like to mention one low Would like to mention one lower bound on the two valuation of modular degree in terms of the number of prime factors of n. And to do that, we need to recall the Atkin Lanar involutions that acts on the modular curve. And from the modular parameterization, we know that there is a map from Jacobian J0n of X0N to E. And if And if w is in the kernel of the map given by the Atkin lanar involutions, then we have this property that pi of omega d is pi d for any divisor d on the Jacobian. And then taking any Q rational point on the modular curve, we get a map from W prime to the set of two rational points on electric curves. Rational points on electric curves, two torsion points on the electric curves. And further, if we denote W double prime to be the kernel of this map, then we get the following lower bound due to Dhammigan and Krishnamurti, which is obtained by considering another curve, X double prime, which is quotient of the modular curve and its Jacobian. And the property. And the property that I mean, yeah, because I mean, by the definition of w prime, it turns out that we our pi also gives a map from j double prime to e and this satisfy the following degree relation. And in particular, this size of the kernel here will divide the degree of pi, and that gives the lower bound of valuation of Me in terms of omega of, I mean, number. terms of omega of i mean number of prime factors of n omega n and essentially and for the i mean yeah as long as we want to use analytic tools to understand what kins conjecture our aim in general will be to get something like uh lower value i mean v2 of m e is greater than omega n and that part again dominates the rank part. Part. Yeah, I will come back to details soon. Okay, so let us first, okay, so let us again recall the height function that we are using throughout the whole talk. So, yeah, as I just said, it follows crudely from Damigan and Krishnamurti's result that the lower valuation of ME is Valuation of Me is, I mean, yeah, so two valuation of Me is bounded by omega n minus three. Three is coming because this thing is at most two and this thing is at most one. Okay, then we also know due to Bhargava and Sankar that average rank of the all elliptic curves when we arrange with the with When we arrange with respect to this height, the average rank is strictly less than one. And then, I mean, if we want to show that Watkins' conjecture is true on an average, then, of course, we have to show that the average of the two valuations is large enough. And this is very simple because, yeah, this is very simple because we have a, I mean, our discrement is like a polynomial function. Our discrement is like a polynomial function, so we can use any shifts to get that the number of prime factors of this object is large for almost all AB. And that gives immediately that for almost all E, the number of prime factors of the conductor is large. And yeah, that gives the immediate consequence that average rank of the electric curves is bounded by the average of the. is bounded by average of the all two valuations of modular degrees. And also in particular, if we know the minimalist conjecture, which says that half of the times elliptic curves has rank zero and half of the times it has rank one, then yeah, then like almost, I mean, for almost all the elliptic curves, Watkins conjecture is true because we know that Watkins conjecture is true for the Rank one elliptic curves. Yeah, there is a long story behind that which I am. Uh there is a long story behind that, which I am not going into how it is proved, but it is known to be true for rank one cases. Okay, now because as I mentioned, I mean here I am talking about almost all the elliptic curves, obviously it does not give any information about other thin families. By thin families, I mean which has zero density. For example, one thin family is given by One thin family is given by the set of all quadratic twists of a given elliptic curve E. And yeah, so given an elliptic curve E, we want to count how many D's are there for which the Watkins conjecture is true for E D. And yeah, as I just said, we are really on a thin set because according to our height function, the number of electricals that we are interested in. Of electricals that we are interested in grows like x over 5, but here we have x at most. And then the key to handle the modular degree of the twisted curve E D is the following identity of Rankine's method, which relates the modular degree with the Fourier coefficients of the associated modular forms. And this identity gives that the lower valuation of modular degree of the twisted curve has the following lower bound. And now the idea is that we analyze, I mean, how does this thing grow? And from there, we want to deduce some consequence on the Watkins conjecture. Okay, so first of all, if we assume the rational, I mean, if E has at least one two torson rational point, then we first of all have that two divides the size of FP points. And the good thing of this property is that these all of these three things are These, all of these three things are even. And in particular, we are getting that the lower, I mean, two valuation of A M E D is bounded by three times omega d minus omega n. And again, three is coming because we have three factors and each of them are even. And yeah, and then due to existence of two isogeny, it is well known that there exists, I mean, there is. That there exists, I mean, there is a well-known bound of R in terms of the number of prime factors of N, and essentially, this bound coupling with this observation here gives that Watkins conjecture is true for ED as long as the number of prime factors of D is sufficiently large. And this is a result of Asparza, Lozano, and Posten found 2021. And of course, this. And and of course this says that the number of D yeah number of D for which Watkins conjecture is true is like yeah for almost all D, Watkins conjecture is true. Yes. And later in 2022, Caro improved this result by showing that Patkin's conjecture is true if as long as E has a prime power conductor. Here, I mean, yeah. Here, I mean, yeah, in this result, we were not assuming that E has a prime power conductor. I mean, it was arbitrary, but here, I mean, as long as E has a prime power conductor, this Watkins conjecture is true for any quadratic twists. And this follows essentially by Setza's classification of dielectric curves of prime power conductors, which gives an explicit lower bound of this object C. of these objects here and yeah and that essentially proves the yeah that essentially proves the conjecture for ED and these explicit constants are yeah following from Setzer's classification that I haven't I haven't written what are the constants because they are I mean they are main set like case by case size okay now Okay, now, yeah, so the first obvious question is: what happens when we have no two torsion rational points? And in that case, our valuation here is zero for at least for many points. And but it's also not that bad because we have one even term here, even if these terms are not even, we are still having at least one even. We are still having at least one even term here. And that gives that a lower bound in terms of only the number of prime factor of D. Okay, and then it is known due to Heath Brown under the assumption of BSD and GRH that the average rank of all the quadratic twists is. Of all the quadratic twists is bounded. And that essentially shows that even if we have, even if E has no two-torn rational point, then Watkins' conjecture is still true for almost all the quadratic twists, provided that BSD and GRH are true for the associated del functions. Okay, now since we are done. Okay, now since we are done with one thin family, but yeah, we'll move to another thin family. And but yeah, okay, so another thin family is when yeah, yeah. So another thin family is when he has at least one two-toles and rational point, and of course, in that case, we have two children. And of course, in that case, we have two choices when the group is Z mod 2Z or when the group is Z mod 2Z square. In the case Z mod 2Z is the result of Carbon Peston from 2022, which I mean, in that result, they showed that the Watkins conjecture is true. I mean, depending on the reduction types of the reduction types of electric curve at the primes. At the primes. And yeah, this is just a small extension of this result. I mean, yeah, it's basically the same proof. It's just that wherever he assumed it is z over 2z, we just had to do slight modification for the kzma 2z square. And we arrive at the conclusion that Watkins' conjecture is true as long as one of the following property holds. It's not that each of them has to hold, but one of them, yeah, if as long as one of them holds, then the As long as one of them holds, then the Watkins conjecture is fine for E. So I will, yeah, I will give the proof like briefly. So, yeah, so we have the rank bound. I mean, here we are assuming that is semi-stable underwriting. Oh, I thought I wrote, but yeah. Oh, I thought I wrote, but yeah. Okay, so here also is assumed to be semi-stable. For non-semi-stable case, I mean, there will be some, there are some conclusions, but there will be more conditions. So, I opted to choose the simplest version, but it looks like I forgot to write the semi-stable here. Okay, so in the semi-stable case, we have the following rank bound in terms of, I mean, R is bounded by omega n minus 1. is bounded by omega n minus 1 and then again we recall the lower bound of two valuation of m e which is again mu minus 3 so note that okay and in this case also this lower bound is greater than mu minus 2 this is because because of the conditions that we are putting in part a that it has non non-split multiplicative reduction everywhere because of that Because of that, the rank is the rank is the rank dominates mu minus 2. And so, of course, the yeah, as I mean, if the rank is at most mu minus 2, then we are done. But if not, then yeah, so rank we can assume to be mu minus 1 because it is already bounded by mu minus 1. And then the most known exact sequence. Exact sequence associated to Selma group says that the Selma 2 Selma rank of E is it dominates mu plus 1. And then it essentially shows that the 2000 part of the Tether Supper group is trivial. And in particular, the parity conjecture is true for at least in this case. And then we have from the, yeah, I mean. From the yeah, I mean, taking the product of a local root numbers, it turns out that our rank is odd, but again, in the again here, we are assuming that number of prime factors is of the conductor is odd, and that implies that r is even. So, we are getting some contradiction here, and yeah, that's and this contradiction shows that the r has to be at most. that the r has to be at most mu minus 2 and yeah that proves the conjecture for this case i mean for the case part a and for the other other parts also it is yeah more or less same it's just that we have to again play around these exact sequences so yeah i will not be talking about all the parts okay now uh now here in this result all Now, here in this result, or even in Caro and Pasten's result, we yeah, we don't know like how often these conditions are being satisfied or whether they are satisfied by even for a positive proportion of electric curves or not. Because I mean, the conditions are really about the reduction types. And for example, it's even hard to compute the uh proportion of elliptic cross which a uh of a given conductor. Of a given conductor. Okay, so what we do is that we take some other, I mean, other way of computing the proportion of electric curves, which has at least one torsion. I mean, for the talk, specifically, if it has at least two or three torsion, then we have the following two well-known information that for. Well-known information that when he has a two-torsion point and when he has a three-torsion rational point. And in particular, we are now interested of the lattice points of these regions, where R1x is the set of polylliptic curves from the beginning, which has high is about x over 5 by 6. Yeah, I should have normalized as, I mean, so that it we get. So that it we get five here, but it does not matter, it will be pretty much clear. Yeah, yeah, here probably I parametrized in a wrong way, but yeah, so okay, so the point is that I mean, yeah, under suitable norm, I mean, under suitable normalization, we have x power x over 5 many points here and then x. Over 5 many points here, and then x cube many points here, and x square many points here. And what we want to do is that we want to see, for example, how many how many points of this x cube many points satisfy Watskin's conjecture, and again same for R3 region out of x square many points. Okay, then uh okay for this we need to recall the Need to recall the well-known method of two isogeny, which allows to bound the rank in terms of pi-Selmer rank and its dual, where the Selmer group counts the number of homogeneous spaces which are locally solvable. And then we want to count the number of number of AB for which the rank is sufficiently smaller so that our rank is bounded by omega n minus 3 and again this is further bounded by the by the two valuation of M e due to the lower bound we have been using and yeah so so in our case the homogeneous spaces that we are considering are precisely of this form Of this form. And specifically, we are interested in the following choices of D1 and D2 because of the descriptions of Silmar groups here. And then we simply, I mean, for simplicity, at least for the talk, we use the following criteria. I mean, yeah, solubility criteria of these spaces. And using these two criteria, we do some computation, like, yeah, I mean, using basic analytic tools and arrive at the conclusion that the set of lattice points inside the region R to X that satisfy Watkins' conjecture has like, I mean, that proportion is positive. And since we have And since we have this result for the Pi-Selma group, similarly we will have same result for the its dual case. And combining these two, what we get is that a positive proportion of periodic curves inside the region R2x satisfy Watkins conjecture. And yeah, so I'm not stating the most explicit version of the result yet because, I mean, this is still a work in progress. A work in progress, and yeah, we are basically trying to improve the percentage of, I mean, the percentage in terms of the proportion like we are getting in this result. And the idea is to, we fully utilize the local solubility, local solubility criteria of these homogeneous spaces here. I mean, here I'm just using the most simplest version for which not even Hencelima is needed. Which is not even Hensel Lemma is needed, but Hensel Lemma does give one list of criteria that ensures the required local solubility. But there are too many conditions that, yeah, we are trying to see how to handle those conditions to get better result here. Okay, now for the story of our region R3X, we first consider. We first consider the simple family, which is given by x cube plus a and then our rank of the three selma group is bounded by in terms of the 3000 part of the class group here and the number of primes inside the set S and using this This okay, and then we know that okay, so yeah, somehow we estimate SA, and then we use the yeah, we use the result of Bhargava and Bharma on the yeah, it was proved long back, but Bhargaba and Bharma, I mean, proved it with some modification and rewrote the proof basically. I think it was Helborn's original proof, but yeah, now I forgot. But yeah, the point is that. But yeah, the point is that the average size of the three torson parts is bounded as long as we take the average over all the quadratic fields, doesn't matter whether it is imaginary or real. Then, yeah, then using that, yeah, using all of this, we get that the number of yeah, number of a's for which the Watkins conjecture is true for E has a lower bound of order x over square root of log x. And again, this. And again, this is still a work in progress because we want to get rid of the square root of square root log x from the denominator. And it doesn't look like using this bound we can do because the main, because the hard part is to bound SA here. I mean, since we are already talking about divisibility by a set of primes with density half, we are bound. hub we are bound to get square root log x here and for that and and also that all of these families does not have a three torsion point so it does not i mean this is not such a good idea to use this bound to compute i mean to find positive proportion of elements in our 3x which satisfies the watkins conjecture and for that we are basically using the local solubility criteria The local solubility criteria of cubic forms in three variables to count the points inside R3x. And yeah, by local solubility criteria, I again mean it is same as in the quadratic case, I mean two-seller group case. Okay, so now I will be talking about one approach for I mean to study Watkins' conjecture. To study Watkins' conjecture for electric curves with a prime conductor. So there is an association of Gross. I wrote the year wrong. It is 1985. And yeah, Gross associated the elliptic curves inside. I mean, Gross associated, I mean, Gross realized the elliptic curves as the points inside Picard group of suitable. Inside Picard group of suitable curve whose which is identified further with the set of all electric curves with a supersingular reduction at prime p. These EIs correspond to those isomorphism class or supersingular points over algebraic closure of F P. And there is a bilinear map from x cross x to z given by the X to Z given by the following inner product and we also have the Hege correspondence from X to X given by the Brand's matrices and then we pick a vector V e for which is like the simultaneous eigenvector of all these E operators whose eigenvalues are precisely the Fourier coefficients of Fourier coefficients of the associated of the modulus The associated of the modular form associated to E. And then we have a result due to Maestre which relates the modular degree with the norm of this vector VE. And yeah, and this is the key point. As long as our electric curve has prime conductor, then we have been trying to use the Trying to use the we have been using this Mysterious identification of ME in terms of the inner product. So, yeah, so it's a result by Kazaliki and Kohen from 2018, which says that the inner product is always even for the prime conductor case. And that essentially shows that Watkins' conjecture is true, at least for. Watkins' conjecture is true, at least for rank one. And that's how the story of proving Watkins' conjecture of rank one finished. Because, I mean, before Kazaliki cohen, I mean, all of the known results were, I mean, boiling everything to the prime conductor case. And they finally proved the conjecture for Rankon case using Glossius association. Now, Now, the next question is how to what to do for the rank 2 case or higher. And in the rank 2 case, it turns out that if all of these coefficients are even, when the electric curve EI has supers, I mean, yeah, so EI has supersing reduction over Fp bar, but when EI is defined over Fp, then all of these coefficients are predicted to. Coefficients are predicted to be even. Okay, yeah, I mean, if they are even, then the Watkins conjecture is true, or at least even weekly, if like some of the squares of these objects and some of the cues of these objects are divisible by 4. So, this is precisely the conjecture proposed by Kazaliki and Cohen in their, yeah, in a paper like from Like, from a paper in 2017, like, this was the older version of this paper. Not older version, I mean, the previous version. Yeah, that was written in terms of, not in terms of Watkins' conjecture, but that was really about this conjecture. Okay, so yeah, to prove the conjecture, I mean, one equivalent, if one wants to prove the conjecture, then If one wants to prove the conjecture, then equivalently, one can try to prove that one can always. I mean, yeah, one needs to find another cus form which is congruent to if modular two and on which the atkin liner operator wp acts as minus one and yeah so this is the this is one of the result that we got recently Of the result that we got recently due to a suggestion by Merrell, and what we got is that I mean, instead of AP, we can show that for any P, we can get a new form of level P for which this statement holds that there exists F prime for which A prime is congruent to F modulo 2 and on which WPX has minus 1. But of course, here the problem. But of course, here the problem is that, I mean, we don't know how, I mean, we have no control over this F. So we don't also have control over whether coefficients of this F are in Q or not. So we don't even know whether this F will correspond to some elliptic curve or not. So yeah, that we are thinking how to do. Okay, now I'll be talking about another. Be talking about another approach towards this conjecture of Kazaliki Kohen through the brands matrices. So, how brands matrices are coming? This is essentially because of the definition of the Heke correspondence. And this is a result of Gross from the same paper where he defined the association in terms of the Picard group. Group. And that says that this T piece, yeah, I mean, this Heke operator's T piece permutes the EIs. And in particular, they fixes EI as long as the, I mean, the elliptic curve EI is defined over Fp. And yeah, and if E has root number minus one, then Tp of V E is minus. Tp of Ve is minus Ve. And in particular, from the Grosses result, Kazaliki and Kohen observed in the same paper where they mentioned their conjecture that this conjecture is true. And in fact, the coefficients are, I mean, even zero when E has root number minus one. So, and yeah, okay, now for the root number plus one case, Plus one case one can show again using the properties of brands matrices that this conjecture is true if we can find one M for which all of these entries or brand matrices B I J, I mean yeah all of these entrances are even and simultaneously Fourier coefficient A M is also odd. But there is a big problem with There is a big problem with this already because since we know that the entries also give rise to cusp forms, it is due to a result of share that all of these entries will be even for almost all m. Like for any cusp form, almost all the entries are always even as long as they are normalized. And yeah, and because of the same reason, I mean, M will also be even for almost all M. So, I mean, we have a 100% of the cases here, and we have 0% of the case here, and we don't know what happens in the intersection. And that is the hard part here. But, I mean, one good hope here is that, I mean, yeah, hope is the following line. Yeah, copy is the following line which says that almost all the cuspermans in of level P, we yeah, this here like the this phenomenon with a p. Now here big question is like what do I mean by almost all the cos forms here at least here I'm not trying to At least here, I'm not trying to say anything specifically, but what I'm trying to say is that we know that so this space has a basis given by the Hecke eigenforms. And I am saying that, and I am considering all the cusps, which are like linear combination of these Hecke eigenforms. So the coefficients they can come from from any like any element of C, the coefficients. What I'm trying to say is that as long as. I'm trying to say that as long as these Hege eigenforms are not PROS twist equivalent, then if we associate gallery presentation to them, then we can study image of that gallery presentation and that will give that as long as they are not twist equivalent, they will share such a phenomenon. And if two things are twist equivalent, then they, I mean, they differ only by. They, I mean, they differ only by a root of unity. So, yeah, in that sense, I am saying that almost all the cases satisfy this property. But again, I mean, we still don't know how whether the custom associated to this branch matrix will fall into this category. Okay, so yeah, so again in the same paper of Kazaliki Kohen, they showed that this I mean this Bijls where L is a prime, all of these Bijls are even as long as L is inner. Long as L is inert in the yeah, in the quadratic extension q square root over minus p. And yeah, they obtained by realizing all these entries as number of representations of L in terms of a given by a ternary quadratic form. And yeah, so about this condition, I mean. This condition, I mean, suppose that our discrement is positive, then we know that q square root of p is contained inside q e2. And then the condition inert immediately implies that the provenance element associated to L has an even order inside the Galois group. And that implies L to be even right away. But we remember that we want L to be odd and all of these things to be even. Be odd and all of these things to be even. So, at least this thing won't immediately work. I mean, this thing won't work for positive discrement. Okay, yeah, the last page, last slide. Yeah. Yeah, so, but when, yeah, so this again, yeah, this is also should be negative. Also, should be negative. So, what I mean to say is that this approach does work when discrimination is negative. And yeah, this is, I mean, this is, I mean, just following this argument that we have to find primes which are 3 mod 4, and we have to make sure that L splits in Q square root P, and then we can pick up, then we can find a prime L inside. A prime L inside Q square root P lying above the small prime L that remains inert inside QE2. And yeah, so but in general, like yeah, we still don't know how to find such a prime L or such an integer M for which Bij's will be even and M will be odd. But what we know is that all of the row sums and column sums of the Brand's matrices are even. Of the brand's matrices are even. And at least using that property, we can show that, I mean, the family of vectors covers like, does not cover like at least 50% of the possible cases. And by family, I mean like the family of vectors, which is supposed to be zero by the conjecture, we are showing that it may not be zero always, but these. Not be zero always, but this also does not cover more than 50% of the possibilities. And yeah, so these are the references that we are using. And yeah, so I'll stop here. Thank you for the thank you very much. Questions or comments? Go to one of the first pages where you talked about the deformation ring and the tangent space and the majority of the majority of the city. Yeah. So, like, um, has there been an any like algebraic approach to sort of study the distribution of these dimensions? The problem is that when we are putting these local conditions here to determine the appropriate. I mean, the suitable subgroup. Yes, the suitable subgroup here, the local conditions that we are getting here also correspond to some deformation conditions. Right. Yeah. And yeah, that I don't know. I mean, how to, yeah, I mean, I mean, in general, like, and also in Damigan's proof, he also had to, he also had some conditions like E2 is probably. E2 is probably trivial or non-trivial, one of those conditions. But in general, I don't know whether we can find the deformation conditions that works for all the related curves. That I don't know yet. Okay, so we can talk about later. Other questions or comments? Thank you. So the conjecture is about the prime two. So Watkins' conjecture is about the prime two. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. And you've talked about various different sort of lines of attack and results towards this conjecture. And I guess my question is. My question is: So, the conjecture is not true if I replace two by some other prime. But do some of the results or techniques that you've used remain, do they still work if two is replaced by a different prime? I mean, I haven't seen, first of all, I haven't seen much if we replace this two by some other prime. I think this two is essentially coming. I think this two is essentially coming because of because of the relations with like E2. I mean the modular modular degree, I mean, naturally comes because I mean, yeah. Yeah, I don't know precisely, but my question is not really about the conjecture. Yeah. My question is about the results that you proved. I mean, I am expecting. I mean, I am expecting that we first of all may not have R here for the V3, at least for V3. I mean, for the two, we should have the strongest possibility here, R. And for the three valuation, I think it might be like much lesser than R. Yeah. Yes, no, I agree. The conjecture is not true if you replace two by a different prime, but my question is not about the conjecture. The conjecture. So, you mean how will the valuation be? So, what I'm asking is about the results that you've proved. Okay, oh, you mean those techniques, whether they will be applicable or not? Yes. I mean, the main starting point again here is the lower bound. Yeah, because we know what is the lower bound of MA, two valuation. And yeah, the first starting point would be to get lower bound on the three valuation, for example. And that I haven't seen, but I think I saw one Stein's conjecture which probably says something like it is not divisible by larger enough primes or something. And also, yeah. And also, yeah, this won't also work because the Atkin operator is really involution. And given involution, we can expect about two torsion points only.
