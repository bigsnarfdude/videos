And our next speaker is Lingse, and she's going to talk about market varieties test and standard remote. It's a handful of a title, so I'll walk you through it. More or less, though, we are actually. You have something. Oh, yeah. That's why I thought it was. More or less, yeah. But really, what we are looking at, and the larger motivating problem is detection. Larger motivating problem is detection and natural function for localized source events. So, thinking about specifically natural events like Francis just mentioned, like volcanic eruptions or wildfires and how you might attribute downstream impacts, which tend to be gradual changes seen over a period of a few years, and how you might attribute that to localized sources. This is a very, very challenging problem. It's not something we're looking to. Problem. It's not something we're looking to solve, but actually build methods kind of towards a solution. But I'll talk about actually maybe a more interesting motivating example in an area that I've been working in for the last five years in the area of climate intervention, which is specifically actually solar climate intervention, which is the concept of injecting aerosols into the atmosphere in a number of ways to kind of counterbalance what humans are doing to. Are doing to the climate, right? So, this is happening, but it's, you know, people are talking about it. If you're not in this field, you might not have heard about it, but I'm happy to talk about more afterwards. But this is really important. The activation and detection of these types of events are very important for any kind of national policy on climate or interventions of this sort, because everyone in the world would be likely impacted by this unless there was. Really impacted by this, unless it was extremely localized, and which is often we probably don't care too much about it. So, we're looking at building methods kind of towards detection and attribution of these types of events, which you don't really have a lot of examples of now, right? So, a really nice example of this, actually a good analog are volcanic eruptions, which is what I'll talk about here. So, I just specifically want to mention there are multiple types of attribution in the Mentioned there are multiple types of attribution in the climate, some are harder than others. One that we're looking at is again localized sources. So, can you kind of tease out kind of immediate events? So, you have a volcanic eruption that can lead to a number of, I say, kind of domino effects in the climate where you see very obvious changes in your aerosol concentrations, in your temperatures, in your precipitation. And those can all happen over a series of. Those can all happen over a series of weeks, days, weeks, months, years, and how can we trace those impacts? So, we're really looking to develop statistical methods that are interpretable and that we can actually pull meaning and represent these relationships in this complex process. So, this is a nice example to show you from a volcanic eruption the types of changes you might see in certain parameters. And certain parameters that happen over again a period of two or three years. I'll also mention this is a very large project. This is probably about 45 people composed of climate scientists, climate modelers, atmospheric scientists, applied mathematicians, statisticians, four other academic institutions we're working with as well. So this is just a, I'm just going to show a small subset of what we've been doing. Just here's, again, I've Just here's again a small subset of some of the statistical methods we're looking at for this problem space. And today I'm really just going to focus on the space-time dynamic model. But we're also looking at explainability methods for echo state networks, some change point detection methods, specifically epidemic change points, where you have kind of this slow change that then eventually returns to normal after such an event. And as well, data fusion, because we're And as well at data fusion, because we're really interested in can we do this and how can we leverage observational data? Because these types of events are actually not that easy to simulate in the climate model itself. And there are very few models that can do that. So again, just motivating the problem more, this is a little bit what of our data looks like. This is reanalysis. So true observational data is, of course, much more sparse for most. Much more sparse for most of these variables. But you have from left to right aerosol optical thickness or depth, temperatures on the surface, and temperatures in your stratosphere. So I should have ordered these differently, but as far as your signal to noise ratio that you would detect after an event, your aerosols will have your largest signal to noise ratio. The stratospheric temperatures, as you can see, you actually expect a warming in your stratosphere, which you see. Expect of warming in your stratosphere, which you see a few months after the event, which happened in June. It was kind of the, is the next strongest, or the next strongest signal to noise, and then the weakest signal to noise will be your surface temperatures because there's so many things that contribute to changes in your surface temperatures. And you can kind of see this cooling in your northern hemisphere and the winter following the eruption. So just an example of kind of what your data looks like. Also, very well motivated. Also, very well motivates the need to understand other contributions to these changes and D try and diagnose pre-processing, and all that, which is why we work very closely with climate scientists in this area. So now I'm going to dive into the specific model that we're looking at to try to pull inference from this problem or try to make inference in this space. So just to introduce the basic dynamics. The basic dynamic space-time model, right? So, even this model alone, which you have a few different dynamic parameters here. So, consider just your mean function, which can capture your trend. This can also be just a fixed global mean. Typically, you have a spatial effect and your random error, all of which are dynamic. So, you're getting an estimate at every time point over time. So, this alone can be highly parametrized. Highly parametrized. To make it a bit more flexible and actually more efficient to compute, we're representing our spatial random effect with a basis function expansion. So very simple phi alpha t and alpha t we're allowing to be dynamic, but we're sharing our basis over time. And then to go further, we're representing these coefficients as starting with just an NAR. Starting with just an AR structure, the stationarity assumption may not hold when we are looking into this, but with the right number of pre-processing, it can, right? But anyways, we're starting here to represent and kind of add some dependency, temporal dependency into our coefficients. And this is also going to help with computation. And then lastly, we bring in the multivariate component because we really are interested in how we can make inference about the correlation. Can we make inference about the correlations across these variables over time? They actually, the correlations between the variables change before and after an event. So how we do this is we're representing our basis functions through this, now we're looking at a VAR structure for our output Ts. And this will make more sense when I talk about what basis functions we're using. So we specifically chose So we specifically chose actually that we're using Lattice Krieger, the multi-resolution representation, because it gives really nice fixed locations for basis functions. And this way we can actually talk about the multivariate correlations that are specific to spatial locations, right? So you can, just looking at a single layer of these basis functions, this is an example of the locations of the basis center. Example of the locations of the basis center locations. And so you're talking about this A matrix is going to explain the correlations for, and right, it is actually spatially varying. So you'll have a, for three variables, for example, you'll have a three by three correlation matrix for every basis location. So you can talk about a correlate, spatially varying correlation across these variables. Okay, so to further bring in, we understand that these basis functions are overlapping and they have spatial dependency structure across them. We do something similar to what the Guinness Fiter's paper did as far as leveraging the spatial auto-aggressive model, but we are assigning it to our error structure in our Um, our error structure in our VAR model. So, leveraging this kind of spatial neighborhood matrix and our ADA Ts allows us to share information with neighborhood basis functions, right? So, we are right now doing this with just a single layer, but you can think about doing this across your multi-resolutions if your estimation method is scalable enough, which is a whole nother challenge. Okay, so just getting into a little bit of the parameter estimation, and then I promise I'll get back to a bunch more pictures and examples of how this works. So we're really using kind of what's in our existing toolbox right now, and then we're building on this for better estimation or a better, a more efficient computational estimation. So we're really leveraging the VAR package. So we're actually, and as well as the user. And as well as the using common filtering for estimating from the posterior of alpha t. So it's a full MCMC, say for our A matrix, which we're currently just estimating with maximum likelihood for faster convergence. But otherwise, it is a pretty straightforward sampling method and entirely gives, nearly entirely Gibbs sampler. A couple of things that we're just working on, just you can, you know, you can leverage this. You can leverage this, you have sparse matrices here. So A is fairly sparse, and your spatial matrices and covariant structure in your eta is also fairly sparse. So that can make this very computationally efficient. Okay, so I'm going to dive into some examples on how we can interpret these models and kind of how we're still thinking about this because it's not, you know, again, we're interested. You know, again, we're interested in the evolution of these correlations, and that is not as definitely challenging to figure out how to kind of even pull the inference from this model, which we really intended to be as inferential as possible. So we started with the simulated data. We simulated from our dynamic model. We also simulated actually just from a straight VAR model and shown we can actually kind of recover that structure well too. But I'll show just World to, but I'll show just front maybe you simulate from a dynamic model and set your A matrix to be kind of asymmetric with some of these cross-correlations. We used only a single layer of our basics functions just to show you kind of how this works. So, this is just an example of what the data looks like if you simulate it across three different variables. And these are kind of the first four time points, and you can see. Four time points, and you can see how it is kind of slowly evolving over time and some of the correlations across your spatial grids. And then, if you were to, you know, just check, if you were to fit this model and check the fit as expected, because we're generating from this model, right, it does, it does fit fairly well. And I'll show you what this looks like and more realistic data because it definitely gets more complicated. But what we're really interested in is can we? But what we're really interested in is: can we recover A? Is this interpretable? Does this tell anything? Does this tell us anything about the correlation across our variables? Right now, A is varying spatially because it is estimated for every basis location. It is not too poorly varying. It's shared across time right now. So, this is just an example of if we have enough time points, and I'll talk about that in a second, but you can actually estimate. But you can actually estimate pretty well in this straightforward example. It's also really neat for interpretability, and again, hard to see the contrast here, but you can project A using your basis functions onto your spatial regime and also see some of that spatial variation, which could be useful to understand how the correlations are changing across space. Just to mention, this shouldn't be surprising, but we do need sufficient time points to recover A well. You need a good history, and you don't always have that in observations or reanalysis. And so just something to point out, depending on the time resolution, and length of time you're working with. Okay, so now I'm moving from simulated data or from. Moving from simulated data or from alcohol synthetic data because it's generated to simulated data, which is simulated from a simplified climate model. So, this is the HSW, I won't go into the acronym, but it's a simplified climate simulation. It actually uses the Department of Energy's Earth System model, but it takes out a lot of the, it pretty much removes all other sources of temperature change and just has aerosols driving that temperature change to bigger. Temperature change to say it simply: so it's the primary mode of variability for temperature changes is aerosol. So, the top figure you see is that the aerosol injection, mostly in the northern hemisphere. And then what you see is the changes that are kind of ensue in the stratosphere and surface. So, this is all the same time snapshot just to kind of show you what this data looks like. It's similar. It's similar to reanalysis. It's a little bit higher as far as spatial resolution. It's actually pretty high in temporal resolution. It's every two days. We did do some aggregation here just to make computation easier. But just this is just an example of what this looks like. And then when we apply our model to this data, kind of what this looks like. So again, the multi- So again, the multivariate model fits the data fairly well. It can recover the general trends. And I think that you can see that looking at their residuals as well. There's some spatial patterns left, but I think it fits it rather well, which is a good sign. And then further, we want to see: do the this is our estimate of our A matrix for that VAR structure. BAR structure at each basis location. So I just wanted to show some of the variation that you see across space at every basis location. So what you do see in the top right corner is that AOD has a significant positive impact on stratospheric temperature, which makes sense. So when you increase the amount of aerosols in your atmosphere, you're actually going to increase stratospheric temperature usually and then you decrease surface temperature. Usually, in a decreased surface temperature, and this is over a number of months. And then, what you also see is a weak effect on surface temperature, which is also makes sense because as you go further down your time evolution, your signal-to-noise ratio, as far as trying to infer what impact your injection of aerosols had on your downstream impacts, that signal-to-noise ratio will decrease. Ratio will decrease. Things that we saw that actually we saw in other similar analyses but didn't expect was an effect on surface temperature, on stratospheric temperature. So this is not intuitive because typically you see an impact of stratosphere, your stratosphere impacts your surface, but you likely will have some kind of feedback back to the surface and stratosphere as well. So there's something interesting that we saw there. Another thing I'll mention about Another thing I'll mention about this data is that what you'll see, you see, in the, there's actually, I think, because we're using, I would say, this is a fairly low resolution basis function, like we could add more layers and increase the resolution of our basis functions. If we had double the amount of basis functions, right, you have less dependency across your larger space. So we're talking about the entire globe here, and it doesn't always make sense. The fewer basis functions you have, and that spatial. Functions you have, and that spatial neighborhood structure we're imposing actually creates a lot of dependency across your space. So, you could have too much dependency over a large region that is making kind of the southern hemisphere influence the northern hemisphere too much. And actually, it was fairly evident in this data because of the way the data was simulated. And that we have essentially a zero field in the entire southern hemisphere, and we see a lot of. Southern hemisphere, and we see a lot of influence of the southern on the northern hemisphere, and that's unexpected. Okay. All right, so the last thing I'll touch is returning to the reanalysis data or the data that has not just a single source of aerosols, right? Is we're trying to apply it to this data. And what we're really finding is there's just a lot more complicated relationships than obviously what we've had, and we're trying. And obviously, what we've had, and we're trying to understand how well that our model does with this data and what kind of adaptations might be needed. So, a couple things I'll point out, just kind of looking at some exploratory data analysis here. So, these are just pointwise correlations at every spatial location on a coarse grid between the pairwise variables. So, the first thing you notice is that there's definitely spatial correlations in the correlations themselves. Correlations themselves. But it just varies by space, and that definitely motivates kind of our spatially varying correlation structure, that VAR structure. You can also see things like in the surface temperature correlations, there's an effect likely of elevation or land versus ocean and other different trends that we're not accounting for right now that we need to account for. We also know because We also know because this is a model over time, there are lots of other sources of variability that leads to temperatures, such as ENSO. In particular, around this volcanic eruption, there was actually the longest timeframe, I think, of there's an seven-year El Niño period, which also kind of heightens the impact of the volcanic eruption. And so, is it possible to actually use an Enzo index to try to extract some of that effect? Some of that effect. Okay. Looking at some of just, this is that was looking at spatial correlation, looking at temporal correlation, looking at just some partial autocorrelation plots across the variables. This was really, we want to see, okay, we're assuming an AR structure, a VAR1 structure. Is this reasonable for our data? Is there further detrending we could do to make this reasonable? Or is this something else that we need to continue? Or is this something else that we need to consider? So, kind of at first glance, for some variables, it could be reasonable. It definitely shows some interesting lags in influences across variables. And I just thought it was important to show some of this and how complicated the data can really get. All right, so finally, showing how our model performs on the reanalysis data. The big thing is that it can pick up the general trends, but the really key thing here is. But the really key thing here is on the surface temperature, especially, we have a lot more complicated spatial trends and variability. We likely need either a lot more basis functions, and there's just more, there's more that we need to represent and can do here. Okay, so just to wrap up, we have a, again, this is, this work is, we're kind of right in the middle of it. This is not finalized at all. So all feedback is really helpful. The problem itself. Is really helpful. The problem itself is very motivating. Here's some things that we're currently working on and just considering moving forward. In particular, just working on improving the computational efficiency so we can increase the number of basis functions because you're talking about basis functions for every time point as well. So it's very highly parametrized. We would like to include multi-resolution basis functions. We actually want to include more variables in our output. We want to explain. We want to explore other interpretations of A. So, and there's a lot more sensitivity analyses that we'd like to do. So, something that we are looking at, which is kind of neat, is you can often interpret VAR models using impulse response functions, which I'm actually not super familiar with. So, if anyone is, I'd love to hear your experience. But this seems like a really promising approach to also enforcing change over time. And then, yeah, again, just more robust testing is needed for a number of various data types because we'd really like to apply this to truly observational data where you have a lot of missingness and just different, possibly different signal to noise ratios. And yeah, I'll end there with a few minutes for questions, I think.
