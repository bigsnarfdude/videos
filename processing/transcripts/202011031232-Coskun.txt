It's a pleasure to introduce Iset Joskun from Illinois, Chicago, who's going to tell us about Brill Noether theorems for moduli spaces of sheaves on surfaces. Thank you very much. Thanks for the invitation and organizing this wonderful event. So everything that I'm going to say will be joint work with Howard Noyer and Kota Yoshioka when I talk about K3 surfaces, which will be the main focus of this talk. Focus of this talk. And when I talk about rational surfaces, then it will be based on joint work with Jack Heisinger. So, what's the setup? The setup is: suppose you start with a smooth projective surface with an ample on it, and say that you have a coherent pure dimensional sheaf on that. So, what that means is that every pure dimension D means that the support of F has dimension D, and every non-zero subsheaf also has support dimension D. Then you can. Dimension D. Then you can write the Hilbert polynomial with respect to this ample that we have here, and you get, which is just the Euler characteristic of the twists of this Your sheaf by, maybe I should have put an H here. So then you get a polynomial of degree D that looks like this. And then you define the reduced Tilbert polynomial by dividing by this leading coefficient up to this d factorial. And then. And then, um, what would it happen? Okay. I see. So, I um, all right. Um, so let me introduce also in case that the sheep is torsion free, let me introduce a few more invariants. We'll have the slope, which is the first churn class divided by the rank, and then the age slope will be that dot age, and the discriminant will be this invariant. So, this will be. Will be this invariant. So this will be used for convenient invariance. And the thing that you should think about is that this is another way of packaging the churn numbers of the churn character, if you want. So for instance, if I know mu, then I can and the rank, then I can recover c1. And once I know the c1 and the rank, then I can recover the second joint character from the discriminant. Okay, so then the main definition is, of course, you call a sheaf g secker semi-stable if. occurs semi-stable if for all proper subsheaves you have that the reduced Hilbert polynomial of the subsheaf is less than or equal to the reduced Hilbert polynomial of f and you compare polynomials at large values so that means that for m sufficiently large you want the value of the reduced Hilbert polynomial to be less than or equal to the reduced Tilber polynomial of your sheaf all right and then just you know another terminology that semi-stable Terminology that semi-stable sheaves have Jordan-HÃ¶lder filtrations, and you call two semi-stable sheaves S-equivalent if they have the same associated gradient. And then the main theorem about the moduli existence of moduli spaces says that there exists a projective moduli space parameterizing S equivalence classes of age-gissiger semi-stable sheaves on X with fixed churn character. Character. All right. So then there are many problems about these modulized spaces. So, you know, like for instance, basic questions that you can ask, when are these moduli spaces non-empty? When are they irreducible? What's, you know, how, so what's the topology? You know, and you know, a lot of these problems are open. So there are several types of theorems, right? The one type of theorem is One type of theorem is that you make X very special, like for instance, you look at P2 or you look at a K3 surface, then we have fairly well-developed theories and we understand the geometry of these moduli spaces well. But if you have a random surface, then we don't fully understand when these moduli spaces are non-empty or when they are irreducible. There are theorems if you start restricting your V. For instance, if you make your discussion. V. For instance, if you make your discriminant sufficiently large, then the theorem of O'Grady tells you that these moduli spaces are irreducible and of the expected dimension. And then you have a lot more information about them as well, like that the general member of the moduli space is a bundle and a slope stable and things like this. But many of the basic properties, again, like non-emptiness and irreducibility are still open. And irreducibility are still open for these spaces. And what really underlies, like one of the fundamental problems that underlies these kinds of questions, is understanding the cohomology of the general sheaf in this moduli space. So, you know, the basic Berlnoder problem, if you want, is that say I take a general sheaf in the moduli space. Where does the cohomology? Of course, I'm being a little bit loose here because if the module, if the moduli If the moduli space is not irreducible, you might be asking me what do I mean by a general sheaf? And then, you know, there are various possible answers to that question. You get slightly different questions depending on what question you are looking at. But for the modulized spaces that we'll consider in this talk, they'll all be irreducible. So these kinds of questions are not going to come up. And of course, once you understand the general sheaf, then you can start asking more detailed questions like, you know, what does Like, you know, what is the locus of Xi's with unexpected chromology? In what dimension does the cohomology jump, and what does that locus look like? But even the first question is, you know, widely open, even for surfaces and modulized spaces that are relatively well understood. So that will be the focus of my talk. So the basic focus is going to be: I take a surface and modulize spaces. She's on there. I take a general sheaf in that, and I want to know what is the cohomology. So, there are a few basic remarks that we can make if we fix the rank and the slope and make the discriminant really large. Then, as I said, by the theorem of O'Grady, this moduli space is irreducible. And if the discriminant is sufficiently large, then you know this sheaves will not have H0 or H2, they'll only have H1 and the value. H1 and the value of H1, of course, will be minus the Euler characteristic. So that's one type of asymptotic thing that you can immediately see. And the other kind of asymptotic thing that you can see, of course, you know, if you fix the rank and the discriminant and you make the first churn class get sufficiently ample, then again, you know, the general sheaf will only have age naught and it won't have higher commodities. But you know, But you know, these asymptotic things are useful sometimes, but you know, what we really want to know is much sharper understanding of the cohomology. And you know, the dream situation, of course, happens for P2. So let me tell you what the theorem is for P2. So this is a theorem of Gutsche and Hirschowitz. And it says the following things. Suppose you look at your moduli space. So maybe one thing that I should Modulized space. So maybe one thing that I should say on P2, all of these moduli spaces are irreducible. And let me assume that the rank is at least two. Under these conditions, the theorem says that if I take a general sheaf, then it has at most one non-zero cohomology group. What that means is that you can determine the cohomology of the general sheaf in the moduli space completely numerically. So, of course, the first thing that happens if the Course, the first thing that happens if the Euler characteristic is negative, right, then you must have H1. So that means that H0 and H2 have to be 0, and H1 is minus the Euler characteristic. On the other hand, if the Euler characteristic is positive, then it's saying that, or non-negative, it's saying that you don't have H1, but you could have H naught or H2, but you could tell whether you have H0 or H2 by the sign of the slope. Because if your slope is negative, Because if your slope is negative, right, then by stability, you cannot admit a map from all, so your H0 has to be zero. And you know, you can then use Sair duality to handle the other case saying that. So, you know, if you have the Euler characteristic is positive and your slope is positive, then you have H naught and the higher cohomology vanishes. And if your Euler characteristic is positive and your slope is negative, then you can only have H2. All right, and then you'll say, I mean, what about this r equals two? So let me give you maybe a small example. You know, that's necessary if you if you allow, you know, sheaves rather than bundles, because you see what can happen is that look at something like the ideal sheaf of a point twisted by minus three. So if you look at something like this, where p is just a point and p2, the Euler characteristic, of course, is zero. Of course, is zero, but both h1 and h2 are one-dimensional, and of course, the general member of that moduli space is isomorphic to a Hilbert scheme of points in that case. So, you know, it's just like the only thing that you can vary is the point P. So every member of the moduli space looks like this, and they all have both H1 and H2. So you see, the failure here is that the general member is not really a bundle, it's not a bundle. It's not a bundle. So, you know, seriality doesn't work well. So that you can run into these kinds of problems when you have this sort of situation. You can't just, your general member of the Margeline space is not locally free. And that's the only exception for P2. And that's why I assume that R is at least true. And you know, if And you know, if such, if we are in this dream situation, namely that if I take the general sheaf in the moduli space and it has at most one non-zero cohomology group, then we can say the weak Brill noder holds. And so, all right, so and this is the remark that in this case that, you know, in the case that this is irreducible, then of course, this is equivalent. This is equivalent to saying that, you know, I mean, you can say two, I mean, you can say two different properties. One is you can say that there exists an F which at most one non-zero cohomology group, or you can say that the general sheave is at most one non-zero cohomology group. Of course, those two things are equivalent in case the marginalized space is irreducible. And then, as I said, P2 is the dream situation. I said, P2 is the dream situation where weak Berliner holds for all moduli space-off bundles. All right, but you see, already when you make your surface a tiny bit more complicated, right? Like for instance, when there exists the curve with negative self-intersection, the picture cannot be as simple. So let me give you maybe an example, right? For instance, if you look at the Herzebrow surface, so let me remind you. Surface. So let me remind you that the Herzegovina surface is a ruled surface over P1. What you do is you take the rank 2 bundle O plus O of E, right? And you take the projectivization. So then this surface has a section with this special property that the square of the section is minus E. And then, you know, the Euler characteristic of this O of E is 2 minus E. So in part. Minus e. So, in particular, you see that this thing is negative if e is large, right? You know, or more accurately, if e is at least two, then the sky is less than or equal to zero. So, you know, you don't expect there to be any age naughts, but of course it has an age naught, right? E is an effective curve. And of course, more generally, if you have a higher rank vector bundle, what can happen is that if you twist your sheet, That if you twist your sheaf by E, the Euler characteristic can be negative, even though the Euler characteristic of F itself is positive. But you see, if F itself has a section, then F twisted by E also has a section, right? So that you see that the Euler characteristic alone cannot predict the cohomology. All right, so what happens here in this case is that this is the only obstruction for these searchible surfaces. For these searchable surfaces. And, you know, the theorem is something like this. And again, I should have said that in this case, the moduli spaces are irreducible as well. So I don't have to worry about different components and things like this, right? So you take a modulized space, a moduli space, and take a general sheaf in that modulized space. Then you see. So, okay, let me maybe say that if I look at Fe. F E again, this is a ruled surface over P1, and I have this distinguished section that I'm calling E, right? So then the Picard group of this F E is generated by E and the fiber, right? And I said that E square is minus E, E dot F is one, and F square is zero, right? So now what you can do is you Right, so now what you can do is you can look at the total slope of your um this was C1 over R, right? So the first observation is that if the fiber class dot the slope is bigger than or equal to minus one, then you can't have H2. And you know, the flip side of that, if you want, but I say our duality, if f dot mu is less than or equal to minus one, then you can't have you can't have h0. So in particular, you see that if you're in Particular, you see that if your intersection with the fiber class is minus one, then you can only have age one, and in that case, age one is equal to minus chi. Okay, so now by shared duality, so maybe I just said here that again, let me maybe assume r is equal to greater than or equal to two here. So by shared duality, we can assume that the intersection of our slope with the fiber class is minus one. We already dealt with the case equal to minus one, right? So then what you learn. So then, what you learn is that if the intersection with this exceptional curve, your slope with the exceptional curve is at least minus one, then f has at most one non-zero cohomology. So that's, you know, weak Brill Noder holds in that case. But if E dot mu is less than minus one, then, you know, what happens is that then H naught of F minus E is isomorphic to H naught of F. So what you can do is you can inductively get rid of the. Inductively get rid of these minuses until you are either in case one or in case three, right? And that tells you what the cohomology is. But you know, there is no like, you know, there is no guarantee that once you've done that process, that you don't end up both with age naught and age one, for instance. And you know, we already saw in the example, like if I just take the line bundle off E already, it typically has both age naught and age one. Okay. Than H1. Okay. So, and you know, rational surfaces basically have this property: like you can analyze more complicated rational surfaces, like the Alpezo surfaces and things like this. And as long as mu is sufficiently ample, then we will know that holds. But you can make a fairly You know, you can make it fairly precise with sufficiently ample means, but you know, already for the line but you know, if you take p2 and blow up a bunch of points in p2, we already don't understand the ample line bundles on those completely. So at the edges, these kinds of questions, like close to the edge of the ample cone, these kinds of questions get tricky. Already four line bundles before you even go to protect the bundles. But the question, like the case that I want to talk more about today is the K3 surfaces case. So the new feature So the new feature in the case of K3 surfaces is that now we have this line bundle OX, right, which has both H0 and H2. Both age not an H2. Okay, so then this introduces potentially more cohomology into your sheaves. And the setup is going to be like this: X will be a K3 surface. The Picard rank will be one. I'll assume that my K3 has Picard rank one, and generated by this ample H, and I'll assume that H squared is 2n so that, okay, so this. Okay, so this will be a K3 of degree plan. So let's see some examples of moduli spaces with interesting homology before we start talking about what can happen. So the first example is like this. So, okay, so let me take my x. Again, it's of this form. It's, you know, the card rank of this x is zh, and h squared is 2n. H and h square is 2n, right? So then what you can do is, um, so this h of h has n plus 2 sections, so you can get take the canonical evaluation or co-evaluation map, whatever it's called, right, from O to the M plus two copies of O of H, and you have the co-kernel F. Now, it turns out that this F is a spherical stable bundle. What that means is that it's What that means is that it's a unique point of its moduli space. I'll tell you a little bit more in a little bit about what the moduli spaces of Xi's and K trees look like. But so it's the unique point of its moduli space. But you see, it has the property that it has both H0 and H2. The point is that if I write the long exact sequence of cohomology, the fact that O has H2 gives H2 gives makes f have h1. And then, of course, f has lots of h naught as well. And if I didn't screw it up, so I think h naught is m plus 2 square minus 1 dimensional and h1 is 1 dimensional. Okay? Is it? Yeah. Uh, is it known that the moduli spaces are irreducible for K three? Um, they are yeah, they they are irreducible, almost always. Yeah. Almost always. Yeah, that's right. Good. So, this is why spherical means unique, right? Yes, that's right. It is definitely unique in its component, but you also need to know that there are no other components. But just to show you that then, you know, like the sort of counter examples to weak Berliner, so to speak, can be pretty complicated. Pretty complicated, like they can involve these complicated arithmetic conditions. Let me give you a funny example. And you know, whenever you give your talk and you have a chance to talk about Fibonacci numbers, you should never pass it up. So that's my chance. So now let me look at a K3 surface of degree 2. In other words, when this N is 1. So this N is equal to 1. And let's say that we have the Fibonacci number as usual, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on and so forth. Three, five, eight, and so on and so forth. And I think I want to index them so that f1 and f2 are one, f3 is two, and so on and so forth, right? Then what I can do is the following. Take here, I guess I should say that k is at least one, no, k is at least two, so that I start with f2 going to f4, right? Um, so. So, all right, so let's take k at least two here. So, what you do is you look, you take 2k minus 2 copies of O, and you look at, you take 2k, the 2k minus second Fibonacci number copies of O and the 2kth Fibonacci number copies of O of H. And you take the general map like this, and you look at the co-curve. Like this, and you look at the core curve. It turns out that this is again. Oh, I should not say F. Again, you see F is a stable spherical bundle. And then there are various ways of interpreting this bundle. Like, you know, there are various ways of seeing this. One way of seeing this is that, you know, you can look at P. You know, you can look at P2, and P2 has these bundles called exceptional bundles. And so there are exceptional Steiner bundles, you know, given by this sequence on P2. And, you know, because this is a finite, it's a two-to-one map to P2, like H defines the linear system H defines the two-to-one map to P2. What you can do is you can pull back. What you can do is you can pull back the exceptional bundle on P2 like that, and then you get a stable bundle on K3, and then it's a spherical bundle. Again, it's the unique point of this moduli space, right? And so that's one way you can think of this. The other way you can think of this is that, like, if you look at the previous case and I take k equals to 2, it reduces to the previous example, right? Previous example, right? And then what you could do is you could do this thing called a spherical transforms on this bundle to generate these other bundles. But anyway, so you see that you have these bundles, and then you see that again, the fact that there is an O here means, and that it has H2 forces this F to have H1. And if I have not screwed up my numbers, you can see. not screwed up my numbers, you can see that age one of this sheaf is of course the same as the dimension as this 2k minus second Fibonacci number. And then age nod of this, you can either work it out from the weather characteristic or you can just see that what the age nod is from taking the age node of this minus the age node of that. I should have made one remark before I started this whole discussion. You see, like, you know, by You see, like, you know, by share duality, we might as well assume that the first churn class is positive or like non-negative, right? So then you see, like, if you have that the first churn class of a stable sheaf is positive, a positive multiple of H, then you see that F cannot have H2, right? Because, you know, by ser duality, we're on a K3. know by ser duality we're on a k3 surface so the canonical of the surface is trivial right so so f dual right h2 of f is the same as h0 of f dual but you know if the first churn class of f is positive then the first churn class of f dual is negative so that if it had the section then you would be destabilizing your sheaf so that you see that in this case the only question is whether the sheaves you have have age not or whether they have age not they the Whether they have age not age, the only things to worry about are age node and age one. All right, so coming back to it, so do you see that? Um, first of all, it's you know, it's a fairly arithmetic condition, you know, these bundles, like when these kinds of spherical bundles exist, there's a fairly arithmetic conditions, and then the cohomology is, you know, it gives you all these Fibonacci numbers and combinations of Fibonacci. Numbers in combination of Fibonacci numbers. And you can generate other such arithmetic sequences if you wanted to. But this is the first example. For instance, even on the K3 is a degree 2, what you could do is you could also look at this map. And you get another spherical bundle here that has, again, both H0 and H1. And you could take the spherical transforms of that one to get generated. Of that one to get generated a different sequence that are that's analogous to the Fibonacci sequence, or you know, you could start with this example on the grader n and start taking its spherical transforms and generate other interesting banter. It's still the pullback of an exceptional balance. All right, so. All right. So, you know, this is just to tell you that, you know, it will be a fairly complicated picture. It's not necessarily a simple picture because you have all these counterexamples to weaken another. And then just so that, you know, to give you one more example to have where it's not just a spherical bundle, but it can be of arbitrarily large dimension, the smaller space. Here is what you can do. So now take a case. So now I take a K3 surface again of degree 2n, always Petar rank 1, right? And then I take a Mokai vector, and I'll tell you what that means in a second, right? Of the form RRK plus 1 times H mera, I should say, to be a little bit clearer, and this thing. Okay? So then the claim is that if you have a general sheaf in this moduli space, then it looks like this. The age one of this sheaf is the maximum of zero. This sheaf is the maximum of zero r minus and k minus ki, and age naught of this sheaf is given by this. So, let me give you an example that you can remember because I like, you know, whenever I hear talks with all these indices and numbers, I never follow it. So, let's take i equals zero. And here is what you can do. You look, so this we want a rank R sheaf, right? So, what you do is you take k times h, k here is positive, right? K here is positive, right? So you take R copies of O K H and you take a line bundle on a curve in the linear system H. Okay? And then of course you need to arrange it so that there are, you know, so that X1 of OHD by this thing is non-zero. So if you do that, then it's So if you do that, then it's not so hard to see that the general such extension is actually a stable stable is a stable bundle. You can compute the dimension of this moduli space. But then you see, I didn't say anything about this degree of d so then you see the Euler characteristic. If you have that the Euler characteristic of this line bundle on this curve is 2nk minus r, right? So let me say that the So let me say that the Euler characteristic is 2nk minus r. And if you have the situation that r is bigger than 2nk, then the age one of that line bundle is not equal to zero, right? And then you see that consequently this f right has age not equal to the age not coming from this and age one equal to the age one coming from that. So do you see that whoops, the other way around. The other way around. Doesn't take my minus 9 correctly. R minus 2nk. All right. And then, you know, so this is some positive dimensional examples for you where you can have you can have like cohomology. All right, but so. All right, but so the question is: how do we understand this and how do we compute it? And the answer is going to be that Brisbane stability gives you a good handle for figuring out what these cohomology groups are. So now let me explain that a little bit. All right, so maybe let me tell you a little bit of background on the moduli spaces of K3 surfaces. So to repeat, we have a K3 surface of Picard rank one. So what's the Mukar? Rank one. So, what's the Mukai vector? So, instead of, so it's standard when you're studying moduli space of K3 surfaces. That instead of looking at the churn character, you look at the Mukai vector, which is you take the churn character and twist it by the square root of the todd class. So, you know, basically the way to think about it is that this is, you know, you slightly modify turn two and to get this number. And to get this number, and what you modify by is that you multiply by the square root of the tot class. And for our purposes, maybe the important thing to remember is that the Euler characteristic of a sheaf with that Mokai vector is given by the sum of these two. So that's given by A plus I. Okay? So there is a Mokai pairing on these Mokai vectors. And the way you define it is that if you have the vector for E and the vector for vector for E and the vector for F, right? It's minus the Euler characteristic of Ef, and then terms with these terms, that's the C1 of E times C1 of F minus the rank for F and the A for E minus the rank for E times the A for F. Okay? And some basic facts about the moduli space to answer some of Sasha's questions from before. So you see, let's take our Mukaiwe. You see, let's take our Mukai vector, it might not be primitive, but you know, if there is a GCD of these numbers is not one, then pull it out and you get something primitive, right? So the first statement is that this moduli space is non-empty if and only if the square of the primitive part is greater than or equal to minus true. Okay, now if m is equals to what if m is equal to one, equals to one if m is equal to one or v naught square is positive then the dimensions this thing is just given by the dimensions of marginalized space is given by v square plus two so you know whenever i write a machine vector you can figure out what the dimension is and if v naught squared is minus two so then this corresponds to this to the spherical case so to speak then you'd have that this moduli space is a single point okay and if v naught squared is zero then the dimension And if v naught squared is zero, then the dimension of this thing is 2m, and then I should say that these are normal, irreducible, projective varieties with factorial singularities. There are two other important things that will come in the discussion, but I'm not going to tell you exactly what the answer is, because that would require me to write a lot of it would require me to write a lot of indices and things like this. So let me just tell you: first, there's Me just tell you. First, there is a classification. So, if you have this moduli space, right? So, it's almost always true that the general member of the moduli space is locally free and that the general member is slope stable. That's not always true. There are some Mukai vectors for which it's false, but those kinds of Mukai vectors are completely classified. So, let me tell you without So, let me tell you without telling you the classification that there is a classification of moduli spaces where the general sheaf is not locally free. For instance, if the rank is one, you know, and you're not align bundled, then you're not going to be locally free. But there are higher rank examples as well. And then the other thing is that there is also a classification of moduli spaces where the general sheaf is not slope stable. Like, for instance, one example, yeah. Is it? Yeah. Is it only for Picard number one, K3 services, or for any? I think that these kinds of things are known for, you know, are known in general. I mean. So you mean that there is such a classification for arbitrary K3? I thought so, but I might be wrong. There might be some hidden assumptions that I'm not remembering now. But you know, the place to look at is papers of Yoshioka. Papers of your Shioka. All right? Good things. You know, the kind of thing that can happen is, for instance, like, you know, if you have M times V naught, right, then this is a single point and then it's a direct sum of the same spherical bundle or something like this. So that you don't have a slope stable bundle. So you have to keep track of some of these kinds of exceptional things that can happen. Exceptional things that can happen, and as I said, you know, if I myself were able to follow these kinds of things and talks, I would have probably written it out. So, all right. So, what's the strategy? So, so that's the background. So, what's the strategy for computing the cohomology of the general sheaf? So, you know, you use Fourier-Mokai transform. So, again, the situation here is I have an F, a general F. As I have an f a general f this is my k3, right? And I want to understand the cohomology of this f. So, what you do is you look at the following Fourier-Mukai transform. So, what you do is you look at x cross x. You look at x cross x and you take the diagonal. Then you see you have a Fourier-Mokai transform. So, this x. Fourier-Makai transform. So, this x cross x has two projections. Let me maybe call it p and q to x and x. So, what you do is you pull back your sheaf by p say and you tensor with ideal sheaf with the diagonal, and then you push it down. Okay? So, now let me that's the same as the spherical twist with respect to O, right? With respect to O, right? Yes. So let E be the dual of this, okay? And then so let me assume that this is a coherent sheaf. So if you assume that this is a coherent sheaf, then you learn two things. The first thing that you learn is that the higher cohomology of F vanishes. And, you know, I didn't say this, but I should have said this. Like, one of the This. Like one of the, I mean, I sort of said that the question of computing the cohomology is a central question. But you see, the kinds of applications that you should have in mind is maybe I never said that, so I should have said that. So like you see, the kinds of things that you can get out of knowing the chromology is one, it often allows you to also understand when the general sheaf is globally generated. Generated and you know, so it allows you to so you know, it's also interesting to study, let me say it like this, when the general sheaf is globally generated. The problem, the question of the vanishing of cohomology and the global generation of the sheaf are not that far apart. And so you see this already in here. If you, in addition, This already in here, if you, in addition to being co it being a coherent sheaf, you assume that it's locally free, then actually you get that f is globally generated. Okay. And again, you know, this isn't that hard, like, you know, corresponding to the Fourier-Mukai transform, like there's a long exact sequence of cohomology. So, you know, you have this, the transform, the eight, the, you know, the transform is in general a complex, right? So what you get is that you have the age-naught sheaf mapping. That you have the age naught sheaf mapping to age naught of tensor or x. This is the evaluation map, right? Then you have the age one, and so on, and so forth. So, you know, if you assume that this dual is a sheaf, right, then, you know, these age i's like are like the x i's of these sheaf. And now you see this is supported, and you know, the codimension of the support is at least i, right? So this and this have to be torsion, right? So since Be torsion, right? So, since you cannot have, like, since this is torsion and this is torsion-free, you can't have a non-zero map, right? So, that you get that both H1 and H2 have to be zero, right? So, if in addition, I assume that this is torsion-free, this is locally free, sorry, so then this one is zero as well, so that you see that this evaluation map is surjective. Okay, so this Fourier-Mokai transform allows you to. Allows you to transform the question of global generation and balancing of cohomology to understanding when this is a sheaf or when is it a locally free sheaf or something like that. Okay? And now the trick to this is that you can use Brisbane stability. Sorry, is that I missed at the beginning you had some assumption on F? Where did I have on F? What did I have on F? F was just anything, or it was, or was it? Yeah, I think F, maybe my rank is positive. I see, but it wasn't not local. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah. F was pretty much anything. Yeah. We're talking about a general sheaf with the exception of few moduli spaces. This will be a vector bundle, right? Is it? Yeah, but this operation when. This operation, when you apply this Fourier Mokai and then dualize, is it an involution? Is it an involution? Yes, I think so. And is it important? Is it important? Probably. I don't know. It's not going to come up in the way I present it, but. Let me get back to you later about that, okay? All right, so now how do we know whether this thing is a sheaf? So here is the idea. So we are going to use Brazilian stability. So I'm going to be very fast about Brazilian stability, and I'm not going to explain much about it, but let me say. So, you know, given two real neurons. Two real neuron severity classes, assuming that this one is ample, then you see you can define what's called the central charge, and that's defined as the pairing between e to the beta plus i omega with your e, right? And then this, and then they're corresponding to the central charge, there is a heart of a T structure that means. Heart of a T structure that makes the combination the Brazilian stability condition, and the heart of the T structure is, as usual, the twist of a tilt by a torsion pair, right? So, what it does is that the abelian category is the set of objects in the derived category where, you know, all the cohomology except that places minus one and zero vanish, and minus one, you are in this category F, and then zero. In this category f, and in zero, you are in this category t. And what is f and t? So, f is torsion free sheaves such that for all subsheaves, the imaginary part of this z is less than or equal to zero. And t is, you know, for all torsion-free quotients, right, you have the imaginary part of the CO of Q is strictly bigger than zero. So, but the key point of this is that because our Picard rank. Says that because our Picard rank is one, you know, I don't have too many choices for this B and beta and W beta and omega, so I get an upper half plane of stability conditions. And this upper half plane has a wall and chamber decomposition. Okay, so given my F, so this is, so let's go back to our story. We want to understand, we want to understand the homology of this F, right? So given Of this f, right? So, given Rf, there is a chamber and champion wall and chamber decomposition with this slice with the stability manifold, and in there there is a very special chamber C. The way you should think about it is that there is a wall where the slopes of F and the slope of the ideal sheaf of a point dual twisted by shifted by one have the same slope. Okay? Slope. Okay. So, you know, there's the chamber adjacent to this wall, so to speak. Here is your wall, here is your chamber, right? And then the theorem of minamidiya nagideyoshiokai is that if I look at the Bridgeland moduli space with rank R first turn class d agent, Limit Mukai vector R d agent A, right? So sigma is in the special chamber, right? Then the claim is that that's actually isomorphic to a moduli space. modulized space, a modulized space of, moduli space of, you know, a moduli space of sheaves. This is an ordinary moduli space of Gitzaker semi-stable sheaf. So this ordinary moduli space of Gizaker semi-stable sheaves, right? And furthermore, the equivalence, the isomorphism, is given by our beloved Fourier-Mukai transform here, right? So it sends the object E here to The object E here to the, you know, you know, you do the Fourier-Mokai's transform with respect to the diagonal ideal sheaf of the diagonal and take the dual. Okay? So in particular, you see this gadget is a sheaf. Right? I mean, it's giving me an element of this nice Giesecker moduli space. So then you see the question boils down to when does this Brisbane moduli space contain any stable sheets? Contain any stable sheets. All right, so let me draw a cartoon of the situation, right? So here I have my wall and chambered decomposition corresponding to this F. Now, if I'm way up here someplace, I have my Giesecker moduli space, which is, you know, M age of V. Our F is in the space, and we want to understand. Somewhere down here, we have our special chamber C, right? There might be more walls, which I'm not drawing. More walls, which I'm now drawing. This is a crude cartoon here, right? So, the way you should think about it is that as we go from the Giesaker-modulized space to this good chamber, right, to the nice chamber that we want to understand, you cross a bunch of walls. Each time you cross walls, some objects get destabilized, replaced by some other things, right? Now, suppose that as I did this, then some sheaves survives, some original sheaves survives all the way down to this chamber, right? Onto this chamber, right? Then you see for that chain, for that sheaf, right? Then this then this Fourier-Mokai transform is again a sheaf, right? I mean, it's an element of this mix H, A, D, H, R, right? So in particular, if I have that sheaf survive all the way to that good chamber, then you see that the higher cohomology of that F vanishes, and you know. And you know, as I said, we have a classification of when the general member of this marginalized space is locally free, right? So, you know, as long as we don't run into those few exceptional cases, in fact, that we learn that this is, in fact, a locally free sheaf, so that you get that F is in fact globally generated. So then the question becomes, or the problem, I mean, the question becomes, when can we say that the sheafs are When can we say that the sheaf survives all the way to this chamber C? So, in other words, the problem is that as we make this change, we may cross a totally semi-stable wall and destabilize our sheaves, right? Luckily, so a totally semi-stable wall is when all sheaves destabilize, they get replaced by some other objects. Luckily, Bayer and McCree, whoop, didn't mean to do that. It didn't mean to do that. I don't know why it does that. Luckily, Bayer and McCree have classified the totally semi-stable walls for us. And it turns out that the relevant walls correspond to sort of spherical objects. And given your Mukai vector V, you can enumerate these things and determine when you cross such a wall. All right, so if you do that, then what you get is that you first get That you first get like a qualitative theorem. So, let me tell you first the qualitative theorem, and then I'll get more into the quantitative stuff. So, again, the situation is I have a K3 surface, my Picard rank is one degree to n, right? I take a general sheaf. So, the first thing that you can say is if n is bigger than or equal to r, then f has at most one non-zero cohomology. The next thing that you can say is that the normalizer is the The next thing that you can say is that if Î¼ is at least r plus 1, then again f has at most one non-zero cohomology group. And the other thing that you can say is that if chi f is less than or equal to r, then f has at most one non-zero cohort group. So the way you should think about this theorem is that, you know, if you put some assumptions, some numerical assumptions on your n and your Mukai vector. Your Mukai vector, right? Then you can always guarantee that you can reach this chamber without hitting any of these semi-stable walls. Of course, what I'm suppressing here is that, you know, Bayer-Macris classification of these totally semi-stable walls gives you a whole bunch of inequalities. And you can work out these inequalities to figure out, you know, when there can be such a thing and when there cannot be such a thing. So I'm suppressing that. So, I'm suppressing that. Okay? So, one consequence of these statements is that as long as the rank is at least two and you fix the rank, then there are only finitely many moduli spaces where the general sheaf has more than one non-zero cohomology group. And, you know, normally that would not be that surprising, but here we are allowing, of course, there to be infinitely many surfaces. So, if I fix my rank, then if I look at moduli spaces with the if I look at moduli spaces with a given um with a given um um with a given um Mokai vector then there will be only finitely many counter examples to the weak Brill Noder statement and more importantly than that you can actually you know enumerate them you can run a computer program that tells you what they all are okay so what yeah um so Markman showed years ago So Markman showed years ago that if D is one, then sort of everything is wonderful, right? If D is one, yes. If D is one, then things simplify quite a bit. Can I see that in what you've told me here? Yes, you can, but I sort of hit it. Ah, okay. Yeah, I mean, if D is one, then the situation is relatively simple. I mean, you know, if D is one, like, you know, the possible spherical objects are like, you know, you have R1, D1, A1. have R1 D1A1 and then RDA. One of the things that you prove is that R1 has to be less than R and you know there's a strong relation between R D1 and R1D. If D is one, then that forces there not to be such spherical objects basically pretty quickly. Okay, I mean like the inequalities would tell you that pretty quickly. But one other But one other qualitative statement here is that you can also classify all RIP bundles. I should have said that this has been done by Apro, Dufarkash, and Ortega. Maybe I should have written that out, but yeah, you know, you immediately get a classification of Ulrich bundles. So there exists an Ulrich bundle of rank R on a surf K3 surface with the polarization M times H, if and only if two divides. And only if two divides r times m, and in that case, the general sheaf and the appropriate moduli space is over. But as I said, these are the qualitative things that you can say if you don't want to write any inequalities or like, you know, not get too much into the weeds. But more importantly, this is basically a method for computing the cohomology of the general sheath in the moduli space. So, now, how do you do that? You see, what you do is in this cartoon. See what you do is in this cartoon, right? You look at the largest, strictly semi-stable wall, right? And what you do, that largest, strictly semi-stable wall gives you a resolution of your general sheaf. So if you look at the resolution of the general sheaf, then the way you should think about it is that this gives you now an inductive process in some sense to compute the core knowledge. And then you can really carry this thing out. Really carry this thing out. We carry this out up to rank 20. Here, I just you know wrote down what happens up to rank five because my hand got tired after a while. But here are all the here are all the moduli spaces and all the Machai vectors up to rank five that have cohomology and what the cohomology of the general sheaf is. And you know, you can really make these tables and figure these things out. So I see that I'm almost. I see that I'm almost out of time. I was going to give the first sort of interesting example. Maybe let me quickly say it. If you look at the Mokai vector 9, 5, 14 and n equals 5. So, you know, this is the first time I think that you see the reason, the interesting thing happening because of a higher rank bundle. So the way I should say is that whenever the spherical bundle is The spherical bundle is rank one, we understand the picture fairly well. The problem is that, you know, and that accounts for most of the cases, right? Like 60% of the cases or something. But as you go higher in N and the rank, of course, more and more bundles start coming in. And then, you know, the problem is that you might have to analyze more and more and more bundles and what happens to them. And, you know, as I said, the first interesting case where interesting case where the rank two bundle is coming in is I think for 9514 with n equals 5 and you see you have a moduli space there with age 1 is 1 and you know the general sheaf occurs as you know you have the so this thing has five sections so you know you have the evaluation map or the co-evaluation map and then the kernel is F this is of course a spherical case and you see that this is this is This is one with hormology, one. But as I said, you know, up to rank 20 or so, you can do this thing without some sweat, but not too much sweat. So I think I should stop there. Thank you very much. Let's thank it. Other questions? What about computing homes between general shapes and two different modular spaces instead of H0? Well, you can do some of those things as well. So like, you know, that kind of thing we've done for P2 mostly. And so you should go to Jack's talk on Thursday. He'll explain how to do that on P2, where there is more or less a complete answer. But, you know, that's the next step. You know, that's the next step. We haven't done that much for the K3s yet. And again, we also don't understand in general, like, you know, our knowledge of the jumping loci are not as detailed as it should be. But, you know, those things should be amended. But those things should be amenable to these kinds of techniques as well. So it's just that it's a matter of working a lot of these things out. And what about higher dimensions, like modern spaces of ships on trifles? Depends on what question you're asking. I mean, there are the modularized spaces in mass. I mean, they are the modularized spaces are not going to be reducible typically. So I guess there the question you can ask is whether you can make a sheaf where there's only one comalic group. And you know, one way of manufacturing these things, you can take the types of resolutions that you see in surfaces, right, and just try to make resolutions with those kinds of resolutions. And then, you know, you can get some partial results. And then you know, you can get some partial results. I mean, that I doubt that you will get a complete picture, or you would have all the churn characters and stuff like this. But, you know, you can now that you see what kinds of resolutions help you, you can just manufacture the same resolutions on higher-dimensional varieties and get some partial results. But you know, I would. I would be very skeptical if we would get a good understanding of moduli spaces and higher-dimensional varieties, at least without strong assumptions on what moduli spaces you're looking at. Other questions? All right. If not, let's thank Isa again. Thank you. Is that again? Thank you, everyone, for listening. And that concludes the talk set for today. So we'll continue at 9 tomorrow. Hopefully, the world will still be there at that point. Stay safe and get to the polls if you haven't had a chance. Goodbye. Is that, can I?
