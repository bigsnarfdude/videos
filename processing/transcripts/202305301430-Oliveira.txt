I start by thanking the organizers for inviting me, and it's good to see so many friends again and make new friends. So it's very nice to be here. So I'm going to talk about joint work with Jason. Jason Lotte, he's over there. Yes, very dangerous. Very dangerous. No, it's okay. So, I'll be talking about Lagrangian curvature flow. And we keep on talking in SATS. I will not say this word again, and you might see it. But I'll go over it. Everything will be self-contained. And I'm going to start by a small prelude where I'll tell you what this work does. So, in Calabria Manifolds, there is a distinguished class of Lagrangian. Class of Lagrangian submanifolds. They are called special Lagrangians. And they are very interesting from both a mathematical and physical point of view. So mathematically speaking, they are volume minimizing, and so they are interesting from a Riemannian point of view. Of course, they are also interesting symplatically because they are Lagrangians. And it's the other way around. And the simple question that has arrived. Question that has arrived mostly due to physics motivation is to determine when in a Hamiltonian isotopic class of Lagrangians, there is a special Lagrangian representative. So sympletic geometers usually think of Lagrangians and manifolds up to an equivalence relation. That equivalence relation is the notion of Hamiltonian isotopic class. And the question is: in such a class, is there a special Lagrangian representative? So this conjecture has As was originated from physics, in particular from mirror symmetry, where Lagrangians are mirrored to compatible connections on allomorphic vector bundles. I'm not saying allomorphic vector bundles, I'm saying compatible connections on allomorphic vector bundles. And from that point of view, special agrangence should correspond to the emissioning those connections. And then results known for the case of holomorphic vector bundles inspired. Holomorphic vector bundles inspire some conjectures for special Lagrangians. And it's these conjectures that I'll be talking about. The first of them is from Richard Thomas. And Richard Thomas proposed a notion of a stability condition that is supposed to control the existence or not of a special Lagrangian in a given Hamiltonian isotopic class. The Thomas conjecture. The Thomas conjecture predates the appearance in the mathematics literature of the notion of a Bridgeland stability condition. But since its existence, the original Thomas conjecture has been refined by Bridgeland and Joyce. And now the correct notion should involve Bridgeland stability conditions and their existence in some version of the Fukaya category. Category. And the idea, the main idea is that Lagrangian, even if not stable, you can somehow decompose it into special Lagrangians. So special Lagrangians are somehow building blocks for all the Lagrangians on your manifold. So this is mirrored to what is called the Ardennar-Siemen filtration. And there are further conjections from Thomas Yarwin Joyce, which relate these stability conjectures. Relates these stability conditions to the Lagrangian mean curvature flow, and that's what I'll be talking about today. Before I go on, let me just say one more comment regarding decomposing a Lagrangian in terms of special Lagrangians. I think of this as an analog of a very basic construction in algebra when you have a group that you so a simple group is the simplest kind of groups, as the name says. A simple group is a group whose only normal sub. Normal subgroups is the group itself and the identity. And when you have a group, you can find what is called the composition series for it, which is a so you pick a maximal subgroup, normal subgroup of it, such that the quotient is simple. Now you go again to that subgroup and you do the same. You find a subgroup of the subgroup such that the quotient is simple. And this allows you to decompose somehow your group. Decompose somehow your group in terms of consecutive quotients of simple groups. And that's more or less the same idea that you can do to a Lagrangian, decompose it into special Lagrangians. And we will see through pictures how this arises in our work. Okay, so let's get started with a simple example. I know this might have been a bit over the top in terms of science fiction, but let's start with a simple case. So let's start in. case so let's start in two dimensions oops in two dimensions uh with the flat torus and so that's the flat structure is not working uh now but so this is the flat structure and in a torus in a two-dimensional torus any curve is lagrangian because the two form uh restricts to a one-dimensional submanifold that always vanishes the two form in one dimension so any curve is lagrangian Dimensions. So any curve is Lagrangian. Okay, so I've drawn here three copies of the torus with three different pairs of Lagrangians. And each pair of Lagrangians represents Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangians. So Amiltonian isotopic means that if you look at the signed area that they enclose, that vanishes. So for example, the area in blue is always equal to the area in red. The area in blue is where the blue guy is on top, and the area in red where the red guy is on top. We are in red, the red guys on top, and here the same, and here the same. So these L's and L tildes are all Hamiltonian isotopic. And now I want to ask you which of the representatives in each case is better? Because we are trying to find the best representative of an ambotonisotopic class, so which one is better? Does anyone want to risk? The red one, I agree. So the straight lines are the best representatives. At least because they are shorter, so At least because they are shorter, so don't spend so much ink drawing them. So, in the next slide, I'm going to tell you how to characterize the straight lines using these two geometric objects that I wrote here, the synthetic form and the allomorphic volume form. I'm running out of bullets here, apparently. And I'm also going to tell you how to find. And I'm also going to tell you all to find the flow that deforms the Lagrangian until it becomes straight. Okay, so first to characterize them. First, let's parameterize them using arc length. So S is the arc length parameter. That just means the other velocity vector as norm one. And then I'm going to pull back this complex valued one form to the Lagrangian. So if you pull back, you get. Lagrangian. So if you pull back, you get this, right? Lx prime plus i L y prime, where L x is the L x prime is the x component of the velocity, li prime is the y component of the velocity. So here is a picture, right? So in blue we have the Lagrangian, then we have L prime over here, the X component, the Y component. And if you call beta L the angle that L prime makes with the X axis, prime makes with the x-axis then this is cosine beta l and that's sine beta l because the norm is one so you can replace that in that formula there you do that and use Euler's formula to write it as e to the i beta l times d okay so betl is the angle that l prime makes to the x-axis so when is l a straight line it's when beta l is constant so there we go parametrizing straight line Straight lines as those for which beta is constant. Or equivalently, their second derivative of the Lagrangian vanishes. Second derivative is also known as the curvature of the curve. So next, how are we going to deform a curve until it becomes straight? That's the second question I want to answer in this slide. So here is a picture. I want to deform the blue one into the direction of the red. The blue one into the direction of the red, so I deform it in the direction of its curvature. So that's what we do. So that's called the curve-shortening flow because it shortens length. And so we consider the one parameter family of curves that evolve in the direction of their curvature, that's the curve-shortening flow. And I didn't write it, I should have written it. But in this case of the torus, and if you pick any of these Lagrangians that I've drawn, Any of these Lagrangians that I've drawn, or any that is not newlomorphic, the curved shortening flow exists for all time and converges to a straight line. That's a result of Grayson and Gajin-Damilton in the 80s, 82 and 83, I think. So this form won't keep it human speed. Sorry, won't keep it. It's not arc link parametrized. Well, here you use the arc link to respect the time. use the arc length with respect to time t. Yes? So it's not a linear equation because the arc length is changing. So it's not the heat equation. That answers the question, right? Okay, so that was it about two dimensions. Now I want to go to four dimensions. So in four dimensions, the Calabria is also known as the hyperkeler manifold. They are the same thing in four dimensions. Same thing in four dimensions. And without loss of generality, I'm going to pick the synthetic form to be omega 1, and then the holomorphic volume form is going to be omega 2 plus i omega 3. So an oriented embedded Lagrangian is simply a two-dimensional submanifold for which the sympathetic form vanishes, at which the sympathetic form vanishes. And on such oriented Lagrangians, we have two forms that have unique norm. One of them is the restriction of the holomorphic volume form, and the other one is the volume form of the induced metric on the Lagrangian. So an ambient metric induces a metric on the Lagrangian. Use that to write down the Riemannian volume form, and both have norm one. So if both have norm one, have norm one. So if both have norm one, there is some unit complex number that relates that relates them. Because that varies from point to point, that defines a map from L to the unit complex numbers, the circle. This function is called the Lagrangian angle. So this is exactly the analog of that e to the i B T L that we saw in the case of curves. But now into dimension. Okay. Okay, and the special Lagrangian, we are going to define it as a Lagrangian submanifold that has a constant Lagrangian angle. Okay, so that's what a special Lagrangian is. It turns out that then you can write the two-form e to the minus e bet the L omega, take its real part. That's a calibration. And the special Lagrangians satisfy this calibration condition. So they are calibrated so manifold. In particular, they minimize volume in the... Minimize volume in the rhomology class. Okay, so that's the definition of special Lagrangians in this case. So imitating our characterization of straight lines on the plane, right? Next, I need to tell what it means for two Lagrangians to be Hamiltonian isotopic. So I'm going to write that as L tilde L L of. L L okay, tilde, L tilde. Sorry, I did not talk to myself when I wrote this. So I'm going to assume that the four manifold I have has finite fundamental group, and then I can say that they are amutoni and isotopic if there is an isotopy, so a one-parameter family of simple ectomorphisms starting at the identity and such that the final simplectomorphism. Final simple hetomorphism brings one Lagrangian to the other. And of course, if you have a Lagrangian that is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian, then the Lagrangian angle is Hamiltonian isotopic to a constant map. And if it is homotopic to a constant map, you can find a lift of that function to S one to a function two R. Function to S1 to a function to R. So in that case, there is a lift from the Lagrangian angle to a function to R, and that's called a grading. So you can think of this as the analog of the angle that the curves make with a specific line on the plane. Okay, so one construction this is that you can do with Lagrangian, with graded Lagrangians. Lagrangian with graded Lagrangians. Graded Lagrangians are Lagrangians equipped with such a lift. From now on, I'm always going to think of the Lagrangians as equipped with such a lift. It is to connect sum them. But it's called Lagrangian connect sum. This is a construction due to Poltornovich, I think. And topologically, is the connect sum, but as Hamiltonian isotopic classes of Lagrangians, if you do it, in which order you do? Do it in which order you do, that gives you different results. So it's Lagrange a manifold that has the topological type of the connect sum, but it is different in general depending on the order by which you do it. So being equivalent Hamiltonian as a topic to a special approach, is that the same thing as saying zero metal cost? So, if it is amutanisotopic to special agrangian, it has zero Maslow class, but not all that are that have Massboff class need be amutonisotopic to a special Arrangian. Is this connect sum with the sum in the Foucault category? So you can define the sum in the Foucault category by saying that there is an exact triangle where this guy is in this corner, you see? Guy is in this corner, you see? This corner guy, the triangle goes like that. Um, that is a more general notion than this, but this one satisfies that notion. And what is graded? Like, what's graded? Graded means that it comes equipped with a grading. So, I fixed a lift of the Lagrangian angle to R. Okay. Are there other questions? Why do you need this to be seen that you guys adopted to a special version to define the grading? What is the idea? Define the grading of white idea? Oh, you don't need them to be, you just need to be, you need the Lagrangian angle to as a function at mid-a lif to R. That happens if and only if it is homotopic to the identity. What I'm telling you is if it, if the Lagrangian is anotonyisotopic to a special Lagrangian, then the Lagrangian angle is homotopic to the identity, and therefore there is a lithium. But because I'm trying to find which Lagrangians I'm going to be able to anotor an isotope to a special Lagrangian, As a top to a special Lagrangian, I'm going to start with Lagrangians that admit such a lift. And are there other questions? What is the why is the graded required to form this connect sum? What is the specialty? Oh, when you do the connect sum, this is a it comes with the grading also. Okay, but you could forget about the grading if you want, you can do that, you are free to do that. Want you can do that, you're free to do that, but I'm not going to do that. I want the grading to be wrong, okay. And the notion of stability is trying to imitate slope stability. It says that you can destabilize a Lagrangian if you can decompose it in a Lagrangian connect sum such that the average grading of the first is greater or equal than the average grading of the second. Okay? So yes? The grading stack in the morning? So basically, you let the grading be the same as it was before until you are close to an intersection point, and then you smoothly interpolate from one to the other, and then you continue constantly in the other. We will see this in a second in an example, okay? I don't want to do the general construction because it would take too much time. But I know this is a bit overkill, this slide, but we are going to see now an example. But we are going to see now an example, and that will hopefully clarify things. Okay, so I'm now going to specify on the four manifolds that we are going to deal with. All these four manifolds, these Calabiao four manifolds, have a circle symmetry, so a circle action that preserves all the structure. And this there are infinite families of examples, and that's a good testing ground for the conjectures, and that that's maybe the goal of this program. The goal of this program, our program. Okay, so the circle symmetry gives rise to a projection on the orbit space, and the orbit space turns out to be R3. So if you know, if you are familiar with the upper Keller moment map, this is the upper Keller moment map. And if not, just think of this as the projection of the space of orbit. And this projection has the property that there is a discrete set S in R3. So here is a. S in R3, so here is a picture, such that away from that set, all the pre-images are circles. So these are the orbits, the orbits are circles, but the pre-images above these points on that discrete set are points. So this discrete set corresponds to the points where the action is not free, and in all other points, the action is free. Okay? No, you allow for non-compact. The Lagrangians are compact, but the Calabria, we're not good. Yeah, these Calabias are not going to be compact. Okay, so now I need to tell you what is a circle invariant surface because we are looking for circle invariant Lagrangians. And these are the pre-images of curves downstairs in R3. Okay, so I've drawn here two curves: green one. Curves, green one and the blue one, and the pre-images above. Because these curves start on them, these points of S where the pre-images are points, the pre-images of these curves will be two spheres. Because the pre-image will be a circle above any point in the interior of the curve, but this circle is going to collapse to points at the end of the curve. And in fact, these four manifolds, their topology is generated by these two spheres. Generated by these two spheres that are the preimages of curves connecting points in S. Okay, but now I need also to tell you which of these circle-invariant surfaces are Lagrangian, because not all these circle-invariant surfaces are going to be Lagrangian. And the Lagrangian ones are those that correspond to the pre image of curves that lie in a plane orthogonal to the new one axis, to the new one. axis to the mu one axis is the first okay and mu one because i fixed omega to be omega one but if you pick any other plane and the curve contained in any other plane it will be like ranging with respect to a different sympathetic structure compatible with the upper calor with the upper calor one so th those are the circle invariant lagrangians and now i need to tell you when is it that two circle invariant lagrangians That two circle invariant Lagrangians are Hamiltonian isotopic. Okay, so and two circle invariant Lagrangians that are the pre-image of curves, gamma one and gamma two, are Hamiltonian isotopic if and only if you can isotope gamma one to gamma two through plain curves, so contained in that plane, without crossing points of S. Okay, so here is an example. So here you can you can isotope You can isotope gamma one to L, this straight line, right? Because through planar curve, so you just remain on this plane, and there is no point of S in the middle, so you're good. But if you try to do that with the blue one, gamma two, you have to cross that point. You cannot do that. So gamma two is not amotonisotopic to L, but gamma one is. And now I'm confusing the Lagrangians with the curves, right? But let's do that. Are there questions? Are there questions? Feel free to interrupt me if you remember the question, and if you want me to go back, look at some table I have. Okay, so I don't have a table, unfortunately, but any other thing that you want planarly means in the same plane, right? In the same plane, yes. You're not allowed to rotate the planar, there's no conditional sign. There's no condition on signed area. No, no conditional signed area. It's a good point. I was confused about that when I started doing this. Anyway, so now what is the grading? And the grading is very similar to the case of curves. So basically you fix a line on the plane where you are. Here I fixed this line corresponding, this horizontal line. And the grading is gonna be give. The grading is going to be given by the angle that the velocity vector of the curve makes with that line. So I've run here. Here is like this, here is like this, then here it becomes negative. Okay? Everything okay? Okay, so okay, so now which circular invariant Lagrangians are special Lagrangians? Question? So special Lagrangians are the ones which have a constant Lagrangian angle, therefore constant grading, because grading is a lift of the Lagrangian angle. And because the grading is this angle, are the ones that have constant angle, which are the straight lines. So a circular inferential Lagrangian is a special Lagrangian if and only if the curve that it corresponds to is a straight line. So it turns out that everything is very similar. It turns out that everything is very similar to the case of curves, except for that signed area. Can you say that again? What does L look like when gamma is a straight line? It's just. So if it is a straight line like this one connecting two points of S, is a sphere, but it's a very minimal sphere. Yes. But it's not it's just a minimal it's two plus. It's just a minimal edge too. It doesn't have to be round. Yeah, it doesn't have to be round. It could be an ellipse. It could also be different from an ellipse, but. Are you fixing like endpoints of your element to go to? Do you allow your lagrangiers to go to infinity, or are you fixing like in some results? You can allow Lagrangians to go to infinity, but let's not think about that. Let's only think about these Lagrangians that I'm talking about now. Yes? Yes. I know that you kind of have to go through one of the singular points. Is that a problem? So here in this case, I cannot deform the blue one to the line, right? So sometimes you won't get lines. When I try to deform it, it will break. Yeah, we will see this later. But if you try to deform this blue one in a way to shorten the area, In a way to shorten the area, the minimum possible to the minimum possible, you get stuck in a thing like this. When you're deforming, like, does this, does like encountering one of these like stickular points and if you try to like split it, is that like the is that like the decomposition of the fuck out of Kai category? Like something? I think it is related, yes. I can try to understand. Related, yes, we can. I can try to understand better what you mean later, but I think we might be able to see some of this stuff. Okay, so now I need to explain stability in this setting, okay? So, forget all that crazy thing about average gradings and so on. Let's see what stability means in this setting. So, here I have three points in S and I have three special agrangians in this triangle. And I'm gonna do the connect sum of. The connect sum of L plus and L minus. So this is how you do it: the rule. You go along L, then you go around this point, which is the intersection point of L plus and L minus, in a clockwise manner, and then you follow L minus. If you try to do L minus, connect some L plus, you go first through L minus towards the intersection point. Now you go around the intersection point again in a clockwise manner, and then you follow L. Clockwise manner, and then you follow L plus. So that results in these two. So that's L plus connects some L minus, L minus connects some L plus. And we see that this guy you cannot amiltonian isotope to L. But this guy you can Amutonian isotope to L. And this one is unstable according to the definition that I gave, because if you look at beta plus here, that's positive. Beta minus is negative. Beta minus is negative, though, so beta plus is the angle that L plus makes with L, and beta minus the angle that L minus makes with L. So this one is greater than that one, because this one is positive, that one is negative. So unstable, you cannot deform to a special Lagrangian. You cannot amultaneously double to special Argentian. Stable, you can amultine as special Lagrangian. And this finishes the proof. Basically, it's not much more complicated than that. You need to, of course. Complicated than that, you need to, of course, make an argument that by playing around with these ideas results and beta minus different. Oh, it's because you're doing it in the opposite order. Yes. And also, but even if you keep this beta minus and that beta plus, now you started with L minus and beta minus is negative. You can also revert everything, and then you have this beta minus, and then you have that one over there. Then you have that one over there. So object is the one on the left. Yes, that's right. Okay, so L is stable if and only if you can undertake an isotope. As I thought, it to special Lagrangian. Okay, so these results, as I said, you need to make an argument, but this leads to our first theorem, which is a circle-invariant version of the Thomas conjecture. But now it's a theorem. So the circle-invariant Thomas conjecture is a theorem. And it says that you can Hamiltonian isotope. You can Hamiltonianisotope a circle-invariant Lagrangian sphere to a circle-invariant special Lagrangian if and only if it cannot be destabilized by a circle-invariant configuration. That's what U unstable means. It cannot be destabilized by a circle-invariant configuration. Okay, as I said, this is a circular invariant version of Thomas Turum for the specific X. For any of these X's, I should. For any of these X's, and so these X's, they live in infinite families and there are infinite examples. You are free to pick the points of S, so those are parameters in the construction. If you change the number of points, you get a different type of color manifold that is topologically different. If you keep the same number of points, but you move them around, you get a different type of color structure on the same manifold. Can you have two? So let's see if two circling variants. Let's say you have two circling variant Lagrange genes, which are not Hamiltonian isotopic through circling variant Lebron genes. But could they be Hamiltonian isotopes? Yes, actually in this case, we also know that they are not Hamiltonian isotopic because this guy is not Hamiltonian isotopic to that fly. And that follows even through possibly non-circular invariant Hamiltonians because, and that's the result, that follows from a result of. And that's the result that follows from a result of uh the brackets there is the Hamiltonian isotopic class, not the invariant Hamiltonian. No, actually these brackets actually mean the homology class, but it's you can say Hamiltonian isotopic class also. But these two Lagrangians are not the same homology class, different Hamiltonian isotopic classes. And there is only one special Lagrangian in that Hamiltonian isotopic class. That Amaltonian isotopic class, in that sorry, homology class, and that's this one. And there is no special agrarian in the Amotonian isotopic class of this guy, except we invariably. Okay. Okay, so now let's go on to mean curvature flow. So, mean curvature flow is the accurate dimensional analog of the curve-sharpened flow, where basically you pick one-parameter family of Parameter family of, in this case, surfaces that are evolving in the direction of their mean curvature. Okay, and we need the Lagrangian, the initial Lagrangian to be almost calibrated and flow stable. These are necessary conditions. Almost calibrated, I've put it here, what it means. It basically means that the total variation of the Lagrangian angle is not more than pi. So if you look at the curve, that means that the velocity vector of the curve is The velocity vector of the curve is always pointing in the same half-plane. So you can't have like a circle, for example, because that has total variation to pi. So you needed to have maximum total variation, a little bit less than pi. And then flow stable is a slightly stronger notion than stability, but it's the one that appears in the Thomas Yao conjecture. And it basically means that if you decompose your Lagrangian into a Lagrangian-connect sum, that Connect some that automatically increases the area. So the area of the decomposition is greater than the area of the original one. For instance, Thomas-Yell conjecture says Thomas conjecture? Are they different? They are different. So the Thomas conjecture doesn't involve Lagrangian mean curvature flow, and the Thomas-Yell conjecture is basically says the same thing using Lagrangian mean curvature flow and this slightly stronger stability condition. So the key observation. So, the key observation towards the proof is that the mean curvature flow descends to modified curve-shortening flow for curves downstairs. It's not exactly curve-shortening flow, it's a modified version of it. But it has some important properties in joint with the curve-shortening flow. First of all, the curve remains in the plane that it was, and this implies that the pre-images continue to be Lagrangian. Images continue to be Lagrangian, therefore, it's called Lagrangian in curvature flow rather than just in curvature flow because it preserves the Lagrangian condition. And the area, which through magic and Fubini's theorem coincides with the length of the curve, is decreasing along the flow. Oh, if you don't put almost calibrated, there are finite there are examples that show that there are finite time singularities. Show that there are finite time similarities. That's the work of Hender and Eps. If you want, in the end, I can give you the example more or less. I can make a picture. So, and because the area is decreasing, the length is decreasing, you can combine that with the flow stability of L naught to say that suppose you decompose a gamma t into a Lagrangian-connected sum, because gamma0 was flow stable, then the Lagrangian, the length of. Then the Lagrangian the length of the Lagrangian practice sum is greater than the length of gamma naught, which is greater than the length of gamma t. And that means that you will not ever be able to, along the flow, see gamma t getting decomposed into a Lagrangian correct sum. And that tells you that gamma t needs to stay away from these points, these red points that I've been drawing. So it will never hit those red points. And then if it never hits those, one more thing that you need is that the gradient. That you need is that the grading satisfies the heat equation, so LT stays almost calibrated because the total variation is also decreasing through the heat equation. So, I'm not increasing. Okay, and then because you know that gamma T never hits a point of S and that it stays almost calibrated, you can make an argument by contradiction to show that it cannot hit the so it doesn't. So, it doesn't hit the point of S and it cannot have a finite time singularity. Basically, what you do is that suppose that it has some finite time singularity that cannot hit the point of S, and then you do a blow-up analysis, and then you use some recent results from Lambert, Lotte, and Schulz. I mentioned solutions to the Lagrangian curvature flow, and you find out that no finite time similarities occur. So, the flow exists for all time, and if it exists for all time, it needs to be converging to a It needs to be converging to a straight line, and therefore, you have proved that what have you proved that the Lagrangian mean curvature flow starting at the normal calibrated and flows stable circular invariant Lagrangian exists for all time and converges smoothly to a special Lagrangian. So, that's the circular invariant version of the Thomas Yah conjecture. So, this is where our first paper ended. Now, I'm going to start with the second paper. The second paper. Paper. The second paper asks the question: How what happens if L is not stable? If you start with a guy that is not stable, and that's where you are going to see the Lagrangian getting decomposed into special Lagrangians. Are there any questions before I start showing more pictures? So, what do you show from long targets that you have converges to um Oh, that's uh that's a standard argument that is in Thomas Yao already actually. Already, actually, and we just use it for you basically look at the difference of beta L with the constant that you know it will need to be because that constant is determined topologically and you see that that thing is gonna is converging to zero as t goes to infinity and you're saying what's your modified current flow? Uh yes, maybe I'll write it in the end because it requires me introducing something. Because it requires me introducing something. It's basically the same thing, but instead of the curvature, you multiply that by a function that comes from the uppercaller structure. And that, for example, implies that the end points stay fixed and so on. But I can write it down. It just requires that I introduce one thing. Okay, so next, what happens for unstable Lagrangians? So for unstable Lagrangians, finite For unsegular Lagrangians, finite time singularities do exist and occur when gamma t is the points of s. I'm not proving this yet, I'm just telling you that this is what happens. And I want to sort of use this to describe all these singularities look like. So and here is how they look like. So so here we have a family of curves and we are evolving in a way that the curves will hit a point of S. A point of S. So the pre-images are these surfaces that have a circle corresponding to the pre-image of a point here. And this point is going to converge to this, that is getting smaller and smaller. And in the moment that you hit the point of S, that circle needs to be shrunk to a point. And that's why these are called neck pinch singularities. It's a bit brutal, but it's. So, what do you mean by finite time symbolic? So, something is going to infinity for what quantity? No, a finite time symbol. I just mean that this phenomenon will happen in finite time. So, if you look at the corresponding curve in the plane, so is becoming curvature is becoming very high. No, uh not well, uh that is true, but not from the picture. True, but not from the picture. You don't need to know that. But it's gonna hit this thing in finite time. It turns out that that is true and is very confusing, but anyway, let's forget about that. How much time do I have actually, by the way? Is someone fifteen minutes. Okay. Maybe I won't use all the fifteen minutes. Maybe I won't use all the 15 minutes. Okay, so let's consider an example to try to establish the existence of these finite time singularities. So here I have a curve gamma naught, which is amotoninisotopic to this L plus connects some L minus. Remember that was this thing, but of course that's amote and isotopic to this. And we want to see that's convex, this curve is convex, and I want to convince you that this. And I want to convince you that this curve will evolve in a way that it will eventually hit this point. Infinite time. So what do we do? We paint it yellow and we call it a Pac-Man disk. And this corresponds to the image of a holomorphic disk in the hypercalor manifold with boundary in these Lagrangians. And it turns out that if you look at the area of It turns out that if you look at the area of how this disk evolves, the area is evolving. So how do I say this? The area is decreasing negative rate, determined by the angle that is here. So this delta is supposed to be an angle. It's not a masonic symbol or anything. And it is decreasing at this constant negative rate. And therefore, it will And therefore, it will reach zero area in finite time. It evolves through this equation for as long as the flow is well-defined and smooth. So this means that before it got to zero area, the curve hits the point. That's what this is coming. That's when the ghost hits the Pac-Man. Yes, to so yeah, so this Pac-Man is getting smaller, uh it's being eaten rather than eating something, unfortunately. Something at that point. So there is a finite time singularity, otherwise, the area would go to zero in finite time. So this shows that there is a finite time singularity. But this is very specific for this convex curve and so on. So how do you do it with the general Lagrangian? And so what you do with the general Lagrangian is to use these Peckman disks as barriers. So you copy toss. So here we have a Lagrangian. It off, so here we have a Lagrangian in. Oh, I use the same color. Okay, so we have a Lagrangian in blue, which is this guy here, goes winding around, and we cap it off with two Pac-Man discs, one here and the other one there. And then this, because of a maximum principle, this Pac-Man disc will push this guy to hit that in finite time, and this one will push this portion to hit that in finite time. Time. So there will be. Suppose you continue the flow after the first singularity. One of them will occur earlier than the other one, or maybe both at the same time. But suppose one happens earlier than the other. Suppose you continue the flow somehow. Then there will be a second singularity. So what we do is to restart the flow now for a piecewise smooth curve. In each smooth portion you do a different flow. Portion, you do a different flow after the singularity, and you establish the existence of finite time singularities that way. And eventually, after all the finite time singularities that can occur occur, you can now flow all the single components, which are now stable. And in the infinite time, they will converge each of them to a special agranger. So, in the end, the blue thing will converge through the singularities to the red, to the red, no, to the green thing, which No, the green thing, which is uh union of special arrangements. Once it hits one of these red dots, and and it always is going to go through that dot when you continue to flow after. No, it will not go through, it stays there. I mean, yeah, it always passes through that point. It becomes a piecewise each one evolves separately. Exactly, exactly. Each one evolves separately, yeah. That's right. I have a better picture of that now in the Turum. So, this is the Turum. The turret? It's a picture. That's all we wrote it in the paper, also. No, I'm kidding. It's not. But this picture is very good. So it shows you the initial curve. Then there is a finite first time singularity at time t1. Then there is another finite time singularity at time t2. And another finite time singular at time t3. Now, in this case, we were We were mean, and we chose this to have the same angle. So, this is what is called the semi-stable case. Let's not think about it. But now you can evolve this for finite, and at infinite time, they will converge to the light blue straight lines. So you'll decompose this Lagrangian as this union of special Lagrangians. So, I'll now say the correct statement of the theorem. So, you start. Statement of the theorem. So you start with the circling variant and almost calibrated Lagrangian. And now there is a continuous family defined for all positive time such that the following goals. There is a finite sequence of times such that away from those times, the family satisfies the Lagrangian curvature flow. So smooth Lagrangian curvature flow. In each piecewise smooth component. What component? If it wasn't almost calibrated, you might not be fairly ready to see what the time is taken. No, if it was not almost calibrated, you might have a different kind of finite time singularity that we do not know how to solve. I guess my question is the fact that only finitely many at least. Yes, that's because we have manifolds with finite topology. Because if you if you I'm sure you can construct an example on a hypercaddle for a manifold with infinite topology. Hypercatal for a manifold with infinite topology that has infinite time singularities. It's a good problem for the problem session. We can discuss it. I'm sure you can do it. It should give a nice five-page paper. I think it would be interesting. Anyway, so and then at each singular time, there is an act in each singularity in the way that I have very precisely defined. And then there exists, I was joking, I didn't. I was joking, I didn't define it precisely. There exists a k, which is an integer and a chain of embedded special Lagrangian spheres, such that as the time goes to infinity, L converges uniformly to the union, sorry, not disjoint, and the L T as currents converges to the sum of the currents corresponding to the different special Lagrangians. Special Agrangel. Yeah, it's just uniform in C0 if you want in the Ausdorff distance. Okay, so then the moreover, this is well, if the gradient on L is a perfect Morse function, this just means that it has only two critical points, the minimum Only two critical points, the minimum and the maximum. Then the grindings of these special Lagrangians in the decomposition can be chosen to satisfy this monotonicity condition. And we just wrote this here because this is one of the axioms in the regional stability condition. And if in C, the K, the number of special agriculture is one. Sorry, if you start with a flow stable guy, then k is going to be one, so there is only one special agrunche. And if k sorry, I wrote this incorrectly. And if k is greater than one, then L is unstable. If you mean L0 of L, what is L is tried to question. Sorry, sorry, no, no, no. What you mean L not is flow stable or what the starting. The starting hi sorry say L not yes L naught I'm sorry Yeah in the in the paper we have it with L's and then I when I was writing the slide I changed L to L naught so that I don't have to say such that L zero is L but then I forgot that. But anyway, and then I changed this here and I changed the thing right there. Anyway. And I changed the thing. Right. Anyway, forget about the last cycle. Thank you.
