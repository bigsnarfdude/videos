Thank you very much to the organizers for this very nice meeting here. I will call about quantum roto sensors of multi-cuted systems. Of course, this is a work with my colleagues. I am happy to say that the whole team has been here either in person or in Zoom. And the results that I want to The results that I want to tell you about are in this particular works that we have published. I prepared the talk in a very didactic and simple as possible. So some results I will just mention some lines about in these papers. Okay, the outline of the talk is just the introduction and statement of the problem. Introduction and statement of the problem. It will be in a part crucial. The Majorana representation. I will put some slides, I put some slides about it. And then the generalization of the problem for multi-qued systems. We are going to use a generalization of the Majorana representations. And then I will mention the results and then some conclusions. So, well, the first thing that we need to do is about to understand. we need to do is about to to understand the the title of the of the of the presentation right so uh here i will discuss about a very old ancient problem which is a measurement of rotations right which is a very old problem in metrology so for example if we are in the middle of the sea in a boat how can we measure if this boat was has been rotated if we cannot see some landscape or some some land in the Some land in the surroundings. The first solution is this compass, this magnetic needle suspended on the air, on some water. And of course, after that, we might to optimize these estimations. So for very small rotations to be more efficient and to not waste some fuel about the boat. Then another invention is called this. call this the gyroscopes of course right so here are these these are some some schemes about some old gyroscopes of course the modern ones i saw i have seen some pictures about these gigantic electronic gyroscopes which now they are used so now here what we are going to ask is about well what if instead of a classical system we have a quantum system, we have a quantum system. And then which state we now have this the device is a quantum system. Of course, we can ask this quantum system, of course, has many several states that we can put. And then which states of this quantum system could measure a rotation? This is called quantum roto sensors. Of course, among all these states will be some states that are optimal, and these ones will be called And these ones will be called optimal quantum proto sensors. So, just like a basic example, I bring this glass. I don't know if some people can see me, but for example, in the classical case, we can say that my system is this glass, right? And the possible states are all the possible orientations. And we want to calculate to measure, I'll be to make this system sensitive on the rotations about the z-axis. Of course, if we put the glass. Of course, if we put the glass in this orientation, it's almost imperceptible if we can the rotations, right? However, if we put it in this way, it is more sensitive to rotations and then we can detect when we rotate or not. Here in this problem, the system is instead of a glass, is the quantum system, and my space of configurations will be the whole Hilbert space of. Hilbert space of quantum states. Okay. And of course, there are some other applications. Maybe a quantum system is not the best one for a vote, but there are other applications. For example, in medicine, they want to measure very small and very local magnetic fields. For example, here is an example. They want to calculate vertebral rotations measurements about vertebrates, and then they can tell you something about, well, some pressures about the nerves. Pressures about the nerves, and then for medical purposes. They are some methods that they use, they want to measure small magnetic fields using magnetic resonance imaging. Okay, well, in theory, how we can quantify the sensitivity of a quantum system. Let me start first with the, instead of the multi-qubit, let me start first with the start first with the with single spin systems and in the case where we want to calculate we want to measurement measure the sensitivity of an infinitesimal rotation about a given axis to to calculate this in here in quantum theory what we are going to use is like some kind of interference process and then the quantity that we are going to use is the fidelity so we have we have our We have our single speed system. We prepare this system in an initial state, and then there is an interaction that creates the rotation here about the set axis. And we want to estimate this parameter theta, right? And then, of course, the fidelity, which is just the overlap between the initial and final states, will tell us a quantification of the sensitivity. If it is one, the fidelity, then it's like the Then it's like the case that we put the glass in this way, so it's almost imperceptible. I'm sorry. But if the state changes a lot, changes a lot about this after this evolution, then it is more sensitive. We want to make infinitesimal rotations because we, well, we want to make more sensitive. So they are small magnetic fields or as faster as we can detect some difference. Detect some difference, it will be great. So now we expand this expression in terms of the theta that we want to estimate, and it turns this quantity is called the quantum feature information. And in fact, since this is the inner product of this projective filber states, what we are going to obtain is the norm of the tangent vector in the tangent space of the projective filber space. Of course, the more the norm. Of course, the Morse, the norm will be calculated by this Fubini study metric. So, this is another interpretation about this metric in the tangent space, which is kind of intuitive, right? Because the faster you move to an orthogonal state, the more sensitive is the state. In practical terms, this quantity is just the variation of the expectation value of the angular momentum set, which is Momentum S, which is this expression, right? And there is a bound to estimate this parameter, the theta, the parameter associated to the generator set, which is given by this quantum Crammer round bound. As you can see, is the inverse of this quantum feature information. This means that therefore this equality, it is assumed that you can always saturate this equality. Always saturate this equality with some measurement scheme. But of course, the right-hand side of the equation, as you can see, is dependent on the state. So then an optimal quantum roto sensor will be a state that maximizes the quantum feature information and then minimizes this quantity, right? The estimation. Okay, an example in this case. An example in this case for a single spin system, the optimal quantum rotosensor is the GHZ state instead. So it's a superposition of the state with the highest projection along the Z axis and the lowest. These calls are Limberger-Holstein states. Another problem, another variation of this problem is now if we want to make a rotten sense. If we want to make a roton sensor which is sensitive, not about a given axis, but about an arbitrary axis. I mean, about all the axis. For example, we're going to measure a small magnetic field, but we don't know the direction of this magnetic field. So it will be great to create a roto sensor with these characteristics. Here, the quantum Crammer route is not averaged. And so here we average over all the directions. Average over all the directions of the generator. So the angular momentum operator pointing in the N for an generic n. And it turns out that now we need to minimize this quantity by using some inequalities. Here we use the Jensen inequality to obtain this expression. And this quantity, this integral is easy to do. It's easy to do, and we obtain this expression. So now we need to minimize this expression. To saturate this inequality, it turns out that you need to make that this quantity is constant. I mean, is independent of the n. So then to saturate this inequality, we put this condition. And then if we see the last expression, we want to maximize. We want to maximize, right? Well, we want to minimize the whole quantity, so then we need to cancel this term. And this gives us another condition, which is that, well, the expectation value of the algorithm momentum operator for any direction must be equals to zero. If you heard the talk of Jean-Martin, maybe these conditions are familiar. Maybe these conditions are familiar. You can observe that these are familiar. In fact, these are the conditions for what is called the anti-coherence of order two. So in conclusion, I see this observation one. This average Crammer raw bound is saturated, so it is minimal to the right-hand side of the equation. Sorry. Sorry, is minimize the right-hand side equation if the state is a two-anticoherent single-spin state in this case. Okay, I will not discuss more about anti-coherence. There are many properties. Okay, but now, okay, we know that this solves the solution. This can give us optimal quantum roto sensors. There is an easy way to like easy way to like a visual way to to to obtain these two anti-coherence states. It turns out that if your state has rotational symmetries over two different axes and the angles of rotations are different than pi, so it's not just 100 diameter, then the state is automatically two anti-coherent. Therefore, if you have a generic single spin state for Generic single spin state for a generic S, we just need to look for a very symmetric state on the several rotations, and this will be an optimal quantum rotosensor. An example is, for example, this one. So here we have the chain of conditions, right? If psi has a point group as described in observation two, then it's too anti-coherent. This is not necessarily sufficient. Necessarily sufficient, it's not an if one only pip, but if it's too anti-coherent, then it's an optimal quantum rotor sensor about an arbitrary x. An example is this one for spin two, for a single spin two system, is this one, which here I write it just as a vector with the coefficients in the S set eigenbasis. And it turns out that this one has a point group equal to the tetrahedron. Of course, here we cannot see like Like it's not intuitive, right? To see a tetrahedron inside of these coefficients. So, now the next question will be: okay, how can we observe the symmetries, the rotational symmetries of spin states? And for this, we use the Majorana representation for spin states, for single spin states. So, this is the first page of the article. The first page of the article where Majorana presents this representation, it's quite mechanical. So we have the state of a single spin state. We have the coefficients in the eigenzette basis, and then we can create a polynomial. With the polynomial, we solve it, we find the roots of the polynomials, and then by stereographic projection, we send the roots to the sphere. The polynomial. The polynomials is always at most a polynomial of degree 2s, but you can always put the extra roots such that any spin system has associated 2s roots. This banana representation is just a generalization of the block sphere representation. So if we remember, a spin one-half state, a qubit, is always a State a qubit is always associated a point on the sphere, okay. And this like this is the method. If you use the method, the general method for major energy, you obtain the same result as here with all the steps that I mentioned. So here, then each spin S state is associated with two S points on the sphere, which is called the stars, and the whole collection is the constellation. For example, a spin one state has associated. A spin one state has associated two points on the sphere using this technique that I mentioned with the polynomial. Here is another example. For example, this spin to state with these coefficients, it turns out it has these four stars and we just put some lines and faces. And it turns out this is a regular, well, it's a square on the equator. Okay, the properties, of course, Okay, the properties, of course, of this representation is that it's a bijective representation. Each geometric figure has a unique state associated, and vice versa. Of course, it's highly nonlinear, as you observe, it is a polynomial, and then you solve the roots. The relation between the coefficients of the polynomial and its roots is highly nonlinear. And also, most important, the rotations. The rotations. If you rotate the state in the abstract Hilbert space, which are given by these Wigner-D matrices, it's equivalent to rotate the state, the constellation, the state constellation, in the physical space. So practically we can visualize rotations. So then if we return to this state and we ask what is the point group of this state psi, well, we instead to try to solve. We instead to try to solve the Bigner D matrices and some equalities, we just plot the constellation, we observe a tetrahedron, we can compare the distance, for example, of the points, and then we can immediately say the point group of the state. So the point group of the geometric object is equal to the point group of the state. This way we can find it. Here we return again about the problem about quantum rotors about given axis. To rotate circles about given access, we say that here the solution is the GHZ states. It turns out that the GHZ states are just the regular eneagons, 2s, 2s eneagons on the equator. And for example, here it is like the worst quantum sensors, which are spin coherent states oriented on the Z axis. Here, of course, if we make a rotation along the Z axis, Along the z-axis, well, it doesn't change, so it's like the disorientation of the glass in the quantum in the quantum version. Okay, there exists also some W state, which is quite important in entanglement properties. And this one, well, in this orientation, it will be a quantum proto sensor, so it could detect, but it's not the optimal one. Here are the other examples of G-Axe states. And of course, in the second problem that we mentioned about the quantum proto-sensors, about an arbitrary axis, in fact, with this process, we can make some reverse engineering, right, about the optimal quantum proto-sensors with the observations one and two. For example, let us now suppose that we have a single spin tree system. So, well, we know that. So, well, we know that with this Majorana, a spin tree system has six stars. Now, well, what is a very symmetric object that we know that it has six vertices? Well, we know that it's the octahedron. Octahedron satisfies the properties of this point group that we mentioned. And we just need to use the Majorana representation to calculate the spin vector, the coefficients. And that's all. So in this way, we. And that's all. So, in this way, we can really fast calculate optimal quantum prototypes for any single spin tree system. This has been done experimentally, in fact, with some experiments with photons, polarization, quantum polarization of light. And then here, I calculate this optimal quantum rotosensors for arbitrary axis. And in fact, as you can see, these are the plateau. the these are the platonic solids which are practically a very symmetric systems so now and um now the next is the the new part the the results that we have done is well we want to solve the same problem though but now we are going to make use of multi-spin system which is like the multi-qued systems like the multi-cuited systems. For simplicity, we are only using symmetric multi-spin systems. So B tensor product of K copies of spin S systems. The procedure that I will explain here for other cases, for example, anti-symmetric and even for tensor product of spin systems with different spins, is practically straightforward. So they are the same. Forward, so they are the same steps. We can use even the same steps, but for simplicity, we are going just to discuss this one. Okay, what is the problem before to start? Here, well, we need to the devil is in the details. First, the Majorana representation that I mentioned, it was only for single spin. It was only for single spin states. So, this is the first detail that we need to discuss. And of course, the quantum Fischer informations and the quantum Kramer-Rau bounds, they were also calculated, at least here in these slides, also for single spin states. So, we need to review, to check what are these expressions and to work on them. Okay, first, let me discuss about how to generalize the imagery and a representation. Generalize the Majorana representation, but now for multi-spin stains, let me mention this. Of course, the SU2 group in this space, maybe I don't mention this in this talk, but we are always working with the space which are close after SU2 representation. So we are not working with some pseudo-qubit, pseudo-spin systems, right? Then, SU2, of course, this space is not irreducible, it's not a reducible representation, but we can't block decompose the system. So, this one is equivalent to a direct sum of several blocks, where these blocks has several different or with some degeneracy spin, spin degrees. I mean a generic A generic, a general state here, which is a linear combination of these states, the factorizable states. Each state, any state, any generic state, can be written as a linear combination of a state in each of these blocks. Each of these states transforms as a spinor with the respective spin S1, S2. Perspective spin S1, S2, and so on, SR. Here are some examples. For example, the system of two spin one states is equivalent to what we are going to call a principal subspace of spin two and the direction of another Hilbert space of spin zero, so a scalar in this case. For three spin one, we have again two. Here there is, for example, this one. For spin three-half system can be decomposed in five, if a direct sum of five spin systems, serves of spin systems. And since each of them transforms as a spinor, then we can associate to each of these. To each of these sub-spaces, a constellation in the similar way to La Majoran. For example, in the article that we wrote, there are some ways, of course, to calculate which irreps you obtain in these products. We can use the old techniques of representation theory, calculating the integrals of the characters, but there are also. Characters, but there are also another techniques which use the Poincaré series of some invariants, SU2 invariants. And it turns out, for example, that the rational, it turns out this is a rational polynomial. And you expand this polynomial, and the coefficients tells you how many irrefs appears and which ones appears. Unfortunately, there is no closed expression to calculate which irrefs. Which irreps are you going to obtain. Well, at least there are efficient ways to calculate. As I mentioned, there will be always just a unique Hilbert space with the highest spin, and this will be important, and we are going to call it the principal subspace for reasons that I will mention later. In this case, for the symmetric multi-spin systems, this principal subspace always has subspace always has spin equals to k times all right so as I mentioned then if each of these subspaces transform irreducible of the SU2 transformations then we can associate to each of them a constellation in the same way as the Majorana technique with the polynomial and so on therefore a generic A generic state in this Hilbert space will be a set of two constellations, one of spin three, one of spin two, and also some coefficients. Of course, the coefficients, this part is new, of course, in the usual Majorana representation, but here they are important because, well, this here this are linear combination, right? And then they are important to me. Then they are important to have these terms. In fact, also on the paper, these coefficients we can associate to another constellation called the spectator constellations, and in somehow we can define them in a unique way. So we can create a bijection between the set of constellations, the spectator constellation, with the whole space of the whole Hilbert space. Okay, so then Okay, so then this is an example of a quantum state. Okay, and again, all the properties of the previous Majorana, oops, the previous Majorana representation are satisfied also here, except for this set one and set two that they transform in a weird way, at least the phase factors. Its norm is just invariant, it's invariant on the rotations, but their phase factors. Rotations, but their phase factors could change after rotation. But okay, in fact, we are going to see that the phase factors are not relevant for this problem. This is another example. Oops. No? Okay. This one. This is another example. For four spin tree half space, we have this decomposition, and then we can put any exotic state as we want. Exotic state that we want here. The only condition is that these sets are normalized. So the sum of the squares of these sets must be equal to one. So for example, here I put a ecosahedron, a cube. Here I don't put anything because, well, set three is equals to zero, then it doesn't matter the constellation, and so on. And here for each zero, well, it's at a spin zero, so it doesn't have any constellation at all. Okay, so we checked this generalization of the Majorana representation. Now, what about the quantum feature information quantities? Okay, so let us review again the quantification of the quantum feature information for a given axis, but now for multi-spin systems. It turns out, as you can see, well, the generators that appear is a set and That appear is a set, and since these operators do not transfer, do not combine, do not mix the blocks, then they somehow factorize the problem. Not completely because there are some squares here, as you can observe, but anyhow it could reduce this to this expression. As I said, the phase factors of the sets doesn't matter because here I are in the square. Are in the square norm. And now we want to maximize this expression to characterize the optimal quantum rotation sensors. It is easy to observe that to maximize this quantum feature information, all of these sets must be zero, except the principal, the one associated with the principal subspace. And now we want to maximize these quantities. So this one must be zero and this. So, this one must be zero and this one must be maximized. And then we put these conditions, but only in the principal sub space. So, we obtain somehow a generalization of the GS states. This is an example. So, an optimal quantum prototype sensor in these four-spin three-half systems. So, as I said, we put everything equals to zero except this one. And in this one, zero except this one and in this one we put a gh set that as i said they are always any agon here is a dodecagon a regular dodecagon on the equator i put generalization in quotes because it turns out this the is the original g state just in another um in another interpretation right so instead to to see to be To see to be seen as a spin six state is seen as a four-spin three-half state. In fact, here it is some decomposition, the decomposition of the GHZ state. So it's just the V product of three or four GHZ states of string three-half, and they are only rotated by some particular angle. And they create the same state. Same state. Now, to the second problem that we discussed. So, for an arbitrary axis, we make again, we analyze this quantity, but now in this generalization, the Jensen's inequality can be applied again, and then we obtain this expression, this whole expression. Again, if we want to saturate this inequality, this expression must be constant, so must be independent of the n. Must be independent of the n or the state psi. And as we can see here, if we want to maximize this expression, then we need to cancel this term. And here the weights, well, the principal subspace will be the highest weight in this sum. And then it turns out that again, we must cancel to put all the set are zero except the one corresponding to the The one corresponding to the principal sub-space. And in the principal subspace, we only need to put a state such that it is a two-anti-coherent state. So as you can see, we reduce the problem, this other problem, we always reduce it to the fierce one, the well-known. So this is an example for a 3-spin one system. We have this decomposition. We put all the sets. We put all the sets zero except the first one. And in this one, we put a two-anti-coherent state. And if we use this technique, that highly symmetric state, it's automatically two anti-coherent state, as we mentioned in observation two. Then here we can put the octahedron, and that's all. We only need to make the reverse, all the steps in reverse to calculate the respective spin. The respective spin, the respective states, which in this case is this V product of these three states, which again, if one see this state, you cannot see an octahedron, right? Well, the conclusion. So, as I mentioned, we generally make some generalization on We generally make some generalization of Majorana representation of this V product of K copies of spin S. As I mentioned, we can make this also for all other cases anti-symmetric and even for the general, more general case. We take advantage of the previous results, so for the single spin systems, to reduce our problem, but now in this general for this, for this system. For a given axis, we For a given axis, we obtain that the optimal quantum proto sensors are these generalized in quotes ghz states they are the same just seen in another decomposition and for arbitrary axis they are again states with a two anti-coherent state but only in the principal sub space and after that we can also as i mentioned the same technique the same procedure can be applied for other multi-cuts Can be applied for other multi-cut systems and also to study other additional restrictions. For example, in these two examples that I showed you, the final state is a V-factorizable state, but not necessarily. So this was just pure luck. In fact, if I remember well, for four spin one systems, you obtain here a cube, and the cube is not factorizable. So now we can put this. So now we can put this condition. Obtain optimal quantum proto sensors, but now with which are B factorizable, or in the case in the anti-symmetric case, are wedge factorizables. In fact, for example, for states in the anti-symmetric case, wedge factorizable states are associated with these slater states that are obtained for Hamiltonians in fermionic systems. They do not have interactions between They did not have interactions between the fermions, for example. So there are some physical restrictions that we can study now with these results. And well, that's all. Thank you. Thank you very much. And this is my bibliography. Thank you. Eduardo for this talk. We have time for questions. Let me see. Yes, John, please go ahead with your question. Thank you. Thank you, Eduardo, for this clear talk. I have a question. Did I understand quickly that in order to find the most The most sensitive states. What you need to do is to look at states with maximal angular momentum. So you only need to select the sector with maximal angular momentum. And in this sector, you need then to choose the most anti-coherent state somehow. Is that correct? Is that correct? Yes, hi, hi, John. Yes, of course, correct. And this is the procedure, the technique. Okay, so my question is, would it be the same for arbitrary states of many Q-dits? Because here you only looked at symmetric states of many qubits, but what about other types of states? Other types of states, states without symmetries? Yes, yes. In fact, the result will be the same because, for example, here, the key important results is that this S squared at S, they don't combine the blocks, right? So practically the expressions will be also the same. And then here, as you can see here, this term. As you can see here, this term has this term, right? Which is a weight that depends on the spin. And of course, the higher the spin is, this weight factor is higher. That's why the principal constellation, sorry, the principal sub-space, I mean the space with the highest spin, is the most relevant to minimize this expression. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. Okay, are there further questions? Cause Omalis, please. Just a nasty question. Do you have any idea, numerically speaking, how do this quantum approach compares with traditional classical systems of angle detection, of rotation detection? For this case of rotations, well, I don't know because, for example, in my glass example, I don't know what to quantify the estimation. Of course, it depends of the technique that you are using to measure the estimation. However, for other applications, like in to measure, To make some measurements with, for example, with light, we know that there is this Kramer-Rau limit in classical fields. For classical fields, it depends on the inverse of the square root. But for quantum lights, it depends on the n over n. And this is just an exponential, well, exponential increase of the steep. Of the estimation of parameters, and so you say that the quantum approach in principle has a huge advantage over the classical approach, correct? Yes. Is there any realization of this? Do you know of any concrete realization of this or is it just well on paper we see that one scales like this and the other like that? Thank you. For rotations, like here, I mean. Like here, I don't know, but for other estimations with classical light and quantum light, yes, it is experimental. Okay, other further questions last question. For the average problem of a single spin, if you do the calculation. If you do the calculation in the next order in theta, will you see that I don't know four anti-coherent states are better than two anti-coherent states or how does these roto sensors behave with the anti-cohere degree of anti-coherence? Okay, thank you. Well, at least for this expression, as we can observe, it only depends on the. We can observe it only depends on the second order. Because, yeah, well, this is a nice question. I don't know. I don't really know the answer. I know that, for example, just to make an observation: here is infinitesimal rotations, right? There is another problem. Right? There is another problem which is finite rotations. And it is not at least one-to-one that for finite rotations you need anti-coherence of higher orders. Instead, if you want to estimate rotations by pi, the most optimal quantum roto sensors are the spin coherent, which are in fact the worst, well, is the opposite of at the coherence. So I think that it is not as trivial. Not as trivial the answer. Okay, let's thank the speaker again. So we are now having the coffee break here and we are restarting with the last talk at 10 past 11. And so we can after the
