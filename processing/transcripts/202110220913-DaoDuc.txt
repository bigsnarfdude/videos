Thanks again for everybody that's tuned in all week, both virtually and in person. This is our last day. We've got four great talks for you. We're going to start off with Kanye Al Duk from UBC. All right, so okay, I'm going to start. And first I want to really thank the organizers for the invitation and also for putting together this wonderful Together, this wonderful workshop. This is my first time at VIAS, and my understanding was that this was a research center that was focusing on the math, but I just find it amazing that I said that to Leia this morning at breakfast. It was amazing to also see biologists attending this workshop and giving a lot of insights on their method. And as a blind mathematician, I really value that. Really value that. So I'm going to talk to you today about some research I did during my postdoc and also some new research I started in continuation of this as I moved to UBC recently in the math department. And it will focus on the study of this big molecular machine that you can see on the background that is called the ribosome. That is called the ribosome. That is just okay. So, should I just use my pointer, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so this big machine, yeah, so the ribosome, which is this big molecular machine that you can see in the background, and it is basically Basically, the main mediator of protein translation. And so I also talk about transport, which is one of the main focus of this workshop. But maybe my view on that would be at a different scale than what I've seen over the last year. What I've seen over the week. So well, I hope that it will be still interesting for you. And it will lead me also to tell you a bit more about some current research that I studied, so there are some new results and new methods on how to analyze biological shapes. Okay, so uh a bit of a background to begin with. Okay, now I cannot use the I need to use this to This to not yes, with the slice of slides are not respond responding now. Once you get the slide. I hope I have to do that. Okay. So. You do have to reshare your screen. So now I have to share the screen. Okay, I hope I don't have to do this. You probably just froze up. It froze up. So I... Okay, so I do a screen share again. Yeah. Yeah, I just need a full screen. What is it? Just full screen your presentation. Alright, so let me tell you a bit more about the ribosome. And so, as I said, it's a machine that is involved in. A machine that is involved in protein translation, and you can see this actually as a transport process that leads the ribosome to get assembled at the start codon. Oh, sorry. Sorry about that. Well, we can maybe pull up a chair and then it would feel just like, you know, okay, so in this cartoon at the bottom, you see this mRNA sequence, and what I just wanted to mRNA sequence and what I just wanted to tell you about is that you can see translation as a transport process of ribosomes that would get assembled at the start codon. So this is the initiation, what we call the initiation step. And then they would move along just decoding the sequence of codons, assembling the amino acid corresponding amino acids and build a protein. And this process goes on. And this process goes on until your ribosome reaches the stop codon and then you have your fully nascent protein. I also included some what I, yeah, usually when I talk about the ribosome and as an introduction I also like to show these two pictures that are separated from almost 60 as and it really shows you know how much of a progress we made. I mean this is really that's also I think just amazing science is. Think just amazing science is, you know. This ribosome was first discovered by Georgi Pallad, and it was in 1955. And he was at the time studying the, using electron microscopy to visualize the endoplastic reticulum of the cells. And at the time he noticed these spots, and so that's also why this part of the ER is called the rough ER. And he hypothesized at the time that the spots were actually Spots were actually corresponding to these particles that he called the ribosome because they were made of ribonucleoproteins. And he was right at guessing that these particles were actually involved in translation. And 60 years later, using CryoEM, which is a technique I'm also going to talk about, we have a very precise view. Precise view at the very high resolution of this particle. So you can really see these two subunits that are getting assembled. So these are shown in yellow and blue here. And what you can see in green is the tRNA that the ribosome binds to when it assembles the chain of polypeptide. Alright, so I hope this will work. Okay, perfect. Would work? Okay, perfect. So I've been studying translation and I've been interested in the ribosome for the past few years and I think what is just so amazing is that you can use all kinds of experiments and data to study this process of ribosome transport. So I just want to mention a few of them and it covers basically a lot of scales and that's also something that I find great. Something that I find great as a mathematician to study for studying this process. And I just want to mention a few of them. So at the macro scale, for example, you can use in vitro systems. So these are called cell-free protein synthesis systems that basically provide, for example, time series measurements of translated proteins. So that's you can roughly measure how a system is. STEM is working to make proteins and get some measurements, and that's also something I won't talk too much about today, but I'm also interested in studying translation at this scale. You can use, also you can build some more high-throughput data, so for example using mass-spec proteomics. And the technique I'm going also to talk about today uses RNA-deep sequencing, so it's called ribosic. RNA-deep sequencing, so it's called RiboSeq. It was developed basically around 10 years ago and it generates basically a lot of data because you can look at how translation you can measure translation dynamics now for all genes. So if you think about yeast that makes 6,000 genes approximately. And you measure things at a codon resolution. So you get this. So you get this very nice high-fluid data to analyze. You can also, I just wanted to mention also single-particle imaging because some of you are really interested in that. And so there has been protocols that have been developed to really try to image translation at a single particle level. And you can go like this event through a thinner scale. So there's a lot of interesting research. There is a lot of interesting research using optical tweezers to freeze the ribosome and measure forces involved in translation. And finally, the last thing I will talk about, should I use this anymore, is the cryo-EM that I also showed in the previous slide. So you can get these 3D atomic structures, and there are also thousands of structures that are now popular. Thousands of structures that are now publicly available with very high-resolution 3D images. So I just highlighted here these experiments that I'm interested in and with also this collaborator, this great group of collaborators that I'm collaborating with. Okay, so what I'll present today. Okay, so what I'm going to present today is how to combine this data that I just mentioned and use some mathematical, statistical and computational approaches to study translation. And well, at the end of the talk, I hope that you learn more about the following questions. So I will tell you about how we can quantify if translation dynamics are limited by the elongation or the initial. By the elongation of the initiation step, if the ribosome structure is playing a role in these dynamics, given also all these structures available, how to compare these structures from a geometric point of view. And this research basically led me for the past few years to just try to question what metrics we can design more generally to study. Design more generally to study biological shapes. Alright, so just some motivation and maybe some introduction to the sequencing data that I want to talk about today, so it's called ReboSeq. And it's a protocol where basically you isolate these polysomes. So you can imagine that you have multiple copies of RNA which are under Are under translation, so you can have these ribosomes that are bound to it. And the protocol is basically freezing all of them and then isolate these protected fragments. And just by mapping these fragments back to the genome, you can get this profile. So it basically tells you how you have a density of ribosomes, of occupation of ribosomes along a cutting region. Region. And so it's a high-throughput method, so you can do that for all of genes. And in the end, after doing this experiment, you can get different profiles. So this is an illustration that shows different profiles that you would get for different genes. And that basically reveals also how heterogeneous this transport process of the ribosomes can be. So as a first approach, you can just think that if translation, for example, is slower For example, it is slower in a specific region, you should observe like higher peaks. And so when I started working on that for my postdoc around 2014-15, I was basically interested in trying to solve this kind of inverse problem. Like, if I'm given a profile, what can I say about the local dynamics? Okay? And so to And so to do that, I used a modeling approach and I used this model for particle transport that had been actually widely used for modeling translation. And it's based on a model that is stochastic and that is called the TASEP model. So it's a totally so TASEP stands for Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process. Simple exclusion process. And well, you can see it as a continuous time Markov chain where you just model the occupation of particles along a lattice. So here you have a lattice of size n, and if you have a particle occupying, then the state is the value that you put at this location is 1 and 0 otherwise. And so the continuous time lack of change, so there are some rules governing the rates of entrance. governing the rates of entrance of particles so that they can move, they can enter the lattice at the rate alpha and exit at the rate beta. I'm assuming here that the process is homogeneous, so you just put a constant for the rate of hopping from a site to another, with this simple exclusion rule that if there's a particle that sees a particle just Sees a particle just downstream, it won't move. And so it's a process that actually was introduced in the 70s and has been widely studied then by mathematicians or physicists. So one of the person also in the audience and one of the next speakers, Tom Chow, actually did some great work to To extend this model and apply that also to translation. And I also wanted to mention that it's been used to describe all kinds of processes in biophysics. And there are some, for example, some paper that connect this tassel process to microtubular transport, which was one of the main focus of this workshop. Alright, so when I started working on it, When I started working on it, I couldn't use this simple representation for first for the simple reason that, as I showed in the data, the profiles are very heterogeneous, right? So you need to kind of relax this assumption that you have constant hoping rates. So now you can assume that your particles can hop at an arbitrary rate. So you put this value So you put this value P at. And another thing that is quite important is that your ribosomes, when you isolate these fruit prints, they have a certain size, and that corresponds to the size of your ribosome, which is approximately 10 codons. And so to me, the kind of necessary extension that you have to put in this model was to include extended size and inhomogeneity in the Hawking rate. So we call this the inhomogeneous L T. Rate. So we call this the henomogeneous L Daset model. I just put here the stationary master equation that you can get when you want to calculate the particle density just to show that it will involve higher order moments of this density. So this represents the flux that you would see at position I. So it depends, it's proportional to Pi and it's depending on this quantity. It's depending on this quantity, to i times 1 minus 2i plus L, which basically says that, okay, you need to have a particle and you need also the next the site at position i plus L to be unoccupied. And so this gives you a flux and at the stationary when it gets to stationarity, you have this equality between what happens at i and what happens at position i plus one. And so because And so, because you have these higher-order moments, you cannot solve this equation directly. And well, there have been multiple approaches that people try to still provide some results. And what we did at the time was to consider what we call the hydrodynamic limit of the particle density. So we are in this case where we are looking at long sequencing, so we can assume that the size of the lattice goes to infinity, and if you rescale basically the time in your process accordingly, you get to this so-called hydrodynamic limit. Okay, so now instead of considering a discrete sequence of rails, now you have a continuous profile, and I'll call this function lambda. And you make basically this process into the real domain, and so instead of considering the density at position i as to i, now I'm considering this as a variable rho. Okay, so I'm looking at rho of x. And basically, after doing some math, you can find that rho, so the density now in this. So, the density now in this continuous interval is satisfying this first-order PDE that leads to a conservation law. And it basically says that the density is governed by this term here, that is a flux of availability. And if you just want to get some intuition about this term, it's basically, as I said, the flux is proportional to the rate. So, lambda of x is the rate at which you Is the rate at which your particle moves along the lattice. It's also proportional to the density. So, same idea as what I said in the previous slide. And now you have this extra term, g of rho, that basically accounts for the rule of exclusion. So if L, for example, was equal to 1, you would obtain 1 minus a rho, which basically takes us back to takes us back to what the master equation that I wrote in the in the in the previous slide. Okay, so we did some work with some of my postdoc advisor, Jung Song, and a PhD student in the group at the time to really derive this equation. And the idea is to really map this tassel process to what we call a dual process. And this, I just want to cite this paper by Sean Hurr and Pierre. By Sean Hurr and Pierre. And just for the anecdote, this was a paper that Tom Chow actually referred to me when I started my postdoc and I was telling what I was doing at the time. He said that I should take a look at this paper here. And then it basically just opened up a lot of ideas for us to try to study, to see the star type in these conditions. In these conditions. Okay, so I don't want to go too much into the details of how you solve this PD and how you study it. It's also, if you're interested, there are more details in the paper. But what we can get, I think the real advantage of using this and what we can get in the end is this really nice representation of the traffic that you can summarize into a phase diagram. So it basically tells you that by considering the entrance and the exit rate, The entrance and the exit rate, you can really have a view of how your system would behave in terms of traffic. And there are some, I just put some illustrations of how this applies to real life. So back at the time when I was in California, I just put different images of different locations in California. So for example, if you go to the Death Valley, you can, this is corresponding to this region here of low density, where basically Flow density, where basically the flux only depends on the limiting factor, it's just the rate at which your cars are just getting on the highway. You can think about what happens if your exit rate now is becoming the limiting factor, so in the region where beta is low, then you will have a Q that can formed at the end of the lattice. Of the lattice. And that's a representation of the half dome in the Yosemite. And there's also a regime at some point where no matter how you increase the entrance rate or increase the exit rate, now your limiting factor of traffic will become basically your lattice. And this is what would happen, for example, if you put a toll in a bridge, like this is the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. And so what I think is also nice is that, okay, we really generalize this model to an arbitrary rate function, but in the end, when you look at this phase diagram, this flux is only determined by four extra parameters, which are the boundary rates and the minimum rate that has some importance when you're looking in this maximal current region. And of course also the particle size plays a role. Size plays a role. Okay, so after doing this math, basically we applied this to our data and we tried to understand, okay, can we position the genes that we observed from ABOC data on this phase diagram? And this is basically a picture that we put in our cell systems paper that basically locates all these different genes in this phase diagram. And you can see that most of them are limited by Most of them are limited by initiation, which actually makes sense. You don't want to accumulate too much of a traffic jam in your system. But there are also some genes which are, for example, in this region of maximal current, and we did some further analysis to understand, to have some more biological interpretation of why it would be beneficial from a system point of view to have such genes in this region here. And we did some more analysis. And we did some more analysis on, for example, how you can be sensitive to a change of variables in different regions of the system, to just provide some kind of first principles on how to make translation efficient. Okay, I also want to mention that we put that into a software, and I think that's actually okay. I hope I can share this. It's a very nice tool, and I just want to mention that. Nice tool, and I just want to mention that because I more recently collaborated with a biologist and I just find it super useful to explain these dynamics. So you can just try to recapitulate everything that I explained in this interface here that shows here at the bottom left this sequence of copying rates. And you can play with this parameter alpha and beta, so the initiation and the exit rate, and this is the phase diagram, and you can see this. Diagram, and you can see this change in the profile when you change this parameter. So you can visualize how you would, for example, move. Your profile will drastically have this phase transition, where you are in this low density, where basically you are limited by initiation. But once your initiation rate becomes, let's say, too high, then you have this switching where basically the position where your Your I can also change this rate, for example. Okay, let me see. You can see these traffic jams just appearing. Okay? And so I actually find this super useful as a tool just to explain how this system would work and you can see now how the system is moving along the phase diagram. Okay, so let me get back to the slide. Okay, and so some further applications that I want to mention is that actually one of the advantage of having these analytical formulas is that we can really solve this impact problem that I mentioned before. So you can just invert this equation and then figure out how to just infer the rate. Just infer the rates from the formula. And it doesn't involve any stochastic simulations, for example, it's just plugging the formula, and so it gives you a very fast way to do that. And I just want to mention some biomedical applications that I'm working on right now, and it's in collaboration with Ethel Winblatt, who's in the Department of Biochemistry at UBC. And so I actually met him after giving Giving a talk on this tassel model at the biochemistry department at UBC and is interested in understanding the role of this gene, FMRP, in the development of neurons and oocytes. And so this is a gene that has been involved functionally to the brain and autism. And in this paper that was published 10 years ago, they showed that this gene was involved. This gene was involved in stalling the ribosomal translocation. So, really, you know, creating these traffic jams that are basically that you can model with this tasket model. And Ethan did basically took this and using Ribosik, he did a much more high-throughput analysis and now tried to understand what's the impact of this genome on the regularized strand of translation in general. And so, it's very interesting. In general. And so it's very interesting to see that there are some genes that are affected by this gene. And so, what we are trying to do now is to understand if you change the, you know, these changes in profiles, what they account for. Do they account for a change in initiation rate or, for example, if you observe a change that it means that translation becomes limited by elongation or initiation, etc. I also want to mention, and I thought when I, after doing all this work that I was done with Doing all this work that I was done with studying this process, but it appears that now there are some more complex pathways that connect these collisions with some feedback on the initiation side. And so I think we might need to extend this model. And that's just something that could be of interest for all the people who are trying to model this type of stochastic processes. Okay, I will move to the next part, but I'm free, you know, if anyone else. Free, you know, if anyone has any question, I'm also happy to take them at the stage. I'm just moving to the next part. Yeah, so just let me know if you see some questions. Okay, so now I want to move to another scale. So I said I was interested in CryOEM, and this is the kind of connection that I made quite naturally after thinking about the translation process. About the translation process and looking at the structure of the ribosome and thinking about what's happening at the atomic scale when translation, when elongation happens. So, this is again this picture of the ribosome structure where you can see the tRNA and what's happening during translation is that, as I said before, you assemble your amino acid to form this chain of peptide that becomes the protein. And what's really fascinating to me is that, okay, when you do this, Do this basically, your chain grows into the ribosome before exiting. It has to go through this narrow compartment that we call the ribosome exit tunnel. And it's known actually that there are some sequences, some sequences really can be designed to lead the chain to just store within the tunnel. And it can have some functional applications, for example, for transporting. For transporting your rigosome into a specific location or for antibiotics targeting. So the question that I asked was: okay, now I have a way to infer the elongation rates, understand the dynamics, and I want to understand, okay, does the structure of the ribosome play a role in these elongation rates that I would observe at the mesoscopic scale? Alright, so Alright, so this is a quite big statistical study that we did in this paper in 2018 with my postdoc advisor. And I just want to focus on one specific set of results that we got then. So, what we found out is that if you try to use a statistical model that will take a look at all the components of the sequence and try to Components of the sequence and try to explain the deviation in the elongation rate, so across all the genes, what you would find out is that there's some influence of positively charged and negatively charged amino acids. And it goes in the way that basically if you have your chain that is at the early stage of translation, so you still haven't exited the tunnel, if your chain has some positive charges, okay, so this. Charges. Okay, so these are two charged amino acids, I think lysine and arginine. They would have a positive impact on the rate at which your ribosome is moving along the sequence. And what's also interesting is that you observe this negative effect for negatively charged amino acids. So this to me suggested that, okay, there must be maybe some electrostatic interactions that would explain maybe how the, that would basically impact the dynamics of this change. Impact the dynamics of this chain in such a confined environment. And I started thinking about that, and made me think about this paper that was published in the 90s by Svantzig, where he was looking at the dynamics of a charged particle in 3D. And it was a very nice paper where basically you can look at this diffusion process. And in this 3D environment, you can project this in 1D. Project this in 1D, and when you do that, you obtain this so-called Fit Jacobs equation. And it basically says that okay, you can recapitulate this change in the geometry in 3D into a term that accounts for this geometric entropy. So what it basically means is that if you increase the size of, for example, if you increase the size of the cross-surface, you give more freedom. You give more freedom of your particle. And so, if you're looking at the longitudinal flux, it has an effect of just effectively slowing down your particle. So, you're getting into your term of questions now. Oh, already. Okay, sorry. Okay, I tried to go very quickly. But basically, what I want to say is that you can model this, and so by looking at the crayon structure, what we found out is that the forces in the tunnel were actually in agreement with the results that we have from. The results that we have from sequencing data. Okay, let me just go quickly over this slide just to say that what I showed here applied for a tunnel that was in yeast, because that was at the time we were studying yeast. But I did some further study to look at the tunnel in different species, and we can find this very interesting geometric variation in the tunnel, and notably the fact that you carry out some That eukaryotes have these two constriction sites. So, if you're thinking now in terms of entropy, that really has some important consequences. And you don't have this in bacteria. And when you do this over different species, so in red you have the bacteria and in blue you have the eukaryotes, you can see that there's really something that seems to have some importance, evolutionary speaking, and this is something that is well considered. Concern. Okay, I just want to say that okay, we are doing some more. Now, since I started at UBC, I started to collaborate more on, try to really think, you know, to extend this to a real view of how the polymer, the chain, should transit inside the tunnel and to study this effect of the geometry. So, what you can see here at some video. Here, at some videos from molecular dialect simulations, that really shows that the geometry has some impact and can really make your chain get stalled inside the tunnel. And so we are now studying basically this escape process of a polymer inside this confined geometry, and we can see some very interesting results if you are looking at the escape probability or the continuation of exit time. And I wanted also to mention this because there have been quite a few speakers. Been quite a few speakers who are interested in these problems during this workshop. Okay, just want to say that since I moved to UBC, I also try to think about how to automate this processing of getting the structures and take advantage of the thousands of structures that are available on the protein database. And so we are building now this database that you can visit, and it basically compiles all the structures. Basically, compiles all the structures together in a kind of curated way so you can really do some cool comparison. And I think in the future, what I'd like to do is to develop some more tools that would be built on this database for different applications, for example, doing some prediction of antibiotic binding or doing some 3D alignment. Okay, let me just skip this slide. Just skip this slide. I just want to say that, you know, just going across these scales and now getting more interested in Croy OEM, I just thought, okay, we designed some tools to analyze the tunnels, but I just find that now, with the data that we get from CrowEM, it's actually great to think about molecular shapes in general. And so for the past couple of years or so, I started to think about, okay, what kind of tools can we develop to compare shapes? Can be developed to compare shapes. So, I won't talk about this Vassar Schline distance, but there are some papers that we just published on that. And actually, I'll give a talk on Monday at University of Alberta where this so you can see maybe this as a teaser for this next talk. But I want to mention this very nice collaboration that I started with Nina Miolan at UCSB and Ashok Prasad. Pressab, and it is something that I didn't use in the context of the tunnel, but at the time I really thought, okay, what kind of metric can I use to compare the tunnel? And I started thinking about this what's so-called elastic metric. And so it's basically a way to compare shapes using differential geometry and taking into account bending and stretching parameters. And I think it can somehow connect to what Padmini was presenting earlier on during this. Earlier on during this workshop. And it has a very nice implementation within this Python library that we've been working on with Nina. And we have applied that to study cell shapes. So now moving back to the cellular scale. And an advantage of using this deformation-based. But deformation-based metric is that you can really use that, for example, to model some deformation. So think about realistic geodesics that can connect a shape to another and try to think about using really efficient tools in order to compare group of cells. So this is basically what I'm showing here: is how the cell shapes changing depending on treatment and different lineages, and so we can see this interesting separation. Okay, I will. Separation. Okay, I will just stop here and I just want to mention my collaborators and all the people who are involved in this work. My postdoc advisor, Jun-son from UC Berkeley, and Jamie Kate, who is doing structural biology. The student Sudan, who did the math of the TASEP and who is now a postdoc at Stanford, Sanjit also helped with the computation. And these are the two students. So RTEM has been developing the data. So, RTEM has been developing the database for a year now, and it's just done an amazing work. Shiki has worked with Sinker, who is a professor at UBC in Chemical Biomedical Engineering, to do these MD simulations. And finally, these three other collaborators, so Ethan Greenblatt, who's a new assistant professor at UBC in biochemistry, and Nina, who's a mathematician at UCSB and Ashok at Colonel West. Okay, so well, I'll just stop here. Just thank you for your attention, and I'll be happy to take any questions. Alright. So we've got time for maybe one question from the room and one question from the virtual audience. Why don't we go ahead and start with the room so we can wait until the audio system gets changed over? I have a question. I have a question. So, at the beginning part of your talk, you talked about this idea of basically traffic damning of having just tons of ribosomes on a piece of DNA. But versus the scenario where you have basically one ribosome. And then, of course, there's the middle guy. But how frequent are those? I mean, there are proteins like actin, but then there are also far sparser proteins, the sorts of things you're measuring like fish. The sorts of things you would measure about fish. Do you have any idea of how kind of common this is? Yeah, so that basically comes back to the slide I showed when you put, maybe I can, should I share my screen again? Okay, maybe I'll share my slides later on to yeah, I just don't want to cover all these technical details anymore. But you know, if you remember the phase diagram, we are positioning all these genes in this region where basically it says that, okay, your limiting factor is initiation. Limiting factor is the initiation. So, my first answer would be that, okay, you don't observe these traffic jams, I mean, and it makes sense, right? You don't want to accumulate off these ribosomes. Now, the other thing that I can mention is that people have done experiments, like trying to play with, for example, terani abundance and depleting some resources, and measure the ribosome profile. And you see, actually, the binding of the ribosome. The binding of the ribosome in the data. So, this is something that can happen, but from a systems point of view, I don't think that in normal conditions that's something that you don't want your, that's not suitable for the system. But it could lead to some maybe some pathologies, as I said, in the applications. I want you to shut your laptop, I think. I have no idea what to do. We can just talk. I can leave the meeting, I guess? Unfortunately, we don't seem to have the. Yeah, now we're walking. It started midway through. Fortunately, the system is not set up right now for virtual participants to ask questions. Ask questions. But I can put it in chat. Virtual participants, if you have any questions, please come up. There we go. Are there any virtual questions? Just so please just speed up. Are you up to time? One. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. Okay, very nice talk. Talk about a model extension. Is it possible to have heterogeneity in the link of the particles? I'm thinking about there might be data, you know, things like information. Could we still track a conservation model or something like that? You can get two types of articles that can look at. That can capable of an analysis. I can't keep a very size criteria distinguishing which is passed part. I think all the differences in copycoding gradient. But I think you can display some. But it would take some more. But that's actually actually a very interesting scene. Yeah, yeah, that's a very interesting. That's a very interesting thing to consider. Actually, sharing marriage, I guess. Maybe we'll talk about it anyway. So I apologize to everybody to have any language and make sure that you can go in this discussion with the public. The next speaker is going to be the JQU when the organization becomes comfortable. So now we have an app slash note. He is on his last university premiere.
