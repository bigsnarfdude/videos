Thanks for the introduction and I would also like to thank the organizers for the kind invitation. It's a great pleasure for me to speak here. So the type of problem we are really interested in is to use waves to get an image of the interior structures of some certain objects. So for example, we can use seismic waves to explore the subsurface geologic structure of the Earth. We can use artificially generated seismic waves and this seismic wave will travel on the ground and then reflect it back to the ground. And then you can record the returned waves on the ground and use this kind of measurement to get an image of this subsurface geologic. image of this subsurface geologic structure. As you can imagine that uh if you have different uh geologic structures uh the measurement you take as uh on the ground will be different. That's why it's it's possible uh uh to get an image of this geologic structure. And similarly you can use this ultrasound waves to get an image of humans body tissue. Uh mathematically this kind of problem Uh mathematically these kind of problems uh can be formulated uh as uh inverse problems based on some PDE models. And uh very simple model is this acoustic wave equation and the C is the wave speed. And at different locations you might have different wave speed so this C is actually a function. And the reciprocal of this wave speed is the index of reflection, a reflection. And the inverse problem is that Problem is that uh uh we want to recover the coefficient in the interior of some object, but you can only take a measurement of the wave field uh in the exterior of the object object. You can only take the measurement uh away from the object or on the surface of the object uh but you really want to recover the material properties in the interior. Uh that's the difficulty for this kind of problem or for all of inverse problems. Of inverse problems. And based on this simple model, there are a lot of work. Both theoretical and numerically, there are a lot of work. And I am mainly interested in the inverse boundary value problems for this kind of wave equation. That means uh uh the measurement uh we are taking is on the surface of the object of uh the boundary of the o object. The boundary of the object. So we can consider this initial boundary value problem. Omega this n is a boundary domain Rn and the initial value is always zero. That means we cannot have interior sources. And the boundary value is of this Diric line type. And the inverse problem is we want to determine the coefficient C in the interior of N from n uh from the boundary measurement and the boundary measurement is uh usually uh modeled uh as this so-called directly to neuman map. That means you can impose uh an arbitrary Diriclai value F and you measure its corresponding Neumann value. Okay? That means uh you have all the Diricle and Neumann pairs on the boundary. And uh we are only making measurements on the boundary. Making measurement on the boundary, but we want to recover the coefficient in the interior. Or, in other words, we really know the graph of this linear operator. And for this kind of problem, for the proof of uniqueness, the most powerful method is this boundary control method. It's invented by Berry Chef and Kurilev. And it heavily depends on the unique continuation principle for this wave equation. Principle for this wave equation and this unique continuation principle was actually proved later by Tataru. Okay, now let's assume that the wave speed depends also on time. So this is a time-dependent coefficient. Or more generally, assume we have this Lorentz metric in this space-time domain, and we consider this wave equation. And we can ask the same question. And we can ask the same question, can we determine coefficient C, the time-dependent coefficient C, of the Lorentz metric from this Diricleton normal map? And this problem is much more difficult because of the time dependency of this coefficient. And in general, this problem is still open. And that's mainly because we don't really know whether the unique continuation principle is true or not. With this time, depending on With this time-dependent coefficient. And up to now, all the equations I showed to you, they are just linear wave equations. But in practice, many waves depict very strong non-linear behaviors. For example, in this ultrasound image, people can use the waves at this frequency Fc as incident waves. But after probably Uh but after propagation people can really observe uh waves at double the frequency. Okay. If the wave is purely linear the waves after propagation should uh still be at the frequency Fc and this new wave at double the frequency is generated uh by the nonlinear interactions of the waves. Okay. That's one example of nonlinear behavior of waves. Here's another example. Here's another example. Uh this elastic material and rocks are typical elastic materials. And uh if you send in two elastic waves in two different directions and then you can observe a new third wave traveling in a new direction. And this newly generated wave uh is also because of the nonlinear interaction of elastic waves. Waves. And this nonlinear behavior of a wave can actually be very helpful in solving inverse problems. The first mathematical treatment might be this paper by Curie Leflassas and Ume. They studied this semi-linear wave equation and the non-linear term is quite simple. It's a quadratic nonlinearity. And they studied the problem of recovery. Uh they studied the problem of recovering the Lorentzian metric G from this so-called source-to-solution map. Uh as I already mentioned earlier, if you don't really have this nonlinear term, you have this linear equation, the problem is still open. But with the help of this non-linearity, they can really solve this inverse problems. Okay. That means uh they use the non-linearity in an essential way to solve the inverse problem. That means uh the non-linearity helps you. Helps you. And after this paper, there are quite a lot of work in the study of inverse problems for non-linear hyperbolic equations, including a lot of work on semi-linear equations. And the more physical models include the Einsteins equation and the Young-Muse equation. And the Ting and Yilan, they are really pioneers in this direction of research. But most of the work focuses on Most of the work focuses on this open manifold. I'm more interested in manifolds with boundaries. Okay, let me give you a very naive explanation about why this non-linearity might help you. So for an inverse problem you have a system, but there is a hidden parameter there. but there is a hidden parameter there. And you want to know what this hidden parameter is. So what you can do is you uh give the system different inputs and uh test uh its uh responses. And then you can use all these uh input and uh output correspondences uh to uh determine what's the hidden parameter in this linear system. Assume you have tested the input F1, you get the response. You test the input F2, you get You test the input F2, you get uh another response. And of course you can take a superposition of this S1 and S2 to this system. But because the system is uh linear, you immediately know that the output must be a superposition of these two outputs. That means if your linear system uh uh if your system is linear, in our case, if your Declared Neumann map is linear, this third uh test doesn't give you more information. You have more information. But the story is completely different if you have a non-linear system. Or your PD model is non-linear. And this third output, this third test with this input, the output is in general not equal to the superposition of these two outputs. And if you are studying the forward problem, this nonlinearity will be a Problem, this non-linearity will be a bigger trouble to you. But for the inverse problem, that might be something good. This means that the third test uh could give you new information. And uh the inverse problem uh uh for inverse problem uh if you have uh more information uh it's always uh a good thing. Okay. Okay, now let's uh go back to waves. Yeah, yes, video please. Yeah, so Okay. Let's uh consider the non-linear uh behavior of the waves. Assuming you have this uh three uh exincendent plane waves. If the wave is linear, this uh three plane wave will travel independently. Okay. But uh if you have some non-linear intersections, after these three waves uh intersect, will it will uh yeah again that picture. Oh, okay, yeah, again, that picture that video again. Yeah, uh, yeah, the first video again. Oh, the first video. Okay. Uh no, diga, diga, diga, definitely. Okay. Okay, they yeah, it will generate a new wave. As you can see, this newly generated wave is a corner. Generated wave is a cornic wave, and this new wave will bring out some new information. Okay, so now let's assume we have four waves and of course every three of them will generate cornic waves, but there will be another new wave. It's caused by the intersection of four waves. As you can see. Of four wave. As you can see, it's a spherical wave. It's because of the intersection of four wave will generate artificial point source. Okay, yeah, go back to the slides. I think these two videos are the videos what Ijan wanted to show you the other day, but he couldn't do that. Couldn't do that. Next slide. Next slide. Okay, okay, can't do that. Yeah. Yeah, that's why the nonlinear nonlinearity of the wave phenomenon can help you in solving immersed problems. Because of this newly generated wave can really bring out some extra information. And mathematically, we can use this high order linearization technique. For example, we can take a linear combination of different inputs. Yeah, if assume we have n inputs. And all these epsilons are small parameters. And uh then we can use the asymptotic uh behavior of this uh uh output as all these epsilons goes to zero. So this is essentially uh perturbation. So this is essentially a perturbation argument. And so rigorously, we are taking the higher order derivatives in all these epsilons at this epsilon goes at this epsilon equal to zero. So if your system is a linear, if this lambda is linear, this higher or the derivative is zero and it doesn't give you anything. But if this lambda is uh non-linear, This lambda is non-linear, this high-order linearization is not zero, and it will give you information. And this, well, the first order linearization actually goes back to Isakov, and the second order linearization goes to Swin and Women in the 1990s. And uh it was uh the recent work that began to use this higher order linearization or multi-linearization in a systematic way. Systematic way. Okay, so uh well let's go back to inverse boundary value problems we are considering. Uh the first uh uh nonlinear equation is this. We consider it uh in uh on the Lorentz manifold. G is a Lorentz metric. And uh it's a semilinear wave equation and the nonlinear term is uh of this uh Taylor theory. Okay. Theory. It has a Taylor expansion, but as you may notice, that this k starts from 2. And yeah, we want to determine all of the Taylor coefficients from the boundary measurement, the stereotype of Neumann map. And we need to assume that the geometry is not so complicated, so we assume there are no conjugate points on this whole Lorentz manifold. Lowering the manifold. Yeah, we are considering the space dimension 1 plus 3. And of course, all the coefficients we assume they are smooth enough. And because of the finite speed of propagation, at best we can expect to recover the coefficient in a domain like this. And uh assume that uh the measurement type is that the measurement type is capital T. Uh we cannot recover the coefficient here because the waves traveling from this boundary cannot uh reach this region. And the waves starting from this region cannot uh arrive at the boundary before this uh time capital T. Okay, and uh we prove that uh uh the boundary measurement the directly I to know in my mind. Measurement, the Dirichlet Norman map can actually uniquely determine all these Taylor coefficients in the domain of determination. Okay, for the second equation, the nonlinearity is the form is much simpler. We have this fourth outer term here only. But for this problem, we also want to determine Problem we also want to determine the Lorentz metric G. So the purpose of this inverse problem is to simultaneously determine both of these two coefficients, the Lorentz metric G and the non-linear parameter A. And we need to assume that uh A is non-vanishing. If uh A vanishes, it's essentially a uh linear equation. So for the linear equation, uh the problem is uh much harder. Okay, this is Okay, this is our result. Uh assume you have two sets of coefficients and their corresponding directly to normal map are equal. And you can prove that these two metrics might be diffeomorphic to each other, and also there is a conformal factor here. Well, the diffeomorphism is quite natural if you have a If you have two metrics that are different to each other, they must give you the symmetric item, a map. And there is also this conformal factor here. And this non-linear coefficient also might differ by the same conformal factor. But we also know that this conformal factor satisfies this wave equation. And the and the the Cauchy value of beta on the boundary actually vanishes. And uh this result is uh actually optimal. If you have two sets of coefficients uh uh with this relation you can prove that they're derived to normal map or uh diricly to normal map are exactly the same. Okay. But we cannot really conclude that uh beta is equal to zero from uh this equation and this boundary condition. And this boundary condition. If you have a unique continuation principle, you can conclude that beta is equal to zero. But the problem here is we don't really have a unique continuation. And if we have a unique continuation, the linear problem we can solve. We don't really we don't even need to use the nonlinearity to solve this problem. So up to now, at least up to now this problem this result is optimal. Okay, uh you know since we are dealing with uh uh manifolds uh with boundaries, uh one technical difficulty might be that if you send out some wave from the boundary and uh the wave will travel inside uh this domain but it will be reflected uh after it uh reaches to the boundary and it uh after multiple reflections uh the wave will will become very very complicated. will become very very complicated in the interior. And because we don't really know the metric in the interior a priori, so we don't really know how this waves travel inside this manifold. And this multiple scattering might be become very difficult to control. But we can really remove this reflection using our measurement, using the Dewey Clinton number. Our measurement using the Diricletonoma map. If we have the Diricletonoma map associated with this non-linear equation, we can immediately get the Diricletonoma map associated with the linear equation. And this linear equation depends only on the metric G. So assume you ascend in waves from this boundary point. Assume you ascend in some Yeah, assume you ascend in some plane wave because the space-time structure is now curved, this plane wave will actually be distorted. So it's called the distorted plane wave. And we don't know how it travels, but we can find the location of this first reflection point. And according to the measurement, or according to the Dirichlet-Neumann map at this point, we can engineer some boundary sources here. Some boundary sources here, and this boundary source here can remove this reflection. So, what you can do is you can engineer some boundary sources using our measurements that generate this distorted plane waves without any reflection. That will make our analysis much easier. Okay, let me quickly give you the sketch of our proof. So first we can recover this metric at the boundary from this linear arise Diriclephonoma map. And then we can use the non-linear interaction of four distorted plane waves. And if these four distorted plane waves, they intersect at some point in the intersection. intersect at some point in the interior, it will generate a spherical wave. This will be an artificial interior point source and it will generate a spherical wave. And this spherical wave will arrive at the boundary at different time. So essentially you can have a subset of the co-dimension one subset of the boundary associated to some interior source, some interior point. And the difficulty is you can only measure this site and this site is called the earliest boundary light of the efficient site. The difficulty is you don't really know the location of this point. So for any interior point, you have this earliest boundary light observation side. So you can measure a lot of this kind of co-dimension. A lot of this kind of co-dimensional one sites. And you want to use all these observation sites to recover the metric in the interior. And of course this is a much difficult problem, but it's proved by Hinz and Wuhan in 2009, and this is possible from this earlier star boundary light observation site. You can recover the conformal structure of the metric. The metric. Well, the diffeomorphism is always a natural obstruction, but there is also a conformal factor that you cannot determine at this stage. Okay. And the next step, so the last step we only use the location of the singularities to record the metric, but now you can uh analyze the principal symbol of these uh spherical waves. of these uh spherical waves generated by the nonlinear interaction of four waves. From the principal symbol, you can uh recover the nonlinear coefficients uh up to the same conformal factor. And if you want to determine the conformal factor uh you really need to use the sub principal term. That means the principal term is not enough, doesn't include uh contain enough information about this conformal factor. But the subprinciple terminal Conformal factor, but the sub-principal term contains some information about the conformal factor. And here for the analysis of sub-principal terms, we don't really use distorted plane wave, we use Gaussian beam solution. I will come back to this later. And from the sub-principal terms, we can conclude that this conformal factor satisfies this wave equation. So this is actually the best result we can expect. We can expect. Remember, all these coefficients are time-dependent. Okay, now let's go back to more practical problems. So now the coefficients are time independent. And this model is actually a good model for ultrasound acoustic waves. And there is a non-linear term here. As you can see, the non-linear term is the same. Can see the nonlinear term is the second order time derivative of a quadratic term. And if you don't have this term, it's just the standard acoustic wave equation. I think everyone is familiar with the equation without this term. So this is a quasi-linear wave equation. And C is the wave speed. And the beta is a non-linear parameter we want to recover from the boundary. We want to recover from the boundary measurement. This is the Diricleton on the map. So the problem is much simpler because the node coefficient is time-independent. Okay, so this is our result. So this um wave speed uh induce some uh remaining metric. Okay. And uh we need to assume this remaining metric is non-trapping. metric is non-trapping, that means the length of this all the geodesics fully contained in this bounded domain is the length is they are finite. And we assume that the measurement time is large enough, that is because the finite speed of propagation, if the time is is too short, the wave might not reach to every point in the interior of the domain. Okay. And we also need to assume some convexity condition Assume some convexity condition of this boundary. And of course, this concept of convexity is related to the metric of the wave speed. And we need to have some geometric conditions, geometric assumptions on this wave speed on the metric. So either of these two conditions holds, uh is it good enough? So the first condition is that uh uh this is that this manifold is simple. That essentially means that you cannot have remaining conjugate points. Or it admits a strictly convex function. And of course its convexity is related to this metric or to this swift speed. And well this looks like a very technical assumption, but it's satisfied. Assumption, but it's satisfied. Well, if you are manifold, it's simply collected, and if you are the curvature is a non-positive or non-negative, it satisfies this condition automatically. And either of this condition, if either of these conditions holds, we can prove that this Dirichlet-normal map determines these nonlinear parameters. Okay, for the proof, the proof. Since we have a quadratic nonlinearity, we do a second order linearization of this measurement, this direct ital map. So this F1, F2, F0, they are boundary sources. We take a second order derivative of this Dirty Client normal map applied to the superposition of these two inputs and then multiply by this F0 and then take the integral of and then take the integral uh over the surface. And uh then you use the integration by part you get this identity. This boundary integral is equal to this integral in the interior. This u1, u2, u0, they are solutions to this linear wave equation as you can see. This linear equation there's only this coefficient c, but this wave speed is already known. So if you are given So uh if you are given F1, F2 and F0, you can fully determine U1, U2 and U0 in the interior. And this F uh this F, this boundary source is uh can you can impose uh them arbitrarily. So this is also something you know. Uh that means in this identity the only unknown thing is this uh this coefficient, uh the non nonlinear coefficient, the beta in the interior, okay? Coefficient beta in the interior. And this identity relates the boundary measurement to this unknown coefficient in the interior. So the next step is the general strategy is you construct special solutions to these linear equations and then substitute these special solutions into these identities and try to direct useful information about this non-linear coefficient beta. Okay, so this. Okay, so this U1 and U2 are the solutions for the forward wave equation and U0 is the solution to the backward equation. And the special solution we used here is actually this so-called Gaussian beam solutions. And we need to choose three Gaussian beam solutions. They travel along the same trajectory. same trajectory and this trajectory is actually some non-geodesic in this Lorentz geometry. That means the energy of this Gaussian beam solutions they are concentrated near this trajectory. And you can really think this Gaussian beam solutions as some traveling wave packets along this trajectory. And the projection of this non-geodesic Projection of this non-geodesic, of this trajectory, is actually remaining geodesic in this manifold, and this remaining manifold, remaining metric is induced by this wave speed. And user U1, U two they actually travel uh forward, you know, along this uh uh trajectory, but uh U zero they travel backward. Yeah. They travel backward. Then we insert this kind of special solutions to this integral. Then the whole integral over the integral over the whole space-time domain will reduce to some integral along this non-geodesic. This curve in this space-time domain. And then it further reduces to some integral algorithm. To some integral along this Riemannian geodesic. And since we can choose this trajectory of this geodesic optually, that means we can have this kind of line integral along an arbitrary remaining geodesic connecting two boundary points. So the final step is to invert this kind of line integrals. Assume we know this kind of line integral along any geodesics and then you want to recover the coefficient. And this kind of line integral is some weighted integral of this coefficient beta times c to the power of three halves. And the weight is of a very special structure and actually satisfies some Jacobi equation. So this is called the Jacob equation. Uh Jacobi equation. So this is called the Jacobi weighted rate transform of this uh uh of this function. And uh unfortunately this kind of Jacobi-weighted rate transform is invertible. Okay, so you can really invert this retransform uh to recover the F. And since the C is already known, then you can uh recover this beta. Okay, that's for the West-Wild equation. So the So the last equation I want to show you is this non-linear elastic wave equations. Here we actually have a quasi linear hyperbolic system. U represents the displacement of this elastic uh material and uh this uh U alone is a vector. So this is actually a couple system. This is actually a couple system. And this S is the stress tensor of the elastic material. And well, now we assume this stress tensor has this non-linear form. And yeah, these terms are linear terms. And if you ignore this non-linear term th you win you will end up with some uh the the the linear elastic wave equation. I think uh probably somewhere uh probably someone familiar with linear elastic wave equation. But now we want to include some nonlinear terms. The quadratic term is of this complicated form. But we ignore the even higher order terms. And this lambda and mu are called the Lame parameters and ρ is the density of the elastic material. Well in the la in the linear elastic wave equation there are only three parameters, lambda Three parameters, lambda m and zhou, but when we include this nonlinear quadratic term, there are three new nonlinear parameters appearing here, A, B, and C. And yeah, the problem is similar and we measure the Diricleton normal map because this uh equation is nonlinear, this Diricleton normal map is also nonlinear. And uh we want to recover all of this uh We cover all of these uh six parameters. And this nonlinear model goes back to Goldberg in 1961. Okay, here is uh our results. Uh you know in this uh elastic material there are two different waves, the S wave and the P wave. The P wave is also called the longitudinal wave and the S wave is called the And the vast wave is called the transverse wave. And they have two different wave speeds. And the two wave speeds are determined by the ratio of lambda mu and zhou. And lambda mu and zhou, they are linear parameters. And these two wave speed will induce two remaining metrics and these two remaining metrics conformally. and these two remaining metrics are conformally uplated. And still we need to assume that the measurement time is large enough. And also we have some convexity condition on the boundary. And the we need similar uh geometric assumptions here. So no matter with respect to the S wave or to the P wave, wave out to the P wave, this remaining manifold is simple, or it admits a strictly convex function. And then we can prove that the Dirichlet Neumann map determine all of these six parameters. Well very fortunately we can uh determine all of these parameters. And uh here we actually use the non-linear interaction of two waves. Okay. Two waves. And because we have two different types of elastic waves, the nonlinear interaction of elastic waves could be very complicated or it could be very rich. Well if you have nonlinear interaction of two P waves, it won't generate a new P wave, but it will generate a new S wave. That's why we couldn't really use the non-linear non-linear Really use the non-linear interaction of two waves uh for acoustic wave equations because it only has uh have one wave speed and the non-linear interaction of two acoustic waves uh will not generate a new acoustic wave but uh the the elastic wave is uh quite different. Okay. Uh two P wave doesn't generate a new P wave but it will generate a new S wave and uh two S wave will generate a new P wave. And uh all of course you can also And uh all of course you can also take one P one P w uh one P wave and uh uh one S wave. So the nonlinear action the nonlinear interaction of one P wave and one S wave will generate uh both new P wave and uh S wave. Okay and this rich uh behavior of nonlinear interaction of elastic waves can actually help us in solving this uh non-linear problem, uh nonlinear problems. Okay, and uh of course And of course we cannot recover all of these six parameters at one time, right? We need to break it into different steps. And the first step is actually the recovery of the ratio of lambda mu and zhou. So if you know the ratio of lambda mu and zhou, you essentially determine the wave speed. And that's the idea of this first step. So the first step is actually. First step. So the first step is actually you recover the wave speed. And uh the result is uh known for this uh elast uh linear elastic wave equation and uh we can directly use that uh result for linear elastic wave equation because if we have the Dirichlet Neumann map for the non-linear equation we can also know the Diracleton Neumann map for the linear equation. Okay, so this uh is actually the already known result for linear elastic wave equation. For linear elastic wave equation. And this problem actually reduced to this so-called length rigidity problem. This is a very difficult geometric inverse problem. But luckily, we are only dealing with this scalar case. We are not dealing with the anisotropic problem. But the scalar case, the result is already known under our geometric assumptions. And it might seem quite seem quite uh s uh surprising uh because is a linear parameter but uh we really use the non-linearity to recover this linear parameter. Okay, so this linear parameter zhou and two non-linear parameters A and B will recover three of them at the same time. And the recovery of C is C is a little bit different. For the recovery of rho A and B, we can have a point-wise recovery. But the recovery of C, we cannot really have a point-wise recovery. And the recovery of C is quite similar to the recovery of C. Uh uh to the recovery of the non-linear parameters uh uh in the Westwalter equation I already mentioned earlier. And uh for that uh you need to invert this Jacobi weighted rate transform. Okay, so following these uh three steps we can uh recover all of these uh six parameters in this elastic wave equations. Okay, okay, I think uh I will stop here today.
