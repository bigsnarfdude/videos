Discuss small time asymptotics first of the classical Schrodinger problem, which I obtained together with Giovanni Conforti. And in the second part of the talk, I will instead present the same small time regime, the same results in the small time regime for a more general and purely metric formulation. Purely metric formulation of the Schrodinger problem introduced and studied with Bernhard Montsen-Jean and Dmitry Forotnikov. So, for this reason, the talk is divided into two parts, essentially. In the first part, I will introduce the Schrodinger problem since this is the first talk, so I cannot rely on previous talks that have already given, I have already said what the Schrodinger problem is, and so forth, and so far. And so far, I will resume some basic results and review the literature that studied the convergence of Schrodinger problem towards optimal transport. And then I will state and prove the second-order Taylor expansions for the entropic cost, namely the optimum value of the Schrodinger problem towards optimal transport. Transport. And looking at the proof, it will be clear that this is, in fact, a particular instance of a more general fact, which motivated me and my co-authors to introduce this metric version of the Schrodinger problem. And therefore, I will discuss the setting, the metric setting for this variational problem. Problem and also provide interesting examples that are covered just to motivate to compensate somehow the purely abstract approach that still covers interesting and concrete examples. And in the final part, I will state and prove the results also in this abstract framework. So let us start with the classical Schrodinger problem. I decided to give the Give the definition, which, in my opinion, is the closest one to the one proposed by Schrodinger in his seminal paper in the 30s. And it goes as follows. So Schrodinger suggested the following thought experiment. Assume that we have n independent diffusive particles evolving according to this SDE. According to this SDE, so of diffusive type, we denote by mu tn the empirical distribution at time t of our cloud of particles. And then, by the Sanov theorem, we know that if n is sufficiently large, the probability that the initial configuration of our system is close in some sense to a given probability measure mu is exponentially small. Is exponentially small as a function of the Boltzmann entropy of with respect to M, which is the invariant measure for this SDE, and in the same analogously for the final configuration, of course. Still, by virtue of this SD, we expect that if we observe our particle system at the initial time. system at the at the initial time and see that it is distributed more or less like μ, then we expect the final configuration to be close to p epsilon mu, where p epsilon is the Markov same group associated to this SDE. But if on the other hand the final distribution is some probability measure ν different from p epsilon ν then some macroscopic fluctuation some Fluctuation, some unpredictable event occurred while we were looking at the system. And the four Schrodinger asked the following question: What is the most likely, the most probable evolution that lead our system from the initial to the final configuration? And in order to answer to this problem, we still argue by sign-off-like arguments and look at the probability of the At the probability of the joint event of the initial and final observation. This probability is again exponentially small, but this time the function that determines the smallness is no longer the Boltzmann entropy, is a new function that we call entropic cost and is defined as this variational problem, which is the Schroedinger problem. So here we were. So, here we want to minimize still the Boltzmann entropy, but with respect to the law on the path space of the whole process. And we minimize this Boltzmann entropy among all path measures with initial, with final. Yes? Do you mind if I jump in? There's a question in the chat. Okay, sorry. I do not see it. I had the same question. The question, I mean, somehow the question is, I mean, somehow the question is: Are there some initial conditions? I mean, somehow your very first statement by Senov's theorem says the probability of the initial distribution being something is something else. But aren't the, isn't there some initial condition on the STE? Well, okay, I take this distributed test uniform. So, okay, for the initial, how to say, wait, no. Wait, no, I don't. I mean, if you impose the both condition, then you get exactly this. No, I mean, this, I think it's since here you have standard Brownian particles, so you expect that they are sampled with uniform distribution. So yeah, you expect uh wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Thank you. It's Christian. Hi, Christian. Well, because of the relative entropy with respect to the equilibrium measure M, then this means that at the initial condition, you play identically and independently this load, the equilibrium at the very beginning. So you impose an initial. Sorry, you impose an initial condition, or the equation forces an initial condition on you? This means simply playing this IIED sequence with M, you can observe mu, which could be a launch deviation event. Ah, okay. So that's how you determine the initial condition. Okay, so that's how you determine the initial condition. You sample from the equilibrium distribution initially? From mu. You sample from the equilibrium distribution, but you observe mu. So even at the initial time, you can have a large deviation event. And this costs you the entropy. You can have a large deviation event because n is finite at the initial time. Is that right, Christian? Absolutely. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. And of course, the probability is exponentially small, you see. I see. Sorry. Okay. With this definition of true problem, we can actually see precisely because our SDE is of this type, so all particles. Of this type, so all particles are independent. This dynamical trigger problem reduces to a static one. Static since we pass from the path space to just the product of two copies of our state space. And here we minimize the Boltzmann entropy among all couplings between mu and nu with respect to the joint law at initial and final time of our process. And looking at this static version, the link with optimal transport appears. Since, for instance, if we take u equals zero in the previous SD, so we just have pure Brownian particles, then there is scaled Schrodinger problem. We see it behaves essentially as an optimal transport problem plus a regularization term, which A regularization term, which forces the coupling P to be somehow spread and regularized. And this has been observed first by Mikami and then studied even further by Mikami Thionon and generalized by in the most possible abstract framework by Leonard, which proved that whenever the ref the measures are zero epsilon. Measures R, zero, epsilon satisfy a large deviation principle, then there should be a problem gamma converges to optimal transport to the optimal transport with cost function given by the rate function. So in particular, for Brownian particles whose rate function is the distance squared, we have this veer of order convergence. And since Schrodinger problem turned out to be Should your problem turn out to be extremely useful in numerical applications, it became natural to look for improved convergence rates and so to look at further taber expansions. And the first order one has been studied in the sense of gamma convergence in this series of papers and to complete the picture in the point-wise sense by Sumik Pal. sense by Sumik Pal. Even if, I mean, his work is much more, works for a much more general class of reference measure, R0 epsilon. But still, focusing on the quadratic case, together with Confoti, we obtain a second-order expansion. So we improve the previous results. The previous results in a twofold sense, since we passed from the first to the second order, and also we passed from purely Euclidean results to ours, which holds in actually on weighted Riemannian manifold and actually even beyond on so-called RCD spaces. And what we proved is that there is scale entropic cost that meets this Taylor expansion, and the second, the term that appears. And the second, the term that appears as second-order expansion is the feature information of the vast angeles between mu and mu. And how it is possible to conjecture this second-order term? The starting point is this variational representation of the entropic cost of the Schwabino problem. Also, here in this case. Also, here in this case, there have been several papers that studied this topic, first in the Euclidean, then in more general settings. Well, this result tells us that the Schrodinger problem can be seen as a sort of fluid dynamical variational problem, a la bene-mounier, where we minimize a functional, which consists of a kinetic part plus a perturbation. Plus a perturbation, which is given by the fissure information. And therefore, as you can see here, we have the somehow the first order term that appeared already here. And since here the scaling is epsilon squared, it's somehow natural to conjecture that this is the term that appears later. But how to prove this rigorously? Well, let me first introduce a further quantity that which will play an Quantity that which will play an important role, which is and also has a physical interpretation in the Schrödinger problem, which is the total energy of the system, which is expressed, which is, I mean, it can be interpreted as an energy, since it is easy to see that it is the Hamiltonian associated to this Lagrangian evaluated along the critical, unique critical curve. Curve. With this ingredient at hand, then what we noticed together with Giovanni is that the entropic cost is regular as a function of epsilon of the diffusion parameter, and its first derivative is linked precisely to this energy. And this can be proved rather easily by using the envelope theorem. Envelope theorem. With this identity, then the second-order expansion can be proved as follows. First of all, by fundamental theorem of Kaltus, we just integrate this identity between zero and epsilon and get this first line. Here, H0 and H1 are just shorthand notation for the entropy of mu and nu. And then we use another fact which is Another fact which is easy to check, which is the monotonicity of the feature information, more precisely the fact that it is non-increasing as epsilon increases. And this allows us to immediately get the upper bound, which is this one, the desired one. While for the lower bound, we argue again by monotonicity of feature information. So here we Of feature information. So here we bound from below the feature of rho tau by the feature of rho epsilon. And then we prove that the feature information is continuous at epsilon equals zero, which is instead a rather technical point and relies on refining convergence properties of the entropic interpolations of rho t epsilon of the. Of rho t epsilon, of the minimizer of the Schrodinger problem in the dynamical form to the geodesic, Waserstein geodesic between mu and nu. And by means of this continuity, we can replace this feature information at epsilon with the feature information at zero plus some error term. And this concludes, as you can see, the proof. But in the proof, what we really use In the proof, what we really used beside this trivial, beside algebraic manipulation, what we really used is this variation, dynamical variational representation of the Schrodinger problem. So, for this reason, let me now introduce the metric generalization of the Schrodinger problem. And how does And how does it treat? Well, first of all, here we recognize in the Benamo-Brenier formulation of the entropy cost the Wasserstein speed of the curve of measure, μt, while the Fischer information is nothing but the Wasserstein gradient or Wasserstein slope of the Boltzmann entropy in the autocarbon. In the autocalculus sense. So we can introduce this variational problem. And by means of, so this kinetic functional kinetic energy is replaced now by the squared speed of a curve gamma. And the fissure information is replaced by the metric slope of a given functional E on a metric space. On a metric space. And we denote the optimal value of this variational problem by C epsilon. Although here there is a slight gap between the previous notation. So this C epsilon is the rescaled entropy cost for the classical Schrodinger problem, just to keep in mind for the future statements. Okay, so this is how the problem we are. How the problem we are interested in looks like, and which are the set of assumptions we impose on the metric space and on the functional E in order to get some reasonable theorem to prove. As concerns the functional E, the most demanding assumption is the existence of an EVI lambda gradient flow associated. Start associated to it, starting from any point of our space. While the metric space X is a polished space equipped with a sort of weak topology, sigma, such that bounded metric bounded sets are sequentially sigma compact, and in addition, both the distance and the slope are sequentially lower semi-continuous. Sequentially lower semi-continuous. Why do we assume this existence of EVI Lambda flow and why do we ask the existence of this precise notion of gradient flow since the metric framework there are several options? Well, this is the strongest one and in particular entails many regularizing features that will be all of them will be Features that will be, all of them will be crucial in the following. In particular, EVI gradient flows are lambda contractive. They are gradient flows. I mean, they are curve of steepest descent in this sense. So the speed coincides with the slope along the curve. And they immediately regularize any initial data. Any initial data into the domain of the slope. And moreover, we can also quantify in an a priori way the slope of E at gamma t in terms of the initial data. Okay, this might look quite abstract, of course, but also maybe too demanding assumptions. For instance, the existence. Assumptions. For instance, the existence of this weak topology can be might be might look demanding in applications, and also the existence of an EVI Lambda flow. So just before stating the results obtained with Mont Saint-Jean and Voghotnikov, I would like to present to give three main examples which are covered by which fall within this class. And they are the following. Luca, can I ask? Yes. Luca, can I ask a question? Yes. That Evi Lambda flow, am I supposed to think of them as those lambda convex functionals on the Washistin space? Is that the idea? Yes, I mean, yes, Evi condition is stronger in particular. So yes, it implies lambda convexity. I see. Yes. Thank you. And so the first example is the recently introduced. Is the recently introduced mean field Schroedinger problem? So, here this problem has been introduced by Bakov, Conforti, Gentiles and Lonard as a generalization of Schrodinger's original thought experiment in the following sense. I mean, on the one hand, in the Schrodinger problem, all particles, the underlying particle system. The underlying particle system is made up by independent brown diffusive particles. So, from a physical point of view, this is quite restrictive, as in many applications, instead, particles are allowed to interact. So, for this reason, the underlying particles are now allowed to interact through this pair potential. And with this change, at the level of At the level of Schrödinger problem, the modification is the following. This particle system still satisfies a large deviation principle, but now the rate function is of this form, is this Boltzmann entropy, but now the reference measure is no more fixed. It depends on the argument in the path measure we choose as argument. Or the path measure we choose as argument in the following way. So, gamma q, the reference measure as a function of q, is the law of the unique strong solution of the McKinnblas of SDE, which reflects the interaction behavior of the underlying particle system with initial sampling of this kind. And this variational program, I mean, its optimal value. I mean, its optimal value is the mean field entropic cost. In the same paper, Bakov, Conforti, Gentile, and Leonard proved that this variational problem admits, under this assumption, this Benamouberny-like formulation, and up to expand the square, you see that it is precisely of the form we desire. The form we desire, since we have a quadratic part, a kinetic part, and something which is we recognize as the slope of this functional E. So if we choose as metric space the Wasserstein space with this functional E, for which the existence of the EVI gradient flow is ensured by general results proved by Mbozzo Gi and Savare in their book, then it is sufficient to take. Then it is sufficient to take as sigma nothing but the narrow topology. And all the previous assumptions are satisfied for this example. Another one is represented by internal energies. A notable example of them is the Reni entropy. So here we are in the on Riemannian Riemannian manifold with post-non- Any Riemannian manifold with non-negative rich curvature. We take a function u satisfying this condition, in particular satisfying McCann's condition for some n greater than the dimension of the manifold. Then this internal energy satisfies the previous assumption. In particular, there exists an EVI0 gradient. I zero gradient flow associated to it. And for this choice of U, we recover the Rainy entropy. And once again, as sigma, as weak topology, we just take the narrow topology. So again, in the application, there is a very natural candidate for sigma. A third example, third and last example, I would like to change the I would like to change the metric. So, replace the Wasserstein distance by a class of non-linear distances induced by non-linear continuity equation introduced by Doibeau and Sarai and Savaren, which somehow changes the geometric interpretation of the Wasserstein space. So, we move from the, I mean, Wasserstein distances related. Passerstein distance is related to autocalcruz. So here we introduce a different cell, the Riemannian norm on the faster genes. And once again, on P2 equipped with this, now with this distance, and again for internal energies described in the previous slide, we get We get we are again able to see that all the assumptions mentioned before are satisfied. And the interest in this third example is the fact that this class of distances are best fit, are better somehow if one wants to study the hydro they are somehow linked to naturally linked to hydrodynamic limits of uh lattice gases. Of lattice gases for lattice gases. So this somehow opens the door to a Schrodinger-like approach also to new particle system somehow. Okay, after this motivational part, let me now state the results obtained with Lenard Montsen-Jean and Dimitri Faux. Lenard Montsaint Jean and Dimitri Forotnikov. Well, first of all, we proved that the metric Schrodinger problem is solvable under mild assumptions, which are very natural as they are the natural counterpart of the same conditions under which the classical Schrodinger problem is solvable. And first of all, we prove that. We prove that this perturbed functional, this perturbed kinetic energy, plus the complex indicator of the marginal constraints, gamma converges to the geodesic problem, so the unperturbed kinetic energy. And I state it as a sort of Moscow convergence, since we are able to prove since the gamma Liminf holds. Lim inf holds for this weak convergence, so the pointwise in time sigma convergence. While for the gamma lim soup, we are able to prove to build a recovery sequence which converges uniformly in time and strongly in space to a given curve between X and Y. Moreover, as a good gamma convergence. A good gamma convergence theorem. We have enough mild equicoercivity to prove convergence of the optimal values and up to some sequences, weak convergence of minimizers. And how do we prove this result and also the well-posedness of the problem? The most difficult part is the gamma-lim super in the gamma convergence. in the gamma convergence theorem. Well, for both points, for well-posness and gamma-lin-sup, we strongly rely on the regularization properties of the EVI flow for which we assume the existence. The idea is here depicted. Given any curve gamma, we apply the vertical direction, we apply the EVI flow. Here we apply the EVI flow for a certain time h t so so that we obtain the curve gamma tilde, which is the diagonal here. And then in order to control in a quantified way the energy, but also the slope of E along the diagonal, we just argue by triangle inequality. And in the horizontal direction here, we use Direction here, we use the fact that the EVI flow is lambda contractive, so we can estimate gamma hat in terms of gamma. While here in the vertical direction, we are moving essentially along an EVI flow, so the regularization behavior is even higher, is even better. And this allows to prove, to build a regularized version of gamma, since gamma tilde. Gamma, since gamma tilde is not only, I mean, of course, it is still absolutely continuous, but also the energy along it is regular enough for our purposes. And arguing by this triangle argument, we are able to obtain this inequality, this explicit control, that as you can see, is the one is sufficient to One is sufficient to obtain the conclusion. Since here we have passing to the limit as t1 minus t0 goes to zero. Here we obtain the speed of gamma tilde. Here we obtain the slope of e along gamma tilde. I forgot to say that t plus, t minus here are just fancy notation. They are just either t1 or t0 depending on which if h t1 is If h t1 is larger than h t0 or the other way around. But so it's not so, I mean, it's just a fancy notation. But in the end, here we obtain a speed and slope of E along gamma tilde controlled by the speed of gamma, of our initial gamma. And this term gives a total derivative so that when we integrate then between zero and one, we get And one, we get this bound. And this allows us to get at the same time well-posedness and gamma-in-sub-inequality. Since for well-posedness, it's just sufficient to remark that this right-hand side is finite. So we can apply standard compactness and Ascoliatz-La argument to prove the existence of a minimizer. While as epsilon goes to zero, Well, as epsilon goes to zero, we precisely get the gamma-Ninzukian equality as this right-hand side reduces to the kinetic energy of gamma. So, as stated before, here, in particular, we have that this metric entropic cost converges to the optimal value of the geodesic problem. Basic problem, which is, I mean, if the space is length is nothing but the square distance between x and y. So, also in this framework, we can ask ourselves which is the speed of convergence. So, we can try to obtain a Taylor expansion for this convergence. And the result is the natural generalization of the one stated for the classical Schrodinger problem. For sake of simple brevity, let's just define I as this surrogate, this generalization of the feature information. Then what we prove is that, again, we have a second order Taylor expansion, so we have the same approximation, same precision, and the second order term is nothing but what we can expect. Term is nothing but what we can expect. So is the generalization of this metric framework of the feature information. And in particular, we can also say something on the minimizer of the geodesic problem that we select by gamma convergence. Since given any sequence of minimizer omega epsilon of the epsilon metric Schrodinger problem, then there exists some omega star. Omega star to which omega epsilon converges weakly. And this omega star has minimal feature information among all geodesics between X and Y. And how can we prove this? Again, we rely on the derivative of the cost of the Schroedinger of the entropic cost. So we prove that. So, we prove that the cost is regular enough, even if, in this case, due to the lack of uniqueness of the minimizer, we cannot prove C1 regularity. We have something less. We just have absolute continuity, but we have pointwise left and right differentiability with explicit formulas for them, and this is. Is okay. Just a side remark. Okay, again, in order to prove this, the idea is the envelope theorem, not surprisingly. And you can recognize these identities as the natural generalization of the formula written before for the classical Schrodinger problem. In that case, we had that the derivative of the cost was the energy. Of the cost was the energy minus the energy, which reads this way. So that taking into this gap, this slight gap between this metric entropic cost and the classical entropic cost, we see that the derivative of the rescaled classical entropy cost exactly gives is of this form. So throwing away this part, which is not present in our Is not present in our metric problem. We just get a pure fisherial information term as a derivative, which of course here is maximized and minimized since there may be more than one solution for the Epsilon-Schroding problem. Okay, with this identity at hand, again, we can prove by the same technique the Taylor expansion. The Taylor expansion, since by fundamental theorem of calculus, we have this identity. Okay, so here there should be an S so that by monotonicity of the generalized feature information, we immediately obtain the upper bound, which is the desired one. And to get the lower one, again, we first used Used the monotonicity in the opposite sense and then argue by, I mean, one has to replace the continuity of the Fisher information at zero that in the case of the classical Schrodinger problem was obtained by a previous result proved together with Nicola Gigi. Gigi, Nicola Gigi. Here we just use gamma convergence of use the gamma convergence at any epsilon of this metric Schrodinger problem and we are able to to deduce the continuity up to epsilon equals zero also of the Fischer information. And therefore, we can again replace this infimum over the minimizer of the epsilon. Over the minimizer of the epsilon Schrödinger problem with the infimum over the minimizer of the geodesic problem plus an error term. And this concludes the proof and also the talk. And I thank you for your attention. Okay, thank you, Luca. Are there any questions?
