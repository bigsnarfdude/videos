I will introduce a technology, a very recent technology in some of our work. And based on this technology, I will talk about the potential, what is the translational potential for this technology in precision medicine, looking at diseases. And also, for many of you, what is the potential of integrative analysis? So, Hong Yu, I touched on that thematic word on how we can actually bring together this new technology together with genetics. So, I don't have the solution, I'm more like. So, I don't have the solution, I'm more like probably throwing more ideas than anything, but feel free to talk to me for collaboration afterwards. So, introduction of the technology. So, this is the first part of the talk, we talk about single cell, and nowadays single cell has spatially resolved information. Now, Vesium has been something been around where you have multiple cells per spot. Okay, it's new, it's the nature method of the year in 2020, but four years after. But four years after that, we are actually talking about subcellular transcriptomics. So, this new technology now are not only measuring multiple cells per spot, but they have multiple measurements per cell. So, we are looking at around 150 transcript per cell is the kind of data. Now, most of this data actually have matched histology information on it. What drives this is a lot of oncology research in cancer. Oncology research in cancer, and we see that the trade-off between these two platforms. Obviously, HE is very much in clinic. There's tons of this information out there. It's easy to obtain the standard existing clinical pathway. This is like the other extreme, right? It came out only about a year ago and it's got a lot of potential, but extremely expensive. So, can we get the best out of both worlds? Out of both works, and so a lot of work is seeing. So, one question people ask is: Can we predict, you know, is there any chance, or is this just a dream world to get from histology to omics information? And so, back in 2020, there was a paper to look at: we can do this by deep learning. And you're going to ask, why is it important? The important Important. The important reality is we have a huge amount of HNE alone out there. And the concept is: if we have only a small selection of this information that's very deeply phenotype, could we build a model that when we actually use in practice, we don't utilize this. We only, the model will be transferable and we can unlock the potential of histology out there. Histology out there. And if you can unlock that potential, could you get better? And there's no guarantee that you'll be better in actually understanding diagnosis or even subtype of disease. And I just want to say how much that's out there. You talk about different types of biomedic. There's also histopathology collection. So here's a paper from Journal of Pathology Informatics that talk about publicly available breast histopathology HNG images. HMG images. There's tons of them publicly available out there with various levels of implantation associated with it. And so the question I initially asked is: what are the solutions out there and how good are the solutions? So what are the solutions out there? We embark on a benchmarking study. It's quite crazy. Just within the last 12, you know, maybe one and a half years, huge amount of method. And this is where I sometimes use statisticians left a little bit behind. Just look at the methods, right? Just look at the methods, right? It's like CNN, then GN, then Transformer goes in, and it's like the CS was beating each other with every architecture that they can perform. But no one actually looked at how useful it is. They use a correlation metric to judge this thing, which I found really unsatisfactory. So I decided to ask my student, and I have to say, I asked multiple students, no one students will need to do this job alone. And then aside, you can tell me that most of this method we took a month of one student's time to be able to reproduce. This is the slight challenge in computational world these days. So we managed to get 10 of the methods working on our hand and we actually applied this to the TCGA data, 600 slides to see how they did in looking at the survival analysis. So we set up a Analysis. So we set up a very extensive metric. This benchmarking paper is on bio archive. So I just want to get to the conclusion of this. The conclusion is when we put it on the breast cancer TCGA data, looking at HER2, TM, BC, and Luminal, we found that some of them could actually, when you stratify a high risk, low risk, show discrimination potential. Others don't. And it's actually a bit of a mixed. And it's actually a lot a bit of a mixed bag, so there's a bit of a signal, but not consistently. There's no methods that consistently outperform, and fancy deep learning don't actually beat this classical CNN method that's actually up there. So that was the quick conclusion. We also realized that all those were developed on the Spock base, which is multiple cells per Spock. So my team decided to embark on trying to utilize the latest technology. The latest technology, which is multiple information per cell, to see whether we can refine. Because now we are modeling between the morphological information of the cell to the expression of the single cell. You're matching cell to cell, not cell to a collection of cells. So here we take information or loss function associated with morphological structure from the HNE. Structure from the HE, cell type information, the neighborhood of the distribution information into account, and is a fairly simple and total information to actually get out this information. And so we built a model and what we did is obviously we took the same TCGA data and we predict single-cell spatial expression of the TCGA data. The TCGA data, and then you can see at this point you could bring this information back and create a sort of imputed modality for TCGA. So we tried a breast cancer, only a small selection. I have to say, this is GPU, really intensive. Look for GPU collaboration. But what you can do is you can take HNE, this is the measured cell type, this will be our predicted cell type. Predicted cell type. And so I think in our, and we tried it on NAP, we tried it on melanoma, and just on the cell type proportion alone, we do capture the cell type quite well. But evaluation needs to be a lot more. So this method is actually on bioRxive at the moment. We do a lot more testing and validation of the method, but I felt that wasn't the focus. I didn't want to make that the focus of today's talk. To make that the focus of today's talk. So, I encourage you to talk to me to find out about this method and the bio archive to look at how we actually fully evaluate this. But I thought what was more interesting is what can we do with this data going forward? So, today, if I have these resources, what kind of question we can answer? So, before I bring the genetics in, which is the last part, I just look at when we apply to TCGA. When we apply to TCGA data, what kind of question you can ask? If you have 92 samples, of course, you can now partition them into the various cell type. So that's not even taking spatial information, you'll get partition of the cell type. Note, we don't work well in every one of them. We were very lucky. A breast pathologist actually worked with us in grading over the quality of the HIV images in the breast cancer. The breast cancer. And we got a sense of if the great weren't too good, if they are overstained, understain, and so on, the prediction absolutely don't work. But for the really good quality ones, we were able to do reasonably well. So what kind of question one can ask with this kind of thing? You could actually find cell type-specific differential expression. So for ER positive, PR positive versus ER negative, PR negative. ER negative, PR negative. We were able to look that macrofashion, stroma cell type. There's, you know, you can see there's a slight difference in expression. So now we could unpack this information and you could also unpack the information among ER positive and PR positive. You could unpack them into maybe new subtype of information. Visually, it looks like there's a bit of subtype of information, but this is just cell type. This is just cell type. You put in all this effort, I look at the patterning and I seem to be throwing the information away. No, this is just more like sensibility check. We can calculate spatial statistics. I was actually thinking from this morning's talk about the fMRI data, what makes this very different from fMRI. fMRI, you got coordinates. You sort of know where in the brain region. The problem is, The problem is the x and y coordinates do not match between all these individuals. You can't just put in an x and y into your regression. Hence, for every image, you have to construct spatial relationship metric. I didn't do anything new. I went on to spatial geo, that is 20 or 30 years ago, look at what people have done there, take some of the metrics such as L statistics, for N's I, nearest neighbor correlation. So we just implemented a few to see. A few to see what is, you know, what can we gain from it. Let me just talk about the spatial metric. So you could see what this metric tries to capture is do you have things that split apart, right? So maybe two types of cell type that never interact with each other. Or that in the two types, they are really interacting with each other. So then, you know, this kind of high values often means that you have a lot of mixture. means that you have a lot of mixture, low value means you're very segregated. Different statistics actually capture something different. But you can then ask, instead of using gene expression, I use this kind of statistics. Am I able to discriminate these two? Well, cell type you can split because that is how we define the two groups, right? So surprisingly, the bulk RNA-seq data found Bulk RNA-seq data found nothing different between these two groups. That was really interesting because we don't match RNA-seq in TCGA. Didn't find anything, but Spatial managed to capture something a little bit more. And so that brings into a concept that we use a lot. It's a standard strategy we use. Cross-validation, something we use training very often in machine learning. Very often in machine learning, and often we do repeated cross-validation to get the error rate. But here, I don't use repeated validation to get the error rate, but I look at create individual specific accuracy. So this is a way to unpack how a model can affect individual. Do the model work well with every individual? The answer is no. Every single model that you give out works for Model that you give out works for selected individuals, and we call it the classifiability of an individual. And so, if you compare different input of different individuals, you may find something individual that everything works really well. So, whether you use bulk information, cell type information, or neighborhood information, it all works really well. But you will also find individual as you look into this where you know cell type. You know, cell type don't capture that information, but the information is in the neighborhood pattern. It's very small amount, but if we care about giving the best care to every single individual, we have to start considering how can adaptiveness bring it into the biomarker discovery. So, this is an illustration of how this can be used. And finally, I know I'm here with the potential. I'm here with the potential of integrative analysis. This allows us to ask the question: you know, I do the GIST, I got this in silicon data, I can capture the spatial statistics, I can also bring in SNPs, CNV, copy number alteration information and ask and look at the relationship between two. Potentially even look at things such as spatial QTL. So I did something. So, I did something that I've done many years ago. I just re-look at it this way. I look at copy number aberration in TCGA data among these hurdles positive. And I actually, for every single individual, I look at, let's partition the data that has CNA gained and CNA lost. And then I ask, among these people with CNA. Among these people with CNA gain and CNA loss, what genes shows differential pattern? So what I put in is not differential expression. Because I got this neighborhood metric, I just change the input data. And so I can do the standard thing that you have done for a DE analysis, except now it's a differential patterning analysis. If I put all that information on the chromosome, this is the This is the average copper number variation. Because of the data, I can only look at selected region, not quite the whole genome. And I look at the number of genes that really changes at a single area. And you can detect little hotspot. And I call this differential patterning hotspot. And we look at these three areas. And what was interesting is one of the areas around this chromosome A region. Around this chromosome A region, if you look into the literature, these are actually sort of known, this is known hotspot that affect risk of post-prostate cancer and many other cancer, including breast cancer. So showing potential information, a lot more work needed to look into this area, but I think it gives you a sense of what kind of question one can actually ask. One can actually ask associated with it. And the last illustration is: could you actually ask questions associated with known SNPs and this spatial information? So you could say, I just look at a selected number of SNPs that's already known to be associated with the breast cancer. Can I link it? You know, can I run some sort of a simple GTL analysis and look for statistics? And look for statistics where you actually show some sort of differential patterning. And you can see that these are example individuals where some of them have clear clusters. And if we choose it from the other group, then there's actually no spatial pattern. So you can actually pick that information out of this. So in conclusion, I showed a method that we do using multi-modality deep learning to sort of freak out. Deep learning to sort of predict expression from HE images. We try to illustrate the translational potential of using this for precision medicine in trying to do diagnosis. But I'd like to open and welcome discussion on analysis and modeling and ideas, a lot of things that you have done that you're doing to bought data set. Could you actually extend to do it on spatial? To do it on spatial, given these computational-derived resources, and finally, we do a lot of methodological research in single-cell, and this is sort of a collection of methods that we have done. And I'd like to thank a lot of my team and students in this area, my collaborator in computer science who does a lot of medical imaging, Dinny and Nabila, who is the breast cancer research leader of the following. Cancer research leads as well pathologists who actually help with looking at a lot of this breast cancer data and the team of Helen, Weir, and Veilade into the GISWORK. Thank you very much. And the last team have time for one short question. Have the stickers? You like the sticker? I don't have the stickers. My students have the stickers. Students have the stickers. It's remarkable that you're able to really predict the gene inspiration from the fiction data. Do you want to ask how accurate really it is? Yeah, it doesn't look that. I mean, they look all the same to me, like that in actually. There's a lot of information in the color and in the morphology. And we struggle a lot, but we actually found spatial. We struggle a lot, but we actually found spatial relationship was actually extremely important because we can exclude certain cell types or cannot occur in certain regions. So, you know, epithelial, you know, myo, you know, there are certain cell types with the neighborhood. Actually, what is really, really hard to distinguish morphology is actually T cells and B cells. So there are certain things that is easy expression-wise, very hard morphologically, and vice versa. And so we're just bringing the loss function. And so we're just bringing the loss function of both together. It's not, this is really just a first attempt at it. I would say there's a lot of room for methodological development, but I also was to my surprise that the downstream results from it was not meaningless. Like it was not random. Yeah, I think I was just a follow-up. I think I also just had an undergrad, as you said. Right, so as you said it at cell level types, it's much more to predict as far as well. But the quality of the prediction really depends on HNE. So we got someone to grade it. If it's the top grade one, we can do it very well. But when the quality of HNE goes down, then the whole thing breaks. Thanks so much again.
