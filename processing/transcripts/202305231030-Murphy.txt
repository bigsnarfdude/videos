All right. Hi, everybody. Yeah, so this talk is sort of a post-mortem on my experience formalizing the biofix point theorem. It's 14,000 lines of code, so I will not be going into a lot of depth on the actual code. But just to summarize at the top, I have a calculation of the singular homology of the spheres. And I have a proof that any continuous self-map of a compact convex. Continuous self-map of a compact convex body has a fixed point. So, cool stuff. In how many dimensions? I mean, compact convex body involves. In any dimension. In any like normed vector space, a finite dimension overall. A finite dimension. I do not have Kakutami's fixed point theorem, but you can get it from Brower. That could be another project. There is a lot of stuff that this opens up. Stuff that this opens up, right? Having singular homology. All right, so first I'm going to talk a little bit about what the theorem is and sketch out an informal proof so everyone remembers. So the way this product came to be, first off, is that I looked at the list of 100 theorems that's on someone's website, and I looked for one that hadn't been done yet, and that I thought I could do, and then I did it. And I strongly recommend this if you're looking for a project, because it's fun. looking for a project because it's one left in people party no there's like 30 i don't know there's one left in the union of yeah by the theorem proof of the second oh well i actually didn't know this had been done by other theorem provers before i did it i found out that someone had done prior explaining isabelle like afterwards um so i don't know do something whatever but yeah uh you look at the list for lean and not the list i i think so i i don't know purposes it's compound yeah It's the one that's maintained by what's the one in the union? We're on it, we're on it. Can we have that on the user tracker with first project? Also, feel free to chat in any questions. As I said, I'm not going into too much depth on some things. And so, if you're wondering, I will like. I will like that. All right, so the Broward-free point theorem says if you have a non-empty, compact, convex subset of Euclidean space, any continuous map from that to itself admits a fixed point. Fun fact, up until two days ago when I was preparing for this talk, Wikipedia had the wrong statement. It forgot to say non-empty. Yeah. But that's fixed now because someone apparently saw it and thought they should fix it. I was not magnanimous enough for that. I was not magnanimous enough for that. So, how do you prove this? It's not that hard if you have access to the entire theory of singular homology, which is what the rest of the talk is going to be about. So, first off, some general theory of convex bodies says you're homeomorphic to a ball. So, all we need to care about is balls. Then, if you have a fixed point-free map from a ball to itself, you can cook up a retraction onto its boundary. Retractions are really the same as split epimorphisms from a categorical point of view, so they're preserved by the single homology functor. The reduced single homology of a ball is zero, whereas the reduced single homology of a sphere is z. And there can be no surjection from a one-point set onto a countable set, so there's no retraction. There we go. Simple, and that's the end of the talk. Okay, I guess this is Melody talks about, did you? I guess there's now that talks about do you prove one also? Yes, okay. Yeah. And I'm going to sketch that out informally. I'm not going to talk about the lean code part, but you can find it in there. There was actually already some work done on like convex bodies, like analysis.convex or something like that. So I'll talk about that in a second. So yeah, how do we do part one? Well, I have this nice illustration. This is not convex. I'm not a good artist. Not convex. I'm not a good artist, so just pretend it is. But you take some global, right? You take any base point, that little thing in the center. That's the origin of your disk, right? Then for any point, you draw the ray out connecting your base point to the boundary through that point, and you measure sort of how far along you are proportionately. Right? So in the disk that this is homeomorphic to by this construction, the circle of The circle of radius 0.25 will have this point, this point, and this point. The circle of radius 0.5 will have that point, that point, and that point, and so on. Very geometric, and not that hard to formalize in link. The thing that was already done that made this easier for me at least was that little stick measuring thingy, right, telling you how far a point is along this ray from a chosen base point. That was already in Mathweb. So, thank you, whoever did that. By the way, do you have an intermediate statement assuming that this is star complex with this function contingent? Because I think that's all you need. No, you cannot make a circle with one by. No, no, with this function contingent. Oh, with any idea. Sorry, I'm not sure we're asking. So I think. So so i I I I just a small remark that uh proof uh naturally uh splits into two steps. First, for a convex uh compact, this function is finite and continuous, and then uh a homeomorphism is human startomatics plus continuum to a dispatch. Yeah, and I want to say the continuity part was already done, but I honestly don't remember. You can look through the GitHub if you want to see what I did. Through the GitHub, if you want to see what I did and what was already done. All right, so this releases us to the case of a ball in a dimensionally clean space. Well, I'm actually being a little sneaky here, but I don't want to talk about it. You need to think about if you have an n-dimensional convex body, it's homeomorphic to the n-ball, which means you need to have a notion of dimension for the body, and then, you know, it's not that hard. All right, so how do we do step two? Alright, so how do we do step two? Once again, this is very explicit, very geometric. I stole this picture from Wikipedia. If you have a fixed point-free map, you start with any point X, you look where it goes, and then you draw a ray and look where it hits the boundary. Should you start already on the boundary, clearly you're just going to hit that ray through that point on the boundary. And this is geometric and beautiful and whatever, but in the actual formalization, I just wrote down the formula, right? I did some. Wrote down the formula, right? I did some algebra on paper and I figured out an exclusive formula for f of x. So, yeah. The hard part of the proof is calculating the singular homology of a contractible space and of a speed. So, singular homology. My definition is actually a little different than what we saw in the previous talk. How legible is this? Talk. How legible is this? Okay, I can't change the font size, so unfortunately, I'm just a couple things to notice here. The first off is that I have community ring instances everywhere and not just rings or groups. And we'll get to that in a minute. The second thing is The second thing is, I do not use the top.toSSet functor that is in Mathlib. I use my own little custom top.toSSet prime. The reason for this is that when this official set stuff was developed in Mathlib, the convex bodies library, whatever, the analysis of convex had not been done yet. And so they did not have access to the standard simplex function. So this is something that's like. Right, so this is something that's like you have some linearly or some half-finely independent points, you look at their convex hull, and you take this, and it turns out that because we already know things about this, and because it's a subtype of Rn instead of non-negative reals to the n, it's a lot easier to work with. So if you want something to do during the talk, submit a PR to Mathlib and change that. All right. But other than that, it's mostly the same as what you just saw in the previous talk. Saw in the previous talk. I have relative singular homology. I define that with respect to any map of topological spaces, not just a topological embedding. Most of the results will only actually work for topological embeddings, but this seems like a cleaner definition. Yeah, any questions so far? Okay. So yeah, I made some questionable design decisions, as I was just saying. I used the custom topped-up tube. I use the custom topped up to a set. I think, as I said, this just should be changed in Mathlib. There should not be duplicate notions of the standard n simplex. So, do you like real or n and real best? Sorry, which should be real for this project. I like real best, I think, because it's a convex hull, right? It's something defined by a convex hole, and it's nicer to have that setting inside a vector space than it is a non-vector space. Not that space. I think that's where most of the things crop up. It's a semi-module. I know, there's still a module I ran in real. I'm aware. But for some reason, it's awkward. Something in the project ends up being a lot more convenient when you have real versus unreal. Just, I don't know. You want to add and subtract and multiply minus one? I don't know. Yes. Yes. The second part, the having a commutative coefficient ring, this is specifically because module.image in Mathwood requires com ring. If you delete those five characters, com underscore, the file will compile. And then I can delete all of the comm assumptions in my project. So another PR, if you want something to do during this talk, is to delete those five characters. You might ask why I haven't done that. I don't have a good answer. But it's not just the fact that it's community-ring. Even if we got rid of that, things are still going to be a little weird, right? Because if you look, let's say in Hatcher, right, homology is defined with coefficients in an abelian group. Or you fix a ring and then you look at coefficients in a module over that ring, right? The reason that's fixing Z, but fixing Z, you got abelian groups. Fixing Zero. Right. The reason that I didn't do that is because I would like to have homology be a functor into the category of R modules. This seemed like a thing that made things nicer to me, because from a categorical point of view, that makes sense. I don't know a good way to reconcile this. So if anyone has any good ideas about how to define significology, you know, should we do it just valued in abalian groups and then say, well, any additive functor from ab to ab lifts to R mod to R mod or something like that? To RMOD to RMOD or something like that. I don't know. Whatever you think is best. That's another answer, yeah. That's hard. Yeah. So. Probably when it gets PRING-TOME to MATLEB, it will just have a not necessarily commutative coefficient ring. Anyways, so to calculate the single So, to calculate the singular homology of a contractible space and to calculate the singular homology of the sphere, what you really need to do is to prove the Eilen-Brick-Steenrod axioms for singular homology. Any homology theory satisfying these, you can give a completely formal argument for the homology of a sphere. And some of them are easy. Right? The homology of a co-product of spaces, well, on just the level of singular simplices, you Level of singular simplices, you preserve the coproduct, and then taking the free abelian group, you'll preserve the coproduct, and so on. And that's not too tricky. For the long exact sequence, this seems like it would be a huge pain, but I have access to LTE, and they already did the snake lemma. So all I have to do is say, here's a short exact sequence of chain complexes, snake lemma. Not bad. And then the homology of point, once again, it's just like the natural medium, everything is like true at the level of space. Everything is like true at the level of spaces. The other two are nasty, right? So homotopy invariance, there's a couple. Yeah. Is this an isabelle too? Is this what? Sorry, I didn't hear the question. Is that it is a bell also? I think so. I believe so. I have no idea, but maybe one thing is whoever you're doing. Yeah, I didn't look too Yeah, um I didn't look too deeply into the projects, but I mean they proved to be our first more theorem, they cupcakes the sphere. I think there's really no way to avoid these, right? Another one that I don't list here, but feels like it has a similar flavor to me, even though it's very specific to single homology, is I proved that the zeroth single homology of a space is the free valing group of the path components. And like with an explicit basis, and that makes, or is the free R module on the path component. So that makes some stuff easier. Pecamins. So that makes some stuff easier, right? Yeah, so for homotopy invariants, there's a couple of ways to do it. For excision, there's only one way to do it, and it's awful. And we'll get to that. So some possible approaches for how you can do homotopian variance. If, like me, you learned algebraic topology from Hatcher, then you saw the PRISM operator. This is like a nice combinatorial formula where you write down a chain homotopy and then you get. Homotopy, and then you get its homotopy theory. It comes from decomposing delta n times the interval into a bunch of synthesis, right? Putting a simplicial complex structure, simplicial complex structure on that. You can also do like a categorical modern homotopy theory version where you think of it as like, you know, top has a notion of homotopy internally, S-SET has a notion of homotopy internally, S-AB has a notion of homotopy internally, right? You have your monodial structure. Your manorial structures and your interval objects, and they all work out. This is what was sort of listed in the description for this conference. I wanted to do this working badly, but then it felt too hard, so I didn't. But we really should get all of this machinery working, right? The third way, and I really, once again cannot justify why I did it like this, is the acyclic models theorem. So, this is a technique for lifting natural transformation. For lifting natural transformations on the degree zero part of some functors to natural transformations on the entire thing. I'll go into more detail on that in a minute. Basically, I really like algebra and category theory, and I really hate geometry and homotorics. I'm not making a normative claim here. This is just my own personal feelings. So, doing way more homological algebra was easier for me than thinking about the prism operator that I never really understood. Understood. Jake is shaking his head at me. He was actually the person who taught me algebraic topology, really. And he's a combinatorialist, so he's very disappointed. On the other hand... He was beaming until now. Maybe it reflects badly on him that I didn't understand the prism operator, but I was more pleasant. Anyways, oh, more complex, by the way, is the alternating. Oh, more complex, by the way, is the alternating phase map complex. Just to recall that. So the asific models theorem is this weird result in homological algebra. You can use it to establish a bunch of stuff, including the existence and inverseness of the Eilenberg-Silver and Alexander-Whitney maps. The core idea is that if you have a functor valued in modules and it's sort of pre in a very sort of Of free in a very specific sense. It's not just that every module is a free module, but that in fact every module is free on a basis generated by the actions of the functor on certain fixed basis elements. This is very wordy. Then defining a natural transformation out of that functor is the same as just giving its values on the basis elements. And so this means you can nicely inductively define maps. What does a model mean here? Sorry, I have some terminal. Sorry, model is just an object. It's an object of the domain category C. But you're thinking of them as the simplest possible objects in the thing, the things that generate the rest of the values of the functor. So, yeah, there's a lot going on here. It's not very important, but the theorem does have. But the theorem does have wider applications. You can also use it to prove that singular and simplicial homology coincide, I think, which would be another good thing to do. But I didn't. Yeah. So you can have this notion of a functor with a basis, then you can have a notion of a chain complex of such functors. If you have these, you can talk about another functor being cyclic with respect. Talk about another functor being cyclic with respect to it, which means the homology vanishes in all of those model spaces. And then, under these conditions, if you have two functors into chain complexes, one of which is based and the other is acyclic relative to that other functor, then any natural transformation on H0 lifts up to a natural transformation for F to G unique up to chain homotopy, or natural chain homotopy, which is nice. It gives you, it's very, it's kind of non-constructive. It's kind of non-constructive. It's non-constructive in that you're sort of defining things on free modules and choosing bases, but G plus means supported on degree at least zero. Yes, thank you. Sorry. Because we need to do induction. The whole point is that we're lifting from degree zero. Yeah, but it's messy. Here's the thing, though. That is wrong. That's a that. Is wrong. That is what was written in Temo Tom Diek's book, which is what I was using to write this. But in fact, you don't just need this condition for the homology of g of x to vanish when x is a model for fn, you also need it in another degree. So I successfully thrown an error in a book by formalizing things. That's like what we like to tell people you can do, right? That's the the slogan. So that's cool. Wait, so so did you give an example that shows it's wrong, I mean? Example that shows it's wrong, or yes, but I don't remember it. Okay, fine. But you also just can't proceed with the proof. Like the proof in the book uses something that it does not assume. So that's bad enough, I think. Ultimately, it doesn't matter for the application, because the homology of delta n is just zero in every dimension, but I don't know. For the homological algebraic part, it was not right. So yeah. So, yeah. For the specific case we care about, like how does this actually tell us anything about homotopy invariance? Well, a common trick for establishing homotopy invariance of like homology or cohomology theories is you just need to check that the two inclusions of x into the like zeroth level of the cylinder and the one level of the cylinder induce the same map on homology, right? Because any two maps which are homotopic are sort of compositions of these two fundamental ones with a homotopy. Fundamental ones with a homogeneous, right? And so those two maps from x into x times i, those are natural transformations. They give you a natural transformation on the corresponding singular chain complex functors. By the acyclic model theorem, to check that they're homotopic, we just need to check that they induce the same value on H0. And additionally, you know, that F is base and that G is asymptotic with respect to F. The point, though, is. The point, though, is each of these spaces, delta n times i is clearly contractible, right? And so if we can establish that contractible spaces of vanishing homology, we actually get homotopy invariants of all maps for free. And this turns out to be easier. I'm not going to go through how I did this, but it's sort of very explicit. You turn a homotopy into like a You turn a homotopy into like a contraction of the complex. All right, and yeah, as I said, this gives you the Ellen Brick-Silver theorem for modules. That's kind of neat. Once again, just like how I was saying way back when, with these three approaches, really, what I would like to do is the second one, like to prove Eilenberg Zilber, what I would like to do is to write down some explicit, you know, combinatorics of special sets and stuff with shuffle maps. But when I say, With shuffle maps, but when I say I would like to write that down, I mean I would like someone else to write it down because I don't like doing that. But quick and journey way to get the Ellenberg Zoom theorem should be like, I don't know, 20 lines. That's probably way too low. 500 lines. 500 is not a big number. All right, any questions before we move on to the last part of my talk? This is not going to last a full hour. Actually, I guess I have a question. Actually, so is what you what do you end up doing for uh contractual space, is it sort of like the same thing that you had to do for you would have had to do for this prison operator, but no, it's not. It's not. Yeah, I don't want to try and explain it out loud, but it's not. Are there any other operations that are like straightforward to define using the exhibit models theorem where you write down some other simple thing on level zero? Simple thing on level zero, and then but uh so all of the various coherence conditions for the Allenberg-Silver maps, right? So, these things are like associative and co-associative and stuff. All of that comes for free with this theorem. So, I would count that as different. I don't know. Surely there are other ones. I don't know them, but yeah. The answer is probably no, but did you look at the much more combinatorial? Look at a much more combinatorial proof that spares there? No. It's an affront. It's possibly shorter. Well, it's possibly shorter, but then I wouldn't have gotten an invite to the conference. Right, so the hard part of all of this, I mean, everything up to this point was nasty and terrible also, but the really nasty and terrible part is excision. Because to prove excision for singular homology, you need to have barycentric subdivisions. You need to have barycentric subdivision, right? It all comes down to these two lemmas, which essentially say if you have a cover of a topological, an open cover of a topological space, then by iterating very centric subdivision, you can on any fixed singular chain get small enough to land in the cover. A singular chain is said to be to land in the cover in that sense if each particular basis element that occurs in it Basis element that occurs in it has image containing a cover element. So when you take a simplex and you do barycentric subdivision on it, you multiply the diameter of that simplex by n times n plus one. Each of those little faces is going to be smaller. Iterate this some number of times. You get arbitrarily small diameters. And by the little bag number lemma, that lands you in an arbitrary cover. But I mean, it's just not nice, right? Like even writing down big. Nice, right? Like, even writing down based subjects of the vision is kind of nasty. And then I have this awful lemma, which is like, oh, if you actually do have such a setup where you can iterate a map, iterate an endomorphism of a chain complex such that you land in some subcomplex, well, then the inclusion of that subcomplex is a quasi-isomorphism. But, you know, it's just kind of very specific and grody. So the actual definition. So, the actual definition of very centric subdivision is this sort of nasty recursive thing. Yeah, it's all defined with basis elements. Right. That's what the singular chain complex basis thing is. Yeah. I do actually use the words barycenter for the center of mass. Once again, all of that stuff with like centers of mass and convex combinations, this is already in MathLib. I'm very grateful for that. Method. I'm very grateful for that. Yeah, but it's basically just this recursive construction of very centric type of vision, like you may have seen. Okay, and then Mathlib does actually have a formalization of the Lebesgue number lemma already, but it was not in a form that I needed. It's sort of stated for uniform spaces and in like a kind of awkward way to work with. So I had to fudge that a little bit. Had to fudge that a little bit. But as I said, once you have a notion of barycentric subdivision, and once you can prove that iterating it decreases the diameter, you can show applying barycentric subdivision to a given chain k times will land you in the sub complex of stuff with diameter n over n plus 1 to the k times whatever the original diameter was. Diameter was. Yeah. And then using excision, you can do sort of an ad hoc argument to calculate the homology of the sphere. You could also do it with my via Taurus, or you could do it with like showing that the relative homology of x to A for a nice inclusion A into X is the homology of the quotient space. I didn't do this because I wanted to be done with the project. I've been working on it for two months at this point, and I had to start grad school. And I have to start grad school. But another way of framing this is that there is plenty of future work for intrepid formalizers. So what to do next, apparently this is a half hour talk. I need to clean up the code base quite a bit. I wrote this in two months and I did not comment anything and I did not clean up the code particularly. I don't have any squeeze simps. I don't have any squeeze simps. It would not meet the Mathlib standard of quality. So I need to do that. And there's also some order will die. Or it will die. Yes. And I also need to fix some stuff in MathWeb, right? That thing with the model.image I was talking about earlier. There's some universe issues with some special sets. But there's also quite a lot that you can just do once you have a singular homology, right? Singular co-homology is an obvious thing that jumps out. You can prove my arbitrary. Thing that jumps out. You can prove my arbitraries. You can prove, like, what's the invariance of domain and dimension, right? There's all of these nice little theorems that you can get. Yeah, we can prove that pi n of s n is z, which would be pretty cool. We could start doing some stuff with homogeneous. What? You have pi in the base n exist. You have h n of the. Yeah. Right. But once you have the Hershey's theorem, so I believe in Mathwood, we already have. I believe in MathFib, we already have a Whitney approximation, right? Saying that a smooth map, or any continuous map is approximable by a smooth map. And so you can use that to show all of the lower homometric groups vanish or whatever your favorite way of doing that is. And then you can apply the Herswitz theorem to calculate pi i information. So that could be fun. Yeah, and look in the formula as we were talking about in the last talk. So yeah, that's it. So, yeah, that's it. I missed the bear earlier and I was only sad. They're my favourite animal. I just didn't get to see it. I would concentrate on PRing some of those easy Heraldic, the easy Ironovic feedback, because that might be very easy PRs. Because that might be very UCPRs. That would be very have you thought about some alternative approaches to the statement? Because that is what I would have expected to be the first part of this. No, I have not thought about it. I don't know any alternative approaches. I guess what I have in mind is there are analogs like in a topical model where there's necessarily much more algebraic periods in the model. What about narrative address? So as part of proving excision, I did that lemma which says any sufficient number of iterations lands you in an arbitrary cover. That is the same thing you use to prove my riotoris. So my riotoris is reachable by just a little bit of chromological altra from what we have so far. So what would be your favourite other cohomology theory to connect this to? I really like K-theory. So topological K-theory, the stuff we were talking about yesterday, that would be fun. Sheaf cohomology, I like the argument that sheaf cohomology with Z coefficients coincides. What is that argument? How far away from that? So, oh dear. Oh dear. For spaces where you have a good cover, I think what you can do is you can take, you can calculate sheaf cohomology by the check complex, and then you can basically say that that check complex is the same as the singular homology complex that you get. Like you can just sort of stare at it and see that they gave you the same thing, but up to one thing. Do you need singular knowledge? Oh, I don't think you need. Why? No. Because we have a homological algebra. Right, you can just say that it's a qualitative force. You should have singular over. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should. I really just wanted to get this done. I did not spend too much time thinking about the best way to do it because I thought if I did, then it would take very long and I would never get it. Very long, and I would never do anything. And so I did that with students and some other system. I was going to ask, you talked about relationships with Kthin. I talked about this yesterday. I mean, how much work is that? Well, I was just thinking of doing what you said yesterday. I mean, defining the characteristic classes of a. Yeah. I think characteristic classes of meat. I think it would be fun. I think it would be fun to formalize class bind spaces maybe, but that's not really connected to single homology. That's just, I like vector funnels. Do you know how far your method affinities are beyond what has been put into Method 4 at this point? No, I have no idea. When I finished this product, Method 4 was in extremely early phases, and I had not touched this code in like eight months. But you used a bunch of LTE as well. So I do use LTE. I use it for sniper. I use it for. Lemma, I use it for abelian groups being an AB5 category, but there's also just like a bunch of little lemmas in homological algebra that, like, you know, as we saw in the previous talk, are not in method, but are in, you know, probably not T. So I could not say exactly what I depend on, but it's all sort of general homological algebra that should be PR pretty easily. I don't know. All right, well, thank you.
