We start now with Sabine Berg, who will, I think, continue a bit on what we have heard yesterday and/or related to what we heard yesterday by the markers talk. And it's a pleasure to have you. Thank you for the introduction, and thanks to other organizers for organizing this week here. So, my talk is a combination of a short scientific talk and an open. Of a short scientific talk and an open problem, I will introduce the essential numerical range for linear operators and for linear pencils according to these two publications, joined to work with Marco Maletta and Christiane Tretter. And then I will show the connection to spectral pollution and then I will show you that this is all not very helpful if we look at indefinite pencils and some scary things happen there. And some scary things happened here. So Marco said that spectral pollution typically happens around the central spectrum. It's actually more scary even if you have a self-joint operator with compact resolvent, you can have spectral pollution. And I want to show you this interesting example just to warm up. We look at an operator. We look at an operator in little L2 of n whose matrix representation is given by this diagonal matrix with diagonal entries minus 1, 1, minus 2, 2, minus 3, 3, and so on. And for later on, I also would like to write it as a block diagonal matrix with 2 by 2 diagonal blocks minus n. Now, if we just Just do the trivial thing of truncating this infinite matrix to finite sections. And everything works nicely. We just uncover more and more of these blue and green eigenvalues. So everything works fine. But now I change my basis a little bit and create some spectral pollution the following way. Way within this 2x2 block of the nth block, I create a new basis, these fns and g n's, that depend on some angle theta n, even like this, where I have just fixed an arbitrary point, real point lambda. And now instead of taking the full In the full nth block, or the full span of these two, which would give me again the span as before, I just take only the linear span of fn. So I think as new subspaces, I take the previous n minus 1 2 by 2 blocks, and then from the nth block, I only take this eigenvalue. So I get an additional eigenvalue given by this. Given by this in the product of the operator, how it's acting on this fn. And you can compute that it's given by this n times sine of lambda over n. And now as n goes to infinity, this converges to lambda. And now if I take my lambda not to be in the spectrum, this will be a point of spectral pollution. It's a spurious eigenvalue. So it seems. So it seems on the real line something goes wrong. I can somehow, every real point that is not in the spectrum, I can arrange for it to be a spurious eigenvalue. And it turns out that this is exactly what essential numerical range is. It tells us where I can create all possible spectral pollution without even looking at what kind of substance. At what kind of subspaces I take, just I just look at the operator, where can I create spectral pollution? So, how is the essential number? So, you probably all know the definition of the numerical range W of T, which is a complex set, and then the essential. And then the essential numerical range. It's again a convex set. We take limits in the numerical range where the corresponding normalized elements fn shall converge weakly to zero. And then if we take the central numerical range definition also with wild singular sequences, Singular sequences, it's easy to see that the central spectrum is in the central numerical range. And by definition, this is a subset of closure of the numerical range. And now I can introduce all of this also for pencils. We looked at linear pencils, so we have two operators A and B. Later on, my P will be bounded, but for the moment, let's just assume that the domain of A is in the domain of B. And then, as usual for pencils, we define the spectrum and its various parts using this characterization that its point is in it if A minus lambda B has C. Has zero in its corresponding spectrum or essential spectrum, and then also correspondingly for the numerical range and essential numerical range. Where here I like closed set, so I take the closure of the numerical range. Yes, sure. You can tell me later if you see any problems, but for now I don't see any problems yet. So the essential numerical range still contains the essential spectrum and is contained in the numerical range, but now for pencils these sets may not necessarily be convex anymore. The counter in theorem is the following. So now I take B to be bounded. Everything is essential. And everything is still true. Everything's still true. Yeah, yeah, and then the central spectrum is in the essential numerical range, and you get problems everywhere. But yeah, so these examples are not so interesting. So for A, I assume that if I take the intersection of the domain of A with the domain of its adjoint, that this is tense, and the following my A will be self-adjoint, so this is. My A will be self-adjoint, so this is anyway satisfied. And now, if we take a sequence of subspaces to which we truncate, obviously it makes sense if they are part of the domain, and we want that these subspaces somehow exhaust the whole space. And I write this in the form that the orthogonal projection to the subspace HN shall converge strongly to the Shall converge strongly to the identity of protein. And then we assume that, okay, so this already implies that then truncations of B to the subspaces Hn converge strongly to B. And now we need some more assumptions for this probably unbounded operator A. We also have this kind of We also have this kind of strong convergence of the truncations of A to Hn converging to A, and also the same for the joint operators. So if this is true, then all spectral pollution all spirit eigenvalues are contained in the central numerical range. And also this This add set is actually, I mean, bad in the sense that all the bad things happen there. It's the smallest possible set. If we add some more assumptions to our operators, and one can prove that this is the minimal set that contains all possible spectral pollution. So the benefit of this notion. Of this notion is that you can just look at these two operators, you do not need to have specified your subspaces. You know that spectral pollution is always in this set. And only then, if the set gets too large, you may want to choose your subspaces more carefully to avoid spectral pollution. Now, this is the small. The smallest possible set that contains all spectral pollution because, under these assumptions that I will talk about in a second, if you take an arbitrary point in the bad set, there exist finite-dimensional subspaces that exhaust the whole space, such that there exists a sequence of eigenvalues of the approximate. Eigenvalues of the approximating operators or of the approximating pencil that converge to this given point. So every point in the data set that was not a spectral point can be created to be a point of spectral pollution. And these are generalizations of various other results. I mean, the second theorem, this minimality theorem. So the essential numerical range for operators, so for b equal to the identity, has been introduced in the 70s by Phil Marsh, Drumfly and Williams, but only for bounded operators. And they proved two such results. And then Levitin Chakrowski and Levin Serin proved also the operation. Proved also the operator case, but then for self-adjoint operators that may be unbounded. But because the essential numerical range hasn't been studied for unbounded operators, their theorem like this was formulated in terms of the so-called extended essential spectrum, which happens to be the essential numerical range if you introduce it for unbounded operators. Introduce it for unbounded operators. And then, so first with Marco and Christiano, we proved this for the operator case where A can be unbounded, and then with Marco we proved this formulation for linear pencils. So I have to avoid somehow that the numerical range is the whole complex plane, or that zero is Is in the intersection of numerical ranges. And it turns out that the application I want to look at for these assumptions are not satisfied. So I want to look at definite Schumerwell operators. So in the Hilbert space L2 of R. Space L2 of R. Okay, now my operators are no longer called A and B, but T and J, because this seems to be the common notation. Because J is now a multiplication operator with a sine function. And it is a self-adjoint operator. And T is also a self-adjoint operator. It's the Schr√∂dinger operator. There's a real-valued There's a real-valued pencil. And now I can either so the spectrum of this linear pencil is equal to the spectrum of J T because J inverse is just J again. I want to show you, if we don't look at the operator version JT, but at the pencil version, we run into a lot of problems. We run into a lot of problems if we try to apply the projection method. At least if our potential decays to zero at infinity. If the potential has some limits that are positive at plus and minus infinity, then it's known that the central spectrum is the union of these two intervals. Two intervals in the real line, and this is exactly the essential numerical range. So all possible, if we would use a projection method, all possible spectral pollution would be in the essential dominant range, but that's part of the spectrum, so it's not spectral pollution. But unfortunately, if B goes to zero at infinity, then Then the essential numerical range can be the whole complex plane, whereas the spectrum is the essential spectrum is the real line and there may be some discrete eigenvalues that are complex, unreal. The reason why this is the whole complex plane is that you can find a sequence. A sequence of fn's if you take fn either an even or odd function, then this inner product with j is always zero. And then you just have to arrange them such that this inner product with t is going to zero. And this is doable. So then if you look at t minus lambda j for every lambda, For every lambda, you can use the same sequence fn, and you see that zero is in the essential numerical range, and by definition, then lambda is in the hexaless numerical range. So, this is the whole complex plane. So, that's a bit worrying because we prove that spectral pollution is contained in the essential. Is contained in the essential numerical range, but that's now the whole complex plane. So when I thought of presenting this, I then had the following questions that I will partially solve because I had too much time at the written. So I wonder whether okay, so this minimal. Okay, so this minimality theorem on the previous slide, I cannot apply it because the assumptions are not satisfied, but I still wonder whether I can now create spectral pollution in every point of the complex plane. And if this is true, whether I can find some good subspaces that do not create spectral plots. So now here is a partial answer. And I show you a particular potential or a picture that I took from 2008 painted by Bernard Katelman Trunk. It's not really irrelevant that this is the potential. I just want to show you that there are examples where we have infinitely many complex eigenvalues. Here the red dots are the eigenvalues of the self-adjoint. Joint Schrodinger equation with this potential. There are infinitely many negative eigenvalues. And for the pencil in blue, you see there are infinitely many non-real eigenvalues. And then I realized that I can create spectral pollution as follows if I take If I take subspaces that consist of my eigenfunctions, which sounds crazy, because usually if you know the eigenfunctions and you truncate to the eigenfunctions, no problems should occur. But now if I take my eigenfunction fi to lambda i, and there are infinitely many, we do not know whether they form a basis, meaning whether they Meaning that they phrases. But let me come back to this in a second. If I take two eigenvalues that are not complex conjugate pairs, so let's just take the eigenvalues in the upper half plane. If I take two such eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions fi and fj, then these inner products are all zero. One can show this. My control is just using that T and J is self-joint, so there is nothing going on. I mean, I didn't use any of the particular features of these operators. But now, if I truncate these matrices to finite sections, I just have zero operator, the zero operator, and so zero minus lambda times zero always has zero as eigenvalue. Eigen value. So somehow it seems like the whole complex flames in the spectrum. So that's a bit scary. Then I thought, okay, but usually I want that my subspaces exhaust the whole space. Can I still do this, somehow construct subspaces that exhaust the whole space? If I start with some subspaces, let's assume Hn is Let's assume HN is n-dimensional and assume that this HN's colour exhausts the whole space. And now, if I just add something to the space, then for sure my new spaces will still exhaust the whole Hilbert space. And I take now as an element, Gn, a linear combination of these FI's such that Such that, so I take 3n of them because I have three assumptions and my spaces are n-dimensional. So I think I can create a linear combination that is not zero, but is orthogonal to Hn and to the range of T restricted to Hn and also the same with J. And then And then you can check that still then zero is always an eigenvalue of t minus lambda j projected to these new subspaces and therefore for each of these truncated pencils the spectrum is the whole complex plane. So it seems although I couldn't apply this minimality theorem I can prove it by hand that the Hand that the spectral pollution can be arranged to occur everywhere in the complex lane and even with using the eigenfunctions, which is a bit scary. So my new refined functions are looking at us the same as before. How can I now find better subspaces that do not give me spectrum? Phases that do not give me spectral pollution. If I happen to, so I wonder now whether either I have no spectral pollution or that the spectrum of the truncations are the whole complex plane. So I wonder if I happen to have subspaces for which the pencil spectrum is not a whole complex plane, but if somehow this immediately implies that I do not have spectral function. Maybe that's just the hope. Maybe that's just a hope. And ideally, I would like to prove something for a general method, not just for these indefinite Jou-Ri-Wheel operators, but some general self-adjoint T and J for which add certain complex lane. So, if anyone has any ideas, I'm happy to discuss them. Thank you for your. It's awesome. Thank you for your attention.
