I'm going to tell you, as Mark says, a little bit about holography and vacuum energy and a sort of collection of facts that we've learned over the last few years, which are sort of peculiar and interesting and have a few little surprises in, or at least they were surprising to me. And another reason to talk about this is that this will, you know, a lot of this work was done in collaboration with Sebastian, who's one of the key organizers. So if you have tricky questions, If you have tricky questions, you have him there and you can bug him if you're in person. But I'd like to thank my other collaborators, Gary, Gibbons, Gray, Lucas, and Andrew, who are grad students here. Okay, so let me first tell you the setup we're going to explore, and then I'll motivate why. Okay, so it's a specific setup. We're going to think about quantum field theory in vacuum. In vacuum at either zero or finite temperature. So, when I mean vacuum, I mean either the real vacuum, zero temperature, or thermal vacuum. And we're going to focus only on the one plus two dimensional case. And we're going to consider the theory on an ultra-static space-time. So, this sort of from a Euclidean point of view, we've got Euclidean time, and then we've got our space sigma, and we'll take that to be some general geometry at the moment, some general two geometry. At the moment, some general two geometry. And really, what we're interested in is how the free energy here, which is a functional of sigma, varies as we deform sigma. That's the setting. And the object we're going to use to think about this is the differenced free energy, where I have some canonical geometry. I'm going to call it sigma bar. And then I deform it into some new geometry, sigma, and I ask, how did the free energy change? Energy change. And I'll tell you why this is an interesting thing to look at. But the canonical geometries we're going to look at here are going to be either the round sphere or flat space. So sigma bar will be round sphere, flat space. And we'll think about deforming those and seeing what free energy does. Now, in the sphere case, I'm going to make an additional condition. And I'm going to require that as I deform sigma bar into sigma, I'm going to keep the area fixed. If I just Fixed. If I just scale the area, things will scale sort of trivially. So we want to fix both the temperature. We're thinking of fixing the temperature as we deform and also this area. And you might be thinking, well, hang on, in the flat space case, if I'm at finite temperature, obviously the free energy diverges because I've got an infinite volume. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to consider periodic deformations of flat space. And then I'm going to take this F to just be Going to take this F to just be the free energy in a unit cell of that periodic deformation, and I'm going to keep the area of that periodic or the unit cell fixed as I deform. So, sort of pictorially, I've got my sphere here, and I can deform it, keeping the area fixed and ask how did the free energy change? Or I've got flat space and I, and I, and I, this is supposed to be periodic. It's sort of tricky to draw, or for me anyway. So, you know, again, keeping this area fixed. You know, again, keeping this area fixed. Okay, so why? Why on earth would you be interested in that? Well, firstly, you know, vacuum energy like this is a universal property of all quantum field theories. So it doesn't matter what the operator content is, you can always ask this question, at least for relativistic theories, you could always put them on this sort of space and ask what happens. In two plus one dimensions, it turns out that this energy difference has some nice properties, and in particular, it Properties. And in particular, it's a real, it's a good physical infrared observable. It doesn't depend on how you regulate your theory. So, in particular, there's no finite term, finite counter-term ambiguities in two plus one, and that's not true in higher dimension. So, at least in two plus one, this is a real physical, well-defined object. You can regulate, remove your regulator, but however you do that, you'll get the same finite answer. Finite answer. And I want to also emphasize that, you know, these sort of two plus one theories in curved space can be given a physical manifestation in 2D materials. So things like graphene famously carry on them, monolayer graphene carries on them, some Dirac theory that governs some of the electronic structure. And if you bend the graphene, which you can do, you can deform it, you get some Dirac equation. Um, you get some Dirac equation in some curved space, and so you know, these very basic properties of one plus two-dimensional theories maybe one day they'll be accessible through actual looking at real-world materials, particularly the curved space versions. Anyway, let's get back to the sort of formal questions. And this is what I'm going to talk about. I'm going to tell you a little bit about how to compute. And really, what I'm interested in mainly is holographic CFTs here, and I think the audience probably. Here, and I think the audience probably would be. But I'm also going to tell you a little bit about how to compute these vacuum energies in free QFTs, a scalar and Dirac fermion QFT, because it's not so straightforward. At least we don't know how to do it in general. Well, we've developed some methods, let's say. I'm going to talk first then about some small deformations of the round sphere and flat space in this periodic way. And it'll, I think, raise some things that I found. Raise some things that I found surprising, my collaborators found surprising. Whether you do or not, you can let me know after. And then we'll think about large deformations and see whether some of these surprises persist. And then towards the end, what I really want to show you is a comparison between the behavior of free CFTs, so the Dirac and conformally coupled scalar, and comparing them to the hologram. And comparing them to the holographic CFTs, and we'll see a very strange similarity in behavior, which is a little bit spooky. And this is reminiscent of work by Myers and company, Rob Myers and company, where they were looking in two plus one at entanglement corner functions and again saw some very strange similarity between the Dirac theory and holography or the two plus one holographic theories. The two plus one holographic theories. So perhaps it can be viewed in that same sort of pigeonhole. Okay, so a warm-up. This is very straightforward. If you look at small deformations of flat space or the round sphere at t equals zero, for a conformal field theory, then the behavior is just universal and sort of very simple. And you can, everything's determined in terms of the central charge, because for small deformations, the change in the energy, well, it's the energy Change in the energy, that's the energy at zero temperature, is controlled just by the two-point function on the undeformed space, which you know exactly. So you can calculate everything very explicitly. It's very simple. If we deform our round sphere, this is the round sphere, if we deform it by some function here, which we decompose in harmonics, spherical harmonics, then we find that the energy, it's quadratic in the amplitude of the perturbation. That's generic for all theories for small perturbations. But in particular, it's negative. It's negative. So, for any deformation, it gives you a negative change in the energy. And so, that's perhaps a little bit surprising. It's not quite what one would expect. So normally, you might expect that the most symmetric space was energetically favored, but it's sort of exactly the opposite here. Okay, so in the CFT case, it's very simple, but what about in the general quantum field theory case and also at finite temperature rather than zero? Also, at finite temperature rather than zero temperature. How would we work there? And I'm just going to skip all the details. If you want more details, obviously feel free to ask. But focusing on the scalar or the Dirac fermions, so the Euclidean operator would be, you know, for the scalar would look like this, where we include a potential scalar curvature coupling and a mass. And for the Dirac, here we are, again, including a mass. We want to compute this functional determination. We want to compute this functional determinant and raise to some appropriate power sigma. So, sigma flips sign. We need to just bear that in mind, flip sign depending on the case you're looking at. And it's convenient to do this, to compute this functional determinant using heat kernels. And so one can express the change in this free energy as a heat kernel integral over a heat kernel time of a heat kernel here. Of a heat kernel here, or rather the difference between two heat kernels, because we're looking at free energy difference. So the heat kernel on the deformed space minus the undeformed space. And because of the static, ultra-static symmetry, you can factor out the temperature dependence and you can factor out mass dependence. And the sort of non-trivial part of the operator, which is the spatial part, contributes to this, the really interesting bit of this heat kernel here. This heat kernel here. So, this is the difference between the two heat kernels of the spatial operator, which in the scalar case is just this. In the Dirac case, you have to think a bit more carefully, but roughly the same. Okay, so we would want to compute this to see what's going on. Something to emphasize and something we're going to find is that this quantity here actually will have a definite sign as a function of t. So it's a function of heat kernel time, but for any deformation. kernel time but for any deformation we'll actually find well for all the deformations we can probe we'll find that this always has a definite sign and that means that this answer here because this quantity and this quantity are also just positive this will have a definite sign and in fact it will always be negative so we're going to learn basically that we always disfavor energetically even at finite temperature flat space or the round sphere okay how do we compute things for a holiday Okay, how do we compute things for a holographic CFE? Well, you all know this. We're going to take an infilling Einstein metric whose boundary has the correct geometry that the field theory lives on. It's convenient to explicitly write this bulk metric in the following form because it's static. There's a canonical way to pull out a sort of file factor, Z. Everything only depends. Z, everything only depends on spatial coordinates. And when you've pulled this factor, this vial factor out, this object here, this three-dimensional Riemannian geometry, is called the optical metric or Fermat metric. It controls null geodesics in the full space. But you can decompose the problem of what bulk geometries look like just by decomposing it over this space, because everything basically only depends on the spatial coordinates x. X and so, for example, this Einstein condition when decomposed in this way looks like this pair of conditions here, where this r tilde is the Ricci tensor of this metric, this optical metric. So let me call it the optical Ricci scalar. And one of the nice things about writing things this way is that what was a conformal boundary with this boundary geometry for this optical metric just becomes a real boundary. A real boundary. So the boundary of this optical geometry is just sigma. So here we are. So that's the boundary condition. So you should think of this as a Dirichlet problem where you prescribe this boundary condition and then you want to find some infilling solution to these equations, both for the G tilde and for Z. And so pictorially, maybe the optical geometry looks like this. The optical geometry looks like this: there's a boundary where z goes to zero, that's the conformal boundary of the space, and it's got geometry sigma, and there may be black hole horizons in the interior, or they may not. And at those positions, Z goes to infinity. Now, in order to calculate the energy, if you have this infilling solution, what does the energy look like? Well, you should use the usual renormalized stress tensor, get the energy density, and integrate it up to get the energy. Density and integrated up to get the energy. But it turns out that you get a nice expression for the energy. It's actually just the normal derivative of the optical Ricci scalar at the boundary. That's the energy density. And then to get the energy, you just integrate that over the boundary. So, and of course, to get the free energy, if there's some horizons, you have to include their area contribution. Now, now we've got some framework to compute in the holographic case and the And the holographic case and the QFT case, what do we find? Well, I'm not going to go through any of the details because I don't really have time, but what about finite temperature and zero temperature for non, well, for these free theories, scalar or Dirac with masses and so on, and with conformal couplings, or rather scalar curvature couplings in the scalar case, what we find is this heat kernel function, you can compute. heat kernel function you can compute it analytically for small deformations where everything's quadratic in the deformation this is this is then quadratic in the metric perturbation and you find this is always a negative function of t for any deformation and because of that then you find that this quantity delta f is always negative and that then holds for any mass or temperature in the holographic case i won't look at the sphere case at finite temperature The sphere case at finite temperature because it's a bit tricky because you have the Hawking-Page phenomenon, so at low temperature, you really should just be in it's the same as zero temperature. But at least in the periodic case, a periodic flat case in holography, you could then ask, well, supposing we just do a small deformation of our flat boundary that's periodic, that's a perturbation of the planar ADS Schwarzschild that's periodic in the boundary space directions. If I Space directions. If I think of my flat space deformation like this, decomposed in harmonics, then you get a response. Again, it's quadratic in the perturbation. And it's described by the amplitude, obviously, of the modes of perturbation, but with some function here. This describes the response. And it really just depends on wave number over temperature. And so what I've plotted here is this function a. Function A. And you see that it's got the same sign. So at low temperature down here, we're in the regime where at low temperature, we're basically just doing the zero temperature CFT calculation. We had this universal result earlier. The energy difference is negative, but it turns out it remains negative for any finite temperature because this function keeps the same sign as you vary temperature. Now, the slightly peculiar thing is the following. If you've got beady eyes, you're going to see that this is two curves. One curve is the holographic curve, and the other curve is actually the free Dirac theory. The free Dirac theory is conformal. And so again, we can normalize this in exactly the same way. This is normalized by the central charge and k cubed. I don't know if you can see that. So down here, this universal feature at zero temperature means that they have to agree. Temperature means that they have to agree. All CFTs agree there. But the peculiar thing is, as you come up in temperature, so this way, you get a rather close agreement between this Dirac theory and the holographic case. It looks quite different for the conformal scalar. Okay, so it's about a 5% variation down here fractionally and less in between. So there we are. A bit of a So there we are. Here's my surprise. Here's a bit of a surprise. Now, so there are then some questions. So, firstly, in the holographic setting, supposing we do big deformations, do we still have bulk interiors? It's not so obvious. This is the question of existence. And it's really, you know, it's something that's sort of ignored a little bit in most discussions of holography. But it's quite a, I mean, it's a non-trivial question, you know, for what boundary data? You know, for what boundary data, particularly in the static setting, it's a bit different in the dynamical setting where you know you start with some Cauchy data maybe involved, but in the static setting, which is more like a Dirichlet problem, it's not so obvious you have a smooth infilling bulk. If you do have a smooth infilling bulk, you can calculate things usually. And one can then ask: well, for large deformations in the free case or the holographic case, what happens to this vacuum energy? Does it remain that it always disfavors? That it always disfavors the symmetric space, or does the behavior change when you do a big deformation and suddenly you get to a more favored geometry? And we could ask, are there any more similarities in behavior here? And we'll make some progress on these questions, but I won't be able to answer them all. So let's think about large deformations. In the QFT, we can handle, I don't know how to handle these analytically, but Analytically, but numerically, you can compute things for specific, you know, for specific perturbations. So if we restrict to axisymmetric deformations of the sphere, so I'm just going to focus on the sphere case. The torus case is, or periodic case rather, is a bit more complicated. But for the sphere, we can restrict to axisymmetric deformations. We've got an infinite functions worth of those. And then we can compute this determinant numerically using this. Determinant numerically using this heat kernel method, which turns out to be very amenable to numerical calculation. So, for example, here are some of the geometries we've looked at. These are all constructed as embeddings in R3 by some embedding function, which is constructed by looking at the symmetric spherical harmonic. And you should think of these as being surfaces of revolution, so you should rotate them around these axes here. Around these axes here. Okay. And so there's a range of geometries here which are becoming quite extreme, if you like, a big deformation to the sphere. And this heat kernel thing function for these same geometries here, we can compute. And I think this is for the Dirac case. You find that indeed this heat kernel function for all of these is always just positive. It's a positive function of t. It's a positive function of t, and so this free energy difference remains negative. You know, all of these geometries are disfavored relative to the round sphere. So it was true for small perturbations, but as far as we've probed, it's true for large perturbations. We got a bit confused about whether, it's another surprise, we got a bit confused about whether geometries that became conical would share this property. conical would share this property because you might have thought naively well conical deficits the sort of energy density near the conical deficit you might have expected to flip sign depending on whether it's a sorry whether it's a deficit or a or an excess but it turns out that's that's not it's more complicated and it's not the case and it remains true uh for both conical deficits and excesses that this heat kernel function has its definite sign and the energy difference is always the same way. So that's for all Same way. So that's for all masses, all temperatures. Seems to be true for different scalar couplings and the scalar curvature couplings. So what about in the CFT? So in the QFT, for large deformations, we were only able to probe this numerically. Maybe someone else could do something analytic. I just don't know. I think, you know, if there are geometers in the audience still, geometers have some sorts of results. Have some, you know, all sorts of results about heat kernels. And in the end, this is really a statement about heat kernels. So it could be that one could try and prove that the free energy, you know, these heat kernels, these differenced heat kernels rather, always have a definite sign. I think that would be very interesting if it could be done. But interestingly, in the holographic case, this is one of these examples where we can actually make more progress than even in free field theory, because of this sort of beautiful geometry that the emergence. Beautiful geometry that the emergent bulk gives us. And so, a warm-up for this is at zero temperature. So, if we've got no horizons in the bulk, then both on the sphere and on flat space, the energy is zero. Okay, so that's just the case. Now, it turns out that this optical Ricci scalar obeys this very beautiful relation, which various people here have Uh, various people here have used, for example, Gary's used this in context, but it's got an old history in GR. The energy I wrote down before looks like this. So if I integrate this over the optical geometry and use divergence theorem, then what I find is the energy is expressed basically in terms of an integral of this. Now, that thing is just manifestly negative, because remember the optical geometry is just Riemannian, so this is this. Optical geometries is Riemannian. So, this is positive. And so, what we learn immediately is that given that on the sphere or flat space E is zero, what we learn is really from this that delta E is less than zero at zero temperature. And that's fully non-perturbative. That just depends on the existence of the bolt metric. So, this is much better than we could do in the free scalar or Dirac case, where we could probe things numerically, but I don't know how to prove this. Maybe someone can prove. Maybe someone can prove this in these other cases. But I think it's sort of interesting that this is just one thing I should say is that this is saturated for global ADS or Poincaré ADS. So in that case, that's when the energy vanishes when you've got the round sphere or the flat boundary. Now, what about at finite temperature? So, at finite temperature, things become much harder. Harder. And the reason they become harder is that you're looking at the energy, or free energy, then, ideally, or maybe we'll just look at the energy, the energy difference. So what we've just, what we learn, this case was somehow simple because the energy was zero on the symmetric space. And then we proved the energy is always negative. And in fact, this is saturated on the symmetric space case. Whereas if here, our starting. Whereas, if here our starting point, sigma bar, already has some negative free energy, and so it's much more complicated. And we made some progress by using a technique similar to Robinson's, some of the techniques that Robinson used to prove uniqueness of Shortshot. This is a beautiful, beautiful and complicated paper, very brief, but wonderful. You define a couple of questions. You define a couple of quantities that vanish per ADS, planar ADS. And I should say we're only thinking about the flat case here. We don't know how to make any progress where the boundary is the deformation of a sphere. So let's take the periodic deformation of flat space where we can sort of wrap it up and really think of it just being a torus. Okay, so we define the cotton tensor of the optical geometry. Now that vanishes for Now that vanishes for planar ADS Schwartz Schild because its spatial sections are conformally flat. And then we define another scalar here from this Ricci scalar of the optical metric and Z. And we define it in such a way using a function here so that this scalar vanishes for ADS Schwarzschild. And we can do that because we can always choose a function h of z such that Z such that for ADS Schwarzschild, h of z is equal to this, because the metric only depends on one radial coordinate. So r tilde for ADS Schwarzschild can be thought of as some function of z. You might worry about whether it's a one-to-one function, but it is. So you fix your temperature of interest, and then that fixes this function, and then this thing will vanish only for that bulk geometry. Now, from these objects, Now, from these objects, and there's a very complicated few steps that maybe someone very clever can simplify or do better than us, but we constructed a divergence condition or a vector field whose divergence is negative and vanishes because it's constructed from these on ADS Schwarzschild. And you should think of this as analogous to this previous result here, where thinking of the left-hand side as the Where thinking of the left-hand side as the divergence of D of the Ricci scalar, and this is saturated in the global ADS case, here, so like that, here this is this divergence is negative and saturated in the ADS Schwarzschild case. And when you integrate this quantity that we have over the boundary or over the bulk, use divergence theorem, it turns into some. It turns into some, it gives you a relation. It turns out that you can make things so that you get no contributions from horizons. So the only contribution comes from the boundary, and it's given in terms of the energy of the boundary and the area of the boundary. And what that means is that given that this is saturated for ADS Schwarzschild, what it means is keeping the area fixed as we are as we deform the torus band. As we deform the torus boundary or the periodic unit cell, then it tells us that the change in energy is negative. Okay, and in fact, is only saturated for ADS Schwarzschild. Now we're at finite temperature, so physically you would really want this result for the free energy, and we could only get it for the energy. We could generalize a little bit, but we couldn't do much better than that. But maybe it's quite complicated to get this. It's quite complicated to get this, and maybe someone can find a better way to do things. I suspect the result will hold for delta F, but we just we couldn't prove it. Okay, so finally, in the last couple of minutes, I just want to sort of give another surprise, which is a comparison of the actual quantitative behavior of these vacuum images between free CFTs and holographic CFDs. And holographic CFD. So, again, at zero temperature, everything's just universal. So, the interesting question is, well, sorry, I should say, at zero temperature for small perturbations, everything's universal. So, the question is, what happens beyond that? We're going to focus only on the sphere case because, again, I'm not quite sure how to compute in the QFT case for the flat space case. It's not so simple. It's not so simple. We're going to look at t equals zero only, and then what we have to do, I've already said how to compute in the QFT case, these answers. In the holographic case, we just have to solve this Einstein condition numerically. So it turns into some sort of two-dimensional PDE, couple PDE problem, but it's established how to do that. And it's relatively straightforward, computing the energy. Uh, computing the energy, uh, you have to be a bit clever about how you do it, but um, I won't go into the details. Again, we'll restrict: we're deforming the sphere at the boundary, zero temperature, no horizons in the bulk, so we're deforming global ADS in the bulk, and we'll do it in such a way that the boundary sphere is actually symmetric, just as we focused on in the QFT case earlier. And we'll actually look at a couple of families of geometries, the ones I showed you before and ones I showed you before and another family. And I'll just pick a parameter that parameterizes deformation. I'll call it x. When x is zero, you're just a round sphere. When it's plus or minus one, the sphere is deformed into some singular limits. So the first perhaps surprise, or maybe it isn't a surprise, I don't really know what to expect, is that at least for the ranges of X that we could compute and have confidence that we had control. And have confidence that we had control over the bulk solutions, we could find bulk solutions. And where we couldn't find bulk solutions, it was more numerical issues to do with lack of resolution and so on, rather than there being any obvious pathology in the bulk stopping solutions existing. So it's a sort of math problem. Do bulks always exist? And as far as I'm aware, there isn't currently a proof that they do, but we certainly seem to find. Do, but we certainly seem to find, we don't find any evidence that they don't exist. Anyway, so here are some of the geometries before that we can compute for. We took some other class of geometries, which are slightly, we can deform actually a bit more, but they can't necessarily be embedded into R3. But here's the punchline. What I'm plotting here, remember the energy, we're at zero temperature. So on the round sphere, the energy vanishes. So when I plot the energies here, they're really, you could think of them as delta energies. Than this delta energies. What I'm plotting is the energy divided by this universal behavior for small perturbations. Okay, so for small perturbations, remember everything's just universal. So I'm dividing out by that because that's not interesting. And so these curves should go through one when we don't deform at all. And here are some curves. So these different colors are different families of deformation. And you can see, let's focus, say, And you can see, let's focus, say, on this L equals two deformation here. Now you can see two curves. Here's one and here's another. So this curve here is the conformally coupled scalar. So this curve here is actually two curves. It's the holographic theory and the Dirac theory. And they lie so close to each other that you can't distinguish them by eye on the plot. Eye on the plot. One perhaps surprising thing is that the scalar actually is quite close to what the Dirac and holographic theory look like. So they all seem to have a rather similar qualitative nature, even though we're actually deforming the geometry quite a lot. Remember, the perturbative deformations are sort of where everything's one. So once this has moved away from one, you're doing something non-perturbative. And if you look at, for example, the scalar curvature of these deformed geometries, the maximum and minimum Because the maximum and minimum scalar curvature are maybe differing by a factor of, well, one's positive and one's negative, but they differ from the round sphere scalar curvature by probably a couple of orders of magnitude at most. Okay, so these are cirrus deformations. Here's the other family, and we see very much the same thing. In fact, for this family, for example, concentrate on this, these yellow deformations, the scalar actually looks more different to the holographic and Dirac case. And Dirac case. But again, the Dirac case and the holographic case, they just lie on top of each other to the point where you can't see by eye. This, I'm really, I'm almost finished. This is the ratio of energies of the holographic and Dirac case in the first family. And you see, actually, the variation is less than 0.1%. In the second family, you get a bigger variation up to, well, not quite. Variation up to, well, not quite up to 1% where we could control things. As you go to one, that's where the geometry becomes singular. And so we don't really know whether this diverges off or goes to some finite value. We can't compute accurately enough. Anyway, let me summarize. So we've looked at these two plus one QFTs, vacuum behavior of the free energy, and we see some universal features, which are perhaps a bit surprising. So perturbatively, Bit surprising. So, perturbatively, basically, the symmetric space is disfavored energetically at any temperature and mass for the free theories and also in the holographic case, when you're on, well, also in the holographic case. And non-perturbatively, we can prove at zero temperature that still holds. The energy is always prefers a deformed space. The holographic theories. And for finite temperature, Is and for finite temperature, we can prove the energy, although we haven't proved free energy, also disfavors the flat periodic space in the case of, yeah, for the flat space case, we haven't managed to get any result on the sphere. And non-perturbatively, numerically, in the free theories, we still see this exact same phenomenon for everything we could probe. And finally, And finally, there really, you know, at zero temperature in vacuum, at least, there seems to be this very strange similar quantitative behavior between Dirac and the holographic theory. They're not exactly the same. We know that. Our numerics are accurate to say that they're not the same, but they're very close, which is a bit surprising. And as I said, it tallies with this earlier observations of Myers and collaborators, where they found some similar things. Where they found some similar thing in 2 plus 1 between Dirac and holographic theories for entanglement corner functions. But here, yeah. Anyway, so let me end there. Thank you. Okay, so are there questions for Toby? Yeah, I guess I'd like to ask a question. So I think, yeah, hi. I think I heard you say that in the I think I heard you say that in the holographic case, at t equal to zero, both on the sphere and the torus, the energy is zero and the bulk solution is a symmetric one. But what about the ADS soliton? I mean, I thought the torus was very good. Yeah, no, no, I'm sorry. Yeah, I should be careful. What I said was, okay, very good. So, what I what I maybe I was a bit quick. When we thought about the flat case, really, I'm thinking. Flat case, really, I'm thinking about periodic deformations of flat space. So, one way to think about it is wrapping it up as a torus, and then you can always unwrap it. But I'm really thinking about periodic deformations of flat space. So, when I refer to the so if in that setting, there is no soliton, of course. When you take the torus, then you have a choice of boundary conditions because you really have a compact cycle, and that's where you have the soliton. But here, if you like. But here, if you like, we're always talking about the periodic boundary condition case, which you can unwrap to a periodic definition of flat space. Yeah, thank you. I guess I had a question if you took ADS-CFT seriously. Yeah, I was wondering if. Yeah, I was wondering if you would see the existence of these infilling geometries as some kind of a prediction. I guess it's not really a prediction because you could have stringy stuff that happens for some deformations, but it's almost like a prediction that because you can ask the question about a CFT, there should be sort of a gravity way to answer the question, maybe suggests. Maybe suggests the influence of geometry should exist, but I see. Yeah, I mean, I think the question is, I think that the real question is, can you always ask, can you always phrase it as a gravity question? And it's far from obvious to me. In the end, this is a sort of, it's just a classical geometry question, and mathematicians have. Question and mathematicians have certainly looked at this: whether infilling Einstein metrics exist for prescribed boundary data. And I think there are results that they do, but I think as far as I'm aware, and I'm very happy to be corrected on this, they're usually for, you know, they show that in some neighborhood of, say, the round sphere, you can find an infilling geometry. But as far as I'm aware, there's nothing that says how big that open set. That open set is, and of course, it might be quite small. And there's certainly no result that says for any smooth boundary you can infill. And I think it's a very interesting question because, of course, the behavior, you know, you could transition to this highly quantum bulk behavior if there was no infilling geometry or maybe sort of dominated by rather singular saddle points or something strange. So I think, yeah, it's something that probably, yeah, we probably. Yeah, we probably shouldn't assume infilling bulks always exist. I don't know. But at the end of the day, it's a geometry question. But maybe if. For these infilling geometries, if you think about some regulated gravitational action, do they minimize or maximize or are they extrema? Do you know what the type of extremum they would be? Well, I mean, the Euclidean action, I guess, gives you the free energy. Yeah. Right. So, yeah, I'm not sure. They're stationary points of the free energy, but the Euclidean action is famously unbounded below as well. So, yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. Other questions for Toby? Well, if I could ask another quick one. I was just curious: when you pick a deformation and compute the energy increasing the deformation, does the energy just continue to go down? Or is there some minimum and comes back up? No, it's monotonic. It seems to be monotonic. It's not so obvious. It's not so obvious as I've plotted things because I've divided. Obvious is: I've plotted things because I've divided by this perturbative behavior, which scales basically like x squared. But it does turn out that when you fold that back in, these curves all look like sort of not quadratics exactly, but approximately quadratic. And so, yes, seem to be rather monotonic. Yeah. So maybe the, yeah, I mean, the sort of, I think, very interesting question is why this vacuum behavior between two plus one holographic theories seems to be so rather similar to Dirac. And maybe there's other observables one can compute which show these same features. So this entanglement corner function of Myers and et al. And now this whole range of geometric deformations. Maybe there's Geometric deformations. Maybe there's, you know, you don't expect that from ADSTF. You don't expect quantitative sort of close agreements. But for some reason, it seems to, at least the things we've studied, seems to look that way. Okay, well, if there are no other questions, I'm going to invite everyone again. Invite everyone again to the coffee brick. I put the link in the chat, and let's thank Toby once more.
