Speak at this wonderful workshop. It's a pleasure to be here and to talk about a joint work with my PhD supervisor, Alexander Feliou, which is about Descartes Rule of Science for hypersurfaces. Firstly, let me briefly recall the classical Descartes Rule of Science. Almost 400 years ago, Descartes told us that a universal Descartes told us that a univariate real polynomial cannot have more positive real roots than the number of sign changes in its coefficient sequence. On Monday, we have seen already a possible generalization of this theorem for polynomial equation systems in the sense that if we have a polynomial equation system in n variable and in n polynomials, then we wish to have an upper bound for the number of positive real solutions of this equation system. Equation system. Today I like to suggest another possible generalization of TechAr rule of science, and this generalization is based on the following observation. So in the one-dimensional case, whenever we have an upper bound for the number of positive real roots of the polynomial, then we have automatically an upper bound for the number of connected components of the complement of the zero set. And vice versa, once we have an upper bound for the connected components, we will have upper bounds for the number of. Components, we will have upward balance for the number of real zeros. So, based on this observation, we call the following problem, Descartes rule of science for hypersurfaces. Here we consider a signomial function. A signomial is just a fancy word for a polynomial with real exponents. But I like to use this word signomial because it expresses that we restrict the domain to the positive order of R. And we wish to have an upper bound on the number of connected components of the On the number of connected components of the complement of the zero set given by f, where the signomial f takes negative values. So, in these three examples, we have here one negative connected component, here also one negative connected component, and in the last example, we have three negative connected components. And these are predicted by take out cross signs in the one-dimensional case. So far, so good. But why do we care about such a generalization? Care about such a generalization? Why do we care about the number of negative connected components of the complement of the variety? Well, our motivation comes from chemical reaction network theory. And if you haven't heard about chemical reaction network yet, then let me very, very briefly introduce chemical reaction networks to you. So, in each chemical reaction network, you have a finite number of chemical or biological species, and they are interacting in a finite number of reactions. Finite number of reactions, and each reaction has formed something like this: an arrow between two positive integer combinations of the species. And the goal of the chemical reaction network here is to model the change in the concentration of the species over time. And in this model, it's given by an ordinary differential equation system, usually. And usually, the entries of this ODE are polynomial maps. So, if you are asking for equilibrium points, you are basically just studying a polynomial. Equilibrium points, you are basically just studying a polynomial equation system. And while we were studying these chemical reaction networks, we associated to each reaction network a signomial function Q with the property that if we know that the pre-image of the negative real line under Q is connected, then the parameter region of multi-stationarity of the associated reaction network is a connected set. If you have no idea what the parameter region of multi-sessionarity is, never mind. Just keep in mind. It is, never mind. Just keep in mind: if we can answer this question, then we can say something about the reaction. You might say that this question is not that difficult. I mean, this guy is just a semi-hydropower set, and we know that there are algorithms describing the topology of the semi-hydropower set. Well, the real life is not so nice and easy, because even for this relative small reaction network, for this two-site phosphoridation system, the corresponding System. The corresponding signomial looks something like this here. And this guy has a few additional terms like this here and a couple of others. So for this reaction network, the corresponding signomial has 15 variables and 400 monomials. So, you know, our love methods from assembly algebraic geometry all look like it fell. And that's why we came up with studying decarbural science. With studying the car rule of science for hypersurfaces. And of course, for our application, we wanted that this upper bound on the negative connected components is equal to one. So we can conclude that this set is connected. Let me go back to the classical case. So for which sign pattern can we guarantee that the number of negative connected components is equal to one or at most one? Well, we only have three different scenarios. Different scenarios: one when we start with positive coefficients and then we end up with negative ones, or the other way around, or we start with positive coefficients in the middle. We have some negative guys, and we end up again with positive coefficients. So, our main goal was to generalize these three cases for multivariate polynomials, multivariate sequence. Well, how can we do that? The first result is as follows. The first result is as follows. So, if we have a signomial function in n variables, and we know that there is an n simplex p such that the negative exponents of the signomial, I say I call an exponent negative whenever the corresponding coefficient is negative. So, if the exponents with negative coefficients, also the negative exponents, are in the industrial x p. In this n simplex p and the positive coefficients are in this p up, then we know that the pre-image of the negative realign is pass-connected, this picture here. So we know that the upper bound for the number of connected, negative connected components is equal to one. Let me tell you what this p up is. This p up is basically the union of these opposite cones, and each opposite cone is associated to a vertex, and we just take And we just take the supporting hyperplane of the simplex, of supporting hyperplanes which are containing the vertex associated with this opposite cone, and we just reverse the inequalities. So this opposite cone is on the other side of this supporting hyperpendent displays. So far, so good. Actually, we came up with this name opposite cones because we had no better idea. We studied the literature and somehow. Literature, and somehow it seems that no one has expressed it in these opposite terms. But if you know a better name for these guys, then please let me know. I will be very happy to hear about that. Okay, and let me also sketch the proof very, very briefly. The proof is based on the simple observation that whenever p is the standard simplex, meaning spanned by the standard vectors and the origin, then we know that the signomial f. Know that the signomial f is actually a convex function. And if p is not the standard simplex, then using monomial change of variables, we can translate everything to the case when the simplex is the standard simplex. So we know that the pre-image of the negative realign in this case actually homeomorphic to a complex set. Okay, this theorem has basically two issues. One, it's not It's not that easy to decide computationally whenever an n-simple XP with these two properties exists or not. It's not impossible, but you know, it might take time. And the second issue is that even if this describes everything that happened in the one-dimensional case, so I mean, it describes all the cases where we can guarantee that the number of connected components is a number of negative connected components is at most one. It does not describe everything in the multiverse. Describe everything in the multivariate case. For example, we know that if the signomial has only one negative coefficient, then the pre-image of the negative relies on pass constant side. And if you look at this example here, this signomial has one negative exponent. And in this case, it is impossible to find a simplex P such that negative exponent in the simplex and in the opposite cones are the positive exponents. And it is. And it is impossible, let me say, because these positive exponents are equally distributed about the sky. Okay, what else can happen in the multivariate case? In the multivariate case, we can also have that we have a hyperplane separating the positive and the negative exponents. So on one side of the hyperplane, we have all the positive exponents of the signomial, and on the other side, we have all the negative exponents. And on the other side, we have all the negative exponents. And if we have that situation, then we also know the pre-mage of the negative realized pass. Okay, and notice that to decide whether such a separating hyperplane exists or not, you just have to solve a bunch of linear inequalities. And as Maurice mentioned in his thought, you know, solving linear inequalities or solving linear algebra problems or linear optimization. Problems or linear optimization problems, it's easy. We love that because we can do it quite easily. And in a minute, I will show you how efficient it is. But let me tell you two other things. So the proof of this theorem is basically based on the proof of the simplex theorem that I showed you before. In the first step of the proof, we forget about the points on the separating hyperplane. So in this case, we would forget about this. So, in this case, we would forget about these two points. Then we know that we can hide the syntax with these two properties above. So, we know that the pre-image of this modified, modified by forgot these two exponents on the hyperplane. We know that the pre-image of the negative line under the modified signal meal is connected. And using the normal vector of the separating hyperplane, we just push everything to this modified field. So, it's really based on the simplex theorem. But if we consider this example here, in this case, we cannot find a simplex P such that negative points in the simplex, positive in the opposite tones. Why not? Well, this positive exponent is contained in the convex hull of the negative guys, and it is not a vertex. So, there is no chance to find a simple X with these two nice properties. Okay, let me go back to. Okay, let me go back to the applications. So, remember, before I showed you this two-side phosphorylation network, it was a huge polynomial in 15 variables and 400 monomials. And we could find a separating hyperpin in 0.3 seconds, which I think is pretty fast. And even if your signomial is larger, it has 21 variables and 18,000 monomials. For this reaction network, we also found a separating hyperpinning lesson, which I think is, you know, quite. Which I think is quite powerful. But let me go back to the Descartes rule of science. So far, we have only seen scenarios where the upper bound was one. Well, here is a case where we know that the upper bound of the negative for the negative connected components that was two. And this is the case when we have two parallel hyperplanes such that the positive exponents are between these two hyperplanes and the negative exponents are on the two other side. So before I finish, just let me summarize what I showed you. Just let me summarize what I showed you. So, what do we know so far about Descartes rule of science for hypersurfaces? Where we have four cases: one, when we know that the exists a simplex that contains the negative exponents and the positive exponents are in the opposite cones, or if the signomial has only one negative exponent, or when we can find a separated hyperplane. In these cases, we have upper bound equal one. And very recently, we showed And very recently, we showed that in these cases, the negative connected component, in fact, is a contractible set. So it's not just, you know, it's not just connected, it's in fact contractible. And in this case, we know that the upper bound for the negative connected component is two. So let me finish at this point. And here are some references. Thank you for your attention.
