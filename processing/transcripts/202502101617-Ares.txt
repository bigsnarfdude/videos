The next talk by Filipper to Aaron is about uh dynamics of the symmetry in random quantum space. So thank you very much. Uh it's a pleasure to be here in beautiful bank. I would like first to thank the organizers for putting together this very nice event and give me the opportunity to present our work here. So today I would like to talk about the time evolution of symmetries in random unitary circuits, quantum circuits. This is based on a This is based on a work that we have just completed, me together with Sara, who is in the audience, Lorenzo Pironi from Bologna, and Pascale Cabres from Sisa. So the main question I would like to discuss in this talk is what happens with a symmetry or a broken symmetry after a quantum quote. So the main the general the main setup I have in mind is I have in mind is a spatial extended quantum system that we prepare in a pure state, as I note, and then we perform a sudden global quantum query, okay, such that the initial state is not an against the consequence Hamiltonian. So the full system undergoes a non-trivial unitary dynamics. And now let's consider certain internal symmetry. So we can think into possibilities. So, we can think into possibilities. The first is that the initial state is symmetric, so it respects the symmetry, while the post-sequence Hamiltonian breaks it. Or the second possibility, vice versa, is that the initial configuration is not symmetric, breaks the symmetry, but the eposequence dynamics respects it. So if we go to the Go to the time evolution. We can see that in both cases, one of these two terms breaks always the symmetry. So we can directly, very easily conclude that in both cases, the time evolution, the time evolved state, breaks the symmetry. So it's non-symmetric. So you can tell me, okay, this is the answer to this question. So this is the end of my talk. But now we can imagine. But now we can imagine that uh this extended uh system can be divided into spatial regions, A and B, and now we can wonder what happens with this symmetry in one of these regions, for example in A. And here the things are much less trivial. Why? Because as we know, while the full sequence While the full system follows a unitary dynamics, so it never relaxes to a stationary state, this one now, that the subsystem A, okay, that whose state is described by this representative matrix, does relax in the terminal limit to a stationary state that is described either by a Gibbs ensemble in the case of new integrable systems, or a generalized Gibbs ensemble if the system Gibbs ensemble, the system is integral. This Gibbs ensemble takes this form and it takes into account all the charges in evolution with the possible Hamilton. So, given the form of this stationary state, it may happen that while the full system is in a state that breaks the symmetry, the reduced enzymatics, this stationary state, respects the symmetry, is symmetric. Symmetric. Okay? So now the main questions that I would like to discuss in this talk is what are the conditions under which this symmetry is restored and in case it is restored, how does the time scales involved in this symmetry restoration depend on the initial configuration or on the consequence methods. Consequence variants. But to answer these questions, we need a way, we need a tool to measure the extent the subsystem breaks the symmetry. And one solution that we found in this paper with Sara and Pasquale is use the tools from the theory of entanglement of many body quantum systems. And in particular, we introduce a quantity that we dub entangle symmetry that does this job. So Does this job. So what I will do is first I will introduce this quantity and then I will show you how it helps us to answer this couple of questions. So let's be more specific and introduce the basic setup. So we can consider our favorite spin one half chain that it is in a pure state, although the discussion I will do, it is also valid for when the total chain When the total change is in a mixed state, and now we take a subsystem A made of several contiguous spins. And as we have said, this subsystem is described by this reduced schematics by taking the partial trace to the complementary subsystem. And the other ingredient that we need is certain charts that generates a symmetry. And here, for simplicity, I will consider a UY. I will consider a U1 symmetry, although the framework can be extended to compact Lie groups or discrete symmetries. And the only requirement that this charge must satisfy is that it should be local in the sense that it should be decomposed, it should be the sum of the charges in A and B. And this is, for example, the case of the transfer magnetization, the magnetization along the z-axis. The sum we can split into. The sun we can split into the spins in A and the spins in B. And indeed, this will be the charts that I will use in the rest of my talk. So now it's illustrative to see what is the form of this reduced enzymatics with respect to the charts, QA. So in the case that the reduced enzymatics respects the symmetry, so rho A commutes with QA, in the basis of QA, rho A takes a block. Pro A takes a block diabet, where each block corresponds to a symmetry sector of a fixed charge. This is the case of, for example, when we want to study the symmetry resolution of the resolution of entanglement with respect to symmetry sectors. This will be, for example, the case of the next talk, and there will be also other talks to give this week. And in that case, we want to compute the contribution to the tangent of each of these blocks. Of each of these blocks. But here we are going to consider the opposite situation in which generically the reduced NCD matrix doesn't respect the symmetry, so it doesn't commute with QA. And in this case, in the basis of QA, it's not blocked the abandoned matrix. So it has non-zero entries outside of the symmetry sectors. So this observation is the basis to the final proof of symmetry breaking or entangled symmetry. So let's consider Symmetry, so let's consider a reduced density matrix that is not symmetric, so it's not log diagonal. And now, from it, we can define another density matrix, okay, rho a q, by projecting over the charge sector. So, this pi q is the projector over the eigen space of qa with eigenvalue q. So, we obtain, so essentially we are killing all the entries outside these blocks. So, now we obtain a block. So now we obtain a blocked Diagonal matrix that commutes with QA, so it's a symmetry. And then the entanglement symmetry is simply defined as the difference between the von-Neulyman entanglement entropies of Rhoi Q and Rhoi. This is the entanglement symmetry. And the entanglement symmetry satisfies two basic properties to be a measure of symmetry breaking. The first is that this. The first is that it's always non-negative, and the second is that it is zero if and only if draw A commutes with QA. So if and only if draw A is zero. But this entire mass symmetry suffers a problem. It's the usual problem of the volume entropy, that it's it involves the logarithm of a matrix, so it's usually complicated to calculate. Complicated to calculate. So, in the same spirit as in the entanglement, we can do the replica trick. So, we can replace in this definition, the volume entropy, by the Reni entropy. Okay, so we obtain, we can define also this Reni entanglement that is parameterized by n. And in the case the limit n to 1, we recover the definition of the entireness, the volume number. And this And this Rhini entanglement symmetry not only satisfies the same crucial properties as the von Norman case, it is also easier to calculate and it is also accessible in ion trap experiments via for example randomized measurements as I will show you later. So let's see how this entire symmetry works with a simple example. Let's take this ferromagnet with all This ferromagnet with all the spins pointing up in the c direction. So, this is a eigenstate of the transfer magnetization, and therefore the radius density matrix commutes with QA, and it's a symmetric state, so the entire symmetry is zero. But now we can perform a rotation of each spin around the y-axis, so we obtain this tilted thermodynamic. And this tilted thermomagnet is not anymore an eigenstate of the game. And again, state of the transverse magnetization, the reducing matrix doesn't commit QA, and the asymmetry is matrix. And indeed, the tilting angle theta tunes how much the symmetry is proven. This we can see in this plot, where I represent the Renier internal symmetry versus the tilting angle for different values of the Reni index. So at theta equals zero, you have the ferromagnet, so the symmetry is respected. Symmetry is respected, and now we turn on theta, so it starts to grow monotonically until theta equals pi over 2, where all the spins point in the x direction. So, in this case, the symmetry is maximally broken, and then it goes down monotonically until theta equals pi, where all the spins point down in the straight direction, and the symmetry is required. So, now with this tilted steroomagnet, we have a huge We have a huge supply ground. So, for example, we can take as an initial state one of these ferromagnets and we can perform a global quantum quench with a Hamiltonian that respects the symmetry. So, in this case, initially the symmetry is broken, and then the evolution is in the time evolution respects it. And this has been studied a lot in these past few years, starting by this paper. And I will discuss. And I will discuss a bit this case later. But here I would like to focus in this other case in which the initial state, so for example the ferromagnet, we take it as the initial configuration. And now we perform a quantum quench with a Hamiltonian that breaks the symmetry. So in this case, we have initial configuration respect to symmetry and the dynamics breaks. And this case has not And this case has not been studied until this paper, the paper I was referring at the beginning. But instead of focusing on a particular Hamiltonian, we could take a, I don't know, for example, get quantum missing chain that plays this symmetry. I will instead consider the time we're using in a random unitary circuit. Why? Because we expect that this random unitary circuit capture. Unitized sequence capture the typical behavior of chaotic systems. So, in this way, we can have, we can structure what are the generic properties of the entanglement symmetry in Cautic systems. So, what I will do is we take the spin chain, preparing this thermomagnetic state, so the symmetry is respected at the beginning, and now I will. Beginning, and now I will apply to each couple of contiguous spins a random unitary gate where u is a unitary matrix drawn from the Harran example. So these matrices, they don't respect anything. Okay? So now I will evolve in time a path. This is like the circuit that this morning William was presenting at. So it has this blink work structure. And now the question is. And now, the question is: let me focus here in the rest of the talk in the Reni-2 asymmetry. What is the average Reni-2 asymmetry, the time evolution of this average Reni-2 asymmetry? Let's first see what happens at time infinity. At time infinity, we know, as William was also saying this morning, that we expect that the system is described, the total system is. Described, the total system is described by a Hagandom state, so we can replace this pre-work circuit by a full unitary matrix that is applied at the same time to all the states. So this is, in this way, we can calculate the behavior at n infinity, and this is the result. The calculation of the asymmetry for random states was done in this paper, also with Sara Lorenzo and Pasquale. And the result is in this plot where I represent. Where I represent the Runito asymmetry as a function of the ratio between the subsistence size, LA, small LA, and the total system size, A, for different values, for different system sizes. And the most remarkable feature is that in the terminalic limit, for a small subsystem, the average asymmetry is zero until LA over L equals one half, where it jumps and then it grows. It jumps and then it grows logarithmically, like one half locally. So this is the asymmetry, the stationary value of the asymmetry at long times. So we see that at long times for a small subsystem, the symmetry restored, you have an emergent symmetry, and for large systems, subsystem is broken. Why the symmetry is restored for the small subsystem? The in the for the small subsistence, this can be explained in terms of this decoupling equality that tells us that in the atomic limit for subsistence smaller than L A over L smaller than half, the reduced density matrix is exponentially close to the normal isolated. So, to the maximally mixed state, that since it's proportional to the identity with respect. To the identity, it respects any symmetry. So that's why the asymmetry is zero here. And then the other point is that we can give a group theory interpretation to this one-half coefficient. Indeed, in this other paper with Pasquale, I'm a student, Angelo Rossotto, a student of us, we analyze this computation to any generic compact group. And in this case, we have the And in this case, we have the same behavior. For small subsystems, the asymmetry is respected, the asymmetry is zero, so because of this inequality, and then for large systems, we have that it's proportional to local A, which have a coefficient that is given by the dimension of the loop. For those that have studied symmetry of solved entanglement, this is very similar. In symmetry of solved entanglement, we have some kind of term log. Kind of term log log LA with similar coefficients. So this is what happens at time infinity. So yeah. Finish your sentence, so let's go. So, okay. So let's see now how this asymptotic, this stationary value is reached. So for that, let's distinguish the two cases. So the case Distinguish the two cases. So the case smaller than one half and larger than one half, where the symmetry is restored or broken. So let's start by subsistence larger than L over 2. Here I yeah. So I'm confused about the symmetry. So which symmetry are you talking about in this? The transfer magnetization, the sigma set. It's a particle number. Or if you want in terms of What in terms of qubit is the number of qubits in the state? Using initial state to define this symmetry. Yes. Yes. But anyway, I mean, since you are in a random seat with... So anything could work, right? Yeah, this symmetry is arbitrary. Yes. So this is very generic, yes. Because the use are all different in principle here. Yes, the use are all different. The use are all different. Yeah, indeed, I should have put it here. You want they are all different runflow from different. Actually, you do not need time at all. For the time infinity. This is a completely random state. Yes, this is for time infinity. That's for deep circuits. This is, yeah. But now this is what this is what I will show now. For example, I mean, depending on the time step. For exam I mean, depending on the time step, the asymmetry is different. Yeah, as as soon as yeah, you reach very quickly the the stationary value. This is precisely the next slide. This this. So here I consider subsistence larger than L over 2. I represent the average asymmetry versus tar. So at tar equals 0, the symmetry is 0, and you see that it fast jumps to a value that is very close to the stationary. That is very close to the stationary one. Okay, this is the stationary one. And here the symbols have been calculated is the static value, and the lines is this function. You see that has the same structure as before. It splits into terms, this that only depends on the subsistence size, and this one that only depends on time. So at time t infinity, this goes to two and it cancels, and we obtain the value for a higher. The value for a random system. Okay? This formula is valid for large systems. And on the other hand, for a small subsistence, for subsistence more than n over 2, we have this behavior. So now it jumps to something, and then it starts to decrease until it reaches zero at long time. Here we don't have, we were not able to obtain a, here we only have the start of. Here, we only have the start of values calculated numerically. We were not able to obtain an analytic function, but we were able to see how it decays to zero, decays in this way, essentially similar to how the entire entropy decays. Okay, exponential in time. Okay? Yes? Yeah, I saw your face like this. Will you put measurements in? Will you put measurements? Will you put measurements? This will be the next step. No, no, not today, but this is something that. No, not today, but this is something that we have, yes. Yeah, it's very natural. You'll have some signatures you cross over. Yeah. Yeah, this is an interesting formula. How did we get the asymptotics there? This formula? Yeah. Essentially we get uh from uh what we you can okay, it's a bit complicated, but uh A bit complicated, but you can define certain transfer matrix in this circuit. So you can rewrite everything in terms of the trace of this transfer matrix. That comes from the largest eigenvalue? This one. This one, essentially, this formula is given by the largest eigenvalue of that. While this one, not exactly. This one is because it's It's a bit complicated to explain here. Essentially, because you have to rewrite the time asymmetry in terms of something that we call the charge moments, which is like the trace of rho squared with some flags, with some boundary conditions, as the we saw in another talk. In the talk of yeah, in your talk, you you have to insert uh some flags. Some flux. And essentially, you can see that at long times, the dominant behavior is given by then, the time asymmetry is written in terms of the quotient of this partition function with the flux over the partition function without flux. And you can see that in the long time image, what obends the time evolution is the partition function without the flux. So, how do you see it in the numerical? numerically yeah numerically yeah it's some kind of numerical statement right no because uh you we we were able to to get the exact time evolution of the neutral moments of the of the of the partition function without the flux this we know we we were able to extract the full tannibulations so since uh numerically we observed that uh the other partition the partition for The other partition the partition function with the flux thus is sublimin numerically, then we concluded that the long time evolution is governed by this neuronal participants. And for this, we have the exact time evolution. And okay, we just track and then comparing checking with numerically, we check this numerical time. The V, the constant V? The V is sensitive. The V is essentially is equal to the growth of the entanglement entropy. So the entanglement entropy in this circuit first grows linearly and then saturates. So the slope of this entanglement entropy is precisely this V. It's the rate of entanglement growth. Yes. So, okay, this is the situation for last. Or large and small subsistence, and now one can calculate the accubulation time. So, with these results, we can calculate the time at which the asymmetry is arbitrarily close to the asymptotic part. And we obtain that for large subsistence, this equilibration time is independent of the subsistence size. This is derived from the formula that die-trick formula, essentially, because the length and the Because the length and the time are splitted, appear in different terms, while for a small subsistence, this equilibration time is linear in a way. So now one can wonder how generical these results, these are results for this big work circuit. So we can wonder what happens if we consider non-local interactions. So now instead of we can Instead of, we can evolve this ferromagnet by applying, take two random spins and applying the same gate, random gate as before, but now to two spins that can be as distant as we want. And we took them randomly and we applied different random gates. And now, here, the only technical point is that to do some calculations, we need that this time step. We need that this time step goes to zero. So, in this way, we were able to obtain certain differential equations that describes the time evolution of the symmetry. And the result is this. That's why now we have continuous lines. So, essentially, the qualitative result, the qualitative behavior is the same. Here, I represent for a large subsystem, a subsystem larger than L over 2. Then a subsistent lighter than L over 2 and a subsystem smaller than L over 2. And again, in this case, for large subsystem, it grows, monotonically grows, and collapses to the saturates to the value expected by the Harandon formula, while in the other case it grows and then it decays to zero. So, okay, here is another plot in which I plot the average asymmetry, but now as a function of the subsistence size for different time steps. The time steps, and at the beginning it grows logarithmically for any subsystem, and then at some point for large subsistence goes to the saturation, while for small subsystems, it goes to zero. And this dashed line is the prediction for hardening states. So here, again, we were not able to obtain exact analytic results, but we were able to deduce numerically that, for example, in this case, the average transmitted for subsystems larger than network. For subsistence rather than n over 2, follows a similar formula that before with the length, the subsistence length in this term and another term that only depends on time, but also now in the ratio between the subsistence and the total system size. Okay? So we can also compute in this case the ecclipeation time. So I remember you that for local we obtained that for large subsistences. For large subsistence, it's independent of the subsistence size, and for small subsistence, it's linear in LA. Why now for non-local, you obtain that again for subsistence larger than L over 2, it behaves like before, but for subsistence smaller than L over 2, it grows logarithmically with the subsistence. And why is this? What is the reason of this? You can see. Of this, you can see that this is this crevices times coincide with the scanning time of the system. The scanning time is the time necessary it takes to the information, to localize information, to delocalize among all the degrees of freedom. And why this accumulation time of the symmetry restoration coincides with the scrambling time of the system? So, again, system. So again we can invoke this the capital inequality that was the reason why that from which it follows the symmetry restoration. Essentially, the reason why the stationary state satisfies this inequality is because a long time all the information is scrambled over all the degrees of freedom. So from this point of view, this inequality is telling us This inequality is telling us that from a small subsystem, we can only extract exponentially small information about the total system. And now we can understand that the symmetry is restored due to essentially the scrambling of the information. So from this follows that the cubilization time of this time asymmetry should coincide with the system. The system's current time. While this inequality doesn't put any constraint for large subsystems, so it is not necessary that the extribution time in this case coincides with the system. So, okay, these are the results that we have obtained for random unitary circuits evolving from a symmetric state. These are dynamics that respect. State, these are dynamics with respect to symmetry. And let me flash very briefly what happens in the other case that I pointed out at the beginning. So now let's consider as initial state this tilt as ferromagnet. So now the symmetry is broken. And now we can evolve with a Hamiltonian that respects the symmetry. And for example, here I have plotted the results for a quench from the tilted ferromagnet to the x-axis fins. So this does. So these dots, these symbols, is a SAP value computed using the fact that it's a Gaussian state, while the curves are obtained using the quasi-party picture of entanglement adapted to this entanglement. What is your analogy? XXQ. XX. Yes. So it's free, so I can do calculation, and indeed, this is the starter non-car value. And this is the you take the passive particle picture of entanglement, you adapt, and you obtain this. And you obtain this curves. So, this is the result for two different tilting angles. So, now the most remarkable thing is that the symmetry is restored at the long times, but you can observe that the more the symmetry is initially broken, the faster it's restored. So, this pure red goes to zero at earlier times than the other one. And this is what we have found in this paper with Saran Pascal. Found in this paper with Saran Pasquarian, we dubbed it quantum PEM effect. I don't know if you know what is the PEM effect. This is the story that hot water can freeze faster than cold water, or in a more formal way, the more assistance is out of equilibrium, so the more the symmetry is easily broken, the faster relaxes. So the faster here we use symmetries as a as a proxy for symmetry for uh relaxation. For uh galaxies. What's the uh asymptotics here at no time? The asymptotic. It's uh L L over four L four to over P cube. Here is the case for T cube. T cube. The SSA because you have the quasi-particle. If you have quasi-particle splitting, it's one over TQ. One over T, depends on the case. But here is algebraic polynomial because it's integral. While the other is exponential. While the other is exponential. Here the times are very long. So here the subsistence size is 100. And it's very long because it decays 1 over TQ. So for local observables would presumably stationary value much faster than local. Much faster, you know. That means so if you if you measure anything local, that you do not see like a what point function yeah the problem is that now I they oscillate so it's uh difficult to now the the f if you plot for example the two point function or the one point fun the two point function, because yeah, the one point function is easy, because it's uh it's public theorem. It's public theory. But if you plot a two-point function, it oscillates a lot, so you cannot see. You can see it from entanglement. For entanglement entropy, if you take the tiny bolt entanglement and you subtract the final value, you can also see the but local observables, no, I don't think it's so yeah, uh essentially for for Essentially, for the origin of this quantum pavement effect, we have worked out it in one integrable systems. In this paper, with Colin and Sara also and Asquale and other people, we work out the origin for one integrable system and it's related essentially to the transport properties. The same. And we also observed it experimentally in a 12-fire trap. A 12-ier trap via randomized measurements. So, here in this plot, essentially the same as before, you prepare the ion trap in the tilted thermomagnet. And in this case, you simulate a long-range system chain. And the symbols are here, you take a suggestion of four ions. So the symbols are the the the experimental values, while the curves have been calculated uh numerically in a classical computer. Classical computer taking into account all the recording. And as you can see, essentially, you can see that the more the signature is broken at the beginning, the faster you just start for different values. And yeah, so let me finish with some conclusions. So in this talk, we have introduced the entanglement symmetry as a proof of symmetry breaking in a subsystem. And I have shown you how it can be used. Show you how it can be used to study the evolution of IU1 symmetry in a typical gal dynamics with these random circuits. And essentially, the main result is drastically depends on the subsystem. So, I mean, the main lesson is that symmetries in many body quantum systems is a question attached to a particular subsystem. I mean, and here it is very clear because for subsystems smaller. For subsistence smaller than the half-system size, the symmetry is restored, and it's restored at the discrete time. While for larger subsistence, there is no symmetry oscillation, and for example, the existing time of this symmetry is independent of the subsistence size or the locality of the latest. But with this entire symmetry, you can do many other things. Here I have explained one of them. So it can be seen as a new framework to study symmetry breaking and the phenomena related to symmetry breaking. And the phenomena related to symmetry breaking. For example, in this paper, we studied also with the non-Avivian generalized mixed ensembles. With Jerome, also, we have studied the connection with non-topological defects in conformal field theories. It has also been used to study confinement in speech. So, thank you very much. Is there restoration of symmetry? Only you want uh symmetry if you want to rest your job. Because if you sign something initial state, it's finite items region and can you apply it? Oh, yeah, uh but this is precisely uh uh okay, it depends, I mean, because for example in a chaotic system, you go to a gibbs example and the You go to the Gibson sample, and the Gibson sample only is only the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian respects the symmetry, then the status and state respects the symmetry. Saying that the magnetization will go. What do you mean? So, the initial state, that's the initial state. Yeah, which case you are considering, this one or the other one? The initial state with the broken suit. This one. This one, yeah. This one. This one. Yeah, there is finite magnetization. And the Hamiltonian has a single two symmetry. Yes. Yeah, but for example, this is not a good case for SU2 symmetry because here this is an against state of... For example, if you take xxx, this is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, so it doesn't work in time. The statement doesn't work. But in that case, you don't have evolution because the initial state is maybe a state of the having turned. So in that case, yeah, that's an apple. What response if you have a finite, I mean the small magnets actually running the eigenstate of the magnitude, which is a matter of the magic. No, because for example, another case in which it's not restored, In which it's not restored, it's in the x-x set in the roots of the unity. You don't go to the not in this case, but in other cases, if you take a tilted antiferromagnet, you don't restore the symmetry. In that case, you go to analyze this ensemble that it's not that case you just fail. Yeah, so I mean, you have it's not generic, that it's a restoration of course. Okay, ask earlier, I don't remember who someone made a comment as to whether any local operators for which you could exist you were saying would be quite different because the oscillations and that in the speed changes. So I don't know if it's useful, but I think there is a little bit of evidence, at least mostly concretely, but still, um, that somehow the limit is super entropy For entropy, which is actually entropy is connected to a symmetry field, which is which we call the touch point. So it seems that although the dynamics of local fields is quite different from the dynamics of entropy, the dynamics of all symmetry fields is quite similar, all twist fields. So that would be the one very is to entropy, but that would be also magnetization, for example. So I don't know in the context you're looking at, but example. We're looking at, but the problem is that here the symmetries are broken, so this still is not. I don't know if there's still that similarity in this case, but there is certainly a similarity if you look at evolution of one-going function, for example. So the the entropy of a seven infinite region compared to an inspiration, for example, um, after a point. So they have After a French, so they have the properties. Yeah, we haven't looked at that, but I cannot. Yeah, but in principle, should I just say that semilotrophon is quite special? It's not really mine. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not saying that you can only see here this perm effect, but for example, another case is taking the distance, really. Is taking the distance really between the time evolving state and the stationary state. If you take the distance from a distance resistant, you cannot succeed. So, yeah. So, yeah, for sure there are other places where it could look. I was wondering, there was a formula, the one William was asking about earlier, where you had an exponential minus velocity L of 2. Yeah, this one. Yeah, um so I mean that exponential somehow looks I mean it reminds me a lot of quasi-particle picture. Is there a quasi-particle picture? No, here not precisely because this is uh this is Caudi. Right. Indeed the quasi-particle picture gives you here the decay is uh one over T cube. Right. So this is different thing. It's different, yes. So, from my understanding, if you have a big closed system with a fixed, let's say, particle number, and then you want to have a subsystem, if there's a fixed particle number in the big system, then it should commute with the density matrix of the subsystem. So, if the symmetry breaks in the subsystem, wouldn't that mean that the particle number is changing in the larger subsystem? Yeah, but here we are, okay, in the first case, in the case, the particle number is fixed, yes. You are thinking in that case. Well, I'm just wondering if, for example, your symmetry measure, breaking measure, can detect changes in some larger system outside of the subspace because. Space because yeah, yeah, you can consider the full system, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you can do the game with the full system, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you the important thing is that okay, here I remark the story of the subsystem because depending if you take a it depends on what subsystem you consider, but you can consider the full the full system. Indeed, the trick uh okay, the trick I have to say, this formula we didn't get for a subsystem, we get for the full system, and then we extended to the subsystem. Okay, okay. To be a subsystem. Okay, okay. But yeah, you can also, but this is also value when LA is equal to L. Capital. Okay, I think we, so I have to move on, so not that we sort of fall too far behind our schedule, so let's think this could be something. Oh, you can't do it. Okay, perfect. So you should be able to and that should be the spoiler. Okay, so the last talk of today is by F.A. Young about quantum entanglement in symmetries and defects. Thank you for the introduction. I would like to send some. For the introduction, I'd like to thank the organizers for putting together this workshop in such a beautiful but cold place. So far, I like it, maybe not the temperature part. And also, thanks for the invitation to speak here. And I know you must be hungry. I'm starving, so I'm really sorry for keeping you still here. And thank you, Universe, for your patience. So, what I'm going to tell you today is some story about interplays between three subjects, quantum. Between three subjects, quantum entanglement, symmetries, and effects. So each of the subjects on its own is very interesting, so which you're already seeing lots of recent developments in quantum information science and quantum physics. So what I'm going to do next is to give you a brief motivation for each of these three individual subjects. And then I will tell you briefly what I'm going to say today. Okay, so quantum entanglement is well known that it plays an essential role in quantum information. An essential role in quantum information science and quantum computation. For example, a lot of fundamental procedures in tolerant quantum computation relies on generating quantum entanglement between different qubits. Now, from a physics point of view, quantum entanglement is also very useful. It has powerful tools. It could be used to detect quantum phase transition, track atom equilibrium dynamics, and detect topological order. In fact, we just heard this morning a wonderful talk by William, who told us. Wonderful talk by William, who told us some recent development in GME, genuine multi-party entanglement. I hope I pronounced it multi-party practic, which is also very interesting. Now, the second thing that my talk will briefly touch upon concerns symmetries. So, it is well known that maybe from ancient physics point of view, the symmetries are very useful. It could be used to provide guiding principles for model building, constraining dynamics or quantum. Constraining dynamics of quantum systems along rate normalization group flows. It's also playing a very important role in the classification of quantum phases of matter. Now recently there's also been lots of developments in regarding to symmetries, while these directions concern symmetries in open quantum systems, where you make this distinction between the notion of strong and weak symmetries and lots of interesting phenomena in the traditional symmetry will carry Symmetry will carry over to this new regime with some more findings. Now, another direction of this recent development concerns generalized symmetries, which is like generalizing non-transmetries to improve more phenomena. And it has attracted lots of attention from spectrophysics, health physics, and also pure mathematicians. The third subject that my
