Okay, so hello. So, can you hear me? Yeah, probably. Okay, thank you. So, I will start then. All right, so first of all, I have to excuse my cranky voice because I'm still recovering from a pretty bad cold, but I will do my best to make my talk as clear as possible. All right, so my talk today is based on My talk today is based on a very recent collaboration with two colleagues, Ben Duan from Ziling University and Chun Jing Xie from Shanghai Jiajou University. So this is actually the, has been a quite long project and we just posted our the preprint of the paper just yesterday on archive. So now it is available on archives since this morning. So if you're interested in seeing more details. In seeing more details, actually, you can just do so by checking our preprint from archive. All right. So today, since I'm only give away the half an hour, I'll just do my best to keep my talk as clear as possible without much detail. But I still hope that I can make my talk clear enough. So, first of all, my problem mainly concerns about some particular solution. Some particular solutions of this steady alloprasome system. So I'm pretty sure that many people in the audience are pretty familiar with this equation or its variation, right? So if you look at the first three lines on the left-hand side, it's just the same as the equations of compressible oil system, as you can see. But now we are considering the compressible gas, which is ionized. Which is ionized. So, because of that, we also have the electric effect, which is self-generated by this ionized gas itself. So, we do have these extra equations for this electric potential big phi. And of course, this equation is coupled with the rest of the equation in this system throughout this non-linear way. So, on one hand, it's quite similar to compressible all equations. Similar to compressible all equations, but on the other hand, we do have these extra equations. So, because of that, when we try to solve this problem for any occasion, technically it is much more complicated. But when we consider the one-dimensional solution of this, actually the structure of the one-dimensional solution is much more fruitful compared to the one of a compressed older system. And thanks to this proof structure, Thanks to this proof structure, we were able to construct a pretty interesting solution that I'm about to present today. All right. So, here, as you can see, I'm going to consider this ideal polytrophic gas. So, therefore, there's going to be gamma, which is the constant bigger than one, which is called the adiabatic exponent. So, this is the fixed constant. And also, here, B here. So, this is also a given function. And throughout my talk, I will just assume. Up my talk, I will just assume that this is a constant just for simplicity, and this represents this density of a positively charged ions. And rho here represents the density of electrons in the gas here. And of course, we do have a pressure and velocity field as well. Now, the domain that we consider is very simple. So, since this is the very first work of a whole project that we are planning on head, we are going to On the head, we are going to just consider two-dimensional domain with finite lengths. So, here L is just the length of the nozzle, and we just fix the height of the nozzle by two, which is introducing symmetric interval just for simplicity. Now, what we want to do in this domain is to construct a continuous transonic shock solution of this all up subsystem. All right, so. Right, so mainly we are interested in constructing the solution of this multi-dimensional steady old Laplace system. But moreover, we are mainly interested in the case where this Mach number of the compressible flow is being changed from being less than one to bigger than one or vice versa, either in continuous way or discontinuous way. Eventually, we are interested in constructing the solution in this. Constructing the solution is in this whole domain with the structure both continuous transonic transition here with the sonic boundary, also the transonic shaft. So when we started working on this project, we thought that actually constructing a transonic shock solution of all the Poisson system is much easier compared to the one constructing the solution with a continuous transonic transition. But it turns out that actually the opposite is. That actually the opposite is the case. So, today I will only represent our result on the existence of this continuous transonic solution of all the Poisson system. And actually, this part constructing the transmodic shark solution is just the next project that we are planning to work in the future. All right, so now, as I mentioned earlier, I explained that this one-dimensional solution. That this one-dimensional solution of all the Poisson system is much more interesting. So, let me briefly explain about that. So, here I'm going to just fix constant J, which represents this background momentum density, so which is the product of the density times the velocity for 1D flow. And S0 is the entropy, of course, it's a constant positive. And B, as I said before, it's about the this. The density of the background positively charged ions. And now for the electric potential, we are going to define a function E bar as a derivative of electric potential. So here I put the notation bar just to represent that at the moment I'm considering one dissolution. So with using these new notations, now we can much simplify this. simplify this all the Poisson system into the following form. So eventually we are left with this 1D OD system for the velocity and this electric force and two other algebraic equations. And probably you will know why we are left with that, right? So in order to study the solution of this, of course it suffices to study this OD system, the first order OD system. The OD system. And here, of course, this is autonomous. And moreover, because of this particular structure, it turns out that, according to the paper by Tao Lo and Professor Zhu Pingxin, published in 2012, one can actually explicitly sketch the phase play of the all kinds of 1D solution for this OD system. And today, we are particularly interested. We are particularly interested in the case where certain conditions is satisfied. So, namely, here we are going to introduce the two parameters. So, here ui is just this quantity and us is the velocity at the sonic state. Okay, so therefore, it's automatically determined by the entropy and this momentum density. So, then we are going to consider the case where. Going to consider the case where this US is less than UI, in which case the phase plane of this solution is given in this nice way. Okay, so here, particular solution that I'm going to focus today is this critical trajectory. Okay, so let me briefly explain about this. So, here, as you can see, this critical Can see this critical trajectory is passing through the point where the speed becomes this speed at the sonic state. So it's passing through the sonic point, which is very interesting. And following the direction of arrow here, so the direction of arrow represents the change of the solution as x1 coordinate is increasing. Okay, so let's just focus on the case where we fix the initial data. Where we fix the initial data of this ODE problem with the following way. So here, U0 is going to be the velocity at the entrance and E0 is going to be the electric force at the entrance. So therefore, here now I fix the subsonic velocity with the negative electric force. All right. So if we start with this initial data and keep a try to then solve this OD system for UNE. This OD system for UNE, as you can see, the velocity monotonically increases. At the same time, the E also increases and becomes from negative to positive, and this becomes zero at this sonic point. All right. And of course, if we keep the solution just keep going, then eventually it's going to turn that direction. So it's going to be decelerated again. Be decelerated again. But in this talk, we are only going to take a part with this positive acceleration, and that's going to be our background solution that we are interested. All right. So actually, this phase plane is given already in the paper by Lu and Xin. And here, in our paper, we actually prove that this particular solution. This particular solution with the sonic state in the middle is actually a smooth solution, and we never see such a type of solution in the study of a complex of all the systems. So, we found that this is extremely interesting. So, according to the lambda that we put here, so this is a smooth solution, and of course, it's strictly accelerating. So, before we reach to this point at the maximum length, the acceleration is actually strictly positive. Is actually strictly positive. And also, of course, there is a unique location where the flow state becomes zoning. So, this is the results that we prove about this solution. All right, so then now we can hope, so we hope that we can construct now the multi-disolution of such property. In other words, by perturbing the boundary. By perturbing the boundary data at the entrance, we hope to construct the multi-D solution with this continuous trisonic transition at a small perturbation of 1D solution that we saw in the previous slide. So that is going to be our main problem. So the problem is as follows. So now given on a 2D nozzle with a fixed length L here, now we want to prescribe Now we want to prescribe the boundary data in the following way. So, in solving the problem, now we fix this electric force in the x1 direction. And actually, if we do that, according to the previous one-day analysis of the solution, this kind of implying that the horizontal velocity, the horizontal component of the velocity is automatically determined as solved. So, therefore, by fixing this one, now for the velocity. This one. Now, for the velocity, we are only going to prescribe this vertical component, not the horizontal component. And also, there is entropy. So, of course, we want to consider the flow with non-zero vertices eventually. And then now on the boundary, on the wall boundary, we give the slip boundary condition. So now the problem statement is as follows. So as long as this boundary data at the entrance is just a small perturbation of The small perturbation of the boundary data of the 1D solution, can you construct a multi-disolution of this all of a sudden system that satisfies the boundary condition here? Okay, and of course here now I have to specify what is the norm that we use for the perturbation of a boundary data. So here, as I said earlier, this is the very first attempt to control. Is the very first attempt to construct somebody construct the continuous transformative transition solution? So, we just wanted to use the norm that on our convenience. So, we are going to just consider C4 perturbation of the boundary data. And for the vertical component of the velocity, we are going to give just a C5 perturbation. Again, this is not the optimal, it's just for our convenience, and we still have a lot of room to make. Have a lot of room to maybe just weaken the norm in the future, but it's just technical extension, I believe. And we also give some compatibility condition at the corner just to avoid the corner singularity for the technical reason. So this is just some technical condition. All right. So then now I just need to introduce the terminology for the background solution. So eventually we are solving this small perturbation. We are solving this small perturbation problem. So I have to be more precise on the terminology of the background solution here. So now, given for fixed parameters gamma, entropy J, and now there is a Jetta is just the ratio of Ui over Us, which are the parameters introduced earlier. And then we are considering the very particular phase plane here. So this implies that. So given these four constants, So, given these four constants, now we fix the entrance data with a subsonic and negative electric force. Then, by solving this 1D problem, we get the background solution. So, we call this 1D solution as the background solution associated with these two particular entrance data here. And now, our result is the following. So, then, actually, the result is not so simple. Is not so simple, so I have to be more precise here. So, like I said, there are many parameters to consider, right? And then among all these parameters, so this is the basic one and L is going to be nose lengths. And here, in order to obtain this resistance result for the multi-D transonic solution in 2D domain, we are going to have, we actually have to. We actually have to give some assumption on some of the parameters here. And of course, among all these parameters, there's going to be three parameters that we have to control to get this existence result. So therefore, the rest of the parameters are going to be assumed to be fixed all the time. All right. So here, the controlling parameters is J, U, 0, L here. So J is the momentum density for the background solution. L is the nozzle length at U0. Is the nozzle length and u0 is entrance velocity for the 1D solution. Now, the result I put in a rather simplified form just to help you understand better. The result is the following. So, given these parameters, now we can solve our main boundary value problem that I showed you in the previous slide on certain conditions. So, this is a conditional where Paul needs to research. More precisely, now we can. Precisely, now we can fix two constants J bar and J under bar. So J bar is a rather small number. So that's going to be the upper bound for the case where this J is small here. And J under bar is actually a relatively large number. So we are going to consider two cases. We can solve the problem for two cases. Either this background momentum. This background momentum density is sufficiently small or sufficiently large. So, unfortunately, this is as far as we can have at the moment for some technical reason that I will explain later. So, if either this J is sufficiently small or large, then we can fix a constant D. So, here D is going to be a relatively small constant so that, so as you can see, So that, so as you can see here, u0 is the entrance velocity for one dissolution, ul is the velocity at the exit here. So you are looking at the ratio of the velocity to this velocity at the sonic state. So you can consider this is the quantity more or less comparable to the Mach number. So basically what we are assuming is that if the Mach number at the end The Mach number at the entrance and exit. So, here, of course, at the entrance it should be subsonic, at the exit, it is supersonic anyway. So, that's essential in our property of the solution. But we still want this Mach number rather close to one. Okay, so we call this almost sonic condition. So, if this condition holds, then we can actually solve our main boundary value problem as long as the Problem as long as the perturbation of boundary data is small. And moreover, here, the important thing is that since there is this transonic transition, it's not a chart, actually. We are constructing, if you look at the class of the solution, we are constructing the solution for the classical level. So, by the sober level inequality from this estimate, you can clearly see that we are. Can clearly see that we are getting the classical solution. So, we don't expect any similarity here. So, since the Mach number is a subsonic less than one at the entrance and bigger than one at the exit, it's a clearly continuous transonic solution. So, therefore, we expect to have the sonic interface in the domain. Interesting thing is that, though, we do not consider this as a free boundary. We first solve the problem, then by using The problem, then by using the monotonistic property of our background solution, we can naturally pinpoint the location of the sonic interface by using implicit mapping theorem. So therefore, once we have the solution by using the monotonicity of the property, the velocity of our solution, and using the implicit function theorem, we can decide the location of a sonic boundary so that before the sonic boundary, it is. Before the sonic boundary, it is subsonic. After the sonic boundary, it is supersonic. So, it's a truly continuous transonic solution. Not only that, this transition is C1, which means that all the flow variables are continuous. Moreover, their derivatives are continuous also. And at the end of my talk, I'm going to show you another example of a Sonic boundary, which actually has a completely different feature. So, eventually, with this result, Eventually, with this result, now we have two examples of solid interface with different belonging to two different classes, which we found very interesting. Now, one remark in our main theorem is that this almost sonic condition, so you may think that or one may easily misunderstand that maybe this almost sonic condition implies that we just to solve the problem for short interval. The problem for short interval, but actually, it's not here. The length of the interval is not a problem at all. So, this condition is a given just because we are working with all of our system where we have to solve this quasi-linear system, not the single equation. So, we do have this coupling terms to control. So, because of that, we inevitably add to this condition, but this condition does not necessarily imply. Does not necessarily imply that the nozzle length is small. So if you look at the appendix in our paper, which is available in archives since this morning, actually we do have the examples where L can be arbitrarily large. All right, so since I only have 10 minutes left, I will briefly explain the strategy of the group without much detail. So of course, I'm here, as many of you know, I You know, I'm more familiar with the working on the potential flow, but recently now I'm more interested in working in this multi-dimensional Euler system or Euler Plazon system in the framework of Halloween decomposition. Because number one, it still contains the potential flow part, which I'm very familiar with. And number two, I can also consider the effect of a vorticity, and of course. Effect of a vorticity. And of course, everybody has to work with a vorticity here, of course. So, therefore, now, eventually, since this is a 2D problem, I have this well-known Halloween decomposition framework. So, by using that, I can rewrite my Euler Poisson system this way, which looks very terrible, but actually, it's not. If you look at this very closely here, the third equation only takes care of the vorticity, and it's mainly controlled by entropy variables. Mainly controlled by entropy variation. So, this is pretty easy to control in general. So, it turns out that if I can work with the main part which I call here, which is this one, so this is like the potential flow-like equations, and the second one is the Poisson equation of electric potential. There is no way that we can decompose any further than that. So, we have to work this as a system. So, first, I have this full formulation, then I only take Then I only take off this potential flow model part. So I solve this non-linear boundary problem with this one. Then I can easily go back to this original formulation by just additional step of iteration. So I really not, I'm not worried with this part. All right. So now I can only focus on the potential flow case. Then of course here, of course, here, since we are given with one dissolution. We are given with 1D solution, the natural approach is to work this with the method of iterations. So, mainly you just introduce a collection of a possible approximate solutions. And by using that, you linearize the equations and you just solve this linearized equation and just construct iteration mapping and apply the fixed-point theorem and so on. All these kinds of standard results, right? This kind of standard Z, right? So, here the main part of the work actually is to deal with this linearized problem. So, now I just rewrote my equation, which is a small potential flow part, right? In terms of the perturbation function. So, the first equation basically is related with the conservation of mass. The second equation is the Poisson equation for the electric potential. And, of course, this is the electric. And of course, this is the elliptic. So we think that, well, this is not a problem where it's true on one hand, but on the other hand, this one still is coupled with the first equation. Now, I want you to focus on this first equation, where many people are very familiar with this equation form itself. But actually, here the interesting thing is the behavior of the principal coefficients. Now, I take off as I does the construct. Take off, so I just construct the matrix, I just take the determinant of the coefficient matrix, right? Then, since I'm interested in constructing the transonic solution, actually this function, the determinant of the coefficient of the matrix changes the sign. So, near the entrance where the Mach number is less than one, it's a positive, which means that this equation is elliptic, which will Is elliptic, which we like, right? So then you have the elliptic system, which is very nice. But around the axis, on the other hand, we are expecting to have a supersonic flow. So therefore, the Mach number bigger than one is equivalent to the fact that this function is negative. And of course, somewhere in the middle, we expect to have some interface with the coordination one here where this determinant vanishes. This determinant vanishes. Okay, so this is the situation. So eventually, even for the linearized system, it's not a system of a clear type. It's not elliptic nor just hyperbolic elliptic mixed type. So nobody has any general theory available for this equation. So of course, this is our main challenge to establish the well-posedness of this system. So just to So, just to help you understand better, now let's only consider this equation linearized at the background state, okay? And this is the equation linearized at the background, and then you can clearly see that this changes the sign, all right? Okay, so now, so how do we solve this equation? That is the problem. Now, I only have five minutes left, so I will briefly. Five minutes left, so I will briefly show you how we overcome the difficulties here. Well, first of all, remember this is a system, not a single equation. We cannot solve individual equations separately and then the booster. It doesn't work here. In that case, the compactness cannot be achieved. So, therefore, first of all, by using the Kuzni's idea, where actually he has a very particular example for which he constructs. For which he constructs, actually, he established the private H1 energy estimate for the solution of the equation with this type. Of course, he only considered the single equation, not the system. So we actually employ Kuzmi's idea for a product H1 estimate, but we still have to work as a system. So we still have challenges to handle this coupling. Handle these coupling terms, which are here from the first equation and here from the second equation. So, actually, our main challenge is in handling this coupling term. So, in our paper, so this is the longest part, actually. So, once we get this operator estimate, then for the high-order derivative estimate, we do the bootstrap argument. But also, in doing so, still, in order to Still, in order to do the high-order derivative estimate for the first equation, again, we still need some theory, but it turns out it's available in Kluzini's book. And then also, but the first two steps only just cares about establishing a priority estimate, but it doesn't guarantee the uniqueness, right, the existence here. It only guarantees the uniqueness for the solution. So for the existence, So, for the existence, actually, we have to introduce another boundary value problem with a singular perturbation. So, we're still, unfortunately, I don't have much time. So, for each step, I will briefly show you the slide how we just handle briefly. So, for H1 estimate, actually, the coefficients of our equation. The coefficients of our equation, the principal coefficient had these algebraic properties, actually, which are stated as the essential condition in Kuzmi's book to apply his theory. Actually, in his book, he gave this condition just as a technical condition, which are naturally derived in the procedure of the estimate, but actually he didn't say anything about the physical mean or physical example. Or physical example. But we found it interesting that our case actually this condition, which is purely tactical, holds. And that holds thanks to this monotonistic property of our 1D solution. So that was the essential part. And now, and because of that, we can actually do this kind of energy type estimate. All right. And for the high-order data estimator, this is more technical. So let me just briefly say. So, let me just briefly say for higher derivative estimate, actually, we also have to introduce the kind of auxiliary problem in an extended domain. So we extend our domain a little bit so that this operator L1 becomes elliptical gain. So that we do a lot of technical estimates, but I'm going to skip it. And finally, for this existence part, we actually introduce this. We actually introduced this singular perturbation boundary value problem with two extra boundary conditions, and then we just apply this opportunity H4 estimate, the Galakin's approximations, and the limiting argument just to pass to the limit as epsilon goes to zero plus, that we can achieve this existence of solution for the linear boundary value problem. So of course, each step is very non-trivial, and then that actually made the paper pretty long. Made the paper pretty long, unfortunately, but we anyway we were able to prove some result. Now, so summary: so, uh, by using all these procedures, we now have a classical solution of all the Poisson system with transonic transition, but this transition is a C1, which means that not only flow variables, the fluid variables is continuous, but also their derivatives. But also their derivatives are continuous. But actually, the original motivation why we got interested in this problem is because the behavior of this other solution that we construct, it is something that we can expect in this delayed notion flow where actually there is this continuous trisonic transition here, right? So everybody familiar with this elaborate noise of flow problem. This is extremely difficult because there is no background solution that we can start from, right? But for all the Poisson system, there is one that we can start from. So we hopefully in the future, by somehow finding some way to bridge this all the Poisson system, this older system in this module with certain geometry, hopefully we or maybe somebody else can construct a solution here as well. Solution here as well. And the final remark about our result is that, like I said earlier, this transonic transition that we found is C1, right? So across the sonic interface, everything is very regular. But if you are so familiar with the result by myself and We Chang and Misha in 2009, where we studied this optimal regularity of the solution for this. Of the solution for this self-similar weak solution of unsteady oval system, there is a sonic boundary here, but actually this sonic boundary turns out to be weak discontinuity, which means that the flow variables are continuous, but their derivatives are discontinuous. So by combining this result with our result that I present today, now we are given with two different types of sonic interface. Types of Sonic interface. One actually is a regular interface in the sense that the flow variables are regular. Another one, actually, the flow variable is just leaf continuous, right? So now the question now that one can have is then then, is there any general criterion to determine the type of Sonic interface? So now, you know, these days I'm thinking about this question a lot, but of course, there is no clear answer that I can actually come up with. Answer that I can actually come up with at the moment. All right, so that's all I prepared for today. And thank you for your attention.
