So the third speaker of the session is Lijuang Lin, and she's going to talk about optimal transport under uncertainty on the components. Yeah, thank you. So hello everyone, my name is Ivan Li, I'm from University of Waterloo, a PhD student supervised by Testament One. And this topic actually comes from one of our work called Junction Mixability and the notions of negative dependence. So you see there is no option. Dependence, so you see, there is no optimal two spots in my work. So, in the name of this work, so I remember this title to have optimal choice pot here. So, in this title, we say we are discussing about the uncertainty on the components. So, we are first begin with sorry. Okay, so I'm not very familiar with this. So let's first look SnapLone is multi-marginal optimal transport problem. So what we are looking at is how to minimize the expected cost, which is measured by Cost, which is major bio convex function on the sum of some random variables from x1 to xn. And each xi, we know their marginal distribution, but we do not know their dependent structure. So actually, we are choosing a dependent structure to minimize this expected cost, which is just like you choosing a transport between each component in an optimal transport problem. So this question, of course, we sometimes also call it like dependence on. Also, call it like a dependence uncertainty problem, a risk aggregation problem. And it's clear that if you can get a random vector with a given marginal and its sign equal to a constant, since we take a convex cost function, obviously this should be a minimizer. And we call such kind of random vector with sign equal to a constant as a joint mix proposed by Wang Wang 2011. And from now on, we discuss about the And from now on, when we discuss about marginal distribution constraints, we always refer to those can support a joint mix when the vector, so which is called joint mix ball. And actually, if you select some very nice marginal, you will get several different kinds of joint mix. So, for example, if you take your marginal as the standard normal distribution, the very simple one you can think about would be like n minus About like n, minus n, a minus normal risk is a standard normal risk. And since we have n and minus n appears alternatively, so we call it alternating joint mix. And it's clearly one sums after zero, so it's a joint mix. And another way you can think about how to build a joint mix is to take a multinomial distribution. As long as you take the correlation matrix with the sum of all those elements equal to zero, then you will get the value. To zero, then you will get the balance for the sine flow xi m12 and n be just zero, right? So it's also just mix. And here we take a very spatial correlation metric where we have the correlation between each pair of random variables in this vector equal. So since it's also a giant mix and has the same original distribution, you can directly calculate the covariance for this random vector would be just minus. Random vector would be just minus 1 over minus 1. And this one would be an exchangeable random vector. It means that if you change the position of those random variables in this vector, you will not change your distribution. So the position doesn't matter. And we are wondering like where these two kinds of judgments play different laws in terms of minimizing the expected cost. So we look at the cost of the subset for this route. So for the So, for the expected cost inside of this cost function, we are not going to sum up all those x, 1, 2, x. We just sum up a small group like group k inside it. And now we take a very simple example to consider this question. We take this as a quadratic function and we look at a group with only two components inside. And one is like, it can support an alternating joint mix. alternating joint mix and we have very we have only two and side you can copyright that for a group with two components this alternating joint mix will give you like four or zero subset of cost of subset it depends on your choose own and own or own and finance own but for exchangeable joint mix it's more stable you just get one cost of subset so it seems like this exchangeable joint mix will give you a Changeable joint mix will give you a more fairy distribution of the cost to every small group. So we are wondering where this one can be used to solve like worst-case problem for to minimize the subset of cost, worst-case of subset cost. So directly obviously from our example before, if we take n equal to 4, you can calculate that for this alternating joint mix, this worst case would be This worst case would be equal to 4, and for the exchangeable joint means this worst case would be just 4 over 3, so it's much smaller. But we do not know where it is. We are really minimizing here, right? So this is a question we are going to solve later. But of course, we want to solve a more general question for this optimal choice cost problem and the uncertainty for all those components. So we first formally start this question. So since we have So, since we have some uncertainty about who will participate in this process, so we probably can get a probability distribution for each small group, like how likely this group will participate. And our objective function will be changed to the expect weighted average of all the subsets weighted by this probability. And of course, you might have no idea about which kind of probability distribution you are going to use. Distribution you are going to use. So we have also uncertain set of probability measures, which is M. And we say if uncertain set of the probability measure is metric, if when you computation the label of all those components, like just change the labels, the result probability measure will still be inside the status. So it means that the label of this agent does not make me just care about. Does not mean you just care about who it is, you do not care about their name. Okay, so this is a very natural assumption. And our first result is here. So assuming that M is a symmetric uncertainty set and we take identical marginal distribution, then for a judge mix, you can do a reorganization of it. So it's like you put all those random variables into a box and you take it out randomly. And you take its house randomly without replacement and form a new random vector. So a random permutation. So this new random vector would be exchangeable since you take them out without replacement randomly. And it's still joint mix because the original random vector is joint mix. And it still has the marginal F since we have the identical marginal. And with all those features, you can exactly calculate this collision metrical. Comprehensive is correlation metric would be the PN style we introduced before. And our first result shows that after doing this reorganization, you will get a better use case. And so we can always find an exchangeable joint mix that can improve your orange mode random matter. But we still don't know where this method will give you a minimizer yet. So it will highly depend on your choice of this f function plus of function. Of this f function, pulse function f, and your choice of like certain sets f. So we here choose a simple cost function, quadratic function f equal to x squared. And with this cost function, you can find that a joint mix with the marginal f and the corrosion metric, spatial corrosion metric PN star we introduced before, would be a minimizer for this question. But we do not fully categorize it. Do not fully characterize it. It means that not all minimizer here would be such kind of joint mix. It will depend on which kind of M you choose. So now we are going to introduce two very special cases of this choice of M. So first, the first case is that we choose M as the set of all probability measures defined up to the power. So it means that you have no information about which kind of subgroup will be. Which kind of subgroup will take will be in this set you need to consider. So in this case, the worst case would be just like the worst case of all of the subsets, all of the cost of all of subsets. And of course, you can just limit your discussion to the subsets with K components, but you know which group, the number of the group, the number of components in this group, but you do not know exactly how. know like exactly how likely they can be inside the probability of they participate participant in this in this minimized process. And in this case, this worst case would be the worst case of cost for the set with k components. And for the first case we show that if we forward take the mono distribution with mean zero then we can characterize the all those minimizer. The all those minimizer. So a random vector would be a minimizer if and only if it is joint mixing with this correlation metric. And similarly, if we limited this number of subgrouping to a number of k, as long as you do not take this k as the spatial number like 1, a minus 1 or n, you will still get this if and only statements. And for the spatial case like k equal to n, it would be degenerate just. It would be degenerate just for one dimension. And for k equal to n or n minus 1, it will go back to the no answer. So this already solved. And for about discussion, we are limited marginal with the identical marginal. But for the heterogeneous marginal, what we can get is only for three dimensions. So we should, if you have three modular distributions with mean equal to zero, With mean to zero, then this mean at least minimize worst case problem. All the joint peaks would be the minimizer for this minimizer force case problem. And one very interesting result we present here is that if you can get a joint mix with all those covariance between each pair are non-positive, then any random vector with positive cohesion metric cannot be a minimizer. Metric cannot be a minimizer. So that's why we think that the negative dependent joint minimizer might be a very identical, very nice, like desirable solution for more general question. And that's why in this paper, the title, we started joint mix and notions of negative dependence. But since I'm run out of time, so I do not have time to present our work about negative dependence, joint mix. Joint mix, and this is the reference we use in this paper. Thank you so much.
