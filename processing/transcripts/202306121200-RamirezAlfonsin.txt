I have the pleasure to introduce next speaker. He is Jorge Ramirez Alfoncin from University of Montpellier. He will talk about on the poll number of links. Okay, thank you, thank you very much. Thanks, the organizers, for the invitation and for giving me the opportunity to give this talk. I'm really happy with you. So, today I would like to talk about this subject: the ball number for links. And this is the kind of question that is very easy to understand, but quite tricky to get something out of it. So this is joint work with my former student, PhD student, Ivan Ruskin. Ivan Raskin. Okay, so through the talk, I will be talking about representations, three-dimensional space, you will see. And of course, I will use the diagrams. So I put some diagrams, just projection the note in the plane. I will be using some of them through the talk. And one interesting thing of the diagrams is that we can talk about the crossing numbers of a link, which is among all Which is among all the diagrams representing a link, you take the one that uses the least, the minimum number of crossings. That's the crossing number. Okay. Now, a nickel representation is already mentioned by the previous talk by David Labai. It's just a representation of link, but you may make up that by using the spheres. They're using the spheres, right? So you have threads and you have bolts, and you put one bolt and another, another, another. You may love the thread and you want that this thread, this color, you want, this necklace will be isotopic to a given link. Well, there is a couple of examples. So we have the trifle and the boromin links. They are made out of balls. Balls. We can see a little more structured end on here. We will see why. And then, of course, once you have this definition, what you want, you say, well, if you give me lots and lots of bolts, I certainly will make up the color, the necklace that I need, right? Certainly. So I'm trying to. So I'm trying to, for instance, this here uses four spheres, and I ask you, can you do better than 40? Well, a little bit word. Yes, 24. There you are. Now, next question is, can you do better? Well, twelve. There you go. Can you do better? It turns out that we don't know there. We know we can do it with 12, but we don't know the exact number for the trifle. So the question is, what is the minimum number, right? The minimum of spheres that I need in order to realize this design network. And that's the ball number. The ball number then is the minimum number of spheres. Is a minimum number of spheres that I need in order to make up this matrix? What is Hules can intersect? No, no, no, no, no, no. That's a very good question. No, no, no, no, no. You've made tangency. You have one ball and then tangent to another, to another, but there's no intersection, right? So there's tangency of the balls, like the figures. And the balls can be of different size, not necessarily the same size. If I ask, Size. If I ask the same size, it's completely different problem, it's even more difficult. So, what do we know for this? A few things. There you go. For the trifle, if I trifle for the trivial not, there are three bolts that we need. Of course, we can do it with three, right? One here, another here, another touching both of them, and then you form the truffle. Good. Good. What about the upflake? How many do we need? You see, you may say, well, you may need three for this fellow here, another three for this fellow here. And you're doing six. Thing is that if you take three of them, one, two, three, and then the other three, there are no contact between these two, right? So you have to open up. Two, right? So you have to open up a little bit to make room to make these two boss tangents. So we may say, well, probably four and three. Well, the answer is eight touch. We cannot do it with three and four. It's eight. And now, for the trade-fold, we know that it is between nine and twelve. With a nod exact value. And it's conjectured that it is actually 12. But given that this very particular problem is very difficult. Proving that something doesn't exist, it is not real. Okay. In 2021, In 2021, we proved that actually you can make up your necklace with five times the crossing number of your link. So it is linear on the number of crossings. Okay. There's an example. All these figures that I'm just putting in there have been done by a software realized by Ivan Reskin. So he actually should. So he actually made up all this software and this nice feature is from that software. So you have your not, I think it's a not there. And then the representation over there. Five times, normally it's five times the number of crosses there. Okay. So I would like to explain you how we do this. Actually, it is very simple. It's very technical, but none of technicities here. But I will tell you how I do it. For this, we need a little bit of Lorentz theory. Just let me recall very briefly and quickly what is that means. You have a Lorentz space, which is a d plus two-dimensional vector space, and you have this inner product in which In which you see, for those who don't know, the last coordinate here is negative. So it's not really the inner product that we know, right? So we have this particular special space with that product. And what is nice with this is that the vectors that live there actually are in bijections with the spheres. So there is a bijection. So there is a bijection between vectors in D plus dimensional space and the spheres, the set of all the spheres in D dimension. That's what I'm saying there. We have this bijection. So any points in compliance R, R D are in bijections with vectors in this Latinx in the space. In this Lordens in the space. And actually, these facts tell me lots about the balls. And that's what we use, actually. Tell me lots and lots. Okay, before I tell you this, this is the inverse coordinates. That means from one vector in your Lorentz space, you can associate somehow a ball in the dimensional space. But in a ball in dimensional space, you can. But in a ball indimensional space, you can associate you can find this vector, the corresponding vector. You see, from the ball, you have the radius and the center. From this information, you can find out the associated vector. That's the only way you have to know. Suppose that I take two balls, B V prime. These are the corresponding Lorentz vectors. I take the Lorentz inner product and have a look at this. Product and have a look at this. And this design gives me the information of the balls. Beauty, right? So I can say, well, these two are tangent, externally tangent, if and only if this fellow is minus one. Boom. So we use this. We use this somehow, all right? Very good. The second thing. The second thing that we're going to use is more or less already mentioned by Guy By is this thing here, which is the disk packable for graphs. So I'll give you a graph, and you wanted to represent it with disk. Each vertex is a disk. And then if two vertices are adjacent, your disk must be tangent. Right? And well, you want to turn it into the tangent. Well, you want to study this? I think I have an example here. Yeah, there you go. So that's the complete graph on four vertices. You have four points. Every pair of points is joined by an edge. And the red circle, it is a dis-speckle circle representation of this graph. And now we would like to know when we can do this, for which graphs we can do this. We can do this well. Three people: Kerb, Andref, and Fossen. And yes, they show that you can find this packable thing if and only if the graph is simple planner and simple and planner, and that's it. So, you have any planner graph, whatever you like. I can represent it with disk. Right, such a way the vertices are adjacent, then the discs are tangent always. And moreover, if your planar graph is triangulation of S2, actually, the way you represent your disk is Mavius rigid, which means it's actually essentially the representation is unique up to Mavius transformations. Mobius transformations. And that's most of theorems that Gabe mentioned before. Right? So I put another picture. There you are. You see, I take my graph here. I hope the people from Zoom see this. I take my graph, my complete graph. I take the dual graph, which is this dotted. At edges, does it dual? This point here is the same. You just put it at infinity, just to make the picture better. And then I have a representation of circles. The red are for the graph and the blue are for the dual graph. And essentially, that representation is unique. There is just one up to transformations, right? And this is very nice because you see, you have a kind of dual, like if I take this antisection. Take this intersection. Yeah. You see, this intersection here corresponds to tangent points to the other. It's beautiful. We'll come back to this later, a little bit more general. Okay, but then we have this representation. Good. So let me now tell you how we can. Tell you how we can prove that it's five times the crossing number. So you give me the link. You give me the diagram with end crossings. First step, I'm going to play around. You know that from a node, not a diagram or a link diagram, you have an associated graph, which is the medial graph. You associate the graph to the node, you take the medial graph of that node. By using this medial graph, we construct another. Graph, we construct another graph, what I call G. That essentially, what I do is I add up vertices and edges somehow, right? But the point is that this link L, the diagram L, is still there. I don't touch it, I just add off things. Well, this is a planar graph. I take this representation and giving this representation. Giving this representation, inflating, or I blow up. It's like I say, take the plane, take your representation of the plane, and then each disk, you blow it up. And then you have balls in three dimensions, all cut in the same plane, right? So you have a ball representation with that many balls. And then that's the tricky part. I say, well, for Path, say, well, for each crossing, we're going to add up two extra balls in order to make the crossing properly, right? And that's the trick thing, right? So I have three end crossings, it's three, three end balls, plus two, I mean, that makes five times end bolts, right? And here it is where we use the Lyson geometry to check up that things work properly. That if you have That if you have one under and over, it's still like this. Even when you add up the things, you have exactly the right processing, right? So essential is this. Good. Now, as you can see, this is a kind of algorithm this, right? So actually, our approach is constructive. And that gives me an algorithm. And this is the algorithm. And this is the algorithm that Ivan has programmed and came up with my picture. So now you give me the link. I follow the algorithm and I get the picture here. And you can see here, you see for each crossing two blue bolts, which are the two extra bolts I need in order to make procured things. Okay. Now, in that paper, Now in that paper, we play around with this. And actually, we believe that you not need five, but four times the crossing. And moreover, we say that if it is alternating, the links alternate, then you need exactly four times the crossing up. And there is a reason, I can explain the reason, but there's a risk for this. Right. Right. So, four times the crossing number. Well, in fact, we can prove this four times the crossing number, not for the whole, not for any link, but for a good family of links. And I will show you how we do it. Now, for doing this, we're going to use the Apollonius. The Apollonius Apollonius packings. Now, I don't know how comfortable you are with all this. So, let me spend you some time on this, explaining what Apollonium packing is. I will tell you some nice properties, and then we'll come back to notes, right? So, Apollonius gives you this theorem, say that any three pairs, pairwise tangent cycles, always have two cycles that are tangent to the three of them. Are tangent to the three of them. So you have three cycles there. There are two cycles which are tangent to the three of them. There you go. Now, Apollonius proved this using geometry, very basic geometry, but actually the proof is very easy, just one line, right? You take your three fellows here, you take one intersected point, you send this point to the infinity by a model transformation. By a modus transformation. Therefore, this circle here is now this half space here. This circle here is this half space here. This tangent point is infinity for both of them. This fellow here is there. And of course, here we can add up two cycles which are tangent to the three of them. And then we come back by making the inverse of this modus transformation. There you go. Okay. With this, we can form what we call the Apollonian gasket or Apollonion sphere packets, if you like. And this is the way we do it. Take four cycles. You take three of them, you add up two circles according with Apollonius, tangent to all of them. You have a new configuration, and then again, you take three. And then again, you take three, add up, three, add up, three, add up. So you have four, which are pairwise tangent. For each of those, I take, for instance, for this value here, I take three circles. I know by Apollonius that there are two tangents to all of them. This is one. Tangents to all of them. This is one, and the other one is already the red one. That's why it's not blue there, but it's already there. And I do exactly the same for everyone. And then I have this, and I take three, and again, and again, and again, and again. That's the apologies task. Now, this is very well known and well studied because lots of reason applications to biology or physics, and of course. Physics. And of course, as mentioned by David Gallai, there's a parabolic geometry in there, right? I'm not an expert on this, but behind there's a parabolic geometry. And I studied this Apollon circuit because of two reasons. One is number theory reason. It has to do with curvatures of these circles here. And the second is not theory. That's why we concentrate here. Here, right? Okay, now let us see how we want to use this. First, let us recall what an inversion with respect to a circle is. That's the definition. So you can have a look at the definition, but probably the figure is better. You have a circle. You take a point outside of a circle. You take the segment. You take the segment and you look for a point q prime inside the circle that verifies this property here: that the distance, the product of the distance equals r square. That's the inverse. The inverse of point q with respect to this circle here. Good. Now, if I have this circle here, the black one, the plus that have another circle. Suppose that I have another circle here that goes through the center. If I compute the set of all inverse points of these fellows, blue fellows, actually is the line here, this red line. Now, if the circle does not contain the center like this, I'm going to have another circle that is going to be half inside, half outside. If my circles are both, If my circles are both of them outside, completely outside of the circle, then the corresponding inverse circles are going to be completely inside this circle, the black circle. You can check this. And if the circle here, the blue one, is perpendicular to the black one, then actually it's an invariant. It remains the same. Right? This is invariant. This inversion. Now, there is one nice thing: is that if you have two circles outside your black circle, which are tangent, well, this tangency is preserved by the inversion, right? The corresponding circles of the inversion is going to be, they're going to be tangent. So it's tangency preserving this fabric. Okay, so if I know this, So if I know this, let me come back to this example here, the Tetrahedron. Well, let me apply the inversions here. So take three circles here, take this equal here, and I'm going to make the inversion of all the circles with respect to this one. Now, this is the intersection here is 90 degree. So this is the same, this is the same, this is the same. Is the same, this is the same, this is the same, but the exterior one it goes to the interior one, and then because it preserves tangency, then it goes on that way. And then I have another circle. I take the corresponding inversive circles, I take this, and again, and again, and again. So, with this inverse thing, I can actually produce. Produce the Apollonius packing, but not anymore, not by using anymore the Apollonius theorem, it's just by inversions. And of course, with these inversions, I can start with whatever configuration you like, right? If you give me these configurations, well, I'm going to play around with exactly the same thing. Take a circle, and then you're going to make the inverse of that circle. With respect to that circle. Then, the three of them, the two that are here and the big one, are the same because they are perpendicular to the blue one. But the exterior one goes to the interior and they preserve the agency. So it is on that way. And then I do it again and again. Here are the gaskets. Here I start with the teacher Heathrow. We have done it before. Done it before. This one is the octahedral, which is this. You see, here the sizes are a little bit different. There are two big, two smaller, two mediums, one smaller. Here we have three of the same, four of the same size, and here is different, but I play around with exactly the same way, right? And then I can start with a Q if you would like. And you have this. Okay. Now, you see here, we start with the tetrahedra with the cube and the other was the octahedral. Well, can I do that in dimension D? And the answer is yes, we can do some, we can Produce sphere packings by using polytops, actually. Let me explain how we do this. Take your polytop, d-dimensional polytope, d plus one-dimensional polytope. And we say that there's exterior, sphere exterior, which means that you take your polytope and the sphere is inside the polytope. Well, not completely side, but what you need is that actually the vertices are outside of the polytope. The sphere may cut. The positable. The sphere may cut some faces, but all the verses must be outside. And why we do this? Because we can produce arrangements of bolts like this. Here is my polytop, this prism here. This advertise, advertise, advertise, advertise. I take a vertex here, illuminate it, and look for the shadow of the sphere. That, that gives you a circle, which is one of those circles. That gives you a circle, which is one of the circles there. And I do exactly the same for each vertex. Now, notice two things. If the edge here cuts the sphere, that translates into the correspondent circles are disjoint. And the other way around. If the edge is outside the sphere, then the corresponding circles intersect. But I want a sphere package, right? I want that spheres that are tangent. So, what I need is actually edges that are tangent to the sphere. In that case, the corresponding circles are going to be tangent. Not disjoint, not interior intersected tangent. Right? So, we need this kind of polytos that we call H scribable. And from this, applying this kind of thing. Applying this kind of thing, I can obtain what we call a polytop packing. Now, of course, not political, not all speed packings are political packings, that's for sure. One nice thing here is that actually, given one political packing, which comes from Polytop P, we can talk about we can talk about the dual packing, which comes from the dual polytope or the polar of P. So you have the polytope P, you have the polar of P, and you construct the two corresponding packets and these two packets are really close related. Okay. Here we are. In dimension three, you have the ecosahedron and the spolar. And spolar. I don't know if you can see it, but here is one. And then the other one is the blue one here. This is one vertex, this is one edge, this is one edge, another edge. So there is P and it's polar. I play around with the lights and I get that thing here. And I have this. And this is exactly where we have, right? This is a circle packing theorem, I took it. And that's the way to prove it. This is exactly the circle packing theory. To the cycle pipeline side. Good. Now, one interesting here, one interesting thing here is that we can do this in any dimension. Okay, before I give you the dimension, this is just to show you that actually the representations of the packets can be a little bit different. All are Mobius equivalent, all of these. But we can actually. Describe why they're equivalent by using the polytope. For instance, here you have your polytope. I take one vertex and I put it to the infinity to the north of the sphere. I take the projection, I obtain this. But now if you take your polytope, take one edge, whatever you like, take the middle of that edge, and then you rotate your polytope in order to have this middle here. This middle here in the north, made the projection, you have this. And then, and so on, you have one phase, take the gravity point of that phase, put it in the north, project, and you have the other. So, all these Movie's transformations from one to another can be really nicely described by using just the polytope. Okay. So, as I said, we can do this. So as I said, we can do this in any dimension. So let's take a four-dimensional polytope and we're going to construct the corresponding ball packing, right? So that's the four, that's the ball packing. And then once I have this, I can play around with inversions, right? We have a ball, you have a ball, then you inverse all the points with respect to this ball here, and that gives you more. And that gives you more balls like this, and again, more and more and more and more. And then you have your sphere packing there. But this kind of sphere packing is very useful because we have behind these combinatorics here. And that will be very, very useful for us. Okay. First of all, we We prove that for any link, we can admit a necklace representation by using both in this sphere packing. The O4 is the orthoplishial in dimension 4. So it's the octahedral in dimension 4, if you like. You take this polyton dimension 4, you make your polytipod packing, like with your packing, well. Like with a packing, well, we can prove that there is a representation there. There you go. You see, now, in order to prove this, I use this, what we call the sandwich representation, right? You have plane here and plane there and everything in there. If I take this and I start, you know, making versions to versions more and more and more and more, I will have this kind of thing. This kind of green. Of thing. This is a kind of greed in this sandwich there. So, what we prove actually for this theorem there is you give me the link, apply Alexander's theorem that give you a braid. And this braid, you're going to embed in this grid. And then in this grid, you translate this into the bolts. And that's the representation. Right? So, we can do it. Do it. Actually, we can do it exactly the same if we start with T4, which is the tetrahedron in the four dimensions, or C4, which is just the upper Q, right? And there you go. I do exactly the same. I take this Andrew's representation, I have a grid, and I embed my brave in this. Raid in this grid here. Now, that's nice. That's okay. And then, if you see, he looks very, but once I have a mobile representation, the classical one, look at this. It looks like this. Of course, the representation moves. This is from T4. This is the octave in four dimensions, and that is the upper cube. That representation. That representation. Now, the thing is, this is nice, and we think we can use this for some other things, but not for the ball number. Because for the ball number, we need to go to this Alexander theorem, right? So you start with a certain number of crossings, and then this depends on the number of braids and number of crossings in the brace, which is not really... So it's complicated. You may have something, but it is not very good. So we say, okay, don't worry, we do this. We do this. One interesting thing in these sphere packings is what we call the sections. So you have your sphere packings, take a plane and you cut it. And you're going to keep all the bolts that are on that plane. So that gives you what we call the section of this packet here. So this is. So, this is the first step of the autopilot packing. I cut it. And you see, now my plane is here. That's my plane. So, I saw it from above, if you like. This is its thing. And this I can then just project into the plane, this plane here, and I have that configuration. And that configuration, we know what it is, right? This, we have seen it before. It's the octahedral. So, actually, in your three-dimensional thing, Actually, in your three-dimensional thing, by cutting with planes, you can find actually the Apollonius packing. So we do this for the autopilicial. And this is for the tetrahedra. So you have the tetrahedra there. That's good. And you do the satisfy the same for the cube. There you go. This is the one we're going to use. This is very interesting for us. This is very interesting for us. Okay, now given this, now let us come back to not. We're going to try to study the ball number of algebraic notes, or algebraic links. Okay? Now recall how these algebraic links are defined as you have the two tangles, you have element. Two tangles, you have elementary two tangles. Suppose this is more or less standard for world of view. And then you have operation of these tangles, you have the sum of two tangles. And then you have all these operations, which is minus t, which is just make it like this. And then you have the flip operation, which is a rotation through this x here, just made it like this. Here, just made it like this, and then you have the H plus, which is just make an extra crossing on this way and then add up, or H minus, which is the other crossing, and you add up. You have the depth. Okay. Khan will say that define these rational tangles by making this just these basic operations, right? So you start with. So you start with an elementary crossing here. I take, I normally take the T infinity and apply flip edge flip edge flip edge. So I have an example here. There you go. So I have T infinity. Then I take a flip. I'll take this that makes like this. And I take an H minus three. So it is some distance. I take three turns. I take three turns and then I add up. And that gives me this. And then again, take a flip, let me take these flips here, which is this bit here, and take h two minus two, two minus and so on, and sum up. And the last one plus the same. That'll give you a triangle. And all tangles are formed like this, right? That's a way, a nice way to see things. Given a tangle, we can define the angle link by taking the closure of this tangle, which is numerator to the denominator. And for each triangle, we can define the slope of that triangle, which is a very nice thing. You say you take your AIs, you know that you can consider this continuous expansion, continuous fraction. Continuous expansion, continuous fractional expansion, and it is known that this is always a rational number, which is pq, and this pq is the slope of that correspondent tank. And then, of course, I have to mention this, one of the most beautiful results. Yeah, it's a gym, right? It's a beautiful result. It's kind of result that says that two rational tangles are the same if. Tangles are the same if and only if they have the same slope. Beauty. Beauty. Okay. Okay, now we know what these rational links are. Let us come back to the autopilot packing. So you have your packings, something like this. You have your plan, you have balls, you have the projections you have there. And you see here black. Black means that the balls, the center of the balls, are above this plane. White means that the center are below. So if I take this projection, I can just color it in black and white on this way. So I start with the auto-conservation package, always auto-consumer. Check the section. Always automatic jump. I check the section, and that gives me this cubic section. Okay. If I have a look a little bit closer to this, you see if I take the first eight points of the autoplicial, fourth-dimensional autoplish, that gives me this, and this is the graph. So I take this, I take the projection, and this is the complete graph. All these edges means that the corresponding balls are That the corresponding balls are tangent. Now, let me represent this just by this. I know that there are more, but I'm not really interested in this. I just take this. And one thing which is very useful is you see there is an edge here from black to black. There is an edge from whites to white. And I know that the blacks are above the upper plane, the whites are below. The whites are below. So, this edge, I know it is like this, it's above the white edge. And that's very important. If I take this, I apply one go to make more balls, I take the projections, what's happened is actually that this fellow here is here, the largest one. Each square becomes exactly the same. Becomes exactly the same. You see, you have one little square inside of a big square, but now your big square is here, and you must have one little square here, one little square here. And if I do it again, then all the squares are going to have one little square and one little square. That is the translation only this making this goes with inversions and having more balls and balls and balls and balls. So I have this here, and I know which edge this is above this, and so on. So, what we're going to do is to imitate, just imitate what Conway has done. Exactly the same. I have the sum. You see, if you can represent something with this diagram, this is the sum, right? You say, well, take one go, this little square here. little squares are here, t prime and t, and they just add up. That's the sum. And I do exactly the same for any other operational convey. But now I play in my diagram. And then playing with this, we can prove that any rational link can be embedded in this cubic diagram. And I just pointed with exactly the same. Pointed with exactly the same way as come with defined the rational note. Here we are. So, for instance, you take this note here, that is the cubic representation. So, this is the segments that I use. And you can see more or less exactly the same method as convoys, right? But now it is in this cube, this particular cube. And this is nice because this particular cube means this particular embedding here, right? Now, we can check that actually for each crossing, we need four balls, right? One here, one there, one there, two blacks. So for each crossing, and then if I have n crossings, I must have n balls. Now here we talk about of algebraic links. This is okay, this representation for rational. For rational, and I can add up two rationals that give me an algebraic link. But unfortunately, we need that this must have the same sign. All these slopes must have the same sign. If they have difference of one, they have few pluses and a few minus, we don't know. Every one plus every minus, we know. And in that case, then we're just counting, and this gives me four times. So we have proof. Okay, now at the beginning we said that we believe it's always four times n, a must. We also said that this alternating must be exactly four times n. But what about if it is non-alternating? Can we be lower than four times n? Well, the answer is yes. And for this, we need this. And for this, we need these presser links, which are the tangles from this form there. And we can prove that you take these pressure links, 3 minus 3. This is a non-alternating link, which is 8, 19 in this table, Rossen's table. And we have these autocubic representations with that many of us, which cancel. There you go. So, which is less than 34, which is 4 times 8, 8, which is the crossing number of this value here. There you go. This is an example. Right. So, we can do less with this non-alternating, we can actually say. It is non-alternating, we can actually say things that is not foreign. Very good. Okay, very good. Have probably 15 minutes more. So we believe that all these representations, we can use it for ball numbers, but we can use it for many other things. And that's where we are actually exploiting this. What about this? What about? Okay. Okay. And I think this is a nice approach and we can actually may have some surprises. And I'm going to tell you why. This is really unexpected for us. It comes out like a gift, right? You say, well, I'll tell you what I have, but I don't know why I got this. And it has to do with number theory. Given this representation, in those This representation in the orthocubic diagram, I'm going to define a very particular point what I call NPQ. What is this? You have your diagram, right? You make this and this, and you look for the last H in your representation, which means the last two balls in your representations, once you construct it. And you're going to have a look. And you're going to have a look at the tangency point of these two special bulbs. Well, okay, there you go. This is a representation. This is the last edge here, right? Then this edge is because this ball here and this small ball here. I take this intersection there. I'm going to have a look at this intersection. Don't tell me why. Don't tell me why I'm going to have a look at this intersection. The third thing is that we prove that if I take a line from the origin going through this point, the slope is given by this. Now, you may say, well, why do you need the slope? Because then I can compute the inverse coordinate in Lorentz theory of this, exactly this point. And that gives me that result. I can find infinitely many integer solutions to that equation, that Diafant equation. Amazing, right? Say, well, I just compute the inverse of this particular point, and I can do it because I know the slope and this in here. And of course, from here, well. And of course, from here, well, take this point, take the largest inner product of this point with itself equals zero. You develop, and you have this. And there you go. One solution of this tile here is A, B, and C given by this. And of course, I can do it for any P and Q. So you have infinitely many solutions. Now. Now, we are actually trying to understand why this is. Probably there are some more things, but it is surprising, right? It is a little bit surprising that it comes out. And I think I have a couple of more examples. There you go. So this is the eight figure eight, 16 spheres. And this is the question. And also I put one torus naught, which is the phi one. Not which is the phi one. This is the slope of that node here. 20 spheres. Okay, I think this is it. So thank you for your attention. Is there any question of maybe the people at Zoom? By the people at Zoom, is there any question? The cover of the packing. For each circle, you have a cover, right? Which is the inverse of the radius. Of the radius, and we want to know what is the connection. If I have, for instance, four, one, two, three, four, what is the connection to this? And there is a big terror of this code that says that the square of this plus the square of this plus the square of this plus the square of this is equals to two times the sum of the squares. The square of the sums. Does this cut us? And actually, we can extend all these in any dimension, so that gives me. And that gives me definite equations and stuff like this. So that's the connection. I don't know. I don't know. Do you expect any relation with another? Relation with another not invariant, like cost volume, or something like that. Very good. Very good. Now we actually try to relate this with safer surfaces. Imagine that I give you some links to take the surface surface, the surface, the safer surface. The surface, the safer surface. And you want to triangulate this. You want a piece linear triangulation of this. Right? And I ask you, how many triangles? You may have lots of triangles, aren't they? You may really piece linear with real triangles. How many you need?
