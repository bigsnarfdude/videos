So Duncan is coming to us from, well it could be anywhere in the world, but I assume Princeton. It is still Princeton, yes. Okay. And he'll talk about the Aerie Sheet. Okay, thanks. Thanks for the invitation. So I will go ahead and get started then. So this is based on joint work with Janos Oortman. With Janus Oortmann and Bahan Birak. So, we're going to be working with a model of last passage percolation called Brownian last passage percolation. I'll start by explaining the model. So, I'm going to have a sequence of n independent Brownian motions. Okay. And then I'm going to consider a function pi from an interval xy to the set 1 up to n. And for our purposes, pi is always going to be non-increasing. Okay, and then I can define the weight of pi with respect to the Brownian motions b in the following way. So dB of pi is going to be, I'll write the formula and then I'll explain what I mean. So it's the sum from i equals 1 to n of b i of pi i minus b i of pi i plus one. Pi i plus one. So pi i is going to be the time when pi jumps from line i to line i minus one. So I've drawn a sample hal pi in the picture. So you can see pi at x, it's starting at n. At x, it's starting at n, and at y, pi ends at 1. And what dB of pi is, is you just sort of superimpose the graph of pi on these Brownian motions, and we're going to collect all of the increments here. So for example, at Bi, we jump up to line i at time pi i plus 1 and jump off at time pi i, and you collect the increment bi of pi i minus b i of pi i plus 1. Okay? So that's Okay, so that's the weight of a path. And then the last passage value, Brownian last passage value, b from x to y is the maximum of dB of pi, where this max is over all pi going from xy to 1n, which are Which are non-increasing. Okay, so this is the Brownian last passage value. And if a path pi achieves this maximum, I'm going to call that a geodesic. Okay, so this is a model of last passage percolation. You can think of it either as a random growth model or as, in some sense, as a model of a random metric. In some sense, as a model of a random metric, except instead of in a random metric, you'd be looking at minimal length paths. Here we look at maximal length paths. Okay, and it lies within the KPZ universality class, and it's a particularly nice model. It's integrable, and we can say a lot about it. So, what I'm going to talk about today is the following theorem, which is Which is okay due to myself and Janus and Balant. So, first, let me define the scaling. So, I'll let s n of xy, this is going to be the Brownian last passage percolation value. I'm using the superscript n to indicate that we have n Brownian motions from 2x n to the minus 1/3 to 1 plus 2y times n to the minus 1 third. To the minus one-third. And then if we subtract off a mean term and rescale, then this object converges in distribution. So the mean term is 2 root n plus twice y minus x n to the 1 sixth. And then we need to rescale the entire thing by n to the 1 sixth. So then Sn converges in distribution to a limit S. To a limit s. So s is a function from r2 to r and it's continuous. And this s is the Airy sheet. Okay. And I won't talk too much about the type of convergence here. It's a functional convergence. So you can think of these as functions as living in the space as random continuous functions from R2 to R with, say, the. Functions from R2 to R with, say, the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. Okay, so I'm going to focus on this today. A couple of things to note about S are you can, the Airy sheet is a fundamental limiting object here. So in particular, you expect that S is a universal limit. Universal limit. So, right now we've only proven this for Brownian last passage correctation, but you expect to see it in all sorts of random growth models. In particular, and it's a work in progress, that this should also be the limit of, say, exponential geometric last passage percolation, other nice integral models. Another thing you can do is what we've done here is just take the scaling limit of Brownian last passage percolation where we're varying what I'm going to call the spatial. What I'm going to call the spatial coordinates, but you could also vary the line that you start on, and then you'd have four parameters to vary. And it turns out you can build this four parameters limit from S. So you can build the four parameter scaling limit from asked. And this is And this is the directed landscape. And just like you can build the scaling limit of all last passage values, you can also use the ARIES sheet as a fundamental building block to get the scaling limit of the geodesics. But what I want to talk about today is just give some sense of how we prove. Gives some sense of how we prove this theorem here. So, the usual approach to, or sort of the classical approach to KPZ limits, certainly with Brownian last passage regulation, is there are many things that can be expressed here through formulas. So there are nice formulas for the last passage value between two fixed points, or between one fixed point and one endpoint, where you're allowed to vary that endpoint along a line. Endpoint along a line. But there aren't, okay, as far as we know, there aren't nice formulas for the last passage value between two endpoints as you're allowed to vary both of the endpoints. So our approach to proving this theorem is a little bit different. It doesn't rely, it sort of we use formulas as a starting point, but we aren't actually able to obtain explicit formulas for this F. So you need a different route. But I'm going to start with this classical approach. Classical approach to Brownian passage percolation. So, this is essentially going to describe a continuous version of the RSK correspondence for those who are familiar. So, I'll extend the definition of last passage in the following way. So, I'm going to let bk from x to y be the maximum over the sum from i equals 1 to k. I equals 1 to K of dB of pi i, where here the max is over all sets of disjoint paths pi i from x y to 1n, which are not increasing. So a Not increasing. So a sample set of paths is kind of drawn here. So this would be with k equals four. So the disjointness condition is disjointness on the open interval x, y, if you will, in the picture, because we're allowing them to kind of share endpoints. So you imagine that you have geodesics which are a tat, where they're not going to be geodesics, but you're optimizing over paths with the same start and endpoint, but they have this enforced disjointness condition. Disjointness condition. Okay, and then with this definition, we can create a map, which I'll call the Mellon map from B to W. So it's going to send the Brownian motions B1 to Bn to a sequence W1 through Wn, which we define in the following way. So each Wi is going to be a continuous function from 0 infinity to R. And W1 has a simple. And w1 has a simple rule. So w1 of y is just the Brownian last passage value from 0 up to y. Okay. And then the others you define in the following way with this sum. So the sum from i equals 1 to k of w i of y is the k-fold last passage value from 0 to y. Okay, so for example, you can think of w2 is think of w2 is uh w2 is how much extra weight you can get by adding in an extra disjoint path and what you can at least kind of imagine though this is not a proof is that you're going to get diminishing returns from adding each one of these extra disjoint paths so in particular this means that the w's are ordered so deterministically you have w1 greater or equal w2 and so on all the way up to And so on, all the way up to Wn. So, this is deterministic. And other than the fact that they're all zero at the start, these inequalities are actually almost surely strict everywhere for Brownian mass passwords percolation. So, this is kind of how I imagine this B to W map: you start with unrelated independent Brownian motions, and then you can send this to And then you can send this to W1 through Wn, and you can all, you can superimpose the graphs of W1 through WN on top of each other, and then they're ordered in this way. And this is why we get this term melon, because these kind of resemble stripes on a watermelon. Maybe if I add a few more in. Okay. So what's nice is that this W, one, it One, it's clearly encoding some information about the last passage value. So, in particular, it encodes last passage values from zero up to a point as you vary that point. And it has a very nice structure. So, this is a theorem due to O'Connell and Yor, which says the following: So W W has the law of n non-intersecting Brownian motions. So, and Brownian motions conditioned all with the same starting point condition never to intersect. Okay, so you need to condition in some limiting sense. Or alternately, Or alternately, W is the eigenvalue process of Hermitian matrix Brownian motion. And both of these representations are really nice. So the fact that it's non-intersecting Brownian motion, so you can Brownian motion. So you can, you have the Carlin-McGregor formula for non-intersecting Brownian motions. So you get nice determinantal formulas for the probabilities that the Wi's are in particular places. And so W is really amenable to asymptotics. And so let me give sort of the strongest asymptotic result you can say about W. So again, I'm going to first define the rescaling. So I'll let A N I of Y be W again, N indicating that we have N Brownian motions, Wi from at 1 plus 2y n to the minus 1 third. And then again, we subtract off the And then again, we subtract off a mean term, 2 root n plus 2y, and rescale by n to the 1/6. So then this a n sequence, which I'm going to call an 1, an 2, a n3, and so on. This converges to a limiting object A. To a limiting object A, which is A1, A2, and so on. And A is the airy line ensemble. So this will be sort of very familiar for those who were in Ivan's course earlier in the week. Okay, so this theorem about melan asymptotics, sort of for a single point, proving this for Brownian last passage percolation, doing this for last passage percolation doing this for i equals one and y equals zero showing that this converges was done by in two separate papers by Gravner Tracy and Woodam and Baryshnikov and then sort of constructing the area line ensemble in terms of its finite dimensional distributions is due to Preoffer and Schmohn and the definitive version of this theorem in terms of getting functional convergence and distribution here is due to Corwin and Hannond. To Corwin and Hammond. So let's, this is kind of the picture of what's happening here. So I look at my Mellon W, okay, and I look at a window around time one, and I have an order n to the minus one-third spatial window, and order one number of lines here. And then this, after subtracting the appropriate. After subtracting the appropriate mean term, converges to a limit A. And you can think of A as a collection of non-intersect, a collection of infinitely many non-intersecting Brownian motions with sort of some rules for how they behave as time goes to plus and minus infinity. Okay, so the question is: So, if I say, what does this tell us about Brownian last passage percolation so again I have this formula that w of y or w one Of y or w1 of y is the Brownian last passage value from 0 up to y. So, this is what it's going to tell us something about. So, I have my starting point 0, and I'm looking at all last passive values to this top in an order n to the minus one third window here. So, I'm just going to shear and scale this picture. And then, after I shear and scale, I get an object that looks sort of like this. So, if you draw G adds. So, if you draw geodesics to multiple points from a starting point zero, you see this tree structure. So, the geodesics like to stay together for a while to pick up good portions of the Brownian motions, and then they split off at some point after that. And so, what this melon asymptotics result, this Airy Line ensemble, tells you the joint scaling limit of all of these values here. Here. And also, that's just for the top line. Also, you have other lines below. So it's also telling you the scaling limit of last passage value of these multipath last passage values that look something like this. Okay. This is how you can kind of visualize this result. And so you might think, well, it seems like this is. Think, well, it seems like this is telling us. You might ask, is this telling you anything more? So, for example, if you know that this, the last passage value to this point is large, that tells you that somewhere along a geodesic path, there's some good portion of your space. So there's some good portion of weights that you're allowed to pass through. Okay. And similarly, if a last passage value here is small, it tells you that that part of your space. Here is small, it tells you that that part of your space is somehow lacking. And so you might say, Well, we know a lot of different last passage values, we know a lot of multi-path last passage values. Maybe we're able to understand enough of our space in this way that we can actually extract more information. And it turns out this is the case. So what you can do is you can basically from the Airy line ensemble, if you fix a point here, so this is xn to the minus one code. So in here it would be xn. Minus one third. So in here it would be x n to the minus one third. It turns out that the Airy line ensemble also contains the last passage values from this point xn to the minus one third like this in a really kind of complicated way. But this is the key to getting convergence to the Airy sheet. So let me explain how this works. How do you get This works. How do you get last passage values from a point other than zero? So the starting point for this is a kind of interesting combinatorial identity. So, which is quite surprising the first time you see it, so maybe let me. Maybe let me. So for any x less than y bigger than zero, the last passage value across the Brownian motions from x to y is actually the same as the last passage value across the Mellon functions from x to y. So remember, we're starting with n branches. We're starting with n Brownian motions, and then you have this map. So you're taking a set of n functions to another set of n functions. It's still perfectly reasonable to define last passage across these functions, but you might not think it has any interesting content. But it turns out this is the case, that b from x to y is always the same as w from x to y. So this is the kind of picture in the scaling coordinates. I start with my environment of lines. Lines and this last passage value is the same as last passage across the melon between the same points. Okay, and for this identity, so this went when working on the paper, this was sort of discovered independently. But it turns out that this actually goes all the way back to a paper from the early 2000s of Bian Bougerol and O'Connell. And O'Connell. And there's sort of another related paper of Notmi and Yamada that also, again, independently of the Bianbuirol and O'Connell paper, also essentially obtains this result, though they don't quite state it in those terms. So you might think, well, is this good for anything? So we know that the melon is nice, it's non-intersecting Brownian motions, but why would last passage across Why would last passage across Brownian motions conditioned and conditioned not to intersect be simpler than last passage across Brownian motions with no conditioning whatsoever? So you should expect that, so you shouldn't necessarily expect that this is much of an improvement. But what turns out to be the case is at the scales we're looking at, the branching structure of geodesics in the melon is much simpler than the branching structure of geodesics here. Structure of geodesics here. So it turns out, so at this order n to the minus one-third scale, the branching structure in the melon is simpler. Okay, so this already makes you hopefully think: okay, if you can understand the branching structure is simpler, maybe it's going to be easier to take limits this way. So why would this be the case? So let's start with the simplest thing, which is just geodesics from zero. So in the original Brownian motions, If I look at the geodesics from zero up to the top line, I see this kind of complicated tree structure. And now I can ask, well, what do those geodesics look like in the melons? So now zero is here, and I have a bunch of non-intersecting paths like this. And because of the non-intersection structure, there's never going to be any. There's never going to be any reason to use any of these lines other than the top line when you're creating a last passage pass. So, the optimal last passage strategy in the melon is jump up to the top line and stay there. So, the geodesics here just all follow the top line. So, I just have my one geodesic following the top line up to one, and then the others just go a little bit further than that. Okay, so it's Okay, so it's so the upshot is: you know, we had a complicated branching structure here where there's lots of branch points and they're all happening in the bulk. And in the melon, everything became completely trivial. So you might think, well, this is only so interesting. We already know that the melon has contains the last passage values from zero. That's kind of straight from definition. But now you could think, well, let's. But now you can think, well, let's look at a point x n to the minus one-third, which is pretty close to zero, but not exactly equal to zero. So again, what's going to happen here is when x is pretty close to zero, typically if you look at the last the geodesics from xn to the minus one-third up to these points here, they'll join up with these geodesics from zero. Okay, and so other than some discrepancy at the bottom, these last passage trees are exactly the same. So in particular, what this tells you is in the picture, the Brownian last passage value from zero. 0 to z minus the Brownian last passage value from 0 to 1. This is equal to the same thing as the Brownian last passage value from X to Z minus the last passage value from X to one for all Z in Z in say one. Maybe I'll give this guy a name. I'll call this one plus Z naught n to the minus one third. For all Z in one, one plus Z naught times n to the minus one third. So as you vary z, these increments are the same. And we know that this is also true in W. By this identity, by this nice combinatorial identity. So now you can think: well, what does this mean about the last passage or about the geodesics in W? So I'll first draw my geodesic up to one. Maybe it does something like this. You could think, well, how could the increments of all of these geodesics, starting from xn to the minus one-third, be the same as the geodesics from zero? Well, basically, just like in this picture, they're going to need to share the same part of the path. The sort of differences in the paths are going to need to be exactly the same. So, what that means is if I look at my geodesic from xn to the minus one-third, not to one, but to a One-third not to one, but to a point later on. So this is sort of one plus z for some z in the middle. Then it has to follow this exact same path and just extend a bit further. So these green dots need to be doing the same thing as the red dots. Just like the geodesic changes in the original Brownian picture were the same from x and from zero. They need to be the same in this melon picture. So the point is. So the point is, in both cases, the branching structure. So, in this case, the branching structure from x to this interval becomes trivial in the melon. So the branching structure from x n to the minus one third to this interval. Is trivial in this Mellon W. Now, this is not generally the case. So, the thing that we did here is we chose x that was sort of close enough to zero so that we saw this effect. But if x is far away, but still on this order n to the minus one-third scale, then you don't expect these things to have the exact same branching structure. But it turns out that the branching structure in the melon is still much. Is still much simpler than it is in the original Brownian motions. So now this is sort of, you can imagine this being a larger gap between 0 and x in this next picture. And I have, say, some branching structure here. When I go into the melon, I may have some other branching structure that looks like this. Looks like this, but whereas, and all of these points are in the bulk of your Brownian motions, all these branch points get sent to the top corner. So they get sent to an order one region here and an order n to the minus one third region in this direction. So in the extreme case, before they were all the branch points were getting pushed onto the top line. Here, all the branch points are just getting pushed into. Here, all the branch points are just getting pushed into some top corner. Okay, so rather than your branching all taking place in the bulk, like they do in the original Brownian motions, they're taking place in the top corner. Okay, so this is a complicated thing to prove, but hopefully it's at least believable given this picture up here. So what is this good for? Well, we know that the top corner here converges to the Airy Lion ensemble. The Airy line ensemble. Okay, so this is the object that converges to the Airy Line Ensemble A. And all of the interesting branching information here is happening in this top corner. So that really suggests that the last passage values from xn to the minus one-third up to different points here should be contained in A. So for example, we can do the following thing. So if I say I wanted to look If I say I wanted to look at the difference between the melon last passage value to this point and this point. So that's just the difference between this and this guy here, which is just the same as the difference between the last passage values not starting at the base, xn to the minus one-third, but starting at some point in this top corner. corner. So I have w from xn to the minus one-third to one plus y into the minus one-third minus w xn to the minus one-third to one plus z into the minus one-third. This is equal to the same thing from some point star where Where star is in the top corner. And in fact, you can let this, if you kind of look at the picture, our choice of this star is not quite unique. You can choose any point. Maybe if I zoom in on this picture a little bit. So this choice of star. Choice of star. I could have chosen any point along here. And what's more is if I don't quite choose a point on this path, but I just choose a point which is pretty close, then it's likely that we're going to connect up and the differences will still be the same. So, if you can estimate the location of this power. The location of this path pretty well, and choose a deterministic point which is close by. You might be able to express this difference in terms of a difference of two last passage values from a deterministic point, which is now sitting somewhere in the top of this melon that converges to the Airy line ensemble. Okay, and so this is the key thing which allows us to get the Airy feet. So let me express. So let me express, I'll write down what the ARIE sheet is in terms of the ARIE line ensemble. So definition the Airy sheet S from R two to R two is the unique Unique in law, I mean function, continuous function, satisfying two properties. So one is sort of a just a basic stationarity property. So S is equal in distribution to S of T plus dot T plus dot for plus dot for any T and R and the second property is kind of the key thing which is how it's related to the Airy line ensemble so S can be coupled to an Airy line ensemble A so that So that well, the first thing is that if our if we start at the point zero, then this is just going to be the top curve of the Airy line ensemble. So this is the limiting information which is contained in the Airy line ensemble in the obvious way. Okay, so we get the limit of all last passage values starting at zero. And secondly, Secondly, for every X in Q plus and Y Z in Q, the Airy sheet value from X Y, the difference between the X Y value and the X Z value is equal to The maybe let me, but for every x and q plus y z and q, there exists a random k in n such that for k greater than or equal to this random k, we have the following. This random k, we have the following: s of xy minus s of xz is equal to the difference between two Airy line ensemble last passage values. So it's the Airy line ensemble last passage value from xkk up to y minus xk up to z. So I'm, I'll explain what this is. I'm. I'll explain what this is with a picture in a second, kind of breaking my convention because I no longer am doing last passage across a set of n lines. So I need to, I'm always going to be ending at line one, but I need to specify my starting line now. And here, if you're curious, the value of xk is negative square root k over 2x. So what you have is If I draw this Airy line ensemble, the difference between these two last passage values is the difference between, or the difference between these two areas sheet values, I should say, is the difference between two last passage values in A from a point xk from a time xk at line. From a time xk at line k going up to line one. So this is this is when I go back up here. This star is what you're going to be able to take as xk comma k. And the point is, even though the location on the last passage path in the melon was random, it was always close to xk. XKK to the point where you can say, okay, the difference between these two things by this coalescence idea, the difference between the two last passage values from XKK up to these two points is the same as the difference between the two last passage values from X10 to the minus one-third all the way down at line n. All right, so that's all I wanted to say. I'll stop there for questions. Okay, thank you, Duncan.
