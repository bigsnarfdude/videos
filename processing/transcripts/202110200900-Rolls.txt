Okay, cool. Okay. Sorry about it. No, that's fine. So we are back at the dendrite branch point. We're thinking about what happens to new microtubules when they come in. So if they grow down towards the cell body, no problem. This is still a minus send out microtubule. But if they grow in the opposite direction, now you've generated a plus send out microtubule. Generated a blessing of microtubule in the polarity bolar tubu. So we observed this in vivo a long time ago. This was my first project when I started my lab, and found that most microtubules do this, so 98% of the time. And we identified the machinery that allows them to do that. And what happens is pinesin2 is hooked onto the plus end of the microtubule with its motor domain out through APC and EB1. And when this new microtubule When this new microtubule encounters a pre-existing one, the kinesin can recognize the polarity and will start walking towards the plescent. And this drags the growing plus end down towards the cell body. And once we figured this out, Will Hancock's lab was able to reconstitute this steering process in vitro. Okay, so what I've told you then is so far we have these four mechanisms that contribute to the minus endel polarity in benefits. And alpolarity in dendrites. And three of them take place at dendrite branch points. So, to give you a feel for what that looks like, I'm going to show you this movie of a couple of branch points with microtubules growing into them, being made in them. Okay, so you can see that the branch points really are quite dynamic spots where microtubules are constantly choosing what to do. Okay. So, this was way more common. This was way more complicated than I thought it would be when I started to think about this problem when I started my lab. So, we have all these independent mechanisms that use different machinery to control polarity. And I think you need all these mechanisms for a couple of reasons. First, as you saw, the microtubules are dynamic. So you have to constantly reinforce polarity for very long time scales. Second, as you'll see, Scales. Second, as you'll see at the end, this polarity has to be responsive to other things going in on the cell. So it's not fixed. It can be maintained for a lifetime, but it can also change. Okay, so this is a complexity that is difficult for us to assemble just by sitting here and thinking about it. And so this is where our collaboration with Veronica and Scott came in to try to put this together into a framework that will allow. Together into a framework that will allow us to understand it more deeply. Alright, thanks, Melissa. So, as Melissa very clearly outlined, this is a very nice system for modeling. It's essentially a 2D geometry, but really, if we focus within a branch or if we focus within each of the trunk or each of the branches of the dendrite, we really have one-dimensional geometry, even. And so, what I'll show you in the first few And so what I'll show you in the first few slides is a very preliminary, like version 0.0, if you want, kind of model that we used to sort of establish our common language and vocabulary with the lab. And even this very simplified model that you'll see had a lot of assumptions, helped us make some biological insights. So what we did here is we basically constrained the spatial dynamics to these compartments. So you can kind of tell there's four compartments in the trunk. In the trunk, the way they're drawn there, and there's a couple compartments in each of the dendrites. And so the way that the microtubules were navigating in this model, the dendrite, was by jumping essentially between these different compartments, but abiding by those mechanisms that have been identified in the lab. So they had different probabilities and stochastic transitions between different states to do so. And so what you're kind of seeing here is the establishment of polarity. Is the establishment of polarity, and wherever you're seeing this thicker rectangle? There were more microtubules in the model that were vocalizing there with that minus polarity. A big, big assumption here was that we had these microtubules fixed. They were fixed-like microtubules. And that's a huge and unrealistic assumption. But we've heard some talks in the conference so far, and Bill yesterday talked about a model where it's okay to make that assumption, that there's not That assumption that there's not, that we don't include essentially polymerization to polymerization dynamics. And what you'll see here is that I'm not going to make that point. In fact, our version 0.1 will show you how we don't do that. But for a first attempt, this is how we decided to approach it. So the couple of insights that we got from this simple model were that we were expecting in Evo in experiments to see the To see the polarity of microtubules in the tips of branches to be pretty much mixed. In our model, what we were seeing is that the plus ends, which makes sense, right, they were growing into the tips of the branches and they were accumulating there at percentages that were not seen in experiments. And so that made us think about whether there's something that happens at those tips of the branches that we're not capturing in the model. And in fact, in Vivo, in the Rawls lab, they were able... Vivo and the Rolls lab, they were able to confirm higher photostrophe rates at the end of the tips. And now they're new hypotheses that they want to test it that there might be an enzyme, maybe a deep lemmerase that destabilizes those ends at the deptoite tips. So that was one of the first insights. Another was that, again, in vivo, in situations where they're able to interfere with steerings, to take steering out essentially. So that mechanism that seems to be pretty important for polarity. That seems to be pretty important for polarity establishment, it would see about 50% my descent double polarity. In our model, we were still seeing more than half my descent outparity, so predominant my descent outpulity, despite taking that mechanism out. So that made us think that some other mechanisms in there we might need to refine. So instead of actually using these percentages of how new microtubules are nucleated with the bias force, the cell body, instead, The cell body. Instead, we want to look at a feedback mechanism of how they're growing in the correct direction by building on the tracks that are already there and the polarity of the tracks that are already there. And I will tell you a little bit more about that in future slides. And so now in the new version, what we're trying to do is actually go back and understand the dynamics of microtuples, their turnover. And so microtuples have dynamic ends. And so microtupils have dynamic ends, just like Melissa. To me, it was very clear from before, from my work on cargo transport on microtupilles that plus ends grow and undergo catastrophe. But frankly, it was kind of mind-blowing to me that minus ends can do that too. And even though they're slower, it's a more sustained growth. And not only that, but it's very important for establishing this polarity that's very important in neurons. And so, as the way that we are modeling this essentially my Are modeling this essentially micro-scale microtubule dynamics that we have a mental stochastic model, a Markov tube model, that's between growth and shrinking at each end. And as you can imagine, these stochastic processes are actually coupled to each other because you might imagine those two ends shrinking or one of the ends shrinking into the other, and that leads to complete catastrophe of that microtubule. And I will say here that I know there's people in the audience who have worked on it more complexly. The audience would have worked on more complex tubulent assembly models at either end of microtubules, probably more the plus end. But we, for now, don't think that that kind of complexity is really needed. And we're focusing our detailed modeling effort more into the navigation and spatial organization of microtubules in the branch brain. And so, in this new version of the model, we are incorporating this dynamic microphone. Incorporating this dynamic microtubule of ends. And so, what you're seeing here are climographs of both a plus end of growth and shrinking and minus end growth and shrinking. And what is really, really exciting to me about this is that we are able to get parameters from this for this system. We essentially have an idea of what the speeds and even distribution of the speeds are for both plus n's and minus n's. We have an idea of the average amount of time. Of the average amount of time that is spent in either the growth or the shrinking phase for both the plus and minus end. So that's really exciting that we don't have to have that many parameters in this micro scale model of microtubule pipeline. All right, and so this new model incorporates this dynamic microtubule turnover and it has these variable length microtubules that are now living in two dimensions. You can see how they can be within the tongue, they could be Then the trunk, it would be curved at the trunk into the branches, and so on. Very important to us in this kind of model is to make it modular. And what I mean by that is that we can vary the number of branches and branch points. And that's because in Vivo, it is observed that different neurons have different number of branch points in their dendrites. And so that's something that we want to understand, the impact of that kind of parameter on polarity. And so on the right, you're just seeing. And so on the right, you're just seeing maintenance of variety in one single simulation. So, what this modeling creates is all of the super mechanisms that Bellissa talked about. So one of them is the bio group about, but essentially, you can look at the orange microtubules. Again, the arrow is the plus end, the added profession is the minus end. And so they can either grow with the minus end at the cell body, and we're reading that in the Body, and we're incorporating that at the bottom now, but also they can grow at the minus end and in comet branch point and have to make decisions. So, that's one of the mechanisms we're incorporating. Another one is that nucleation at branch point that we talked about already. In the first round of this model, we were using the actual probabilities from observed experiments, observed in experiments, of nucleation biases in each direction, but now we're incorporating feedback from experiments. Now we're incorporating feedback from existing microtubules. So, say looking again at that orbit microtubule, its decision to basically nucleate towards the cell body to have its plus end down and minus end up would be based on a probability that weighs how many tracks are there with that orientation in which it's financing from. So, for the third one, we know that once they do nucleate, there's also this catastrophe zone or survival problem. Catastrophe zone or survival probability for these microtropics. And we actually have never really used the exact percentages or probabilities. We, from the start, have been using a sort of feedback mechanism, though we're probably adjusting that moving forward. So far, what we're doing is if this orange microtubule nucleated and is going towards the cell body, we allow it to survive, with polymerization, polymerization dynamics, if there are any available practical tracks in that generation. Facts and that just more realistic to use a probability instead, and that's something we will get into. And finally, steering is very important. And again, here, as this orange microtubule comes in, what we want to do is we want to get a sense of locally at that branch point, at that spatial location, what kind of tracks can it encounter for a Canesian motor to steer it in any given direction. So again, we're incorporating a feedback mechanism. Rating a feedback mechanism based on the available existing tracks. All right, um, I think this is the video. So, this would show you what the dynamics looks like right now with minus and I send out microtubules and minus and out our light purple here. And what you'll see here is that it kind of maintains the polarity, but it turns out if we run this for longer, that can switch, and so that's why we're revisiting all of the mechanisms. Revisiting all of the mechanisms that I've talked about, and we're trying to incorporate more and more of our understanding of what happens in ego. So some ways in which we'll validate this dynamics, and in particular the microtubal turnover dynamics, so that growth and epolymerization at the plastic minus ends, will be by using some exciting experiments on tubling photo conversion. So here there's a window that There's a window that is chosen along an axon or a dendrite, a section of an axon or a dendrite. And so you can see that red tubulate protein that's being trapped there, and then it's being observed as time goes on. And so you can see, for example, in the axon that both at zero and at one hour, the amount of fluorescence in that windows seems to be relatively about the same as the microtechnicals in there are very stable. In the thin dry, you can see how some of that fluorescence goes down. See how some of that fluorescence goes down, and in fact, the whole spot has quantification of this. This is just for illustration purposes. But what you're seeing is more dynamic, this would be okay for us to validate our model, to basically take a section in our model, and essentially model this. One of our very exciting goals, perhaps ambitious, but very exciting, is to combine this model with all of these ego experiences. Model with all of these ego experiments to understand this really fascinating experiment. So it turns out that when the axon is injured running under the cell body, so where Melissa's pooping right now, what happens is that a dendrite will essentially convert into a regenerating axon. What that requires though, as you've seen in the previous slides of what the microtubularity looks like in a dendrite versus an axon, is that really Versus an axon is that really all the microtubules in that previous dendrite have to flip their polarity. So they're now plus end out instead of minus end out. So that's really fascinating, both from the point of view of the biology that it's able to remodel itself, but also from a dynamical systems point of view. And so we are interested in understanding what parameters and individual mechanisms might be at play and might help us understand that kind of reversal. That kind of reversal. As the flips, you can see what happens is there might be a transition state where the bicrotupicle polarity is mixed, and then one of the dendrite is selected to convert into that regenerated axon. And it turns out that some preliminary work in the lab is showing that what's happening at those purple zones there, at the catastrophe zones, might be very important in determining, in selecting the dendrite that's essentially... The dendrite that's essentially going to convert its polarity, flip its polarity entirely. It tends to be that the spimbled dendrite that you see on the bottom right is the one that converts its polarity, rather than the most coned dendrite that you see on the top of this figure. So that's interesting, and we don't really understand if it has to do with the number of branch points, with the branch angle, and certainly these are things that we're going to look into. We're also interested in whether there's any Interested in whether there's any bicepility in this dynamical system. So, is it equally likely that we could get a plus send out and a minus send out polarity and there's some tipping zone in the middle where decisions are made based on some stochastic fluctuation? Or is it that if we start with an initial asymmetry, say with plus endow polarity, then the feedback mechanisms that we understand are just going to consolidate that polarity through. I already. And so we definitely will be exploring that kind of question with the stochastic model. But hopefully, in the future, as we understand this better and as we try to coarse brain it, we could also approach it with partial or stochastic differential equations that would be easier to analyze. So with that, thank you so much for your attention. These are the people who contributed. And missing from here is Melissa Rawls' group that pretty much took any of our suggestions. much took any of our suggestions and went and tested them and told pay by parameters. It's been just an amazing collaboration and we're looking forward to trying to answer some of the many open questions that exist in this problem. So thank you very much. Thank you. This is a very beautiful example of a collaboration and I love how you tested all the different review mechanisms. So I have any questions? Mechanisms. So, are there any questions from online participants? I don't see anybody with a hand raised, so. Maybe I could ask a question. Yeah, beautiful talk and also beautiful collaboration between experiment and computational modeling. My question is about more on the structural level. In terms of this mixed polarity or sem polarity, Or semarity interactions between microtubules in that ring, polarity, reinforcement processes. Is there anything known whether just microtubules themselves prefer to be next to each other in the same polarity direction, opposite direction, whether there are cross-linking proteins that somehow would help to determine that? Yes, so most microjectubial cross-linking proteins. Most microtubial cross-linking proteins don't care about polarity, but the one that I had on that we've identified as part of this, the branch point exit, Trend 9, is the fly version of Trend 48. And Casper Hoganrod's lab has shown that that is a very special microtubule bundling protein that will only bundle parallel-oriented microtubules. So they're probably, I mean, we heard earlier in one of the talks about this idea that you can zipper up filaments to kind of reinforce them. We have not looked much at that type of mechanism. So that may also play a role in controlling organization, and that's the only place we've looked at that so far is with the term nine and that kind of probability success probability. Yeah, that's another potential. But yeah, that's another potential missing piece. Thanks. Any other online questions? Let's go to the in-person audience then. Hi, this is Leah. Beautiful work. Is there any evidence of an angle dependence at the branch point? Yes, there is. So the place where we looked at this was with the Looked at this was with the spearing mechanism. And what, so there are different types of sensitivity neurons in this Drosophila larval skin, and they have different branch angles. So the one that I've been showing, this the one we've looked at the most, has very right angle branches. And so you have this, anything coming into the branch really geometrically has almost equal probability of each direction. There are other dendrites that have acute, and this is. Dendrites that have acute, and this is actually much more normal, acute angle branches. And so, if you get rid of that kinasein tube-mediated steering in the neurons that I showed with the right-angle branches, you go about 50-50 mixed. In acute-angle dendrites, it's 70-30. So, there definitely is a geometric effect. We've looked at it with respect to that one mechanism. I think one of the things I think one of the things that we're planning on doing is building that into the model and going back and looking at some of the other dendrites with different branch angles to see which mechanisms are influenced by geometry. I think that's a really interesting direction because the geometry of dendrites is really important to their function and may make some of them more susceptible to losing polarity than others. Yeah, that's a great question. Currently, we don't have it. Great question. Currently, we don't have it in the model because we didn't know which mechanisms would be affected by it. But that's something we're interested in. Yeah, if I may add, I seem to recall, Eric Sicky remembers that UBC had a model of mercury to polarization plants where the probability of catastrophe depended on the angle. Okay. And I don't know if that's something that's also seen in this system or not. So with that, I think that's an Not so with that, I think that's an encounter angle between microtubules, maybe? Yeah, angle dependence. I can't remember. Yeah, here, because we, so we do see when we have collisions, I think it's a collision scenario. When we have collisions, because we have pines in II, they don't catastrophe, but if you get rid of that, you do see some catastrophe. So I think it depends a little bit on the machinery that's there. And we haven't looked at And we haven't looked at too much at whether there's hotspots for a catastrophe other than those branch point exits, which would be kind of interesting to look at as well. Okay, great. I see Alfred Chand has a question. Hi. Have you considered whether microtubules bumping into the cortex at the tip of the dendrite, that physical mechanism might cause the microtubule to shrink? I think that's what's being thought in Pomby, at least. In Pombi, at least. And also, when microtubiles have to go into a dendrite, there's this bend. And I wonder if there's mechanical effects there on dynamics. Yes, so okay, so the tip, again, that's something that our initial round of modeling made us think we should look at more. And anyway, there's the potential for physical interaction and also maybe depletion local depletion of TLN. Local depletion of tubulin. And all we know so far is you do have sort of longer pauses often at the tip than elsewhere and increased catastrophe. We just haven't looked a ton at that yet. In other places, like at the branch point when the microtubules come in, we considered originally that they might hit the plasma membrane, but in fact, they seem to be grabbed almost always. Be grabbed almost always because of having motors associated with the tip by other microtubule. So there are a lot of microtubule-microtubule interactions and less microtubule cortex ones as far as we can tell. And then the angle, yeah, so we've taken that into, okay, but only when we think about sort of probabilities of going in each direction. And again, we haven't really implemented that into the model. The strain, I mean, the microtubules. Strain. I mean, the microtubules seem to be able to bend pretty well. You obviously don't see sharp bends, but they can accommodate some interesting geometries. So we have another question in the room here. Yeah, hi, this is Dave Odi. Really nice talk. I was wondering about microtubule transport generally. You show the tip being moved by kinesin, a kinesin to steer it. To steer it appropriately, but just generally do just, it looks like the model currently just kind of ignores transport, otherwise, it's all the movement of the comets is attributed to polymerization. The photo conversion may look like they're not moving that much, but when you talk about long time scales of days, I'd just be curious how you think about the experimental system. So, sliding. So, you're, yeah, so Mike, what do you go sliding? So microtubule sliding. In mature neurons, sliding does not seem to be a major contributor to moving at least any of the microtubules that we can visualize around. It's possible that small pieces of microtubules could be transported, but the long ones really are locked in place. And in flies, that's due to action of kinesin 6 piveroti that counteracts kinesin 1-mediated sliding. And in mammalian cells, let's see, the motors that counteract that. See, the motors that counteract that, I think, are Kynes in 12 and 5. That's worked from Peter Bottas' lab. So, yeah, so we tend to ignore sliding, but that's because there is some biological reason to ignore it. I don't know if David's question was also about other kind of cargo transport. I mean, we're interested in sort of combining this kind of modeling with transport of various signaling. With transport of various signaling molecules moving forward, too, in case you were getting at that as well. Thanks. Okay, I think we should move on to Pete Kramer's talk.
