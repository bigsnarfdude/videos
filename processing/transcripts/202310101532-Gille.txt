 Yeah, if you just turn the speakers down, that's an object. It's very, can you say something? Okay, so I'm Canada, we extracted it, and I mentioned organizations to organize this conference, because it was 15, and also my vulnerability. So, this is a report on joint work with Bob Curanik. Bob Kirani on USC with mostly final group theories. So there was some connection between him and myself and not direct, it was by Jean-Pierce, so it was quite funny. We we exchanged mails. We exchanged mails, the three of us, and so we'll see the results of the beginning of this exchange of mail with Jean-Pierre Seven and Robert Laney. So everything is actually about LG3. So this volume, which was done by Domai Ricotten Dick 60 years ago. And about dimension of group scheme. So if you have G over S, a group scheme, so S is a big scheme. So S is a big scheme. So you can take uh a n i and a a finite presentation. Okay, so if you don't like the generality, okay, you can take S to be the spectrum of a ring and G to be a subgroup of G L, a subgroup scheme of GLN. Okay, and then an immediate application of Chevalier semi-continuity is that when you look at a Is that when you look at the function of dimension, so S, to you take a point S and you look at the dimension of Gs. So Gs you have to see the allergy reproof of KS, but you can go to the residue field on time. Is upper semi-continuous Function. And so, what means a per se continuous in multiple geometry? It means when you specialize, the function increases. We will see. And what you find in a G3, which is not a trivalent statement, this is by Kodenvik in 6B. This is This is this function B is locally constant, so namely continuous, the same thing. This is the same thing that G is flat. Okay, so of course, if G is flat, we know that the dimension of fiber are the same, but locally. But that's okay. So, So we are interested in various dimensions, but I will just detail one, which is a unipotent dimension. So if g over k, so not this k is a field, g is an algebraic group, then you can take this unipoton dimension. What it is, so the reason why I'm talking about it. So the reason why I'm talking about it unipotent dimension and not unipotent one is that even total one is already taken to energy. So we are talking about something slightly different. So this is a dimension of U yeah where U inside so you take G k bar inside G k bar it is uh unipotent it's a maximum uh position position. Is a supreme all dimension of U, where U is a unipotent smooth. And of course, this thing does not vary when you best change your field. It's stable under arbitrary field extension because the two dimensions are easy. And so this is the absolute version. And so this is the the absolute version, okay, and you have the the we with the you have the same thing at the level of K. So U inside of G, U smooth uni bottom. You can perconnect traditionally and of course this one This one does not care. Why? Because if you if K is fine, I think they are great, okay? We have equality. And because as you know, you can reduce everything to the case of a reductive group. And for a reductive group, you know, there are always a spin and so on. So there are no between these two dimensions. Yes. And why are we interested in that? So this is where the title called the stabilizer. So you have G, say, over K. And K here is finite stream. You have G acting some variety X. K variety D. So for me, this is a separator at a stream of. For me, this is a separator at the screen or case screen of an app. And you can look at the stabilizer. So, what is the stabilizer? You take x times x and you want the diagonal here. Here, you run the map, g tags x, the action map, which takes g x x. x x and g x. And here, of course, when you take the postlight, you get a group, which is the group scheme over x, which is called the universal standards or something. And of course, what happened is that each time you put, you take a point X. You take a point X and you take the fiber, H is the thing which is within IX. So that's a way to protein family hot stabilizing. And if case a finite field, you need to know that unipotons, s a sm smooth unipotent subgroup, that the same thing when you take sig in terms of rational power, they are the same thing that the pesilo in fallen algorithms. Will fall in algorithms. Okay? So now I stand the mind theorem of today, and I explain you how it applies to this tabulazar itself. So the mine theorem G over face about enter G and G. That's myself. Okay. So GF. It's not okay. Are you over us? Okay. So you take your whole scheme, of course, of finite presentation. And then the function d the this one, t u. DU on S to Z on J We take a Z and place this DU on G on S as well. These occurs to be continuous. So it has what you expect of one function. And so a very important thing is that there are no assumptions. Is that there are no assumptions on this G. Okay, so this is very general. Okay, I'm not assuming, for example, flat or something like that. Because this guy here has no reason to be flat. And you know, think about when you take your presentation and stabilize the off point, okay, so the dimension varies and it's not flat, okay? So this is really important. Is it affine or not? What? Is it affine or not at all? No, no, it's not affine. It's not affine or not. No, it's everything. No, it's everything. It's not even separated, okay? But of course, later I will put separated because, you know, why am Coran is not in the room, the upper case? I'm fine with several. But we can. No, this is very and very general and very simple too. Don't be okay. And so, what is the consequence in terms of these things? So, what happens is that if in Is that if in the example okay if we take X I mean to be a if X connected and you put D is a is this unimportant thing of hydrogenic points, okay? But then it means it implies that for all X we have We have D u of HX which is larger than D and then it would mean that when you put if you take X the rational port okay it will imply that hash X contains a subgroup Of order P program. So, of course, it's not exactly, it's not necessarily a zero because with the dimension, you know, we do not make that connected component. We do not see anything about the connected components. Okay, but that's exactly the statement. This kind of statement like that and variation in which uranium Uh in which uh Kirani and co and his collaborator were interested. Okay, so now uh uh I have time I have time to prove uh to theorem and uh okay. So I I thought a proposition, so a proposition So, composition, this is when, I mean, S is the spec air and air is a regular vocabulary. Okay, so you have two fields, you have the function field and the reusability field. Okay, and so you have G over S as a O so I claim that this absolute relative thing, so D u of G K is a K is uh sorry increase when you go to E. And so the proof. So the key case actually, this is when A or A is a D V L. Okay, so we'll see later. Only system is the premium after Okay, so what is so? I call this this number. So, what is and my assumption is says that I have u inside g k smooth unipotent of dimension d And what I can do is, okay, and so I just say G, G is separate here, so G is separated. When you have such a situation, the basic operation is to take the so-called schematic adherence. And so, schematic adherence give you that use, I mean, that thing is only because we are in. That thing is only because we are in dimension one, okay? Because you can always take schematic adherents, but the fact that schematic adherent in dimension one commute with product makes the schematic adherent a Bulkovsky. Okay, so you have this, and this guy knows he's a tail skin and he's flat. Okay, and C is just separated. Okay, so now I use Renault theorem. Renault theorem tells me that if I have a flat group scheme of A whose generic fiber is affine and which is separated, then this U is affine. But if U is alphine, it is linear. So this is an argument which goes back to say. Argument which goes back to SERE, you know, to construct a faceful representation for a flat rock scheme, affine fabric scheme, or a DVL. Okay, so then you can embed there exists a closed embody on E, the San J over F. Okay, but as you know, uniproton groups are trigonalizable, okay, over a field. Okay, and then so you can be trigonal level and trigonalizable is just you know to stabilize a borrower of GLA. Is that to say? The complete flat, right? The complete flag, right? So, why is this schematic? Because when you do x1 times x2, and you take the schematic array, this is this commute. So that's the result. And of course, it's just wrong in IOD image. Okay, but as you know, Boger of Genesis is completely flag, but the Complete flag, but the scheme of complete flags, this is proper, okay? So, what I'm saying is this Borwell, okay, or GNB. Actually, it is defined, it comes from Borwell defined on A, right? And then, of course, when you look at this schematic, okay, this implies that this U is inside this bore, okay, and have to make a vision. I can assume that I'm I can I can assume that that I'm okay. Okay. But this is I mean this U over here I know. But no this is this is over because the U is unipotent. So he's not only in I mean, what I'm saying is that this UA, I vote U, but I did not state before that it was unipotent, but it is unipotent. Because what it means unipotent is the upper triangular since maybe the morphism torus goes to zero, but this morphism is trivial when you go to K. So this UA is unique button, it's flat. Button is flat. I mean, he's inside UN. And when you go to K, okay, is you need button? And of course, since it was flat of dimensions. So just by this small trick to use the value added. Uh the the the valuable criterion of properness for for this variative but also proof of GNF. I I I got I I I found here. Okay. So okay. And the more. And the way to go to a regular recovery is just to make an addiction of the number of parameters. This is easy. Okay. Okay, and now I can prove my generality away, which is just a variant of that. Okay, and again, I will the variant is there. So proof of the new theorem. So again, I mean, there are reductions to the DPA. To the dBA I can't. So, so, but here it's more complicated than that diagram because we want to show that D of G, this one, is that. But that thing, what is the assumption? I call it D. So it means That there exists a finite extension k prime of k that so g k prime contains some some some some u prime of k prime. So what you do, you take F time, you take the function field of a D V A. So we have a finite extension D V A loop. We can normalize. So we can take F final normalization. So it is a D V R2. And what you do, you do exactly what I have done here. Okay, but for A prime and K prime. And then And then, uh, what you get? Yeah, yeah, sorry. Now, it's so simple, and okay. And then, by using the same trick, the argument at all, we find some uv over k prime. So, k prime is a is a a prime. He's a prime prime inside G K prime with that one really important. But of course, when I look here at this D, okay, then I'm authorized to go up in the galvano. Okay, and then it implies that I TK. I GK is large as that. Okay, so the species of UK would not be smooth. No, no, I'm not saying let's assume a smooth lesson. No, no, no, no. No, only the dimension matters. Okay, so and so of course, once you have done that, you know, yes, 35 minutes, you can add, okay, maybe there are other interesting dimensions to to deal with, okay? To deal with. And actually, there are plenty of them which behave exactly the same way. So, as you can see here, what was very crucial, that was a string of the other seats. So, we can prove similar similar results. Similar results for example for trigonalizable if you take a trigonalizer to report the set, but you not only that you can do for example solvable alpha you can do solvable You can do uh solvable you can do uh uh and more and more need buttons and and okay, so and and then it tells you that this this kind of property uh we uh we will work for that. Of course, not everything works, okay? So this keep variable, the ask of whether if we take Of equator, if we take the derived dimension, okay, so that so namely we look at the dimension of the derived group. So, of course, derived group, you have to be a bit careful because you can do only for a smooth. So, you go to the algebraic closure, you you take the reduced part and you take uh and you and and that dimension uh uh is not aversely continuous. A version equal to that is lower semi-continuous. Okay, so of course if you read the paper, it is not as simple because we do all cases in the same time. We do also the non-separated case because Conrad asked us to make it etc. So it's a bit heavier. But anyway, I mean the the conclusion is The conclusion is that this thing was not in the SGS3 group and can be used. Thank you. Other questions? Or a concrete application for you to sort of? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Look at the current need and collaborators. Yes, yes, yes. Because you know, once you put, I mean, action of finite groups, I mean, you are, you know. It's very strange to me that they needed that far to justify kind of experimental approach. So, which is a and uh bed bed, yes, because if you do But yes, because if you don't know this, I mean, just this small argument which is there, you will not see it, okay? Let me say that there was another more complicated way to deal with that, which is the remark in a paper, was to use the work of a paper by Dolgal Chef and Reisweil. And this paper is And this paper is a is a classification of unipotent group scheme of aerobase, whatever it means, one dimensional. And so if you take your Docker chef-based file with you, you can also prove this kind of statement. But this is much more complicated, I mean, to go by to the Docker chef. Um paper by Richards seventies about stabilizers in general position under much stronger assumptions. That's that's okay, I mean for that we can have we can have algebraic. I mean I of course I did this uh over a ski based scheme, but uh Over base scheme, but for this paper, the important cases is over FP or FPAR. So, which paper? Because there are several paper which are. Okay, so I will look at each other by thinking that particular setting doesn't include. Yeah, yes, but I was not aware. Thank you. I will look. Further questions, comments? Let's try and feel it again. Quick break of five minutes.
