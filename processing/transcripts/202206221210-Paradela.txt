Give attack in this nice workshop. Today I'm going to talk about the existence of Fernal diffusion in the restricted planar elliptic three-body problem. And this is a joint work with my PhD thesis advisors, Marcel Guardia and Teresa, both at UPC. So, well, we will start by describing this problem. Here we have two primary bodies, one of mass. Primary bodies, one of mass μ and the other one of mass 1 minus μ, where μ is normalized to be between 0 and 1/2. These primaries move on an ellipse of eccentricity epsilon, which is between zero and one. And well, this ellipse is determined by Kepler's laws for the two-body problem. Our goal here is to describe. Our goal here is to describe the motion of a massless body which moves on the same plane as the primaries. This body is affected by the gravitational interaction with the primaries, but since it has zero mass, it does not affect their motion. So, well, we can describe the motion of this massless particle by a Hamiltonian system, which is a mechanical system. We have a kinetic We have a kinetic term here and a potential which represents the gravitational interaction with the first body and with the second body. We will be interested in studying this problem from a perturbative approach. So the classical perturbative setting in which this problem has been analyzed is to take the mass ratio really small. That means that one of the primary That means that one of the primaries has a big mass and the other one has a small mass. So, intuitively, the third body only sees one heavy body and the other interaction can be considered as a perturbation. If we expand the Hamiltonian in powers of mu, we get that we can write our Hamiltonian for this restricted problem as the Hamiltonian of the two-body problem plus an order mu problem. Body problem plus an order mu perturbation. We are not interested in this perturbative regime. We instead let mu between zero and one half and study a region of the phase space where the third body is really far away from the primaries. Intuitively, if you are really far away, you only see one heavy body at the center of mass of the primaries. Again, if we expand in powers of one over modulus of Q, the Hamiltonian. One over modulus of q, the Hamiltonian, we get that the Hamiltonian of this restricted problem can be expressed as the Hamiltonian of a two-body problem plus an order modulus of q to the minus 3 perturbation. Okay, so well, we are now in a perturbative setting to study this restricted problem. And well, the first question that one asks is, for example, there are two questions: what aspects of the dynamics? What aspects of the dynamics of the integrable model remain, or which new behavior, chaotic, and well-phenomena can emerge in this perturbed problem? A natural question is to ask what happens to the quantities that are conserved in the integrable model. For this model, the conserved quantities in the two-body problem would be the energy and the angular momentum. In this work, we are interested in particular in the following question that is In question, that is if there exists orbits of the restricted planar elliptic three-body problem for which the angular momentum experiences arbitrarily large variations. So, in the three-body problem, this is a conserved quantity, and we want to build orbits in this perturbative problem, which is the restricted planar three-body problem, along which G is not only not a conservative quantity, but experiences. Conservative quantity, but experiences arbitrarily large variations. This is a phenomenon usually referred to in the literature as Arnold diffusion. The first important result in this direction is due to Amedeo del Sam, Sabran de la Rosa, Vadim Calochin and Terre Sierra, which showed that there exists a value G star large enough such that for any pair G2 and G1 above this value, if you take the mass ratio exponentially. Mass ratio exponentially is small with respect to j2 and the eccentricity also small enough. Then there exists a time t and an orbit, which is defined on this time interval, for which the value of the angular momentum at time zero is below g1 and the value at time t is above g2. Okay, this is an important result because it was the first complete analytic proof of Arnold diffusion in celestial mechanics. However, it is valid under really strict restrictive Really restrictive hypothesis on the parameters, the mass ratio, and the eccentricity. In particular, this is due to the fact that the proof relies on Arnold's trick, that you take a doubly perturbative regime. You not only assume the angular momentum being large enough, that we will see later, this corresponds to the third body being really far from the primaries, but they also take the mass ratio exponentially. The mass ratio exponentially small with respect to G. This we will see later is due to the fact that in this problem there is an exponentially small splitting between some invariant manifolds and they solve this problem using this trick of taking an extra parameter which is exponentially small. Now I will comment the main result we have obtained, well, in collaboration with Marcel and Terre in this problem, which is the following. We fix any value of the mass weight. We fix any value of the mass ratio between 0 and 12, and then we show that there exists a value g star such that for any pair g2 and g1 above this value, taking the eccentricity small enough, then there exists a time t and an orbit of this restricted problem for which the value of the angular momentum at zero is below g1 and the value of the angular momentum at time t is above g2. Okay, so we can produce arbitrarily large variations in the angular. Large variations in the argular momentum as well. It's remarkable that the theorem holds for any μ between 0 and 1/2. And as far as I know, this constitutes the first complete analytic proof of Arnold diffusion, which does not use Arnold strict. That is, we do not take an extra parameter to overcome this exponentially small splitting phenomenon. The diffusion mechanism, well, this construction is based on a diffusion mechanism which A diffusion mechanism, which is based on a transition chain of periodic orbits, and the rest of the talk will be devoted to explaining this diffusion diffusion mechanism. First, we will give some heuristics. And well, the first question is, where do we look in the phase space for these diffusive orbits? So it is well known that one has to look for resonances to travel along these resonances. To travel along this resonance. So here's a picture of the extended phase space of the two-body problem written in McGee coordinates. These McGehe coordinates bring the infinity to the origin. And in these coordinates, the extended phase space of the two-body problem is a direct product of something which is more or less a Daffing oscillator and something which I will call a cylinder, which is the product of a two-torus times the vertical one. Okay? So Okay, so well, it happens that in this problem, the origin, the product of the origin, and this cylinder is a normally parabolic invariant manifold, P infinity, whose vertical direction is parameterized by the value of the angular momentum. We will see that we can use this cylinder, which is associated to a double resonance of the system, as a highway to construct diffusive orbits in the angular momentum. In particular, the construction has two main particular the construction has two main ingredients which is the first one is to prove that this parabolic invariant manifold has a stable and unstable manifolds which intersect transversally then we get an homoclinic manifold to this to this cylinder inside this homoclinic manifold we will be that we will build a secret a sequence of homoclinic orbits along which g experiences a large variation i mean we will build a sequence of Will build a sequence of heteroclinic orbits which connect different points on this infinity manifold along which the value of G grows as much as we want. Okay, it is also an interesting question. Why not look at these diffusive orbits in the circular problem, which is easier to analyze? And I want to give some heuristics. And I want to give some heuristics on the existence of obstacles to prove this existence of diffusive orbits in the circular problem. The first one is that G is constant on the intersection of this invariant manifold with constant energy levels. So we cannot use P infinity as a highway for diffusion in G. Also, after reducing by rotational symmetry, this system has only two degrees of freedom. So in the region of bounded mode, So, in the region of bounded motions, which corresponds to negative energies in that plane, the KAM TOI separate the phase space. So, there is no change for diffusion also in that region. However, for arbitrarily small eccentricity, that is in the elliptic problem, we have one extra degree of freedom. And this allows us to build these diffusive orbits in the angular momentum G. So, well, the rest of the So, well, the rest of the talk will be devoted to go deeper into these two main ingredients, which are the first one, the existence of this parabolic invariant manifold at infinity, and the existence of transversal intersections between its stable and unstable manifolds. And second, we will talk later about how this result is used to build a transition chain of periodic orbits along with half-ifusion. So, well, to see this invariant manifold at infinity, it's convenient to introduce a change to polar coordinates. This change, of course, is symplectic. Here, y is the momentum conjugated to r, the radius. G is the angular momentum, which is the variable conjugated to the angle t, and e is the momentum conjugated to time because I like to autonomize the system. In these polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian. These polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian has this expression, and V goes to zero as R goes to infinity. Okay, we identify this from the equations of motion. It's straightforward to see this, that P infinity is an invariant manifold. Actually, it's a parabolic invariant manifold. The eigenvalues vanishes. And this P infinity corresponds to have R equal to infinity, Y equal to zero, and E equal to zero. This invariant manifold is. zero. This invariant manifold is contained at the zero energy level, which is where we will work from now on. Associated to this parabolic invariant manifold, one can define the following stable and unstable invariant sets. For example, the stable set is defined as the set of points in M in the configuration space for which there exists a point in the infinity manifold such that if one looks Such that if one looks at the difference of the orbits of the point x and the point z when t goes to infinity, this difference goes to zero. That is, the orbit of the point x and the orbit of the point z synchronize asymptotically for time going to infinity. The unstable manifold is defined analogously, but taking t going to minus infinity. Yes, or in the yes, for example, yeah. Yes, if you want to see in the normal coordinates, you understand that R goes to infinity simply. It's now a classical result due to Magishi for the circular problem and to Valdoman-Fontig for the elliptic, and I think that even more general cases, that these sets are analytic submanifolds except at the origin where they are symphony. This is not trivial at first. This is not trivial at first because we recall that this is a parabolic invariant manifold, not hyperbolic invariant manifold. Well, as we said, now that we have existence of these invariant manifolds, we are interested in proving that they intersect transversally. So, since we want to look at them in a perturbative approach, the first thing that we do is to look at what happens to this. To look at what happens to these manifolds in the two-body problem. So it happens that the manifold P infinity is also invariant for the flow of the two-body problem. And moreover, with integrability of the two-body problem, the stable and unstable manifolds coincide along a homoclinic manifold. In order to see the perturbative approach, if we look at the portion of this homoclinic manifold, which lies on the region of the phase space with large angles. Of the phase space with large angular momentum, we see that the R-coordinate is always bounded below by a really large quantity. So we will see that if we study now the invariant manifolds of the restricted problem, if we look at the portion which is contained in the region of the phase space with large angular momentum, we can look at them as a perturbation of the invariant manifolds of the two-body problem. Of the two-body problem. Because we remember that when we are far away, when R is really big, the restricted three-body problem can be seen as a perturbation of the two-body problem. And thanks to this observation, if we are, oh, sorry, here should be an intersection. If we look at the stable map. If we look at the stable manifolds in the region of large alpolar momentum, the radial coordinate is always really big. So we can look at these invariant manifolds as perturbation of the homoclinic manifold, which is present in the two-body problem. So, well, in this problem, of course, we do not expect them to coincide as in the two-body problem, but we have proved the following and is the following. The invariant manifolds, W manifolds W U and S, the stable and a stable manifold, intersect transversely along two different four-dimensional homoclinic manifolds, gamma one and gamma two. Well, this was the first step in the construction of this diffusion mechanism we mentioned at the beginning. And I would like now to comment which is the main difficulty to prove this theorem. To prove this theorem and also to give some heuristics of what we do for the proof. As I was talking at the beginning, the problem here is that there is a direction in which the splitting of the invariant manifolds is exponentially small. And to see this, it is convenient to do an scaling. We introduce a parameter g star and do the following scaling. Scaling okay. This scaling is symplectic, and the new Hamiltonian in the scale variables has this expression. From this expression, we can see two things. First is that this perturbative potential B can be seen as a perturbation or the G star to the minus one. Okay, so it's a perturbation. However, we also see that the evolution of the variable t is really fast. Is really fast. We have, therefore, a fast and small perturbation coupled to a slow system, which would be this one, with a parabolic invariant manifold. As many experts here know, this leads to the fact that the invariant manifolds of, well, that the stable and unstable manifolds of this parabolic invariant manifold have exponentially small sp for those who are not familiar with this phenomenon. Are not familiar with this phenomenon? This can be explained more or less heuristically as follows. We only have one fast angle in this Hamiltonian, which is T, so one can perform successive averaging transformations to transform this Hamiltonian into an autonomous Hamiltonian plus an exponentially small reminder. Okay, this autonomous Hamiltonian also has P infinity as an invariant mass. has p infinity as an invariant manifold and by counting dimensions one sees that is a stable and a stable manifold must coincide so the perturbation which now is ordered exponentially small can break this homoclinic manifold but only but the distance must be bounded by an exponentially small quantity. This is more or less a really heuristic approach but more or less the idea behind the exponentially small splitting is that Is that and well, I will talk now about what we do to prove this existence of transversal intersections. And it's the following. To study the splitting between the stable and a stable manifold, we take advantage of the fact that this invariant cylinder at infinity, P infinity, is foliated by resonance. We will talk about this later, invariant or i. Therefore, the stable or i Stable or unstable manifolds can be expressed as the union of the stable and unstable manifold of each tori. These stable and unstable manifolds of a given tori happen to be Lagrangian submanifolds. Therefore, we can parametrize them in terms of a generating function, which is solution to the following Jacobi equation. Q is the vector in the base manifold, and delta G is the vector of. delta g is the defect of exactness of the torus in the cylinder. And we look for a inst to look for transversal intersections between the stable manifold associated to a torre ig and the unstable manifold associated to a tori g prime, we have to look for critical points of this function simply. So we have reduced the problem of existence of traversal intersections. Existence of traversal intersections to the existence of critical points of these functions, of this function. In order to, since the difference between the stable and unstable manifolds is exponentially small, in order to prove the existence of critical points of this function, we follow Lasutkin ideas for the standard map and study the analytic continuation of these generating functions to a complex common domain. I would like to. Domain. I would like to do two remarks in this slide. And it is: well, the first one is that classically, one is not able to solve this Hamilton-Jacobi equation directly in this setting and has to rely on parametrization methods or other different methods. But we are able to solve this well, and we have been. And we have been able to solve this Hamilton-Jacob equation through a Newton method in this case. This was only known to the case of the case of one and a half degrees of freedom. And the other remark is that even if the splitting between the invariant manifolds is exponentially small in one direction, we are able to connect to ri, which for which the difference between g is Difference between g is not exponentially small but polynomially close. This, I think, that is also the first time well this has been done. And well, this is more or less the ideas that go for the first part of this, well, for the first main ingredient of this mechanism we talked about at the beginning, which is this transition chain of torite. Now that we have Now that we have these transversal intersections between the invariant manifolds, we will talk a bit about how to construct a transition chain of periodic orbits along which we increase the value of the angular moment. Well, the fact that there are transversal intersections of the stable and unstable manifold along two different homoclinic manifolds allows to define two different scattering maps which encode the data which Which encode the dynamics along these homoclinic manifolds. Namely, to a point alpha minus and G mass, we can associate a point to which it is asymptotic in the future along a petroclinic orbit contained in the homoclinic manifold. Okay, so to alpha minus G mass G minus, we can associate a point alpha plus G plus along these heteroclinic orbits, which are Heteroclinic orbits, which are on each of the homoclinic manifolds. There is one difficulty here, one extra difficulty here in this problem for the construction of the transition chain, which is the fact that the dynamic, the inner dynamics on the infinity manifold is trivial. If one analyzes the vector field restricted to P infinity, it vanishes completely. So on P infinity, we have trivial linear dynamics. It is foliated by P. It is foliated by fixed points. Therefore, the classical approach of combining inner dynamics and scattering map cannot be applied for this problem, but we are able to combine the two different scattering maps and show that you can still produce orbits along which you climb in the cylinder. This is a bit difficult because the difference between the scattering maps is exponentially small. So it is a bit difficult. So, it is a bit difficult to show that they are different indeed. And well, the main result which allows us to bring a, well, this is the main result which shows that we can build this transition chain and is that we fix any value of the mass ratio between zero and one half. And then we show that there exists a value G star such that for any pair G2 and G1 above this value, there exists a sequence of There exists a sequence of scattering maps and points such that the point at the step K plus one is the application of the scattering map I K to the point Z K and such that the projection in the G component of the point Z one is below G one and the projection of the J component of the point Z n is above G two. is above G2. That is, at each step, we can select which scattering map to apply to produce a new point, to produce a new point, and we climb along the cylinder. Okay? And well, this is of course, I mean, the union of these heteroclinic orbits is, of course, not an orbit of the true system because each heteroclinic. Because each heteroclinic excursion takes an infinite time. So, of course, the union of these heteroclinic orbits is not an orbit of the system. However, using a parabolic Land dilemma due to Marcel, Guardia, Paul Martin, Teresa, and Lara Sabak, we can, for any fixed delta bigger than zero, we can construct an actual orbit of this restricted planar elliptic three-body problem. Restricted planar elliptic three-body problem, which visits a delta neighborhood of the sequence we have obtained on the previous slide. Therefore, this implies the existence of a time t and an actual orbit of the restricted three-body problem such that the value of the angular momentum at zero is below g1 and the value of the angular momentum at time t is above g2. Above G two. These are usually called the shadowing arguments and are more or less standard when you have a hyperbolic invariant manifold. But here the invariant manifold is parabolic, so it's not that standard. And well, I would like to finish by commenting some work in progress, which we are currently We are currently filling a gap to have this theorem, and I hope we will have it soon. And it's for the case of eccentricity below zero between zero and one. And then we would have the following theorem, which is we can fix any value of the mass ratio and the eccentricity. And then we show that there exists a value g star large enough and an orbit of the restricted planar elliptic three-body problem. Elliptic three-body problem such that the value of the angular momentum in this orbit at time zero is below G star and the value of the angular momentum becomes unbounded as time goes to infinity. There are some differences in the proof of this result and in the other and well and in the result we commented through this talk. For example, there exists tomoclinic tangencies between the Tangencies between the stable and unstable manifold. There exist open sets in the infinity manifold where the scattering map is not defined, or at least I'm not able to define it. And it's also, well, I would like to comment that most results in celestial mechanics are perturbative in the eccentricity. And new tools have, well, we have developed new tools to study the Melikov function of this problem, which for those Of this problem, which for those who are not expert is the asymptotic formula in the difference between the invariant manifolds. And I think this is all, and I am more than happy to answer any question if there is any. So is there any question or remark? I would like to ask you that when you say that you combine the two scattering maps, so do you use this Mokel trick or we use a Mocha's trick as follow. We show that the scattering of the materials are the same. The scattering maps share no common invariant curve, and then, for example, Meckel's trick apply, and you can build an orbit which climbs along the cylinder. Also, we can be more quantitative and build the sequence of scattering maps by hand in this case, but it would follow plainly for the Mochal streak. Yes, with this quantitative approach, we would be able also to Also, to obtain some estimates in the speed of diffusion, and for example, show that our diffusion is really slow but exponentially fast compared to the result of Tere, Badim, Ana Madeo, and Abram. So, are there more questions or remarks? Well, if not let's hide me again.
