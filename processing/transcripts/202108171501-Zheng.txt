You already heard about invariant random subgroups. Let's just go through the definition. So, here let's take a locally compact second countable group and consider the space of closed subgroups. So, written as a sub-G here. And then you can equip this space with the so-called triple D topology, where the sub-basis is given by these two types of open sets. Of open sets. So the first type says that you avoid a compact set, and then the second type says that you intersect with an open set now empty. So these form a sub-bases for the topology. So G acts on this space continuously by conjugation. That makes it a nice place to consider dynamics. And so an invariant random subgroup, this name was coined. Subgroup: This name was coined by Albert Glasner and Virag is an invariant measure on this space. So it's so you say mu on the space of subgroups is an IIS if it is invariant under conjugation by G. And so one nice feature of this, which was already mentioned in Alex's talk, is that you can, all IISs arise as stabilizers of PMP action. Of PMP actions. So, for countable groups, it was already in upper glass, Nero and Virag. And for locally compact groups, more generally, it appeared in this famous seven samurai paper. So it relates nicely. So IIS relates nicely to PMP actions. So let's just look at these two basic examples of IIS, the most kind of the singletons. Uh, the singletons are just delta masses on normal subgroups, and so every group would have these two really trivial ones. Those are the delta masses on the trivial subgroup and the whole group. So, when we say a group G does not have non-trivial IISs, it means that you don't see any other ergodic IISs than those two most obvious ones. And then for locally compact groups, it's a nice thing that. Groups, it's a nice thing that if you take a lattice, then you can see it as an IRS just by basically you take the fundamental domain and then push it to this space of subgroups. And you get an IRS. The HAR measure would give you on the fundamental domain is going to give you an IRS supported on conjugates of the lattice. So, in some sense, IRS is generalized simultaneously as normal sub- Simultaneously, normal subgroups and lattices. That's one reason people like to prove statements about them. If you already know something about normal subgroups or lattices, you can just think about whether they would also extend to IIS. So now just write down some notations for narrating groups. So here I write TDQ to be this rooted tree. Be this rooted tree. It's convenient to think of rooted trees for what we're doing here. And Q is the degree of the root. So here Q is equal to 3 and the root has three children. And the D is this regular degree that all the other vertices have D children. And then narrating groups, the narrating group is defined as almost automorphisms or spheroids. Or spheroomorphisms. Maybe one quick way to say it is that you consider the automorphism group of this tree and think of its action on the tree boundary. So this gives you a compact space and an action, and you can take the topological full group of that, and you can define an arraying group this way. And when you actually do calculations, as we've seen in the previous talks, that it's convenient to take It's convenient to take representatives in this in terms of this triple. And so A and B here are finite subtrees. And then you take, you are allowed to shuffle the leaves here. And then the rest, when you take off these two finite submit trees, the rest are form forest isomorphism. You have seen this described in detail before. So that's the notation. So that's the notation we're going to use as well. And another useful thing here is that if you don't permute do tree automorphisms in these sub-trees here, then you get an element in the Higman-Thompson group. And it's not hard to see this subgroup is dense once you put down the correct group topology to make the narrating group. To make the narrating group a nice locally compact group. So, here, I think these facts are already been explained before. So, the group topology here is the one that makes the inclusion of the automorphism group of the tree continuous and open. And we will use the fact that Hickman-Thompson group embeds as a dense subgroup in the narrating group. And so, these two facts also have been mentioned. two facts also have been mentioned before that it was proved by Kapujin that narrating group is actually abstractly simple and it's a result of Bader, Kaparis, Garrender and Moses that it does not contain any lattices. So the statement that the narrating group does not have IISs is a generalization of, in some sense, that doesn't have closed normal subgroups and does not have Subgroups and does not have lattices. So, this is the background. So, the main tool we're going to use is, we'll say the goal is to prove some version of commutator lemma. So, these lemmas have been, depends on the situation. It might be quite easy to prove or take some effort, but it has been very useful in proofs of simplicity or some other statement. Or some other statement. So here, so this type of commutative lemma, the form of it is that you claim that certain subgroups must contain derived subgroup of rigid stabilizers. So here the notation for rigid stabilizers, I call this rigid stabilizer of U in G. So here the setup is that you take some action of a group G. Of a group G, some topological space X by homeomorphism. And then for an open subset U, we say the rigid stabilizer of U is this group element that only acts inside U and fixes all points outside U. So it's a little bit strange to call it a rich stabilizer. Historically, it has been important in the for groups acting on rooted. For groups acting on rooted trees, that's a rigid stabilizer is usually visualized as that you take some vertex and only acts in the subtree here and does and acts as identity outside this subtree. And these are this comes with the definition. It appears in the definition of branch groups. So that's the notation we are going to use. So here, so our main example here is that the top Here is that the topological space is going to be this cantor set that comes from the boundary of the tree. And then a typical subset U, open subset U, we're going to take is just a cylinder set. So here V means the vertex in the tree. And we consider all these infinite geodesic grays that starts with this V. And then this is a nice open set. And then we can consider all these group elements. Can consider all these group elements that only act in this part of the tree and fix everything else outside. So, this is a typical way, typical kind of rigid stabilizers we think about. And then so for commutator lemmas, the most classical one is for normal subgroups. So, this you can almost prove by hand, just think about it for a little bit. Little bit. So it goes like this. So if you take, we always have this group G acting by homeomorphism on some topological space X, and we assume the space is Hausdorff. And then now let's take a normal subgroup that's not too trivial and consider a point in the space X that is being moved by N. And then the commutative lemma tells you that you can always find a non-empty neighbor. Find a non-empty neighborhood of this point x such that the derived subgroup of the rigid stabilizer is contained in the normal subgroup. So the proof of this just does commutator twice. If you have a point X that is being moved by some element in N, and then you can just choose some small neighborhood that is being moved disjointly, and then you do manipulate the commute. And then you do manipulate the commutator a little bit, then you can convince yourself that all elements of the form that is a commutator of something that only works here is going to be contained in n because n is normal. So this dilemma was used widely to prove the simplicity of groups and maybe goes back to early work of Hickman. And then more recently, this type of lemma. This type of Lama was proved by Lepudek and Matabon for URSs. So we're not going into results about UISs, but you can think of it as a topological analog of IRSs. So here, URS, it was defined by Glasner and Weiss. It means that you consider minimal subsystems in sub-G. So it's an UIS is a closed G. An ui is a closed g invariant minimal subset in this triple D space. And for this type of subgroups, La Boudeca and Matobon prove statements of this flavor. So I'm not going to state what it is exactly, but you'll see an analog for IIS in a moment. And then for IISs, like two years ago, I found this. I found this lemma that works exactly in the classical form for countable groups. So it goes like this: so let's consider a countable group acting faithfully on some host of space X. And in order to do measure theory, let's also assume X is the second countable. And then for an ergodic IRS of gamma, if it is not a delta mass on the trivial group, that since I assumed it's phaseful, so it has to move things. Faceful, so it has to move things in the space X. So the statement is that for Î¼, almost every subgroup H, you can find some open non-empty subsets in the space such that H contains the commutator subgroup of the rigid stabilizer of U. So if you compare this statement to the classical commutator lemma for normal subgroups, you can see it almost reads the same. It almost reads the same, except that if you want to use this for a classification of IRS or some purpose like this, you'll immediately realize that you have some freedom for invariant random subgroups to choose what points to fix on the space X. So just one way to use it is like, so I just want to explain this a little bit more. So for if you take some subgroup of gamma and Subgroup of gamma, and then you can consider it's a fixed point on the space X. So if you have an IIS mu here, then you can push it forward to some G-invariant measure on the space of closed subsets of X. So, this is the first thing if you want to classify IIS of gamma, then this is the first thing you want to understand is what invariant measures you can have on the space. Measures you can have on the space of closed subsets of X. So here is denoted by FX. And then, so for instance, in some situations where you have some compression or some mechanism that allows you to understand that there is no G invariant measure on FX other than the most trivial one, namely the delta mass on empty sets and the delta mass on the whole set X. On the whole set X, then you can conclude from this property that the IIS either is trivial or do not have fixed points. And then after that, you can apply the lemma and basically conclude that the IIS has to contain a lot of a large part of the group, essentially. So for instance, if you consider the Hickman-Thompson. Consider the Higman-Thompson group acting on the tree boundary, then there is indeed no invariant measure on the space of closed subsets of the tree boundary. And then by using this fact together with the commutative dilemma, it's possible to recover results of due to Dadico and magnets that if you consider the derived subgroup of Higman-Thompson V, then it has no non-trivial IIs. Has no non-trivial IIsis. So here we take the derived subgroup because it's possible that when D is odd, you have this abelianization. So that gives you one more II. So it's nicer to state the result for derived subgroup. So this is basically how the commutator lemma can be used to classify, well, maybe to help classify IIs of countable. Uh, IIS of countable groups when you have a nice action with a lot of rigid stabilizers. So, one question is that I didn't have a good idea is to what extent this type of commutative lemma for IISs can be extended to non-discrete groups. So, in the proof of this lemma, at some point, the used repeatedly the very simple fact that Very simple fact that say if you have a set, a countable set, and then there is an invariant probability measure on the countable set, then there's no other way, but this set is finite. So this easy fact is used repeatedly in the proof of the community dilemma, which obviously doesn't work in non-discrete settings. So it's kind of at least interesting to me that what Interesting to me that to what extent this type of community dilemma can be extended to non-discrete groups. So now let's go back to the narrating group. So the goal to prove that a narrating group does not have non-trivial IIS. At some point, we're going to show the commutative lemma holds for some electrons. Holds for some elliptic subgroups. So, this proof outline, so to go to some elliptic subgroup, is inspired by this Bader Kaparis Calendar Moses paper where they show there is no lattice. So, let's quickly go through what the ideas are. So, they consider the following. So, it's basically if you assume that you have a lattice in N, then you can induce a lattice in some. Can induce a lattice in some open subgroup O. And then you argue there using some counting or combinatorics. So here their elliptic subgroup O is defined as follows. So remember, our tree is rooted. And then you consider for given a level N, you consider this subtree, this is finite subtree of level N. So drawn as a Tn here. And then you can. T n here, and then you can define this O to be the semi-direct product that you can shuffle these level n vertices, so that's the symmetric group on this level n. And then beneath that, you can do rooted tree automorphisms in the subtrees. So, this is the definition for O N. It has this nice semi-direct product structure, and then it's obviously increasing in N. So, you have O n. In N. So you have O n as a naturally sits as a subgroup in O n plus 1, and the elliptic subgroup O is defined as the increasing union of these subgroups O n. And then so the reason for choosing this one, maybe partly is because you can, if you have, say, a lattice of O, then you can intersect it with, say, O and then project down to this symmetric group that lands you in some finite That lands you in some financial setting, and so that you can do some counting and argue from there. So, that's something that's not easy to think about in the original narrating group. So, here's the argument. So here's a rough outline why you cannot have lattices is like this. So, suppose you take some lattice in N, assume that there is such a lattice, and then you induce it to this open electron. To this open elliptic subgroup O. So you again gain a lattice from the intersection. And now, by definition, a lattice has to be both discrete and have a finite co-volume. And it turns out that these two properties have some conflicts. So if you think about the group topology for this intersection, gamma intersect with O to be discrete, then it has to avoid some small Has to avoid some small neighborhood of the identity element, which you can conveniently see from this picture. That if you go to some large enough level n, then this neighborhood of identity is exactly these product of these rooted automorphisms around this level. And then to be discrete, you have to avoid, there must exist an end such that you avoid such neighborhood. Such neighborhood, the intersection must be identity. So, this is one property. And then the other property is that it has to have a finite co-volume. And if you write down the formula to compute a co-volume here, then you will see that in order to have a finite co-volume, it gives you some lower bound. So, this well, you approximate the co-volume in terms. The co-volume in terms of the projections to the symmetric group. And then having finite co-volume gives you a lower bound on the size of your projection to the symmetric group. And then you can invoke results for finite symmetric groups to see that if the size of the subgroup is large, there are some theorems that tell you it has to contain, for instance, a lot of large part of the alternating subgroup or some. The alternating subgroup, or some statement of that thought. And then this type of results tell you that you have to contain permutations of the forms that you forbid from the discreteness criterion. So that's basically where the conflict comes from. You cannot be discrete and have a finite co-volume at the same time. So this is a very rough outline of the ideas from this. Ideas from this paper that proves narrowing group have no fat disease. So we're going to take some, so the proof for IIS goes through this rough outline in a pretty similar way, and you will see the analogies very clearly. So, as we said before, that this community dilemma Commutative lemma. It just uses the fact that you cannot have invariant probability measure on countable infinite set repeatedly. So here we no longer have this kind of setting. So similar to the proof for no lattice, we go to these finite symmetry groups and try to find some contradictions over there. So in order to do that, we take this type of elliptic subgroups. Elliptic subgroups. So if you so they are different, the notation here is OA. And so A is a finite subtree. And then we basically consider those subgroups that you can, these elements that you can get by first taking, expand A downward for N levels. So here is the A, here is the picture for, so the original. For the original finite subtree. And then A1 means that you expand by one level. A n, you just go down n steps. And then take this type of semi-direct product that you can shuffle on the boundary of an. And then beneath that, you can do tree-rooted tree automorphisms. And then the increasing union of this type of subgroups when N increases, we call it OA. We call it OA. So it's obvious that you get these open subgroups. And then we're going to induce to these open subgroups, just similar to the outline in the lattice proof. So let's take some ergodic IIS of N and then assume that it's not trivial. So we want to show that if it's not trivial, then it has to be just the delta mass on the whole group. Whole group. So the first step is to induce to one of these elliptic subgroups. So it's not hard to show that there must exist some finite complete subtree A such that this IIS intersect with this open subgroup. So the proof of this is not difficult. So first notice that there are only countably many. There are only countably many finite complete subtrees. And then, if the IIS does not intersect any of these, then one can deduce some contradictions that it contradicts with the B invariant. So this step is sort of the preliminary step that allows this transfer from original IIs of the original narrating group to some elliptic open subgroup OA. So we just Group OA. So we just induce by taking intersection. So for a subgroup H, we just intersect with this OA and push forward the IIS to some IIS of Mu A. And then so we'll work there from this point on. So this is the inducing step to some elliptic subgroup. And the reason for doing this is pretty much the same as in the lattice proof that Lattice proof that we want to use specific forms of these elliptic subgroups so that we can project to symmetric groups so that some counting or combinatorial can be results can be used. And then so the heart of the proof is this commutative lemma inside OA. So now in the previous step, we just induced some IIS in the In this OA. It was called MuA before. It might not be, it's possible this is not ergodic, so you can just take its ergodic decomposition and consider an ergodic IIS of this OA. And then, so the key point is to prove a commutative lemma like this. So it claims that for an ergodic IIS of OA, if it's not trivial. Of OA, if it's not trivial, then we can find some non-empty open subset of the tree boundary such that for new, so the claim is for new almost every edge. And then this U might depend on H. So you say that this commutator lemma tells you that H has to contain some derived subgroup of the rigid stabilizer. So I'll say a little bit. So, I'll say a little bit about how to prove this in a moment. But let's assume that we do have this type of commutator lemma. Then to finish the proof, we can push it to the Hickmann-Thompson group V. So, because this lemma tells us that for almost every H, we have to contain some rigid derived subgroup of. On rigid derived subgroup of rigid stabilizer. The key thing here is that this U is now empty. And then because it contains this type of subgroup and V is dense, so it shows us that the intersection of H with the V prime must be non-trivial. And then this shows us that if we start with the original IRS of the narrating group and consider, say, H intersect. Consider say H intersect with the derived subgroup of V, then the result cannot be the trivial subgroup. So, if you push forward the IS, then we'll get some mixture of exotic IISs of V prime that does not charge the trivial subgroup. So, this is somehow this non-triviality is the key here. And once we know that it does not charge the trivial subgroup, then if we invoke then if we invoke this datacoh maintenance result that the only ergodic IICs of B prime are just the delta mass on identity or delta mass on the whole group. Then you see that since we ruled out possibility of getting trivial subgroup, then it has to be the whole group. So if we then if you go back to how we obtained all these things, this All these things, this statement exactly tells you that for our original IRS mu of narrating group, almost every subgroup must contain V prime. And then keep in mind that the IRS is supported on closed subgroups. So if you close V prime, then that exactly gives you the claim that mu is indeed just the delta mass on the narrating group itself. On the narrating group itself. So that's the outline for the proof. So minus the beginning and end, the key thing is really just to prove this commutative lemma for the elliptic subgroup. So let me just quickly say what goes into the proof of the commutator lemma. So the proof, so for myself, the way So, for myself, the way I thought about it is first, there are some ingredients that come from the commutative lemma proved for countable groups. There are some basic operations like you induce to some subgroup and then consider orbits under conjugation. This type of operation are still used in the proof. And then, instead of invoking that you cannot have invariant measure on countable invariant, countable if anything. Invariant countable infinite set. Instead, in this setting, we go to the finite symmetric groups and approve some bounds on the size of projections, essentially. And then in the end, invoke some results about the symmetric group to conclude. So here, the key thing is this type of picture. So here, this green subtree is what I call this. This A, that is the finite subtree that we start with. And now let's consider the collection of subgroups such that it contains some element that moves non-trivially one vertex on the tree boundary, on the boundary of A. So here U and V are two vertices on the boundary of A, and they are different. So you consider, so take U. Consider, so take U and V, and then consider these subgroups, which contain some element that moves the subtree TU to subtree T V, basically. And moreover, we insist that this element does not do anything beneath. So just this for this, and I don't mean that. So yeah, basically, if you remember what I Basically, if you remember what I said about what is the definition for OA0, it just says that it belongs to the semi-direct product of these automorphisms beneath the subtree A, semi-product with the same A. So yeah, so that's basically the picture is just you move TU to TV. And then so we want to, so there should be, so the first thing is that because it's a countable collection. Is that because it's a countable collection here? There must be some choice of UV and A that it has a positive probability under the IRS mu. That's the starting point. And then we want to show that if we grow this, so this is the picture with just the sub-tree A, and then we don't say much about what happens beneath the tree. And then the next step is to use invariance and examine. Variance and examine what happens if you expand this picture for n steps. So we just take this A and then expand it down n levels. So then if you use, so here is some part that you need to, that takes some technical work that using the invariance of mu and the conjugation somehow argue that if you expand this tree down n levels, Down n levels and consider the subgroup that tells you how you shuffle around the boundary of A n, then this projection cannot be too small. And moreover, it needs to be a primitive subgroup of the symmetric group. So, this is where the technical part of the proof goes. And then, once this type of bounds are obtained, then we can conclude by Then we can conclude by invoking some classical bound for symmetric groups. Basically, here, the one here is sufficient to use the project-sexual bound that tells you that if you have a subgroup of the symmetric group that is primitive and does not contain the alternating group, then the size of it must be small. So, in the previous step, we said. So, in the previous step, we said that the projection to this cannot be too small and being vague here, but you can show that they cannot actually be exponential in n. And then combined with this type of bound, it shows you that a not so small primitive subgroup must contain the whole alternating group. Then it tells you that all the permutations are allowed here. And if you unpack all these things and go back to this elliptic subgroup O. Uh, elliptic subgroup O, then we can conclude that it actually contains the whole derived subgroup of the richest stabilizer. And the richest stabilizer exactly comes from here that we only assume that U is moved to V. So in the end, the conclusion is basically inside these two parts. Do not say other things outside. So that's basically the proof. It's a little hand-waving, maybe hard to. Little hand waving may be hard to follow, but you can see the analogy with the proof for lattices. So we induce to some open subgroups, and then after some operations, land reduce the problem to some consideration to projections to symmetric groups. And then in the end, using some kind of some bounds in size of subgroups in symmetric groups. Of subgroups in a symmetry group to conclude that the IIS that we started with must contain a lot of permutations. That's basically the idea. So we should pause here and ask if there's any question. um right uh so so that's the uh basically the the ideas for how to uh rule out uh non-trivial iises and uh so there's some questions i've been wondering about but didn't have much uh ideas uh so so since uh since i'm from random walks and post-one boundary i find uh stationary measures very interesting so here uh is so we know that uh there's no interesting i am That there's no interest in AIs, but then one can ask: what about stationary measures? So, here, let's just take some, say, probability measure on the narrating group. You can choose the one that is the hard measure on, say, rooted automorphisms of the tree plus some generators of the Thomson group V, for instance, just to choose some generating probability measure on the narrative. Generating probability measure on the narrating group, then for any action on the compact set X, we know just by compactness, there must exist stationary measures. So here this notation is the usual convolution, but we consider the translates of mu and then integrate against mu. So if after the convolution If after the convolution, this measure remains the same, then we call it stationary. I shouldn't say much. So here, I mean, the measure nu is a unit mass. It's a probability measure. So stationary actions are abundant. You can find whenever you have action on some compact set, you know that stationary distributions always exist. Distributions always exist, then you can ask if one can say anything about that. And here, if you consider the action of n on the tree boundary, then you see that it has no invariant measure. So you must have some interesting stationary measure from the action. And the question is, can you, are there kind of a much larger collection of interesting stationary? Of interesting stationary actions. I actually do not know any explicit ones. Maybe experts in the audience know about actions of narrating group other than just this defining one on the tree boundary that we start with. But then other actions support kind of different types of action on compact spaces that give rise to. Spaces that give rise to stationary distributions that are interesting. So I'm curious about seeing more examples. And in particular, this construction of Poisson boundary initially due to Furstenberg that you can use to represent all mu harmonic functions. So for connected semi-simple Lie groups, Furstenberg described what the Poisson boundaries are. What are the Poisson boundaries like for measures for these step distributions that are absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure? And here it's not obvious what is the Poisson boundary of narrating group. In particular, even before describing the full Poisson boundary, is the action of N on the Poisson boundary essentially free? So, one remark here is that So, one remark here is that the tree boundary equipped with the stationary distribution cannot be the Poisson boundary because the stabilizers are now amenable. And we know that abstractly that the action of a group on its Poisson boundary is amenable in the sense of Zimmer. So this is not, so the tree boundary is not the Poisson boundary. But somehow it's not obvious where to look for a candidate for Poisson boundary. For Posomanji. So that's some questions I want to get some hints. So, yeah, I think maybe I can stop here. Thank you, Tiani. Are there any questions? It's probably going too fast. Well, I have a question, a couple of questions. One is about your very last comment about the Poisson boundary. It can depend on the measure, of course, the measure mu. Can you say anything about, well, for any measure, from what I understand, for no measure, can you say what the Poisson boundary is? Is that correct? Is that correct? No, so I think nothing is known at the moment. So I should be more careful here. And maybe let's restrict to 2 mu that is absolutely continuous with respect to the harm measure. That's more like the Furstenberg style. If you take arbitrary measures, you might charge some strange subgroups. And then, so in the collected semi-simple League case, this Furstenberg tells us that it can only be a G model. But it can only be a G mod P. And it's the boundary of the symmetric space. And here, it's not obvious what it might look like. So I suspect it should be essentially free, meaning in particular, it would imply the Poisson boundary should not be a homogeneous space, you know, some transitive homogeneous action. So that's what I think it should be. But I think the I want to know if there are examples of action of N on some other complex phase than the tree boundary that we start with. And maybe there is some hint that have some maybe factors of the Poisson boundary where you already see it's essentially free. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know about actions of Higman-Thompson groups? So on Poisson boundaries of Higman-Thompson groups? Is there anything much about that? So for V, so for V, I'm not sure if what I think is correct, but if you, there is this construction of mu boundary, it was probably due to Kamanovich, that you consider the action on, say, the interval and then consider the difference of. Difference of slope at the breakpoints, then that will give you some quotient of the Poisson boundary where you can already observe that it's essentially free. But this action does not lift up to, does not extend to n as far as I understand. Yeah, so that's something I would believe that n behaves a lot like me, but for this particular thing, I do not know where to observe. Know where to observe some nice actions because that one is quite discreet, and you look at the breakpoints. Yeah, the Thomson groups, their orbital graphs are trees, so you can just map the random walk on the orbit, and you will see that the boundary essentially is also the terminal which is all right. So, so this tree boundary is a mu boundary. Is a mu boundary? You can see like no, no, no, no. No, no, it's not. No, just take the orbit and try take the Schroyer graph. So the orbital graph of the action on the on some orbit. And then graph will be basically a tree. So there will be some boundary coming from that. But do you get some free boundary out of it or? No, it's it's essentially the the Kaimano which is Approach. The same random walk, but another interpretation. Because in terminology, you take graph of germs, you look at the slide. And that's the same graph. If you take a generic one, you get the same graph based to the tree. So what you see in the germ, you will see just kind of one direction in that tree, and Camelot shows that. Tree and Camel shows that in that direction you have non-shiggy event. Not the direction, but yeah. Right, but this does not go to N as well, right? So it's no, because that graph is because the trial fields are going to mess up, right? Yeah, so these known constructions. So these known constructions for some quotient of Poisson boundary of V, they do not extend obviously to not in any obvious way can be kind of transplanted to N. So it's kind of an interesting question what new boundaries we can construct for N. And then maybe it has some implications for And then maybe it has some implications for, I don't know, understanding something about boundaries will help understand other things as well. But I find it's interesting. Right. Are there any other comments or questions for Tianik? Well, if not, let's Well, if not, let's thank Chiang again. We return in, what is it, just
