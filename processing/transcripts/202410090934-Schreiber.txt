At the University of California to Davis, who's going to talk about environmental fluctuations and their influence on population growth. Great, thanks a lot, Bill. First, an announcement from Burr staff. Please remember, it's mating season for elk, so please keep your distance from bull elk. And no matter what, don't get between a bull elk and a tarot. Okay, with that announcement aside, I'm going to talk about how the tempo and mode of environmental fluctuations matter for population growth. For population growth. This is work in collaboration with Pierre Montmarch and Edward Strickler, both from France. So, as we all know, environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, salinity, resource availability vary over time. And those environmental conditions impact basic demographic rates like survival, growth, fecundity, and therefore they can impact population dynamics. So, as temperature, for instance, varies, So, as temperature, for instance, varies, it might affect fecundity, which leads to fluctuations in fecundity, which might impact long-term population growth rates. And a simple question we can ask is: to what extent does the tempo, the speed at which those fluctuations occur, matter? For instance, we have these intermediate speed fluctuations, these slower fluctuations, these faster fluctuations. Does the speed of the fluctuation matter? We can also ask: does the mode, the nature of the fluctuation matter? Of the fluctuation matter. Here we have these predictable periodic fluctuations. Well, we might have the same statistical long-term frequencies in the different environmental states, but exhibit more random stochastic fluctuations between those environmental states. Does that distinction between periodicity and stochasticity matter? So, to address these questions, I'm going to be keeping it simple because I'm stupid. And so, one of the things that you already saw as far as the simplicity is that As far as the simplicity is that the way the environmental fluctuations were shown in the previous slide here is it's a piecewise constant functions. Okay, so we have a finite number of environments and you're fluctuating between them. Then for the purposes of presenting things in a more transparent way and following like the lead of Yuan Wu yesterday, I'd also keep it simple by assuming there's just two environmental states for the purposes of this talk. So in the words of Led Zeppelin, So in the words of Led Zeppelin, there's going to be good times, bad times, we've all had our share. Or in the words of the class, some days are fine and other days are black. So it was just two environmental states. Okay, so I'm going to simplify a little more. I'm going to assume you spend half the time in each of the states. Again, this is just to illustrate the key ideas. And at the end, I'll mention the more general things. So we're going to have something representing the environmental dynamic, that's sigma of t. It's going to be That's sigma of t. It's going to be a piecewise constant function going between the values 1, environmental state 1, and 2, environmental state 2. It can either be periodic right now, where for half a time step it's 1, half a time step at 2, and that repeats, or it can be given by the solution of this irreducible Markov chain, where statistically it's going about half the time at 1 and half the time at 2, but not always exactly like that. And if we want to have the simplest population model. And if we want to have the simplest population model, we could have the logistic growth type model where here X is the population density, and we have maybe the intrinsic rate of growth depending on the environmental state. So we have R1 and R2, and we can then get this sort of non-autonomous differential equation. And if we simulate it, we might get simulations like this. If it's periodic fluctuations and the population is persisting, we may get sort of these stochastic fluctuations. Stochastic fluctuations of the environmental signals being given by the Markov chain. We might sometimes see the population going extinct for certain choices of R1 and R2. We can ask in this very simple model, can we predict when we get persistence versus extinction? And all of you say, yeah, of course we can. It's very simple. We just linearize around the extinction equilibrium. That gives us the simple linear non-autonomous differential equation. We can solve it, then we can take the solution. Then we can take the solution, take the log of the density, divide it by t, go to infinity, and that's going to give us sort of this average growth rate, which for this setup is always just the average between R1 and R2. And this average doesn't depend on whether you're going faster or slower. It doesn't depend on whether you're being stochastic or periodic. So in this case, whether the population is going faster or slower at low densities does not depend on tempo and motion. Does not depend on tempo and mode. And that's because this model, very unfortunately, treats all individuals the same. But we want to celebrate the differences amongst individuals, and so we want to do that by accounting for population structure. And here's some examples of population structure. We might have a stage structure, for instance, these armored catfish or these polar bears, or even in a pathogen going through different hosts during its complex life cycle. Its complex life cycle. We might have spatial structure, like in these sort of cartoons of these experiments of Matthews and Gonzalez with paramecia, or we might have a mixture of stage and spatial structure. So these are the models I'm going to be interested in, are models accounting for stage, spatial, structure. And to keep the state space for these models, it is just the non-negative orthant of k-dimensional space, k-dimensional Euclidean space, where k is the number of stages. Euclidean space, where k is the number of stages or locations in space. Okay, so sticking with good times, bad times, meaning keeping it simple because I'm stupid. We're going to assume still the environmental dynamics are switching between one and two. So there's good times and bad times with equal frequency, but they might be periodically fluctuating or stochastically fluctuating. To describe the population dynamics, I'm going to have two matrices, A1 and A2. A1 and A2. They're both going to be K by K matrices because we have K different stages or locations that individuals can be in. I'm going to assume those matrices are Metzler matrices. That means they have non-negative off-diagonal entries. So that's sort of analogous to being a non-negative matrix in discrete time. And then I'm also going to assume they're irreducible. In other words, after a little bit of time, any stage contributes to any other stage. And then the model. And then the model I'm going to look at is going to, for right now, ignore any population negative density dependence or density dependence. It's just this linear model where the rate of change of the vector of population densities is equal to the matrix A at the current environment times X of T. And I'm going to introduce a new parameter, omega, here, which is going to be used to modulate the speed at which the environment is flux. We're going to be looking at sigma omega t and for small. Omega t, and for small omega, that means the environment is fluctuating very slowly. For large omega, it means the environment is fluctuating very quickly. So the first thing we can ask is, what's the analog of the average of little R1 and R2 in the previous example here? What's the sort of long-term growth rate? And it's well known, for instance, this follows from a paper of Ruel in 1979, that there exists a which we call Lyapunov exponent, such that Exponent such that it dictates the long-term population growth whenever you have some individuals in the population. In other words, the law of density divided by t as t goes to infinity converges to this lambda of omega, where I'm treating omega as a parameter that we can change. So this lambda of omega is the long-term population growth rate. If it's positive, the population is increasing. If it's negative, the population is decreasing. And the big question is, how does this Lyopano? Is how does this Lyapunov exponent depend on omega, on the frequency of the fluctuations, and how does it depend on the mode, periodic versus stochastic? Does it matter? Obviously, it's going to matter. That's the title of my talk. Okay. So how are we going to study this? We're going to look at two limits. We're going to look at the limit where the fluctuations are very, very slow. So omega, the frequency is very close to zero. If the environment Okay, if the environment is fluctuating slowly between good times and bad times, right, that means if I'm in good times, then I'm going to stay in good times for a long time, okay? And the population growth is going to be determined by the dominant eigenvalue of the good time matrix. So that's what lambda i is. It's the principal eigenvalue for AI. And also in the long term, if we're staying in the In the long term, if we're staying in the good times, the distribution of individuals across the k different stages is given by the stable stage distribution. In other words, the normalized eigenvector, right eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue. So it's normalized to add up to one. And then the other thing that we will care about is the left eigenvector, which is a row vector, which we're going to normalize such that its product with the right eigenvector is one. When you do it that way, then When you do it that way, then the entries of that u vector correspond to reproductive values. What's the relative contribution of different stages to the long-term population size? Again, I should emphasize the Vi and UI are vectors. The subscript I here is not an entry of a vector, so it's just Vi is a vector for the AI matrix. Okay, so we have these basic demographic quantities, so now we can ask in the slow limit. So now we can ask in the slow limit when omega is low, what does the Lyapunov exponent look like for low frequency fluctuations in the environment? And in this setting, the mode doesn't matter. It can be stochastic, it can be periodic. You get the same first order expression. So we're going to have lambda of omega is first given by the zeroth order term, which is just the average of the two eigenvalues, because you're spending half the time, a really long time, half of the time, with the A1 environment. With the A1 environment and half the time with the A2 environment. So the lambda averages should matter. Then we have a correction term of order omega. What's the coefficient there? It's actually a very simple coefficient. Because what's going on? If I'm in good times, so that's state one, I eventually am following the vector v1. And then when I shift to bad times, so environment two, the reproductive value of an individual at that switching moment is given by U2 times V1. And by U2 times V1. So if that product is bigger than one, that switch was good for the population. If it's less than one, it's bad for the population. Okay, so you're just saying what on a log scale are the effects of the switches on the growth rate. So that's the first order approximation. For the slow limit, mode does not matter. Yeah. Why did you write it as the sum of two logs instead of a log of one log of a big product? Because I like it better. I'm sorry, if you prefer a different way, when you give the top two. If you prefer a different way, when you give the talk, you want me to do it. But let me make you. I know it. There's no death, you can view it as an average of two effects. You can see the effect of this switch versus this switch. If you write it as your messy product with a log, you do not see the two effects. That's exactly what you're doing. Let's keep on going. This is not important. Okay, so now let's talk about the fast limit when omega is very large. So then you're switching very quickly between good times, bad times, good times. Quickly between good times, bad times, good times, bad times, very quickly, right? So it should be roughly your experience experiencing the average matrix, right? So the average of A1 and A2, let's call that A bar. We have all these key demographic properties associated with that matrix, the dominant eigenvalue, the right eigenvector normalized to add up to one, the left eigenvector such that the product, ooh, sorry about those eyes, they should not be here. They should be bars type of you rightfully consumed. You rightfully can skew me for that. Okay, so we have these three key demographic quantities, and in this case, we're going to do an expansion when omega is large. So the zeroth order term in the expansion, this lambda bar f, is just given by the eigenvalue I just told you about, the average matrix. And then we get a first order correction term of the order 1 over omega, because omega is large. Now it turns out the constant there, Cf, depends on mode. Depends on mode. Okay, so here's where mode matters. The simpler case is the random case. This is what the constant ends up being. I won't go into discussing its interpretation, partially because I don't think we fully understand the interpretation. We'd like to think it's some sort of covariance term, but it's not clear how it is because it can be positive or negative. Remarkably, for the periodic case, the first order term coefficient is zero. So there is no first-order correction. No first order correction. So then we say, well, maybe there's a second order correction in the periodic case. So we, in the periodic case, we look at what happens to the 1 over omega squared term, and we get a coefficient, and here it is. Delightfully simple, with commutators and group inverses that we learned about yesterday. So if you like commutators and group inverses, this is just like bliss, right? Okay, so we have this other formula. So we have this other formula. It's actually much more challenging to interpret biologically. I have to confess, we've struggled with trying to give it a good biological interpretation. Okay, so we have these formulas, which means that we can take a particular model and tug at these formulas to get some insights about different ecological scenarios. So let me show you some of those efforts of tugging at those formulas. And so I'm going to show you two examples. One is for a stage-structured model with just juveniles and adults. Model with just juveniles and adults. And the second example will relate to some of the talks we heard yesterday: a spatial model, and just for again, presentational simplicity, I'll just be two patches. So let's start with the stage-structured model. So we're going to have these armored catfish. They're either juveniles or adults. Adults die at rate one. Juveniles mature to adults at rate one. And then in good years, you have adults reproduced. You have adults reproducing at rate A and bad years at rate B. Now, those looking carefully say, why aren't the juveniles dying? That's just embedded into the A and B. So in other words, this is the rate at which adults produce juveniles that will eventually mature to adults. Okay, so that's this stage that we're keeping track of. So that means our two matrices in good times and bad times are these two matrices. And we can say, well, say, for instance, in the stochastic. Say, for instance, in the stochastic setting, we have these slow limit and fast limit formulas. What do they look like? Here's what they look like. Again, I'm not going to go into the details, but what I should note is the coefficient in front of omega is positive, so that's saying higher fluctuations, higher frequency fluctuations, at least when you're sort of in the low frequency regime, increase the population growth rate. And on the other hand, if we look at the coefficient in front of the If we look at the coefficient in front of the one over omega term and the fast limit, it's negative. So that's saying in the high fluctuation regime, also higher omegas make a bigger population growth rate. So that's suggesting that in general, the population growth rate, this dominant Lyophonus exponent, should increase with the frequency of the environmental fluctuations. How about in the periodic case? Here's the formula we get with the second order correction term, with this beautiful square root of 98 of 384. Square root of 98 of 384, some new mystical number in my life that I'm sure has some weird meaning. But again, the coefficient in this periodic high-frequency limit is negative, so it's still consistent with the qualitative trend. So to see how this actually looks, I can choose specific A and B values, numerically compute these Lyapunov exponents, that's the solid curves. Notice frequencies are on a log scale, so I can capture low as well as high frequencies. Low as well as high frequencies. The approximations that I just told you about are shown as dashed curves. There's only one dashed curve in the low limit because I only have one approximation that I need in the low frequency limit. And we see, as consistent with what the approximations predict, in this case, higher frequency fluctuations between good times and bad times lead to a higher Lyauppina f X bar, a higher population growth rate. But interestingly, we also have that. We also have that periodic fluctuations, the mode, lead to a higher growth rate than stochastic fluctuations, even though on average, you're spending an equal amount of time in good times and bad times, and the ordering is always good time, bad time, good time, bad time. Okay, so that I don't get yelled at by Kenneth Goulding, in particular called a mad person or an economist, let's add some density dependence into the model just to illustrate what the simulation. The model just to illustrate what the simulations would look like. So, for a frequency of roughly 0.5, here are some simulations of these models where I add some density dependence into them. And what we see is if I do the periodic model here, I get the population is persisting and exhibiting some periodic behavior, consistent with what we're expecting from the growth rate being positive at low densities. On the other hand, if I do the stochastic environment for the same Do the stochastic environment for the same frequency, the population is going extinct. So, here the mode can change the population from persisting to going extinct. Okay, so that's the first example. So, the key things to remember is here, population growth rates get higher with higher frequencies and are higher with periodic fluctuations. Let's try another example that we heard basically about yesterday. Let's consider these experiments by Matthews and Gonzalez. Experiments by Matthews and Gonzalez with paramecia in flasks. They controlled or influenced the growth rates by manipulating temperature in these flasks, higher temperatures leading to higher growth rates. And they were on a daily time scale, so not quite continuous, just moving individuals between these jars. So we're just going to pretend it's continuous. Okay, so in each of the flasks, there's going to be good times, one, and bad times for the growth rate. So that gives Times for the growth rate. So that gives us these two, oops, these two Metzler matrices. And I'm going to make an assumption about them so I don't get to only degenerate. I'm going to assume the right eigenvectors from good times and bad time matrices are not equal. And then one can show the following results, which is rather than showing you the actual expression for the coefficients, which are quite ugly, and they get super ugly if we're talking about any number of patches, because this result, I'm going to state, holds for any number of patches as long as. Holds for any number of patches as long as the dispersal matrix is symmetric. I'm just going to tell you about the sign of these coefficients. So in the slow limit, we always get the first order correction term is negative, suggesting lower frequency fluctuations are better for population growth, the opposite of the previous example. And in high frequency fluctuations, whether it's the random or the periodic case, we get the coefficient of the first non-zero order term is positive. Order term is positive, again, suggesting that lower frequency fluctuations are better for population growth rates. And that should say periodic. Sorry. Two typos now, at least. Okay, so let's just see what this looks like numerically. So here I'm showing you again the Lyapunov exponents plotted as a function of frequency. The frequency is on a log plot. And the solid curves are the numerical approximations. Are the numerical approximations, and the dash curves are what you get from the analytic approximations. And consistent with what we're predicting from the analytic approximations, the Lyapunov exponent is decreasing with frequency, the opposite of the previous example. Moreover, like opposite from the previous example, periodic fluctuations lead to a lower growth rate than stochastic fluctuations. Now, one of these trends for the periodic case. These trends for the periodic case was actually proved for when you have continuous, not piecewise constant, and periodic fluctuations in the per capita growth rates by Catraille and a JMB paper from a few years ago, then in fact the dominant Lyoplanov exponent is always decreasing. Okay, so what we're showing is, yeah, you can switch it to piecewise constants, something that's consistent, but that's not that interesting. But that also in the Markovian environment, we're at least having the suggestion. We're at least having the suggestion at the high and low frequencies that the Lyapunov exponent should decrease with frequency. There's some monotonicity. So that might make Jan happy, because he likes monotonicity in his talk yesterday with respect to frequency. Okay, so what do simulations look like with density dependence, because I don't want to be yelled at by Poulding, is here. So I'm taking now a frequency of about a tenth, and if I'm running the model with stochastic If I'm running the model with stochastic fluctuations between good times and bad times, then I get this dynamic: the population is persisting, consistent with the Lyapunov exponent corresponding to the growth rate at low density being positive. But if I switch the mode to periodic fluctuations, the population goes extinct for the same frequency for environmental fluctuations. So we see in this example, we get the opposite results. We get the opposite results from the previous example. And in fact, more generally, what we can show is if you have any sort of stage-structured, spatially structured model where the fluctuations are just along the diagonal, you always get this trend, at least according to the high and low-frequency limits, that the growth rate decreases with frequency. So it's not just spatially structured models, that just happens to work because you're doing all the action along the diagonal. But it could be any model that you're doing action along the diagonal. That you're doing action along the plane. Okay, so so far I've been keeping it simple, you know, just having good times, bad times, fine days, black days. So we could ask what happens beyond that. So I'm not going to go that in detail, but I just want to highlight what you can find in this preprint that's on archive. You just have to follow that QR code. Is we have results where the environment switches between any number but finite of environments. Finite of environments. And you can have any periodic, piecewise constant environmental dynamic. It can spend whatever fraction of time you want in the different environmental stage. You can do some weird patterns of going 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 in that period. And then any irreducible Markov chain on these n environmental states, we still have formulas for the growth rates for this model. But there's an important point to be made. There's an important point to be made that what I was talking about previously is somewhat misleading, which is in the case of the periodic expansion in high frequency for at least three environments and higher, in general, the first order correction term is non-zero. So the second order correction term was only needed in the good time, bad time tech models. Okay, so that's sort of the generalization. So that's sort of the generalization that you're welcome to look at in this archive preprint. And using like these formulas for three environments and more, you can come up with this really sort of interesting example, which is let's imagine we have three patches. Dispersal is cyclic around those patches. And the environment is fluctuating between three states. And in any one state, only one of the patches, sorry, only one of the patches has. Patches, sorry, only one of the patches has a negative per capita growth rate. Okay, so you have this. And in this case, what you can show analytically, as shown in this numeric illustration, is that the first order correction term at low frequencies is positive. So it's saying that, oh, at higher frequencies, if you're low enough, you should have a higher Lyapunov exponent. But at the same time, if we just take the Lyapunov exponent and the limit of omega goes to infinity, you get. Omega goes to infinity, you get a lower value than at zero. So that means that the maximal per capita Lyapunov exponent occurs at an intermediate frequency. And it also means it's not monotonic, right? Like that's the, so in general, things need not be monotonic, which of course can mess up many things. So that's just sort of a warning. So with that, I want to finish up my talk. So I was talking about the effect of tempo and mode of environmental fluctuations on population growth. And what we saw was that. Population growth, and what we saw was that for structured populations, frequency typically matters. These first-order correction or second-order correction terms are usually non-zero. And mode seems to mostly matter at higher frequencies rather than lower frequencies, to the extent you can compare a pair of models. In particular, why that's the case for here is because I have the same approximation at low frequencies, whether it's a periodic or a stochastic model. Then we have formulas. Then we have formulas. That's another point I hope you get out of this talk that you and your friends can use for your favorite piecewise constant environmentally fluctuating models. I hope people try these formulas. They're actually not that hard to implement effectively in some symbolic packets like Python or something like that. So you can actually do with these fairly quickly. And then I want to conclude by thanking you for listening and NSF for funding, and then happily answer any. And then happily answer any questions that we have time for. Yeah, time is something I'm a guilty person. Thank you for this interesting talk. But I think you are cheating. Sure, I am. I'm keeping it simple because I'm stupid. So the question is, we have ODE modeling, and so solutions can never reach zero infinite time. That's right. We still talk about extinction. Let's still talk about extinction. So, in which sense do you use extinction? Oh, well, when I say in this talk, it's meaning asymptotically, you go to zero. I'm not saying in finite because there's no finite populations here, so I don't have demographic stochasticity or anything like that. But, despite your complaint that I'm cheating, Edward and one of his former graduate students did prove really cool results that would apply for these types of models with the density dependence and demographic stochasticity. And what they're able to show is. They're able to show is when that Lyapunov exponent is positive, the time to extinction when you're at the quasi-stationary distribution scales like a power law so that with the sort of system size, how large the population can get. So that means you can have very long sort of persistent times in these random environments. So in that sense, as long as the population is big enough, the time to extinction is very, very far into the future. And when the Lyapunov. Future. And when the Lyapunov exponent is negative, you get actually very fast, slow times, sorry, quick times to extinction. Yeah. Let me first go through Chris and then I'll do Mark. I have kind of two sort of related questions. For the continuous case, can this other paper that you mentioned, can you still get formulas for these or is it just purely pay and monotonous? I actually don't. I'd have to, I don't remember. I don't think there were formulas there, but I'd have to double check. Sorry, I didn't look at the paper closely enough. I usually feel like, okay. Closely enough. I usually feel like continuous things are easier to find things than discrete thing. Well, on some yes and no, like that first formula was sort of trivially obvious to me in the piecewise constant environment because you're in one environment. The matrix isn't changing, so you know you're going to follow eventually the stuff given by this basic depth, the eigenvalue and the eigenvectors. And if it was continuous, it's always shifting, even if it's shifting slowly, so you have to do something. If it's shifting slowly, so you have to do something most likely more subtle to get a low-frequency formula. And then also with the high-frequency formula expressions, like there's well-known formula, like the big issue is you're dealing with these non-commutative products of matrices that are exponentiated, and there's this well-known formula for how to approximate those, like e to the x times e to the y. Are you using, so then in the like many state case, you're doing sort of like You're doing sort of a uniform, all states are sort of equally likely to be. They don't have to be. So, like, if you had an infinite number of states, which we can't deal with, but the larger number of states, the larger the state, the sort of less likely it is to get there. So, you can't do this? Because you make something interesting for sort of like large deviations, like on the very small chance that you have an incredibly good environment and grow like crazy, and that matters more, even though it happens very rarely. No, it'd be interesting to see. No, it'd be interesting to see, like, if you have a Markov chain, like on a countable state, you know, like an infinitely countable state space, whether we could still do something where we know, like, yeah, you're spending very, very small amounts of times for a certain number of states. You know, maybe I don't know if that has to decay in a certain way or something. But I think it would be interesting to look at. I just, we didn't do that. Yeah, we definitely take advantage of finite number of states. Yeah. Yeah, Mark. Yeah, thanks for a great talk. Talk. So, in population viability models, where people don't include demographic stochasticity, often what they do is they have a threshold below which the quasi-extinction threshold. Now, for your models, I think your results might change a lot if you had something like that. Well, for my models, I'm not claiming I was using extinction in a loose sense in the way I described to Thomas. So there's no results to change. I mean, these are you know statements about Lyapunov exponents. Statements about Lyapunov exponents, right? They're not going to change. But you could say you could add a quasi-extinction threshold, and under certain circumstances, it's going to be irrelevant, like in the periodic fluctuating case when you have persistence. If that quasi-extinction threshold is low enough, you're never going to get there because the attractor is bounded well away from zero. So the only chance for seeing the quasi-extinction threshold being relevant were from the stochastic setting. So already you get a disparity there, like quasi-extinction only occurs in the stochastic. Extinction only occurs in the stochastic but not deterministic setting. What would happen if you just had a very slowly fluctuating environment and you just had a lot of bad times and your bad times were so bad that... Again, if you chose the quasi-extinction threshold low enough, it wouldn't matter in the periodic case. No, but in reality, like if you're applying things to real populations, the story might change entirely. Again, I don't disagree with you that. I don't disagree with you that. I'm not, I'm not sure. Yeah, I mean, there's this interesting question, which is, I think, that maybe you're alluding to, which is, you like, you have a Lyapunov exponent, and you might think the more positive it is, the longer you'll persist. And that is in general not true. So if you take a model that accounts for demographic stochasticity and environmental stochasticity, you can't just say, oh, the bigger Lyapunov exponent associated with the extinction state, the longer you'll persist. It's too easy. Longer you'll persist. It's too easy to come up with examples because this the opponent exponent is only telling you about sort of like the average growth rate in the long term. It's not telling you about the variance that's happening there. And therefore, it can't account for these other features that are really, really important that might be knocking the populations to low numbers in a way that puts them at greater risk each time they get to low numbers. So I totally agree. That makes sense. So I think that, I mean, that's a hard problem. Yeah, sure. And people are very interested. Yeah, sure. And people are very interested in that, and there's a lot of work being done on that, especially in the coexistence literature, because this came up from various researchers in Israel. And it's beautiful work, but it's still like, we're just scraping the surface of understanding that. But I think it's a really important problem. So I didn't mean to dismiss words. I think I needed to get my head in the right space of a question. All right, so Beau has a comment, but let's thank Sebastian one more time. We'll have something to say about the panel discussion tomorrow. We made a little bit more detailed plan based on some feedback we've heard during the meeting. Let's share my screen. So, the panel discussion tomorrow we will divide into three sections. Based on the topics and the okay. If you see a picture there, it's just because we have one maybe more to do, and if you don't see your pictures there, please volunteer if you want to join a particular section. So the idea now is we don't divide into three sections. Each will run for 30 minutes. Panel discussion. The panelists will The panelists will talk and then we will have 10-minute QA between the audience, the Zoom audience, and also the panelists. And then we will take a 10-minute coffee break between the sections. So give you a little bit of time just in case we always run out of time when people are talking. So the topic is spatial ecology, connecting math and bio, and the optimization and disease. It's very hard to say very clearly. Very hard to see very clearly the topic's name. So, if I put it wrong, don't blame me. We just try to group people a little bit. And another thing is we do wanted to have a scribe, if anyone wants to volunteer to be the scribe to write down the discussion. Because we wanted to turn each section discussion into at least one manuscript, submit to a journal in the future. I'm not particularly looking at GMB because. I'm not particularly looking at GMB because I've heard that name a lot. I see half on the editorial board is here. I like that. Yeah, but the idea is we do wanted to kind of push this field move forward by having more exciting ideas and the idea come from discussions. So if you're interested in, be the subscribe, we really need your help. Talk to folks. Yeah. And everyone, if you wanted to contribute to that paper, either in one section or if you think you can. In one section, or if you think you can deal with multiple sections, feel free to put your name down in each section. And then, when we're doing the panel tomorrow, we might just group people into three parts. And then after the discussion, we hope people can work together until late night tomorrow. Just get something written down, some ideas, and then you go back home, you can still work on this. Maybe it turned out to be some manuscript. That would be great. That's at least something you like to do. Yeah, it's not. Like to do it's not like, yeah, if you want to do anything, that's totally fine. Uh, um, but just we want more like interaction and then maybe group writing. That's, I always enjoy that when people write together. And maybe Sebastian will even draw the panel tomorrow. That would be great. All right. Anyway, yes, please, Mark. So that looks great. I was just wondering about the balance between, like, we've heard some amazing talks here. Do we want to mainly focus on what we've learned about emerging areas here? Learned about emerging areas here or surveying our own favorite merging areas. I'm just trying to think about how we orient with respect to that. I think we can start off of the talks, but I don't think we should be limited to the terms. Okay, so maybe start there in terms of summarizing what we might have heard. Yeah, maybe first and then move to related things. Yeah, and then end with some open problem, open directions. Yeah. So we'll be passing. Yeah, okay. So we'll be passing this in the next few calls. And one other thing is Julan Fong, she will also join both for a panel discussion and also a particular QA section just with her as the program officer from NISF. So if we have questions, we can talk, chat with her during this 25 minutes. It's going to be very short because we don't have a lot of time, so we have to be efficient. So if we can prepare something to say, that's very generous of you. So yeah, questions? You. Awesome. Yeah. So, how tied are you to the? Like, I know nothing about optimization and maybe a little bit about disease because I just started. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of how tied are we to those topic titles. Like, to me, the question I mentioned this morning that I'm very interested in based upon because there's been multiple talks on it, is just understanding like Lyapunov X bias, you know, because there's a lot of talks on that. And that seemed like a theme that would be interesting. It applies to lots of different model types. So, spectral problems. Yes, so spectral problems and the issue of different weight modes of persistence that becomes very important. But that wouldn't be quote optimization. That's why I just wanted to make sure I understood. Is it just like we're struggling with two things? Maybe not worry about the name of the thing. Yeah, don't worry about the name. Okay, that's the main thing I want to make sure. If there's a topic in this section, you're working on multiple topics. Thank you. Oh, and so can you sh so for those of you who are going to click the button? Who are going to take the bus to the lake, Moraine? So we will leave 12:20 outside of Lloyd Hall. So we'll walk 15 minutes or so to the bus stop, okay, and then get water and then get clothes and then get an umbrella. So after the talk ends at 11:45, you can grab a quick bite. I have the note in the schedule? Want to announce the schedule changes for the talks? Because there was a bit of confusion. That was my point. Yes, yes. And then Thomas, so Bob Holt has to cancel because of this housing issue that can lawyer. So Thomas Hillen's talk is moved to Thursday in the time of Bob Holmes' talk. The online schedule will reflect that later. So we end at ten, around ten on Friday. So that makes it a little different. Oh, I just had one request to prepare for this. If people could upload their slides, if they're comfortable doing so, I think you've already gave an opportunity for people to do so because, you know, like someone might remember it's awk and not be sure it's accessible. So we can pull it out. Yeah, so you should have received a link to the Google Drive already. So if you can upload it. Already, so if you can upload your slide and maybe one or two papers linked to your talk, that would be really helpful to the panelists.
