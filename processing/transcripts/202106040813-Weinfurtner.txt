So, welcome back, everybody. And now we've got Silke Weinfertner talking to us about quantum simulators for fundamental physics. Over to you, Silke. Okay. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to present on quantum simulators for fundamental physics. So, I have been given a similar talk quite a few times this year, but Quite a few times this year, but I'm now also focusing on some new results. So, for the ones who have seen it, please stay tuned. Okay, so quantum simulators for fundamental physics, as it says, and collaborators, this is a UK-wide network to set up some novel quantum simulators to test fundamental physics. And here, fundamental physics, I'm thinking about black hole and cosmological processes. Cosmological processes. Okay, so let's first talk about the motivation behind this initiative. So the idea is that we are interested in processes that are important in terms of understanding the dynamics of the early and late universe. And so they arise when both gravity and quantum theory matter in the interplay of these two pillars of modern. Two pillars of modern physics. And so, well, there are these essential processes that occur in situations that we simply cannot get any observational evidence or some experimental insights. And at the same time, this processes I'm thinking about, I'm going to be more specific, they occur in situations where our conventional calculations are. Conventional calculations, our mathematical toolboxes are less well understood or sometimes even breakdown. So, when is that the case? So, when the gravitational interactions are strong, for example, when quantum effects are important, or if you're interested in length scales that stretch beyond the observable universe. And so, what's really missing here is sort of a cross-validation between theory and experiment, which is usually sort of the An experiment, which is usually sort of a successful recipe to develop insights, physical insights, and physical theories. And so here, in particular, there is a potential here where we say, well, if I can set up an analog system where I have the same mathematical equations, I have the chance to check my toolboxes and to refine my toolboxes and then go beyond the analog system. Go beyond the analog system, apply them to the gravitational settings. So, this is the basic idea to bring some sort of physical insights as we usually do or add the standard procedure how we do physics to the interface between gravity and quantum theory. So, okay, this sounds all quite nice, but so how does how can something like this in principle work? Well, so you have So, you have what we're interested in are completely non-I would say some very different from gravitational systems. We're looking at tabletop systems we can set up in laboratories. And what we're looking at are there's a plandora of analog gravity systems, for example, fluids and superfluid optical systems. And if you look at small perturbations within these systems, you Within these systems, you can write down their dynamical equations as classical or quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Classical or quantum field theory means that it depends what your analog gravity system is. For example, I can study sound waves in water, that would be, and I can set up analog effective metrics as seen by the sound waves in the system. That would then be a simulator for classical field theory. For classical field theory in an effective curved space-time geometry. Or I'm going through setting up, going through the effort of setting up a superfluid and at very cold temperatures, for example, superfluid helium at sub-Kelvin, sub-1 Kelvin temperatures, you basically have a pure superfluid. And then, if you look at the sound waves in your system, you have to quantize these sound waves, and you can then set up an effect. Can then set up an effective or quantum field theory on an effective curved space-time geometry provided by the fluid flow. So, this is the common denominator of all these analog gravity systems. You have an overall dynamics that's very different from gravity. But if you look at the small perturbation around some background configuration, they basically have the same mathematics, they follow the same mathematics as quantum fields around curved. Quantum fields around curved in a curved space-time setting. So, why is this useful? So, okay, you have this nice and neat analogy, was pointed out by Bill in the 80s. And so, what can you do with it? That's the question. So, if you have any simulator, how many knobs do you have to turn the simulator? How many interesting scenarios can you investigate? And here in And here is the fault saying there's not one simulator for any process I'm interested in. Perhaps I should state that also very clearly we're interested in quantum field serving curved space-times. And what is wonderful about this scenario is that there are lots of interesting processes. For example, Hawking radiation, super radiance, black hole ring down, light bending, all of these things are interesting physical processes. interesting physical processes, which some of them which we have access through and some of them which we don't. Now for this, what you can do with these simulators by not just having a single superfluid but having a multi-component superfluid, you can enhance the complexity of your simulators. So you can add additional knobs you can turn to your analog gravity system or your quantum simulators for gravity. For gravity, gravitational processes. So, what can we do? Well, we can set up different space-time geometries that can be flat space-time, so Minkowski space-time, which is not at all boring. There's much to be explored, as I will mention later on. There are, of course, you can set up black hole horizons in the systems by setting up fluid flows that become supersonic if you are thinking of sound acoustic. Sound acoustic modes, phonon sound waves in the system, for example. And then you can also set up cosmological scenarios. And the way to think about it, you can use, you are considering systems where you can tune the sound speed as a function of time. And so if you think about how big is my sort of my effective universe, what's the size of it? Well, it's defined how long a perturbation needs to propagate from one end to the other. So if you then have To the other. So, if you then have a systematic way and a control way to change the sound speed in the system, you can actually, for example, increase the size of your effective or analog universe. So, for example, you can exponentially decrease the sound spread in a system, sound speed in the system, that is such that you have effectively an exponentially expanding universe. So, what you can also do are more exotic things. As I said, if you use multi-component fluids, you can change the signature of space-time. You can go from an Euclidean to a Lorentzian space-time. So general relativity, per se, doesn't tell you how many space and time dimensions you have. It is an assumption we're putting in. And what you can do, you can start with an analog space-time geometry that starts with in an Euclidean setting, so that would have four spatial. So that would have four spatial components, which corresponds to elliptic equations for the sound waves. And you can change them to sort of flip one of the space effective dimensions to a time dimension. So then you have a Laurentian space-time geometry. And then your equations governing the sound waves are hyperbolic equations. You can also, what we're looking here, so this it seems like, so what So, what is the characteristics of this fluctuations? So, here we have an analog for scalar fields. So, we don't have a spin two excitation or spin one excitations. We're working with scalar fields. And these fields usually are massless. But again, you can couple various fluids together to create a mass term. And this mass term that can be stable can be a stable mass, meaning m squared is larger than zero, or you can make an Or you can make an instable mass, an unstable mass, an instable mode, and that will be mass squared smaller than zero, so an imaginary mass. And you can also tune in Britin and you can make the mass metastable. So you can set up tachyonics fields, you can set up normal masses, or you can also set up metastable configurations to, for example, study the false vacuum decay in these systems. And then, of course, you also have a quantum system. course you also you have a quantum simulator so ideally that is you know evolving in front of you in the time domain you can have simulations in the time domain but you also want to interact with the system so you need to think of what will be suitable particle detectors or detectors that could interact with your analog curved space-time geometry and so in this sense you can create local probes and as we've shown you can also think of these local probes as Local probes as effective UNRWA detectors or effective particle detectors. That gives you then also the potential to simulate the UNROW effect in these analog gravity systems by adding extra fields that interact with your simulator. So this is a long story here. All I wanted to, or what I wanted to convey in this slide is that, well, analog gravity is a field of research where we had some recent successes in terms of experimental. Successes in terms of experimental implementation, for example, most prominently Hawking radiation, but there is a huge potential to go beyond and do much more. And so, I would say, if you ask me, where are we in the field of analog gravity simulations, I would say, well, we know that, you know, we know that this approach is working in the sense that we could discover some of this fascinating physics in the lab, but there is yet more to be done to go a step further. Okay, so this is what. Okay, so this is what this UK-wide consortium with the help of six external collaborators is what we are trying to achieve. And so we have the main objectives here is to getting a better understanding of the quantum vacuum. So we want to look at the quantum vacuum fluctuations in superfluids. And that's one part of the proposal or one part of the object, one objective. The object one objectives and the other big objective is to study quantum black holes. And in particular, we are focusing on what is known as a very classical effect, the black hole ringdown. And our goal is to study this quantum black hole ringdown in the quantum domain. Okay, and what I'm going to do, because I only have half an hour, I'm going to say just have one slide on the first objective, the quantum vacuum, and then I will. Objective: the quantum vacuum, and then I will focus on the quantum black hole part because there we have some new insights, some new results which we published, I think, last week and which I'd like to share with you. Okay, so challenges related to the quantum vacuum. So, again, as I said before, suppose you set up your analog gravity simulator, namely just a superfluid. And if a superfluid is at rest, no background fluid flow, what the Fluid flow, what the small perturbations experience, the superfluid, they propagate around a homogeneous condensate background. They see this condensate simply as a Minkowski space-time geometry. And so here already you could say, well, I can then study the quantum fluctuations in the system. Now, the UNRWA effect, the UNRO process tells us, well, it depends on the observer how you perceive the quantum vacuum in the system. The quantum vacuum in the system, or if there are, for example, collective phonomodes present, quasi-particles, or if I really see the vacuum state. And so one needs to think of a scheme of how to interact with them. So we need some additional fields to interact with the quantum fluctuations, the sound waves in your Bose-Engineering coordinate state. So one thing we shown recently is that One thing we shown recently is that if you take a localized laser beam interacting with the fluctuations in the Bose-Einstein condensate, you can map that onto an effective particle or UNROID detector. Here we're using a continuous field to map out the fluctuations. And what happens is if you then, for example, accelerate your local measuring probe, for example, by putting it on a For example, by putting it on a circular trajectory, that then you are what your detector realizes or detector sees is not the quantum vacuum fluctuations in the BAC. It does see the presence of this quasi-particle excitations and meaning it gets modified according to the protocol described by UNRU many, many years ago. So, this would be a local, a local. So, this would be a local ideal measurement, ideally a quantum sensitive measurement, where you minimally change your quantum simulator while interacting with it. And the wonderful part behind this is that local probes, these measurement probes, can be interferometric detection schemes, which of course are wonderful techniques to measure the smallest perturbations. Okay, so then if Okay, so then if you want to set up, you know, if you want to get more insights about the quantum vacuum state in these systems, you can, as I mentioned before, you can set up massive excitations and you can tune the mass term such that it's metastable. And what you then can study in these systems, you can study how these meter stable systems, how they start to decay from a false to a true vacuum. From a false to a true vacuum state. And what you see here is these are simulations, and there are tuning parameters where you can set up how metastable, it's a strange statement, but here you can play around with the system. And for example, if you look at the bottom line here, is you start with the system initially in blue, it's all in the false vacuum state, and you let it evolve over time. And what you see that here, when you start to see this little blob forming here. This little blob forming here, and you have this sort of red areas forming, what you see is that that's an indication of how your quantum field theory tunnels from a false to a true vacuum state in the system. So I won't be talking much about this because I want to focus on the new results. So the black hole ringdown and how can you set up analog gravity simulators of the black hole ringdown? Of the black hole in down. Okay, so the first question: so the first thing is: we're going to focus on rotating black holes. So, rotating black holes, right, are generally very interesting gravitational objects. And that is because they have not just an apparent or event horizon, a black hole horizon, which, for example, gives you the Hawking process. They also have ergosurfaces and light rings, and circular orbits. Light rings are circular orbits. Light rings are circular orbits. And so, what that means is they have many more features. And each one of these features carries with it an interesting process. The fact that a black hole has a black hole horizon, an apparent horizon, gives you the Hawking effect. The fact that you have ergosurfaces means you will get the Penrose effect or super radiance. The fact that you have light rings or circular orbits means you get a black hole ring down. You get Black hole ring down, you get ringdown modes, characteristic modes. So, there's a lot of interesting physics to study if you are successfully setting up this analog of a rotating black hole in the lab. So, and now of course, some of the effects I mentioned here, ones we usually think about in the classical domain, for example, super radians or circular orbits. But of course, in this system. But of course in this in these systems which we are having, we have a very high control and in particular when you work with quantum system superfluids, both angst and condensate, helium four flows at very low temperatures, you can actually switch on sort of quantum physics and you can study how these processes behave in the quantum world. And so the effect I'm interested in is related to the black hole ringdown. And so what's the black hole ringdown? What's the black hole window? I'm stealing here a picture from the LIGO collaboration. Subsequently, this discovery here, which is the discovery of the gravity or the detection of gravitational waves from two inspiring black holes, was awarded with a Nobel Prize. So I stole this picture here from the publication. And this is just to explain a bit what the black hole ringdown really is. Ringdown really is. So you have two inspiral black holes. They are getting closer and closer together. While this is happening, they give off this gravitational waves. And the red, wriggly line below is simply the gravitational waves given off from this inspiring black binary system as detected here on Earth by the LIGO collaboration. And then, sorry, I got a chat message. No, not for me. Okay, sorry, I thought I'm running out of time. Okay, so you have the two black holes, they start merging, and then at the final stage, this black hole has merged into one, but it hasn't quite settled down yet. Sort of as if you want to think of this, to just make it a bit really, you have an event horizon that's still a bit bumpy or a black hole horizon. So it has to still give off some energy. And it does so in the final stages with this black hole ring down mode. So it's the very end part here. So, it's the very end part here of this binary inspiral process here, where two black holes merge into one. And so, what is an interesting concept here is that this black hole ring down, while it is the end product of a fully non-linear process, meaning these two black holes forming a single black hole, this black hole ring-down modes are predicted in the perturbative. Are predicted in the perturbative regime, meaning they don't care the actual ringdown frequencies. And I have to say a bit more, the ringdown frequencies have a real and an imaginary part. It's like when you hit the bell, it has resonance frequencies, but also it has a decaying part. And so these ring down frequencies, not which ones are excited, but which ones can be excited in the system. They can be fully predicted. fully predicted using perturbation theory around the newly formed around the 20 minutes in thank you around the new newly formed black hole so right and so these are I shouldn't really call them characteristic modes these are not eigen modes of the system we'll get back to this but so we can calculate them in the perturbative regime so no matter how you there are many ways to excite How you, there are many ways to excite them, but at the end, sort of whenever you could also excite them, for example, by having a black hole and perturbing it, hitting it with a big gravitational wave, for example. And then this ringdown modes, and we're going to talk about them, are independent of how you're exciting them in the first process because we're calculating them in the perturbative regime. And so what we want to do is we want to first see this ring down in an analog system, and then we're going to talk about how they will look. Going to talk about how they will look like in a quantum setting, and we have some first results on that. If I get to this, let me see. Okay, so I have to speed up a little bit, but the main idea is how can I set up an analog rotating black hole? The system we're choosing is a stationary draining fluid flow. And what we're interested in, we're looking at the interface. So, in the first experiments we've done, it was simply First experiments we done, it was simply an air-water interface, and what you get: you get a fluid flow, which let's assume it's a two-dimensional fluid flow. It has a radial component, a draining component, and an angular component. And if you get the apparent horizon or the effective black hole horizon, when the radial component is equal to the perturbations, the speed of the perturbation on my interface, my air-water interface. On my interface, my air-water interface. And you get an ergo surface, which is further out, when the total velocity is equal or larger than the ripple speed. So while the fluid drains, it is a rotating fluid flow, while it drains and you come closer to the sinkhole, so it drains through the center. The angular velocities and the radial velocities are speeding up. The ripple speeds, let's just assume for now, for simplicity, are staying the same. So while you're coming close. Are staying the same. So while you're coming closer to the drain, the fluid flow speeds up, and eventually you get this ergosurface when the total velocity exceeds the perturbation speed of your interface. And then you have an effective horizon when the radial velocity is equal to the ripple speed. And so then you can set up, you can calculate deriving from, starting from the Nabi-Stokes equations, simplifying your fluid flow, invisible, your rotational, and so forth, incompression. So forth, incompressible. You look at the perturbations, and then you can show that this small perturbation follows an effective space-time geometry. How does this look like in the lab? So this is pictures taken of our classical fluid flow experiment at the University of Nottingham. It's a big water tank, three meters long, one and a half meters wide, and then the fluid flow is about 10 centimeters high. Our observable here is the free surface. Observable here is the free surface, the air-water interface. We've developed some novel detection schemes, how we can map out these little perturbations on this interface over space and in time. So, and how does this look like? I'm showing you here some experimental results, how these waves interact with this vortex flow. And you see, we send a coherent wave interacting with such a vortex flow. And what's happening is that we just filter. We just filter the frequency band which we're exciting. And what you can see already is that behind this vortex here, you get strong deformations of your wave fronts. And that is because this wave is propagating an effective curved space-time geometry. And then you can calculate, and I have to skip, you can calculate the characteristics or the geodesics by focusing on a small element of your wavefronts. If you look at a wave. Wave fronts, if you look at a wavefront and a small part of your wavefront, you can calculate the characteristics or the geodesics on the effective curved spacetime geometry. And what you can get is you can, therefore you can predict how your waveframes are getting deformed simply by propagating on such a effective curved spacetime geometry. And now I really have to speed up here, but what you get is you get the circular orbits. And these are very interesting points, and they are simply the separation between. And there's simply the separation between the stuff. If I look at a black hole, you can say and I throw something into it, which parts will fall in and which will escape. And then it depends, of course, if you are on the side where you would be corrating or counter-rotating with the black hole. And what this circular orbits give you, they give you a separation. You know, there's a point where you would fall in and a point where you can escape. And if you bring this closer together, the point just in between is where the circular orbits are. Meaning, if you were to point at Meaning, if you were to point a point particle onto these orbits, it would hoover forever. If you put a wave around there, there's part of that wave that gets caught on the circular orbit and they're slowly dying off. And this is why these quasi-normal modes or ring-down modes, they have a real part and an imaginary part, which means they oscillate with a characteristic frequency and then they die off in time. So, what we did is we said, well, long story short, they are hard to excite, but we know other. They are hard to excite, but we know out of any non-equilibrium process, we expect, just as from the black hole, that the endpoints of this process has to be the, you know, be this be describable in the perturbative regime. So we looked at the simple, we excited the vortex flow and let it settle back to the rest. And then you see a lot of noise on this, and we did a careful analysis. And what we could show is that this noise actually is not noise. If you decompose this noise, the frequency, if you The frequency, if you decompose it onto the answer-model parts, you can make a prediction where you expect these ring-down modes to be. And the black here is our zero prediction, and the green is our experimental results. And within the arrow bars, it's in great agreement. So, now, how does this look like in quantum systems? I have two or three slides left. So, in a quantum system, what's the main thing that's different? Well, and if we don't think about the perturbations being quantized, if I'm Perturbations being quantized, if I'm exchanging my classical fluids with a quantum fluid, the first thing I get is that the circulation is discrete. Instead of having a macroscopic vertex flow, you have angular momentum is topological. So what we did, we set up a vortex cluster, or you could also start from a single vortex cluster with a high winding number. And then what would happen? It will decay. In our case, we just start 29 quantized. 29 quantized vortices closely together, and then we let them decay the cluster. This is what you get. So, this is the compact vortex cluster decay. I'll need three minutes to finish. So, you see, initially, they are so close together that you cannot distinguish individual vortices. They are the center of these black holes. This is a 2D Bosa-Einstein condensate simulation with a dumping term. And then we let the cluster expand, and now you see these little holes that form. These are individual vortices. Formed, these are individual vortices that interact, and you see all this noise. And now it looks like this is just some random noise, some highly non-linear process. And who knows what's going on? You probably would need to calculate the wave interacting with all these individual vortices. That is not true. What we showed is you can actually, if you define a proper coarse-grained background, namely the coarse-grained velocity field, the average velocity field, you can identify this light. You can identify these light rings. These light rings sit outside the vortex cluster. And now you can, although this is a highly non-linear process, you can fully determine the radiation spectrum given off by this decaying vortex cluster. And this is completely in agreement what people try to do in a gravitational wave program. They say, well, look, usually when we look at, think of black hole ringdown, we wait for the black hole to form, then we only have to do a lot of the form. Wait for the black hole to form, then we only have the very late stages of the merger, the final stages, which we can predict with perturbation theory. But now people go beyond and say, Look, if I have a binary system, what if I can perturb around an effective background geometry so that I could already use this LiDRAN methods before the merge of the black hole? So I could extend my perturbation theory if I find the right background to perturb around, well before the black holes have merged. Black holes have merged. And this is what here you can do. We identify three different stages. This is A is the initial phase, B is with all the waves, where this thing radiates and gives off some energy. And what we do, we're working around this effective vertex geometry. And we can calculate, we can predict exactly the, for example, here, the spectrum as given off in this system. And as you can see here on the top is our analysis. See, here on the top is our analytical modeling, and the bottom is what we got from the numerics. Now, I'm running out of time, but what we are after here, there are some resonance mode, some resonance mode, normal modes in the system. But besides the normal modes, you see that this straight line here, this is our prediction for the light ring modes. And we can plot these violin plots to see exactly that where we predict it, you get these very clear signals which are being given off throughout this whole norm. Are being given off throughout this whole non-linear process, which you can fully describe in the perturbative regime. And so, this is what we're doing now. We're going to go from this classical system. We have now set up the new suitable system to repeat this in a macroscopic superfluid helium-4 film. We're starting the experiments now, and I think that within a year we will have some first experimental results. And the goal is then to switch on, make this whole thing more and more quantum. Make this whole thing more and more quantum by first quantize the circulation, which you always get for free in a superfluid. And as a next step, then we are further cooling down the system and making it smaller so that you not only have a discrete circulation, discrete angular momentum, but that you also have quantized excitations interacting with your analog black hole with quantized angular momentum. With quantized angular momentum. And so here is who is all behind these quantum simulators for fundamental physics. And I'm really sorry, I probably run horribly over time. Thank you very much. Thanks very much, Silka. That's loads of exciting stuff. I'm afraid we don't really have time for questions now, but there is like a whole discussion session unless somebody has some desperate need to ask now. Need to ask now, then can we just save it? Save the questions for the discussion session, if that's all right. You can also pop me a message in the chat if you have a question. I'm happy to answer that as well. Yeah, great. Thanks, thanks, thanks, Sophie, again. Thank you.
