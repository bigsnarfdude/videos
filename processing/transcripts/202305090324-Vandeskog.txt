All right, so the next one is by Silis van deskog, and then after that we get Manho Swell. Yes. All right, thank you. Thanks. So yeah, my name is Sibis, as I said, and I'm a PhD student from NTNU in Norway. And today I'm in my poster, I'm presenting work that I did together with my supervisor, Slada Martino, and also together with Rohar, who I visited for three months in Cast. So the overall aim of my work for the last So, the overall aim of my work for the last years has been to improve the flood mitigation tools by developing a methodology for modeling extreme precipitation in space. Of course, time would also be nice, but we never really got to that. So it's only space. And the specific work in my poster today is that we've been trying to simulate extreme hourly precipitation in space, quite high-dimensional hourly precipitation. So the So, the case study we're working on looks like this. Here you have an area in the middle part of Norway. This black line defines water catchment. So, whenever you have water falling somewhere inside, it eventually ends up down here where you also have people living. And we want to prepare these people for the possibility of a future flood by simulating precipitation over the entire catchment so we know where it will fall and how much, and things like this. And things like this. So, we have a lot of data to deal with this. We have radar data on a regular grid of one times one square kilometer. So, every black dot that you might not be able to see is one observation every hour, and we have 13 years of data. So, when you want to model and stimulate extreme precipitation, there are several challenges that have already been mentioned. You need to have flexible modeling of the serviceymptotics, weak independence, things like this. Weak independence, things like this are often very nice, especially when modeling precipitation. Also, we have very high-dimensional data, we have several thousand locations in space, and then inference can be very heavy. And also, typically, models based on extremes often have these kind of asymptotically modified assumptions that might not always hold perfectly. So, you want models that are kind of robust. So, if all the So, if all the asymptotic assumptions don't always hold, you still want the inference to make sense in some way. So, our work has been to kind of try to deal with these different challenges in different ways to achieve flexibility. We have used the modeling framework based on spatial conditional streams models, which has already been mentioned several times. And then also to achieve speed and get fast inference for high. Speed and get fast inference for high-dimensional problems. We build upon the work by Emma Simpson and others for using performing fast inference using INLA and the SVE approximation. And in building upon their work, we've also developed some new method for choosing how to find specific forms for the standardizing functions. We proposed a new type of parametric form for the standardizing functions in the model. Standardizing functions in the model. And we've also developed a new non-stationary SPDE approximation that works very well when implementing the spatial conditional extremes model within RNLA, within the RINLA framework. And then at last, we also developed a new constraining method for the residual fields that works when using RINLA. Also, to achieve more robustness, we have extended upon We have extended upon a post hoc transformation method that was developed by Benjamin Shabey. So it's basically based on taking posterior samples and then transforming them in some way. So you get more robust results and a posterior that makes more sense and you adjust for the possible misspecification that might be in your model and data. In extending upon this, we have also proposed a new So, proposed a new transformation that you can apply to the prior, which coupled together with the post-of transformation of the posterior kind of makes everything more interpretable and makes more sense when you consider the prior. And also, we have this, so when you use the spatial conditional extremes model, typically you can only use one location at a time. But then, as Rafael mentioned yesterday, you can have this composite likelihood where you combine information. This composite likelihood where you combine information from multiple locations. That doesn't always work so well when you're doing Bayesian inference because you get a lot of misspecification. But then we can use this transformation method that we extend to account for this misspecification of the composite likelihood and to get more reasonable results with the composite likelihood. Then we apply all this for modeling and simulating the precipitation extreme. The precipitation extremes in the case study I show.
