Thank you very much, Professor May, for the introduction. And I also would like to thank the organizers for the invitation to be here in this beautiful place and to have the opportunity to attend the interesting lectures and also discussion with mathematicians from many places. So, I will speak about the global existence of global welfareness to. Of global well-positeness to three-dimensional complexible Navier-Dosian equations. Well, here we are working in this typical three, this special three-dimensional syn domain of which are actually periodic. This is based on work collaborating with Sai Li and Yun Joseon, my colleagues from Nanjing. Now, this is our setting. So, this is the basic system. This is our system, the compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations. And the domain we are working on is this omega delta, which is of the form torus times delta torus square. So it's kind of a same domain, which is actually same, which is same in two directions, in the X2 direction as well as the X3 direction. So it's actually very close to one-dimensional problem. Close to one-dimensional problem. So, what we are going to show? We are going to show that this should be three-dimensional. Sorry for the temple, because this is based on my slides of this two-dimensional compressible NGS dose with one single variable. So, we will show that when this thickness of the domain, delta. The thickness of the domain delta is very small, we have global internal post-ness. And we are also going to show that this three-dimensional problem can be well approximated by the one-dimensional compressed Navier-Stokes. Well, there are a lot of studies concerning the global well-posedness of compressed Bonavius-Tozi equations. If you go back to the 80s by Matsumura and Anishida, assuming. Assuming the initial data are sufficiently small in some soap-lapse spaces, you can show the global existence. There are also this celebrated work by Huang Li and Zhou Pingxing, where they can show that by assuming the initial energy is small, also as well as the density in the L affinity, we can show the global well-pulsedness. There are some extensions of the study in this direction. Of the study in this direction by Huang and Li, and later on by Li and Sheng, and so on. Also, there are these works in this BSOF spaces, where they are trying to show the global existence in certain critical space. Of course, for these compressible VSOs, you do not have a natural scaling invariance due to the pressure law, which is of some power gamma, but the skinning media. The scaling may depend on this gamma. Well, I mean, if you assume, for example, the density is close to one, you could think about this P of rho is simply rho of the form. There is certain scaling invariants. You could also think about the scaling invariant spaces, so-called critical spaces. Though there are works by Dong Shai, Xia Vua Dongsha, and also by Chen Mio and Professor Zhubei Zhang here, and also Haspot. And by assuming certain large initial velocity, there are also works which can show the global existence. For example, by assuming certain structure of the solutions, this spherical symmetric solution. You have this work by Ding Shi Jin Ding, Hua Yowen, Lei Yo, and Chang Jiangzhu. And there are also works by Dao Shan Muha and And Jim Mingcheng and Xiaoping Jai, and so on. I will not go out to this. There are certain largeness, but most importantly, there are smallness in all these all structure assumptions. What we have actually for the global well-portland of compressible Navier stocks with lead data is in 1D, in one dimensional setting, you have the global existence and uniqueness of. And the uniqueness of smooth solutions, as long as the initial data is smooth without any smallness samples. So, one direction to get this global well-builtness is to, for example, assuming smallness, certain smallness. Another direction could be to reduce the dimensions. You could start with something in higher dimensions, like three-dimensional or Like three-dimensional or two-dimensional. And you find certain things which allows you to reduce the dimension from 3D to 1D or from either 2D to 1D. Well, for one dimension, the compressible IVS dose, it is globally well posted, even for large initial data. So maybe we can benefit from this global. From this, the global well-position of the limit equations and to show the global well-position of the original equations. So there is the work by collaborating with Professor Ping Zhang, and we are able to show that for the two-dimensional compressible Navier stocks, if you assume initial data is certain has a slow variable, which is of this form, epsilon Îµ2, this is the initial X2, this is the initial data for the density as well for the velocity field. And we, as long as this epsilon, which measures the slowing variation of this XO2 variable, is sufficiently small, we can show the global verbosness. Why? Because in this case, with such a slow variable assumption, it's two-dimensional compressible largest dose will reduce to one-dimensional. Will reduce to one-dimensional compressible narrative stokes. And well, you could also think about the three-dimensional case with two slowly varying variable, two slow variables. This is done by my student, Nan Nan Yang, while following the similar strategy. Well, here, actually, for our syndrome, we are working also similar direction. I will probably show you later. Uh, we will probably show you later, and there are also some work without any uh large smallness assumption, for example, this one by uh Veiga and Kajikov. Without assuming the viscosity coefficients are constant, but by assuming the disc called uh bulk viscosity coefficient is a function of the density like zhou to the power of beta. For this special case. For this special case, if beta is larger than three, they could show the global well-proposedness. This beta could be reduced to three, four-thirds by Shan Yihua and Jing Li. And if you do not expect the solution, if you are not able to get the global existence, you could probably show certain blow-ups properties. For example, Properties. For example, this celebrated work by Professor Zhou Pingxing, where he showed the solution with a compact supported density must blow up at final time. Something like that, right? Yes. And also there are works by extended works by Professor Zhu Bei Shi and his collaborators like Wei Yen and by Hai Lian Li and Yu Xing Wang and so on. Yuan Wang and so on. Also, you could also think about the so-called blow-up criterion. And in two-dimensional case by my colleague, Professor Yun Jong Sun and also Professor Zhufei Zhang here, they are able to show in two-dimensional, the first work on this two-dimensional compressible Nagi stokes. They are able to show that as long as the density is bounded from above, then the solution will be. Will be smooth. And also, there are works by later by with Chao Wang, and also there are work by Huang Li and Shin to show not only the compressible navier stokes in centropic case, but as well as the case including temperature. There are also work by Hua Yang, Chang Jianzhu, and also Yung. Yung, Huang Li, and Wang. Well, this is about smooth solutions. If we are considering the so-called finite energy weak solutions, given certain assumptions on this adiabatic number gamma, you could show actually the global existence of weak solutions. For example, by Pierre Lynz, where I think Where I think the three-dimensional case gamma is assumed to be larger than 9 over 5. And also, this work by Professor Sung Jang and Professor Ping Zhang, where they can able to show as long as this gamma is larger than one, then in spherical symmetric setting, they are able to show the global existence of weak solutions. And of course, later on in this celebrated work by Feliz. Celebrated work by fellas on the Mortoni and Pichatova, where they are able to conclude as long as this gamma is a larger nice resource in two-dimensional case, you have a global weak solution. Well, in our same domain studying, if you think about the solution which is periodic as with period delta, two pi delta, which well delta is small. I mean, if you assume it is rather smooth, for example, continuous. Smooth, for example, continuous, then it must converge into its average. So, given the smooth solution in our this type of syn domain, we would expect that the solution converges to its average with respect to x2 and x3 variable. This xh is denotes x2, x3, which is in this very thin torus. Taurus. So, our way first is to derive certain limit equations, and then it says that it is due to this observation, it is natural to integrate the equations in this x2 and x3 variable to find the average. So, then you will achieve at this one D system. Since we are averaging XH, you don't see XH anymore, only the timer. Anymore, only the time variable and the x1 variable remain. And formally passing this delta to zero, if we assume this average convergence in some sense to the limit R and V, which is independent of delta, you will arrive at a system in this limit R and V. And this limit is nothing but a 1D compressible Navier stores. The first two equations will form a closed 1D compressible Navier-Dose. Then you have a Then you have a solution R and V1, and then you can solve R V2 and V3 from the second and from the third and fourth equations, which are rather parabolic. So for this 1D problem in Taurus, it is well posed. You have the classical works, for example, by Kajikov or later by Stlashklava and Solonik. As long as the initial data is instantaneous. Is smooth, for example, H5. If we assume the initial density or total, the total mass is one or the average, and the linear momentum initially is zero, you have a global in-time sprout solution in such a space. Moreover, by assuming the initial data is bounded from below and above, you will have also the density of the solution. To the density of the solution when the solution is bounded from below and above. As well, it enjoys such due to this assumption. You could also show it enjoys such exponential decay. This is like bounded domain, similar as bounded domain case. So our main result is the following. Firstly, I will give these assumptions on the initial data. This is the initial data of our original 3D problem. It is written as Is written as windy problem plus some small perturbation. Well, this perturbation is small in some such a sense. It is in H2. It enjoys its integral properties. And the important part is if you take the twice derivative to this perturbation, initial perturbation, it is of order delta to the power minus kappa. And this kappa is not too large. And this kappa is not too large, it's between zero and one-half, it cannot be too large. Well, given these assumptions, these restrictions on this perturbation, you can actually show the initial density, this one, the initial total mass, the average mass, total mass is one, and the linear momentum initially is zero. Actually, this looks like a large, but in fact, due to okay, I will explain it a little. Actually, since we are working in this same domain, you have a PoincarÃ© inequality. You use a PoincarÃ© due to the size of the domain is delta. You gain at delta each time you use it. So, if you look at the radio norm or even the L to norm of U and Tau itself, it's not large, it's small. Small. So we will look at these perturbations. Instead of studying the original system, we will study the equations in this perturbation, Joe delta minus the limit equation, as well as the velocity field. Define this energy functional at time t, which includes quite a lot of terms. And this one is the elephant norm of the density difference here. Difference here. So if delta is sufficiently small, we are able to show that the original 3D problem undermines the global interim strong solution in this space, such that the energy function is of this size, delta to the power minus 2k, and the density difference is small of size delta to the power beta. When the beta is the between zero. And the beta is the between zero and one minus two kappa. Again, this kappa is in zero and between zero and one half. So this is still this is positive. This is the domain result. Before showing the key steps of the proof, I will give some remarks. The first one concerning the initial data, actually the initial difference between the exact solution and the approximate 1D solution. We are seeing the twice derivative. Derivative norms is of size delta to the power minus kappa. Well, using Poanga equality, if you take lower order derivative, it is not big. For example, this norm is delta to the power one minus kappa, and this is delta to the power of two minus kappa. Each time you lose one, you take one less derivative, one time less, you gain a delta. And so in And so actually, in this so in this choice of initial data choice of initial data, this is actually small, up to like W1 infinity norm almost. This is actually. Norm almost. This is actually small. So, actually, the size of the initial data to the original system is actually determined by the initial data of the 1D problem. So, we here we do not have a size restriction of this 1D problem. We can a little bit generalize the unitial data to say this one is not independent of delta. It could depend on delta. Well, it's It could depend on delta while it's converging to something independent of delta in rather large in good sub-wave spaces. Okay. Now I will briefly show you some key steps in the proof. We will look at the perturbations between the exact solution and the limit equation, limited solution, the approximate solution, 1D solution. And you will easily So easily get the equations in this perturbation tau and capital U from the equations in row R, U, and V. And there is the initial data for the this perturbation. So we define our time. Up to this time, the initial difference between these densities is small of size A1 over 2. Why we change? Why do we choose such a thing? Because this R is between A1 and AB, B1. So by choosing this difference is small, it guarantees this rho delta is also bounded from below away from zero and bounded from above. And so first we are looking at this basic energy estimates. This is the energy functional. And again, this tau delta is the rho delta minus r. Is the rho delta minus r. So this is a kinetic energy. This is related to the pressure. You can actually have since up to this temp tau star where we have is t star star, where we have the uniform lower and the upper bound for zhou, r and so on, this is actually zhou delta minus r square, tau delta square. So by By actually a rather direct computation, this is now well understood. It's called relative intro by inequality, and you have such equality where this R is of this form. And from this, together with the Gravo, you will have this energy functional times, this viscosity term, dissipation term. It will be bounded by the initial energy. Will be bounded by the initial energy. Again, this initial energy is the L2 norm square, and the L2 norm, as we mentioned earlier, is delta to the power 2 minus kappa. So the square is 4 minus 2, kappa. It is small. So from this basic energy estimates, we will have the L2 norm and the L2L2 norm of the gradient is of a size delta to the power of 4 minus kappa is small. And the next step is to show the decay. And the next step is to show the decay estimates of the L2 norms. Actually, we are able to show that this L2 norm of the perturbations is oversets delta square and decay exponentially. Well, here is something tricky. We are not working directly to this decay estimates. We are actually going back to the original system to show the decay estimates of the original. Decay estimates of the original 3D problem, 3D compressed by stokes. And then, together with the decay estimates of the 1D problem, we are able to recover this estimate. Why we are able to show this one? Actually, this is the idea is quite basic. We are trying to achieve at such ODE inequality. If you can do it, you will have. If you can do it, you will have the exponential decay. So, the basic energy equality for the original three-dimensional problem will give you this one. And this is energy functional, the kinetic energy and the energy related to the pressure potential. And again, this one is like zero delta minus one square. We will try to achieve this kind of OD. This kind of OD inequality. Now we have F, this is our F. We want to have F here, but firstly, this show delta is bounded from above. This looks like L2 norm of U. Well, this is like radiant U delta L to norm. If we are able to use the PoincarÃ© inequality, we can actually make a peer part of F at least. Unfortunately, this is not true in general because. This is not true in general because this u delta has the mean mode. In Taurus, you have a Poanga inequality if you don't have a mean mode or if you manage the mean mode. You take out the mean mode. Well, here it is possible due to this lemma by Shufei Zhang and Ri Zhao Zhi, where if you have the initial density satisfy such a property, like initially, if it is satisfied, it satisfies all time due to the conservation of mass. And the conservation of linear. Mass and the conservation of linear momentum tells you it's norm, the integral is zero for all time. So if this density is bounded from above, you have such a Poangai type inequality. Well, the proof is rather clever and not complicated. You can use this thing. And since this row has upper bound, the row bar, you can replace the two by row bar. You can replace the two by robot square, and you will finally achieve such a thing. And this is since you are taking out the minimal, you will achieve this grading. So we have a part of E1. In this E1, you not only have this kinetic energy, you also have zhou delta minus raw spare integral. But here, that's nothing to do with the density. So we have to make appear some density here. This is done by applying. By this is done by applying the so-called Bogovsky operator in the momentum equation. So we are testing the momentum equation by this function, which is zho delta minus one, applying this Bukovsky operator. Bukovsky serves as a right universe of divergence. It has certain good properties. And by doing so, And by doing so, since here it should be gradient, then you put the gradient here by divergence, divergence B will go back to this route delta minus one. So you will have a term which is like this. All other terms somehow can be controlled, either by this, either by the thing from the energy function in the previous slide. And this one, again, using the fact that this rho delta minus one, the integral is zero. The integral is zero. So you could minus y here, which changes nothing. And these two put them together is nothing but rho data minus y square. So you make a pure rho data minus y square. I will, and as I mentioned, other terms can be controlled either by the gradient u norm, either by the row u square norm, by the row minus u square norm at the can be a solar. Either can be absorbed by this one, either can be absorbed by this one. So, well, here we will use, for example, we are treat taking care of this term. There will appear this row delta L4 norm square. And to estimate this L4 norm, we will use the Gagliano-Nuremberger type of inequality. And there will appear a certain delta to the minus power, but it's fine. Manage the power, but it's fine because we are actually we have a delta here when we apply the point the holder inequality on this thin domain. This thin domain, the domain of the size of the domain or the volume of the domain is delta to the power two. So if you go from L2 to L infinity, you gain delta. So it's just fine. And other terms can be controlled. And the other terms can be controlled. So, together with this one, it can be absorbed by this one, and this one can be absorbed by this term. Putting them together, you will have such ODE inequality and give you exponential decay. I want to say something about this Gagliana numeral inequality because it's not the classical one. So, the next step. Oh, I'm out of time. Sorry. So, I just want to Sorry. So I just want to briefly so yeah, after a lot of calculations, but it follows the idea of David Hoff in 1995 concerning the global economic solutions with small energy and L affinity density. You will have this one with negative power and this L4 L4 norm. So it's not closed. L4 norm. So it's not closed. We want to know what this is. To know what it is, we as Dr. Hoff, we employ this effective viscous flux. And the L4 norm of it can be controlled by these three terms. In particular, everything, and in fact, everything will go back to effective viscous flux F. So we are, it's crucial to control this L4 norm of F. What we do, we will use the, again, the Gardner neural interpolation. Gagniano-neurable interpolation inequality. From the momentum equation, this effective flux can be discovered that it enjoys certain regularity. And the ultronorm can be controlled by this. I want to say is in this two dimension, in this same domain setting, if you directly do risk getting technique and to show to get the Gagnon neural inequality, it's not actually. It's not actually, it will appear this negative power. Why? Because this P is larger than two. If P is larger than two, if you compare the norms, I mean, if you go here from here by holder, you will gain. But if you go here to here, you will lose some power. This is due to the size of the domain or the volume of the domain. It's rather natural. If we use this Gaglian-Nuremberg, you will see by direct calculation here, you will arrive. Here, you will arrive at the delta to the minus power. Don't forget that this E, this energy is actually large of some size minus two kappa. You cannot close it. We don't want to see this one. It's minus power. Well, actually, we are able to show such a refined Dagnian-Nuremberg being equality. This is actually this key lemma. Key lemma. You can, this is some trade-off, as I mentioned probably earlier, between the regularity of between the higher order estimate and the loss of thickness related to the thin domain. Because as we know, the lower or the less derivative you take on the function, the better estimate you can get. The smaller the solution is. You take one derivative. Smaller the solution is. You take one derivative, you lose delta to the power minus one. So we want to take as less as derivative, or we take as less as portion to this delta nabla f norm. We want to this as small as possible again here. This is the largest one, but we are actually here. We will able to put nothing in front. This is the largest portion, but before there is no delta negative norm. No delta negative norm, but here the Delta negative norm, but here the power is not so large. Here it's smallest, but you have a largest minus norm. Well, this is just enough for us. We are able to show by using this, this kind of good energy estimates where all the powers here are positive. Well, the next step is to show the estimate of density. The basic idea is to use again. Basic idea is to use again the viscosity effective viscosity flux, where you have this term appearing as the damping term. Okay, how to show such a refined Gavian neural inequality? We employ the full analysis on this periodic stand domains. We actually will employ the Littlewood Pali decomposition of this stand domains, which allows us to do certain quite delicate. But delicate estimates, at the last, where everything depends on this Bernstein type inequality, where we can play between the regularity, all the regularity you want and the thickness loss you want, like this, like this. Here, you lose too much concerning the thickness, but Concerning the thickness, but you do not lose much from the regularity. This is 1D, you have 1G, 2D, you have 2G, 3D, you have 3G, but in 3G, we do not lose anything from this delta thickness. So I think I already passed the time.
