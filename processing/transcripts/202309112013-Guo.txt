Pleasure and pressure to sleep after Mo, who just gave a super exciting talk. So what I'd like to do today is to discuss two of our recent works in terms of cell matrix interaction. One on single cell scale, the other more on the flattened scale. So my group works on the interface of mechanics and biology. We do a lot of experimental technologies to probe the mechanics of cells. The mechanics of cells ECM. For example, as you can see, you know, in this human breast tissue sample, the purple ones are individual cells, and there's enormous space filled by the pink here is the actual cellular matrix. And the beautiful organization here is really done through the interaction between different cells and between the cells and the ACM. And if anything is wrong, here is only one centimeter. Here is only one centimeter away from the nice looking location in the same breast. This is a triple negative breast cancer. And now you can see the structure is entirely messed up. And the question we're interested in is to build tools to probe how cells behave in such a complex environment. And not only individual cells, but also the ECM and the multi-cell systems. As I mentioned for today's talk, the first part I want The first part, I want to share some very recent results regarding the cell-ECM interaction, mainly about a single cell when they're embedded in a three-dimensional matrix, how they interact with the matrix. We find some pretty cute scaling laws that appear to be very different from the belt, which I hope to have more interaction with our view. And the other part is collect the sub-migration on a curved surface. Curved surface. Again, regarding how cell collectively sense and respond to the creature of a three-dimensional surface. So the first part here is shown in blue is a human breast cancer cell that we stand fluorescently. And they're embedded in three-dimensional collagen one matrix, as you can see in green here. So it's pretty well known that when you So it's pretty well known that when you grow cells on substrate, either 2D or 3D, they can sense and respond to the substrate's stiffness. But the question we're interested in is do they actually do the inverse? So do they change their surrounding? And a more interesting question is, if they do change their surrounding, do they sense and respond to the changes that they make? Which we have no idea, that's why I didn't put it there. But hopefully, I'll talk a little more about this part. Little more of this part. So, to measure how the cells mechanically alter in the change of the strong matrix, the tool we use is up to Twitter's, as Ray gave a beautiful talk this morning. So our tool is basically, again, using a focus laser beam to grab a particle or now with NASA and then apply optical force to drag it within whatever. Within whatever we're measuring. So, here in this video, that you can see one particle is being trapped and wrapped into it, right? And by doing that, you can measure the force displacement curve, which allows to measure and quantify the kind of environment. So with the Twitter, we mainly have been focusing on cells and cytoplasm. Two work to highlight here is one regarding intermediate filament we find that's critically important for the strength and the toughness of a living cell. And the toughness of a living cell. And the other work we show the cell membrane stiffness is also playing a very important role in new recognition. It gives cells an easier time to grab them, to interact with the cells that you potentially can use to design new immunotherapy. And more recent years, we have been very interested in multicellular systems. So when you have many, many cells, how they collectively emerge into something with a structuring function. With the structuring function. We have been measuring cell mechanics in a cell coordination in breasted tumor images and also different types of organoid as well. So for today, I will just focus on the ECM. The measurement we have done here is very simple. Just, you know, we have particles of this rise, which is so I have particles embedded in the sample. Particles embedded in the sample, and then I start to grab them. And the data I show here is measured along the cell contraction vertically. And as you can see in the red symbol here, when I measure far away from the cell, it's pretty floppy. But when I start to move closer and closer to the cell, I find a huge increase in the measured mechanic rigidity. So the natural clearly becomes stiffer as I move closer to the cell. And this is actually a result. And this is actually a result of the nonlinear stiffness because as I relax the cell by using cytoplasm D or blobstatin, you can see the increased stiffness basically drop to pretty minimal. So there's a huge gap that is purely induced by cell contraction. And of course, you know, from the beautiful work that Paul and Fred published a network of years ago, you can see when you shear or stretch Shear or stretch, most of the biopolymers, as you deform them, they become stiffer and stiffer due to non-linear stiffening. And what we believe is happening here is really as a cell embedded in this three-dimensional matrix, they contract pretty strongly, and it's strong enough to trigger this non-linear stiffening. And the stresses are really large near the contraction site, which decay over distance, and therefore you see the stiffening effect is weaker. Stiffening effect is weaker and weaker. So, although we understand this behavior, yes. Are the cells, are you in studies here? Like, is the cell already contracted, or is the stiffening, is the increased stiffening cell because it's actually contracted? Yes, that's a good point. So, we basically make the sample wait, I think, 12 to 24 hours. So, the cell is already contracting, and then we do our measurement. And is it still contracting during the measurement? It's still contracting during the measurement. Well, I think this is a great question and very related to what I will talk about in the next couple of slides. So I'll show you. So although we explained this effect based on the beautiful results from the belt, but the question is, the cells are actually embedded in a 3D matrix in local. When they grab their surrounding matrix, When they grab their surrounding matrix, they actually apply a very localized force, right? So, how do they really feel the surrounding matrix? They certainly don't feel the balance, but what exactly do they feel? It's the question that we're asking here. And the first part of the work is done by a great student, Hai Chen Yang, here in my group. So, if we take a look at some of the results from the BELC, for example, BELC biology that you shear a material homogeneously. Material homogeneously, and this is a work from Fred's lab that for collagen, which is known to exponentially stiffen, that the stress, the differential modulus or spring constant, should be linearly proportional to the force that you apply. And that can be expected if you use a phone type of elastic model to do the simulation as well. And the question really comes as when I apply a local force. As when I apply a local force, do I have the same behavior? If not, what behavior should I see? And the experiment is very simple, which is again take the optical trap, trap a particle that starts to pull on them, and simply just record the force displacement relation. And then let's take a look. So here is the result. So, first of all, I should say, you know, this is the log plot of the force over displacement, and this is the linear force proportion. And this is the linear force proportional to displacement that we should expect if the material is linear. Surprisingly, at the very small force, I rarely see a huge deviation from the linear expectation. The force that we measure is proportional to the square of the displacement. Yes? How is the beam coupled to the network? So they're not coupled. They simply are embedded in. So they have a slightly larger size compared to the match. So they're basically a physical. Compared to the match, so they basically are physically trapped. So there's no other coupling metal. Like treat them, so they don't mistake? They are not treated, but these are, I think, carboxylated bees. So when we mix them with cells, so with BSA attached, but for the collagen case, they should be steroid they have charged on the surface. They have charged on the surface, so they shouldn't directly attach on collagen. But, no, we don't check carefully. So, yeah, all we see is if I have particles in their collagen networks, either with or without cells, they don't seem to change their surrounding collagen networks too much. So there are some images you can see. Question? Alright. So, you know, to confirm, because this small force is Because this small force is really surprising, to confirm this also happens in large force, we also did a nano invitation using a half a millimeter to directly punch into a bulk collagen gel. You can see the force now is in the micronewton scale and the force still scales with the displacement quadratically. So it's always displacement score. And that regulation has a very interesting consequence. interesting consequence is if you have force proportional to u square, you do dF du, you will have the spring constant as linear with the displacement, which would be proportional to the square root of the force. So that's very different with what you would expect from the balcreology, which is K is directly linear with force. So here we always see a square root of the force. The mesh size, what's the mesh size of this network? So I think this is the four megs per mil. It's like the one micron or something. So on the left side, the displacements are much, much less than a mesh. Yeah. And on the right side, they're much bigger than the mesh. Exactly. And that doesn't seem to matter. Exactly, exactly. That's what I feel really confusing. If you look at the displacement and their timing, so I don't think they're really deforming the entire match. What happens is not exactly Not exactly clear to us. But what we always see is they seem to trigger the nonlinear stiffening no matter how the size scale compares. And so if you just kind of blindly computed some kind of modulus for the force displacement, would that number be the same in both of these experiments? Yeah, Chase group did some network simulation, and that's not exactly consistent, but not too far as well. We have been Well, we have been really curious about why it has such a small force and they have non-linear transition. But it appears that Martin and Len's group has a paper that apparently you can use a pretty small force to pluck a fiber that induces a non-linear transmission at a very small force, which could potentially explain this. But that's all I wanted to discuss here. It's not exactly clear that it's done. Here. It's not exactly clear that it's that far off macroscopic expectation, depending on the connectivity of the network, because the stiffening for a collagen system can set in at 10%. And naively, this is 5-10%, right? Yeah. So, I mean, it's a little weird, but it's not crazy. But it's less than one. Cool. Do you compute how I can affect? Can you compute the molecular effective strain from these measurements? Well, I th it it's it's you can. I mean, if you do a continuous model, you you can definitely obtain local strain. But again, at network scale, it's not. But it's not where you expect these sizes to be stiffening. Or would you? Well, what I'm saying is, if if you just naively think that if you want to replace the mesh size with the region that's defling and you're just and you're displacing And you're displacing 5% of that much office. So you can ask me at the time. Is that really inconsistent with a strain for a college network of 10%, shear strain? Now, the problem, be careful applying that picture down at one bash. That's right. Right, exactly. I mean, that's one of the points I want to share this work because I think how to compare. I think how to compare the mesh scale mechanics and the continuous scale is quite interesting to hear. But strains don't have to be of order one to be nonlinear. Yeah. So, how much time? Yeah. So if you have a bundle of collagen sort of push sideways against that with your B, wouldn't you also expect a very non-linear response? Maybe that collagen is under attention even more so. It could be, but it's not always under attention, right? Under tension, right? If you measure different particles, they shouldn't all behave the same. But this is low data of many, many measurements. Pretty consistent, I think. I mean, so you said they're not coupled, they're not attached to the fibers, but with these really small displacements, I mean, do you see? I would just think that they somehow, but maybe they are actually attaching to the fibers. But they're attracted, right? So maybe they're physically attached with a short distance. So when they move. So when they move, they push. Yeah, but we can't really directly imaging the collagen to see what happens behind the beat, though. Anyway, let me continue. I think you will find the second part more exciting. Anyway, so you know, some simple scale rescaling that we normalize the spring constant by the linear spring constant, the force by the critical transition force, we always see this. We always see this, you know, pass for root skating, no matter what concentration we use. We even try to fiber in, you know, in the different materials, we always see this skating. And that appears to be geometric. And here's a why. So here, you know, obviously I'm not a theorist. I'm trying to provide a simplified, perhaps oversimplified feature through dimensional analysis. So here's the stress-strain relationship, and I'm simplifying it into I'm simplifying it into a elastic rigid condition. So it's linear at the beginning, and whenever it passes through a stress threshold, sigma star, it becomes infinitely stiff. And then it doesn't deform. And when I drag a particle at a local region, then essentially what I'm doing is I stiffen my sensitive. Then there's a stiffened region near me. And outside of that region, everything. And outside of that region, everything is still here. So, this now becomes my effective approach. When I deform a local region, I stiffen my surroundings, that they're stiffening off and become part of me. And I drag them with me to deform the far field of the linear region now. So, that picture is going to be pretty distorted. Exactly. That's why I said it's an oversimplified dimensional density. It's always implicated at the point of probably being wrong. Yeah, well, I don't think so. So we have some simulations that you can see. No, let me continue. No, no, no, no. It's total compression. If you push something, compress it. Only in the back it's going to be under tension. Well, there are tension here as well, right? No, no, no, no. You're pushing it in the X direction, right? Right. So you're going to compress that. So you're going to have a sphere. Right, right. That part will soften, right? But you, you. Tension in the back, you put tension in the back, right? No, no, but if you do a network simulation, you're going to see tension along this direction as well, right? You definitely have buckle fibers here that we can see. But you have tension on that direction as well. But anyway, so all I'm providing here is some dimensional scaling that you can take a look for now. Okay, and let's talk more. All right, so if I consider the force balance, the force applying on the particle. The force applying on the particle can be balanced on the integration of the stresses on an interface over arbitrary closed surface, including my particle. And this is a stress tensor, this is surface normal, this is the direction vector along my force direction. And I can, of course, choose this closed surface as this one where I have a critical stress on the surface and the size of R star. Again, it's super, you know, super. You know, simplifier just to see the scaling. Nothing I'm providing is beyond a scaling analysis. So you can see that it should scale as a sigma star times r star squared, right? The surface of this area times the particle stress. And if you apply the generalized stokes simulation, you're going to see the spring constant of this effective particle scales with the shear modulus of the surrounding times R star, which is the. R star, which is the effective particle size. If you combine the two equations, what do we find is k is proportional to the square root of f. Again, super arbitrary that I agree that we're only performing the dimensional analysis, but that seems to give a hint to why we see this behavior. And we should definitely talk more about this in the next couple of days. What we did here is: all right, what if I perform a All right, what if I perform a very simple, you know, finite element simulation to actually see what's going on here? And we chose to use the phone-type model, which is incompressible. It's again very simple. But as I measure the displacement along the particle dragging direction, you can see the displacement basically decrease as I move away from the particle. And if I arbitrarily estimate the critical The critical less scale R star at the half decay of the purple displacement, I find the R star here. And you can clearly see as my force increases, R star value also increases. So as you start to deform more and more, the effective particle size will add the force. And you can compare scaling that you can see it always gives you a square root of the force. And as The force. And as you directly compare the k, the spring constant, and compared as a function of the force, you also see the square root relation. Actually, not only based on the full model, if you change a different constant to the relation, as long as the material is stiffened very quickly, you always see this behavior. And the simplified picture we have is really because as you deform, you stiffen your nearby and you take the stiffened region with you and together. Region with you, and together as an effective probe to form the far field, the linear region. And that actually can also give you the belt behavior. As you pull a particle in the simulation box, when you pull harder and harder, you start to deform the belt. And when you do that, you see the spring constant now is entirely linear with the force. And that's because now you're mimicking the belt geology because the deformation is so large that you're deforming the. Is so large that you're deforming the entire material box, which is the bulk. So, then GPS should with the size of the probe? With the size of the probe? What do you mean? Because you have to pay you increase the size of the probe. So then how that unscale you size of the core? Um it it doesn't necessarily scale with the original size anymore because right now you have uh effective problem, right? And all we do is we know the original size, which is a constant. The effective size is a function of the force. As the force increases, the effective size increases as well. So that's where that does not depend on the initial size of the problem. It doesn't depend on it. Because it's only a constant. Because it's only a constant. It doesn't change the scaling. It may change the pre-factor, but it doesn't necessarily change the scaling. All right, so I just want to quickly conclude what I have said. And the question we're very interested in is how that inform us regarding how cells interact with the matrix. As Paul also mentioned, the actual cell matrix is extremely heterogeneous, but when you have something like an effective probe, can they Like an effective probe, can they essentially smear out the difference and make it more homogeneous when they interact with the surrounding? It's an interesting question I think we should think about. And very briefly on that, we definitely see the effective characteristic lens-scale R star in experiment. For example, when we measure the stiffness as a function of distance from the cell, we see a Distance from the cell, we see a decrease at the beginning and then plateau after we are away from the cell after a certain distance. And this transition here represents our star perhaps. And you can also see that through the traction force microscopy, if I simply just plot the 50% reduction of the displacement contour, if a linear material, you should expect that the contour doesn't change when you reduce the contraction. When you reduce the contraction because the material is in your superposition, it should apply here. But clearly, we see as the cell relax, the 50% of displacement control also reduce. So, very strongly suggested this is a very strong non-linear deformation region that cells are interacting with their matrix. So, that's the first part of my talk. How much time I have? Okay, including or not including questions. All right. All right, thank you. So, welcome questions during the second part as well. So, for the second part, I really like to talk about collective migration, which we're really fascinated in recent years. So, here's one example that we make as a breast cancer model in my lab. Each fluorescent block is an individual cell that you can see they're migrating, they're actually. Are migrating and they're actually matrix surrounding them. If you want, you can see how the cells interact with the matrix. And these are two embryo development examples. You can see the cell migration are really quick and large scale, as Mike showed in the morning. And clearly, collective cell migration are important. But most of the current collective cell migration study are on flat surface, so grow cells on flat space, either plastic or glass. Plastic or glass, but we all know in nature, in our body, our organs are all curved. So the surfaces are all curved. And the question is very simple: how does the curvature affect the collective cell margin? And so all the work I'm going to talk about is by another great student at Wen Hui, who's about to graduate in half a year or so, who's looking for a postdoc. So if you have that position, Yeah, that position, I'm sure she'll be really happy to talk about. So, experiment we are doing here is to fabricate a PDMS well for the opposite surface with both positive or negative curvatures, isotropic. And then we grow a layer of MVCK cells on the surface. The cells also have fluorescent nuclei to allow us to track them, measure. Track them, measure their trajectory, and then calculate the different behaviors. And we fabricated the wells to have a couple of different curvatures from within the range of a couple hundred microns. And here is a video showing the cells migrating, and here are the trajectories of the cells that you can see how they move. So, first of all, I should say, if I simply just track individual cells and measure Just track individual cells and measure their individual cell speed. They don't seem to matter too much, no matter what curvature I put them on. But if I start to calculate the velocity cross-correlation, now I see some great differences. So for example, here, by the way, all the traction are done in 3D, and the calculations are also done along the spherical surface. So this is a correlation function. So, this is a correlation function on the flat surface. And if I do the same calculation on the curved surface, you can clearly see their minimum almost negative correlation. And then it recovers to a larger value and fluctuated a couple times. Yes. Is the flat surface in this case just the surrounding part around or through the little claw or something? It's all in the same sound. Yeah, thank you. And here is a higher curvature that you Is a higher curvature that you can see the minimum value is being pushed to the left with shorter distance. And if I keep going up to an even higher curvature, then the minimum value is even shorter. So if I take the minimum value here as a correlation length, roughly defined, and you can see that the correlation length basically decreased, that the curvature increased. One interesting thing is it doesn't matter if it's a positive or a negative curvature. An active curvature. As long as the magnitude of the curvature increases, the correlation length decreases. And if you extrapolate the trend to one cell length, roughly I'll say when the curvature radius is about 100 microns, they stop talking to each other. The correlation is only on single cells now. Yes? Just to clarify which curvature is this? This is this one. So this is spherical surface, right? So, this is a spherical surface, right? This is just the isotopic curvature. Why does it change sign? Because I have two types of surface. I have concave and convex. Oh, okay, so it's always positive Gaussian curvature, but exactly, exactly, exactly. I don't think it's Gaussian curvature, by the way, sounds like it. Why does it matter? But the cells are always on the spherical surface. Why does it matter? Variable service. Because it matters if it's like this or like this. It doesn't, right? That's all we're saying here. So it doesn't seem to matter which sign the creature. Oh, it's okay. Okay. Okay, great. Alright, so one more analysis we can do is if we take the velocity field and we can dissect the velocity field into divergence, curl, and shear to describe different. And the shear to describe different types of submotion within this collective migration. And if we analyze each of them, we can see the same trend. Basically, on a flat surface, there's some large-scale pattern in the divergence here. As the curvature increase, the divergence value become higher and higher, and the pattern becomes smaller and smaller. So, all of those suggest as the curvature increase, the motion becomes more stochastic. You're a lot more. There are a lot more cell migration going on with a shorter correlation lens that you pattern also seems to decrease your size. So there's some detailed analysis that you can see, but the conclusion really is the multicellular flow become more dynamic and the flow pattern seems to be smaller when you build them on a smaller geometry with a higher curvature. Again, it doesn't seem to matter if positive or negative curvature occurs. So, to show that this is physiologically relevant, and also going back to Davis' question, that the sample we have now is still half-sphere, so there's some add effect. To avoid that, right now we're collaborating with Derek Cohen's lab from Boston Medical Center. We take human IPS cells and develop them into the lung structure. And this is mini-ator SLON. It's a lung ablosphere. It's basically a single. Is basically a single layer of cells only on the surface, and the luminous field would be quite almost perfectly spherical that you can see. Again, all the cell nuclei are labeled with fluorescent text here that you can see how they migrate as they grow. And obviously, the curvature change as they grow, and we can do the same analysis of the flow field to see what's going on as the curvature change. And consistently, we find that. Consistently, we find that the curvature increase, the flow pattern in terms of divergence curl shear all become much stronger with the smaller pattern. Thank you. And again, with this measurement, we are pretty confident that the multi-cellular flow field is highly dependent on curvature. When the curvature is high, the motion is quite chaotic, very dynamic. Very dynamic, and it needs much less correlation than cells to talk to their very recent neighbors on the other side. But the divergence, is it mean always here? Is it like compressible and well if you only look at the 2D, I think they are, but it's unclear if they're actually changing the 3D height. That's something we're looking at now, so great question, by the way. So, a little more for why this happened. For why you know this happens within the remaining five minutes. This is a collaboration with MaxBeese group. So, if you look at 2D cell monolayer, cells, most of them show a polygon geometry. They have micro edges, and many of them actually behave as a hexagon. So, from Maximulation, he has an argument that hexagon is a way to reduce free energy. I suggest you talk to him. You need to talk to him. You know, he's not here. But, you know, the interesting thing we find is if we take all the hexanel cells, they seem to form clusters on this surface. And this is his simulation that you see with some more obviously. And why we have pattern change is exactly because the clusters are more like a visualization business. So, this is inspired by the beautiful work from David Nous, the VDM on Harvard. From David Nelson and the VDA Monharnis group, when they look at cloidal crystallization of a curved surface, we think that cells are similar here. The hexagonal cells also connect to each other to form a more stable pack. But the pack can't grow because if you grow larger on a curved surface, you have bending energy to burn. So when the bending energy is too high, it can't grow anymore. So from the free energy calculation here, Energy calculation here, you can basically compute the critical pack size, which you will find will be linear with the curvature radius of the spherical geometry. And when we test it in our experiment by looking at the hexagonal hex size, we find that they're indeed linear with the medius. So that seems to be consistent, but I should say this is still our working hypothesis since we have never directly measured if the pack has some. If the pack has some bending rigidity. So, if you have some idea or suggestions, I would love to talk more in the next couple of days. So, I will stop here, but just let you know, we're currently looking at the packing behavior of this human atmosphere, how soft the deformable cells, so tile a spherical surface. We're looking at hexagons, we're looking at the defects. There's an enormous amount of defects. As a model defects, so you know, it's really difficult to compare with some of the other works talked in the morning. So, with that, I would just acknowledge my group and fundings and whatever time I have, happy to answer questions. Yeah, thank you. Yeah. I think there's a really simple way of getting that stress to the one-half, force to the one-half, but that's for a generic non-linear system. We should just talk about it in the board after. But it's basically if the stiffness, let's see, if you go from naively from something which is floppy to rigid at a finite strain and treat the increase. And treat the increase at that finance strain as linear in the difference. One half falls up. One half stress falls up. That's interesting. That's interesting. The more it's a weak linear regime. So it doesn't perfectly describe a crossover, but it'll get that scaling version. Right, right, right, right. I mean, that's all we see as well, right? The crossover is not great. But I think it's brilliant. But I think it's very general. Yeah, discussing with Pure and Chase, they argue even you consider the buckling, you can get that scale and have more. But the reason I want to show that data is I think at microscale, when a cell grab a local matrix, it seems to be quite different from the velcro. So how do we take this into consideration when we consider cell matrix batch and how cells sense a greater region, how cells talk about? Region and how cells talk to each other. They're a lot more interesting topics. Ali, I think this joint. So maybe I missed it, but you have two types of curved surfaces, the BDMS dome and the organoid type of thing. So are the cell shapes on the dome similar that you get like the extra hexagon packing basically compared with that 3D? Go with that three D uh and then also or maybe I missed it too. Why was there this uh greater vorticity and motion for this it was a smaller coverage or surfaces right compared to the higher or yeah the larger domes? Yeah, great question. So the first question, not exactly because they're very different cells. But if you look at the ratio of hex notes, ratio of defax or so, it's pretty similar. It's pretty similar, not too different. So, to some extent, I almost want to think about cell tiding on the surface as self-distribution points. But of course, they're active, so you know, what we can think about is that. The second question is when you have the large packs, they are more stable. If you look at the relative MSD of cells within each pack, they're pretty mild. Pack, they're pretty mild. That means you can use all types of flow field. When you don't have a lot of paths, then everything is more chaotic, then all the flow fields come out. Yeah, I think it may be interesting to look at the negative Gaussian curvature surfaces. So here, all of the cases are having positive Gaussian curvature, and at a short time, the cells follow geophysics, and then they will converge and collide. With negative Gaussian cells, Collide. When it's negative Gaussian curvature, they diverge and then have longer persistence. Yeah. That's an excellent point. We're thinking to maybe 3D print a set of shape or something. But one reason made us think it may not be Gaussian curvature is we grow ourselves on a tube which has zero Gaussian curvature, but the packs still form along the tube direction, not so much on this direction. That's why we think. Much on this direction. That's why we think maybe the principal curvature is more important that they cause the bending energy. But I think still it's a great structure. I thought people showed that cells circulate circumferentially around cylinders. I do not detract motion, but I'm only looking at the hectone packs. So that's pretty clear, that is, along this direction. I'm not so sure that they circulated. There some work from Some work from CT Limbs group that they grow cells flowing into a tube of different diameter. I think smaller tubes they flow faster or something. On the surface? I see. I'm sure it's probably a cell type, and it's an observer. It's an experiment. Yeah, at least that seems to be the. They were even talking about Isaac Newton and last week. Something like this came up in the meetings. Okay. All right. All right. Thank you. So I'll just remind people
