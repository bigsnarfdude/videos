But it's a pleasure to have Mishi Ray from the University of Calgary, where she'll talk about Bogan's conjecture for P-adic GLA. Thanks for the introduction, Eric, and thank you so much for having me here. Such an honor to talk. So, my area is in the languages program, and this is a number theory audience. So, I thought we would have Audience, so I thought we would have an extended introduction to just set things up. So, here we go. So, people in the Landlands program study these objects. So, on the global side, there are automorphic forms, which I'll talk about in a bit. And on the local side, we have representations of algebraic groups. So, these automorphic forms are somehow Are somehow like vast generalizations of modular forms that people are assuming. So it can have a number field. Automorphic forms are certain functions on this coset space where a k is the ring of redels associated with the field k and g of k embeds diagonally inside g of a k and these functions satisfy some growth properties and some finiteness properties which we won't Of finiteness properties, which we won't get into. But if you want to recover the classical theory of modular forms, where we have functions of the upper half plane mod SO2C, you can set K is Q and G to be PGL2. So these are the global objects and they are studied by our representation theory. So from automorphic forms we get automorphic representations. Presentations. So, most of this talk is going to be over GLN, so I'll try to state everything as simply as possible. So, if you have G equals GLN, then this calligraphic A will denote the space of automorphic forms over G, and this space carries an action of the group G over adults. So, an automorphic representation is a particular irreducible. Particular irreducible subcodient of this fake space of representations. And in general, you're going to have an automorphic representation breaks up into or factorizes into these local components. And this is like the local global picture in the Landmass program, where we have pi as our automorphic representation and pi v is our representation. Pi Vs are representations of G of K Vs, meaning each pi V is a representation of a group over a local field. Now, representation here is like to break down a module into its constituents. And I guess it's really hard to do that for the entire space of automorphic forms. So we restrict our attention to square integrable automorphic forms, which consist of n. Which consist of things that are square integrable. So this space decomposes into its constituents like this, and each pi is called a square integrable automorphic representation. So once again, it is an automorphic representation. So let's see the factorization one more time. So the square table automorphic representation also breaks down into Into local representations. And essentially, these are the representations we care about for the stock. So the big pie corresponds to what we call a global arthr packet. It's a set of squared integral representations that corresponds to this psi right here. Again, I'll explain that in a bit. And pi these Are representations of the groups over the local fields, and they correspond to these sets of representations parametrized by local orthoparameters. And for today, these high Vs, so once we fix a V, are our main objects of studies. So they come from They come from or they are in local alpha packets, and we will look at these local alpha packets from a geometric perspective. And when I say local, I mean non-article. So that's the thing we'll be looking at. So let's go ahead. So I mentioned parameters, alpha parameters, but in order to talk about alpha parameters, I need to talk about a different kind of parameters. So that's the language parameter. So that's the line loss parameter. So setting up some notation. So now I have f a non-Archimedean local field of characteristic zero, and g is gln. We have the weight group, which is a dense subgroup of the absolute Galva group. And this capital Pi is the set of representation, of smooth irreducible representation of G L and F, but it's really the equivalent classes of smooth irreducible representation of GLN. Using representation of them. And this capital phi is a bunch of parameters that help us parametrize the representations in the big phi. So these are equivalence classes of what we call landmass parameters. And these landlands parameters are certain maps from the big group class SL2C to GLNC. So as I said, So, as I said, this file parametrizes the representations up above. So, that is our local Language correspondence. So, again, I should have equivalent classes on both sides, but it's all right. So, for GLN, the local language correspondence gives it bijection between the two sets I showed you. So, on the one side, we have smoothly reducible representations of GLMF, and on the other side, GLMF. And on the other side, I have these Lambda's parameters. So since this is a bijection, if I take the Lambda's parameter and try to recover all the representations that gave this Lamin's parameter, I will just get one. So this one representation sits inside what we call an L packet. And in general, L packets are fibers of snap. Oops. Press too hard. Okay, so these L packets give us a partition. Packets give us a partition of all the representations. And again, because of this bijection, they are singletons for GLS. So we have another kind of parameter now called the artha parameter, which also each artha parameter also parametrizes a set of representations. So this is also a map from Baylor plus SA2C. From the U plus SL2C times yet another SL2C this time, and it defines a finite set of smooth irreducible representations. And in fact, given an author parameter, we can get a line lens parameter if we just substitute this matrix for the last argument. So these are our author parameters that we're interested in. And for GLN, it so happens that if I write down the arthr packet, The partial packet, as I introduced before, and I write down the corresponding line length parameters by using this formula. The L and the A packets are the L packet and the alpha packet, they coincide. However, these alpha packets do not give us all representations of GLN and like the L packets. Okay, so this is a little unmotivated, but very we so we have a different kind of So, we have a different kind of finite set of smooth irreducible representations, which we call an ABB packet. And now, this is parametrized by our old landlands parameters, but it comes from the geometry of certain varieties that we've been talking about. So, again, if I have a Lanyard's parameter, I can write down an ABV packet, but from a geometric perspective, each ABV packet will contain a distinct. Each ABV packet will contain a distinguished packet, as a result of which ABV packets do cover the entire set of representations, but they may not be destroyed in general. So I said we want to look at Arthur packets in this project, but we want to interpret them as ABB packets. So this is a geometric perspective on the local Language correspondence, where other packets are interpreted. Where other packets are interpreted as ADB packets, and that gives us the conjecture, which is the main conjecture for this talk. So the conjecture is that if I have an author parameter, and if I write down the racket for that, and then I take the landless parameter and write down the ABV bracket for that, they conform. So, I wanted to tell you a little bit of historical background for this. So, initially, Background for this. So, initially, when Arthur came up with his global theory, he defined the notion of global orthobackets, but the local meaning was unclear at that time. So, Adams, Barbash and Mogan, ABD, came along and they gave a geometric perspective and proposed that maybe these are the local analogs. And that geometric perspective gave us the notion of a view. Us the notion of increasing packets, which is adapted differently in this project, but that's where they come from. And then more recently, Arthur came along and made the local meaning clear of what his packets are. So it opens up this question that whether the ABV packets that were proposed, I guess, in the 90s truly coincide with the local ARTA packets as Arta more recently explained in 2015. So this kind of gave So, this kind of gave rise to this conjecture attributed to Hogan. So, yeah, this is the main goal for the talk to discuss a proof for this conjecture. So, you know, proof this conjecture, but on the way, we talk about, we get the setup, we talk about what ABP packets are, you discuss a particular variety of people with violence parameters, and you see comments on. Parameters and you see comments on the proof, and how far we go into the comments will be dictated by time. So let me just right here. Okay. So ABB patterns. So I'm going to go over this quite quickly. So we have an arter parameter, which gives rise to a laminance parameter. And that in turn gives rise to an infinitesimal parameter if we plug in the same matrix for the second component of the laminar. The second component of the line length parameter, and many different line-length parameters can have the same infinitesimal piece. So we fix that, and once we fix that, we define a variety. So b lambda, by this relation where the conjugation action of the image of lambda on n cross n matrices should give you the matrix back but scaled to an absolute value. And this variety has And this variety has an action of a group, and the group is simply the centralizer of the integer group. So, this provides the main geometric basis for us. So, and V lambda is nothing too complicated. It's a finite-dimensional vector space, an affine variety, and it has finitely many orbitals. So, before I describe the geometric local line length. Geometric local language correspondence. I need to talk about Berber shapes, but we are not going to be discussing that very seriously. But the idea is that this variety with this group action gives us this category of perverse sheaves. And a perverse sheaf is essentially an object in the boundary category of constructible sheaves. So it's a chain. At each place, you have a constructible sheaf. There's an action, bubble that. Does an action, blah blah blah, there's some nice cosmological conditions. For us, happily, we only care about simple perverse sheaves, and these simple purver sheets are in bijection with the orbits. So, if you don't want to think about the simple perverse sheets, you can just think about orbits in a variety and so gonna give another form of a correspondence now, but with these orbits coming into the picture. So, we're gonna fix an infinite. So, we're going to fix an infinitesimal parameter. And if we do that, then we can talk about a correspondence with representations coming from the fixed parameter, with Lambda's parameters coming from the fixed infinitesimal parameter, and each Lambda's parameter corresponds to, each equivalence class of a Lambda's parameter corresponds to an orbit inside the moving variety. So, instead of thinking of parameters, now we're thinking about orbits inside a variety. And the way it is. And the way it is done is by interpreting the simple curve rich attached to that orbit. So we get a map from pi to p of pi. Okay, so among all of these orbits is the, we fix an output parameter initially to get the infinitesimal parameter. So we find that output parameter in these buckets. So that we specify that separately. So one of these buckets comes from the parameter we started. It comes from the parameter we started with, and it corresponds to the representation via the local line lens correspondence, and that representation makes up this single-dependent value for GLA. So let me give you an example real quick. It's a very simple example. If we take a simplest possible, well it's not the simplest possible, but more meaningful R3 parameter, then our variety just turns out to be the complex line. The complex line, and the orbits are the action is just scaling the complex number by another non-zero complex number as a result of which there are two orbits, the zero and the functor line. And these two orbits correspond to two different representations. And this one is the one coming from the party parameter. And don't worry about the left side, it's just a way of writing down the two representations that come. Okay, so now we can define. Okay, so now we can define an ABV packet quite vaguely. So, this category of further shoes has a funker attached to it, which is the EPS functor. And it takes, I guess the codomain is representation of a particular component group, which in our case is trivial. So, this is just a category of vector spaces. And this functor helps us define an ABB packet, which takes Which takes, so if you fix an author parameter, we can write down a lambda and go without that. And we take a representation and let the functor act on it. And if we get something non-zero, then that representation is inside the EP. So that's the definition. And now we can talk about comments on the proof in four minutes. So go by quick. So the proof is divided up into So, go back quick. So, the proof is divided up into three stages, increasing the generality of the alpha parameter. So, we start with the simplest alpha parameter, which is simply an irreducible representation of the two copies of SL2C. It does not see the way action. And let me just give the comments right here on this slide. And we first proved the Bogan symbiote for this simple parameter. And the key things. Parameter. And the key things that go into this is multi-segment combinatrix. So I learned multi-segment combinatrix and the analog and the geometric perspective from Andrew Fury's notes. So I'd like to thank him for his contribution to this piece. And then we generalize further. So now we see an action of the weight group. And it would be really nice if I can just delete this group and pretend that the parameter. This group and pretend that the parameters are simple. That's like the first wish, and the wish came true because of this process of unramification, which allows us to do exactly that. So, if I delete this thing coming from the weight loop with possible ramification, then what happens is that the variety in the group actions remain unchanged. So, because of this, we can generalize our proof from the simple case to the irreducible case. Now we get to the more interesting bit. So, if I have a finite direct sum of irreducible parameters, which is the most general form of a number parameter, then what do I do? Well, first of all, because of this decomposition, it picks out a Levy subgroup, meaning block triangle matrices inside G and L. And the idea is that we have this conjecture established for products of G and L. Established for products of GLNs, that each product, each factor comes from an introducible parameter. So it's easy to extend that to a product of groups, in which each factor having an introducible parameter. So we have this conjecture, which holds for the Levy group. And now the idea is to lift this argument from the Levy to the fake group. So on the gemetric side, if you write down the variety for this size, Down the variety for this factor for this for the Luni subgroup, it sits inside the big variety, so it helps us restrict orbits and restrict over sheaves. And on the spectral side, we have a Luni subgroup sitting inside a big GLN. And there are two things you can think of. So we have this parabolic induction at hand that helps us produce representations of a bigger group from a smaller group in a specific case. And on the other hand, this Phase. And on the other hand, this Levy subgroup is also what we call an endoscopic group. So there are these functoriality things you can exploit and lift distribution characters associated to representations of a levy and representations of a group. And it turns out that the first naive sense of induction works to lift this argument on the spectral side. So with that, I will move my talk to a clue. I talk to us, and I'll skip all of this very happily and be returned in case there are any questions.
