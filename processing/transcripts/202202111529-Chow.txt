Can you still zoom today? Hello. And now it vanished into the update. And now we're good. Nice. Yeah, I probably walked out of the tracking camera too fast or something. Because that's what the center camera is, right? That's the tracking camera. And then that tells the other two cameras what to do. Cameras, what to do. Now, the question is: would it always show what's on the blackboard and in parallel a small window of me, or is it just zooming on me? It's just the person, I think. It tracks the person, but if you're at the board writing, it will zoom to that. Yeah, so now we have to go close this thing. Close what? Oh, yes, pop-up. So you can show it. It looks great from here. I can see on the light stream. The only thing is there's a small office on a control path. I don't want to be a recording up. Yeah, we're up. It's just when you um it's if we do uh if if you gra press record with the uh with zoom, right? Right? I think it looks good. The only thing is, I'm not sure if we have audio through the IT work and still just get user audio and I'm connected to both. Oh, okay. Well, we can stop recording and you could try to see what's recorded. Well, somebody, do we have the web link for the live stream? You should be able to just hear us talking. Yeah. If it's yeah, you could just go to Burt's website and have to live. It works. Apparently, it's working. Let's just do the Auto Auditorium thing, so there's nothing I think we want to configure actually there as long as Council joins the Zoom and Auto Auditorium does its thing locally. What about if I lower now screen and try to? I don't think there's a lot we can fix there because even if it doesn't work, that's something inside Auto Datorium. And we just do whatever Auto Datorium was doing for all your in-person meetings up to now. It doesn't know anything about it. It shouldn't make any difference with that if it was working previously. Everything works as it works before. Okay. The thing is, people complain about this now that everyone's used to Zoom. Because it's so good quality. They don't like to see the projector in the screen. They want to see the projector in their content. But they never, you know, when you capture those videos, no one ever used to complain. Now everyone's used to Zoom to the content. Yeah, because it through Zoom, you have this share screen function, so you're actually seeing the slides directly as opposed to a picture of the slides. Picture of the slides. You won't be able to see that. Is there no way to incorporate one and the other? Well, usually they share the slide on Zoom, but you could share the slide. But then you would have to do two things at the same time. Yeah, and the problem there being is it then is, I guess what you have to do what we have to do every day. Pick which audience is more important. Right. Because you can have it look really good in the room, or you can have it. Good in the room, or you can have it look really good on Zoom. You don't necessarily get both. And that's unfortunately the nature of the beast. Unless you go to your new system that likely involves what they call a it will incorporate all of the Zoom functions into your room as opposed to trying to get the room onto Zoom, which is what you're doing now. Which is what you're doing now. Yes. Right? And those devices are usually done with like a little, you know, a little new computer and a few other odds and ends. Like this device will be more sort of industrial and cover the room. So it will cover the room the way auto auditorium used to, if you will. They may use some bits and pieces from auto auditorium, but the interface between But the interface between the internet and auto-auditorium will likely have to change. And then, like I say, what you're doing is you're bringing Zoom into the room as opposed to the other way around, which is what you're attempting to do right now. Which, and it works pretty good, like, comparatively to what else is out there, but as you say, sharing the screen becomes, no, you're looking at a picture of the screen, right? So it's, yeah, the Zoom thing has changed. Yeah, the the Zoom thing has changed the world, unfortunately. And good, bad, or otherwise, you gotta go with it. But it could just share all their slides. That's kind of weird that they don't do that already. Well, then you would have to match it with the presentation, actually. Yeah, right. But you should have like a schedule, I would just put like all the slides of the people. So you have the schedule, you have the name of the presenter, and if you want to see a slide, you can see a slide, and you have the zoom. Slide, you can see a slide, and you have the zoom, you'll have like this, you know, us. But I would do with a slide one, I guess. I mean, the slide, yeah. You could like this is doing the zoom, correct? Okay. So, yeah, the only but then what's doing the slides, this machine? Or a laptop? Yeah. So, um, yeah, the only thing you Um yeah, the only thing you could potentially do is run a Zoom meeting from the same well, no, because then it's in no, you're better off picking all this, but can do, there is some discussion of this in the wiki you found. The thing is in the presentation ops, whether it's the laptop or the laptop, if it's joined to the Zoom meeting, you can do the share presentation thing, but if it's the map, if it's the laptop, you have to be extremely careful to make sure it doesn't connect. Extremely careful to make sure it doesn't connect to the audio either in or out, or you will get audio problems. As long as that's what I say, the first thing I was saying is like, make sure if you're using your computer, mute it and turn your thing off. And once in a while, something happens. We will still have people don't know how to down and off. And then they have like a little bit of a data. Yeah, and so that's like we've done a hundred thousand Zoom recordings over the last 18 months because that's. The last 18 months, because that's how all of our festival presenters and everybody zoom to us, and then we have a bunch of broadcasts here that allows us to do like a pretty decent recording of it. And so we've got multiple views where we can edit in like the gallery view versus speaker and so on and so forth. And so what we ended up doing was just getting another laptop. Another laptop that was part of the Zoom meeting, and use that, as you say, to share the slides over the Zoom meeting. It's just that it now becomes another person in the meeting, so absolutely, the video, the audio, all needs to be muted. It's another thing to manage, but it is possible. Just since we're only talking about the one week, all I would say is we want to focus on the meeting participants. On the meeting participants that are there next week. The ABRS comes second, like whether or not we get good recordings, that's a secondary issue. Just make sure that we can make sure that Unlike Mini will connect to Zoom and will involve the remote participants either when they're doing their presentations or when they're watching a presentation coming from TCPL. ADRS, in the worst case scenario, I can get into the back end and turn ADRS off if it's causing lots of problems. As long as we can make sure that that penny, that logitis. Make sure.penny,.logitech system, is joined to the Zoom meeting next week. I think we're good. It sounds like you don't really need me then if you guys are doing that already. I think when they have a new install, it could be good to know. Oh, yeah. And that was just it. Like, that was sort of where the conversation started. And then Danny's like, oh, we got something going on next week. We're supposed to have been this week. Exactly. To come this week, exactly. And then they postpone it the week after. Yeah, and so I think that's why Danny asked me to get involved. But it sounds like you guys got it well in hand. Like, I don't know how to get into this machine and connect it, but you guys have that all sorted. So maybe I'll, you know, by all means, give me a call. If something breaks, I might be able to give you a hand, but it sounds as though you got it put together. Okay. And then we'll, whatever. Whatever they decide they might need to use me for during the install, let me know. And I'm happy to help, whatever. It's one of those things where, yeah, they originally wanted me to do it, the whole thing, and I just didn't have the time. So, whatever the, like, I don't know if they want me here to help the installers or if they want to help. The installers, or if you're do you know more about that? Because he was no, I we've only got the what they're wanting to do. I've seen the statement of work by how I've talked a little bit with the vendor, but I haven't got a lot of details. And I've contacted Brent up and down, but I haven't heard back from him yet. Well, if that's the case, like you've got my email, you guys all have my phone number, I'll leave it in your court. I'll leave it in your court. If you decide you want my help, let me know. Otherwise, no harm, no foul. I think you should be involved because they all got to leave. Ian is from Vancouver and the company is from Calgary. The only thing is that we don't, they're hiring process, but that's going to take months. So they're like, oh, have somebody pay for it. And the beauty of me. You know, and the beauty of me is my office is literally like 50 yards that way. So if you need me in a pinch, you can find me. But it's, yeah, like, I'm sort of, I'm good to do whatever you need me to do. I just, nobody's really explained to me what the parameters of the job are because nobody really knows. My understanding of it is they would like someone who sort of understands sort of the general kind of Sort of the general kind of operation of all of the various pieces in case something needs to be fixed or what have you. But again, as I explained to Danny over the phone, the problem with a lot of these automated systems is I can't get out the brains of this from here. And so if something fails, it's in there in a black box. It's in there in a black box that's not talking to some other black box. It's not something you can instantly troubleshoot without knowing how the system was programmed. And I really, quite honestly, the vendor's not going to tell me that. Likely not. I mean, it could be somebody I know because I've been doing this for like 30 years and I know a lot of those guys. But, you know, it's one of those things where the automated systems are fantastic. The automated systems are fantastic because you can do everything with one button, but because so much of it goes on in the background, it's extraordinarily difficult to troubleshoot when one thing doesn't work. Right? And that's where it gets a bit dodgy. Like, I was in a very similar boat when I started here like 10 years ago. I did custom home automation and stuff for like 20 years before I. And stuff for like 20 years before I came to the center. And I was in exactly the same boat when I started here because I had to figure out how the Kinear Center was supposed to work before I could even begin to fix it. And that was sort of why I came over today was, okay, I got to get my head around how this thing is expected to work in order to be able to tell you what's not working. And that can be a long process. So, again, I don't really know. Again, I don't really know what the parameters of the job would be in terms of like well, they're here doing the install, but if you guys feel it's worthwhile and would like me to come by, happy to do it. I just kind of need to know what the expectations are. Because, you know, I would expect it's probably documenting the thing from start to finish. From start to finish, and probably preparing some kind of like user manual. But at the same time, it's likely that the vendor is going to provide the bulk of that. They probably have a line item in their invoice for training and documentation. I mean, that's how I do all my jobs. It's like there's X number of hours for client training and for me to do all the drawings and provide manuals. And provide manuals and all of that. So, my assumption is they're going to take care of that anyway. But if you need a hand of somebody who's on site, by all means, let me know. Okay. Thank you. I just, like I say, it hasn't been explained to me because I don't think anybody has to. I think none of us in the world. Nobody knows. I mean, if I can try one, I can try a little bit with some context of what's happening and everything. What's happening is everything that's in the mac mini, the Logitech, there's a bunch of hats we've talked about with various combinations of muting things, muting combinations of speakers and microphones. The idea is to replace or move the Mac Mini out of the room, it goes into the rack where Castle is at the moment. The camera and microphone system, like that whole system of microphones is being rationalised, so there will be one set of microphones. It's the ones that are hanging from the ceiling. And really, I think what And really, I think what Danny was hoping for, or what we're hoping for, is just so that you're aware of how that's intended to work. Because I'm only going to be here temporarily, we're in the process of hiring a replacement for Brent's position. That person would probably make further changes once they get in. So, what we're doing is sort of trying to get the changes that Brent ordered brought in, so that that microphone system basically rationalized so that. Rationalize so that the hybrid meetings work a bit more smoothly. We don't have as many combinations or panic arounds with nuke this, something like that. And it's just the holdover until that new technology manager is able to figure that stuff out for themselves. So understanding what the ADI SDL are putting in, how it's intended to operate at the moment, and for a period of a few months, I think would be the main thing. Did you say you had some? Did you say you had some kind of document provided by the API? There's a statement of work, but it's not actually a huge scope. All they're literally doing is, so you have the Logitech speakers and microphone. Those are coming out. They're being replaced by the speakers and microphones that are integrated into the same audio system as ABRS. So you have all your echo cancellation things. There's a stream going up where the cameras at the back of the room are. Right. So you'll have visibility. So, you'll have visibility of what the Zoom meeting is showing without having to lower the projection screen. And that's pretty much it. Stuff beyond that is mostly they have the programmer for the AMX controller is looking at it just now. They're replacing the current programming entirely, so that will be refreshed down. Yeah, that's the idea. It's probably easier to rewrite it than to rebuild it, so fair enough. Yes. The idea is. And the idea is basically to do the workflows, the two sort of setups that we've done today, like where you have the presenter either remotely or the presenter in person, have the AMX program to be able to do that with this new additions. So show me the Zoom meeting at the back of the room and relay the audio through the APRS microphones rather than through a separate discrete microphone. Gotcha. So are they Gotcha. So are they replacing, is there a line item on your scope of work for an additional audio DSP or anything to that degree? I have to look at the actual materials, but I think there was enough connections available on the existing DSP that they were able to basically add audio outputs, they're not adding any more audio inputs. Right. Audio inputs. Right. Because they're ABRS microphones for all audio at this stage. All they're doing is replacing the, I think I'm speaking to you through a Logitech speaker in the room as well. It's getting more. So that, instead of the Mac Mini feeding the Logitech, it's feeding an additional input on the DSP so it could be sourced either in Room or externally to Zoom. Right, gotcha. Okay. I have a question about. Okay, I have a question about what the audio in the room will be. Is there new speakers or? Yes. So there's two speakers going above on either side of the platforms. I think there's sort of steps on the ceiling. There's two speakers going there and then there's two speakers going at the back. They'll be either side of the display. So there's a 40-something inch display going in the back of the room. Cool. Cool. Gotcha. Okay, well, I'll leave it to you guys. Okay, well I'll give it to you guys if uh let me know the dates and times and what you need me to do and I'm happy to try to work something out. Thanks for coming. Thank you. And yeah, I'll leave it with you. I'll give you your... I can text you my cell number and if there's anything you think I can help with, let me know. Sure. 688 638 4679 Jacob, right? Yes. And your last name? Osaki, P-O-S-A-C-K-I. P-O-S-A-C-K-I. And yeah, Indeed. Ian, do you want me to stop recording? I thought we had to stop recording, but we're still on the Zoom machine. Is it still recording? I think so. I haven't stopped it. Yeah?
