Hopefully, the other people who are planning to join will be back very soon. And it is my pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Daniel Weissman from Emory. And he'll be talking to us about chronic infections likely driving SARS-CoV-2 adaptation. So please take it away. So, please take it away. Thank you. Okay, so I was frantically trying to get some of my slides to be less blurry at the last minute. I think some of them might still be, but let's do our best here. Okay, so let's talk about the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 adaptation. I was really struck by this pattern of the emergence of the first three VOCs. I thought it was pretty strange. I mean, because we had this long period at the beginning. Period at the beginning where we saw very little adaptation, basically just D614G. And then all of a sudden, boom, boom, boom, three very similar VOCs. Here's a list. They had lots of mutations with a lot of sharing between them. None of these mutations, besides the D614G, were seen at any substantial frequency in the population before. In the population before they all occurred on different backgrounds in our three variants, so we can tell that these are true independent occurrences of these mutations. What could have caused this? So basically, you know, most people, I don't know, I seem to be one of the very few people who was kind of disturbed by this pattern or kind of expected that we should have a theory that could reproduce this, but I kind of complained for a while online. Of complained for a while online. And then my former student, Mahan, who is now at Oxford at the time working with Aris Katsurakis, kind of said, hey, yeah, it bothers me too. So Mahan and Aris and my students, Chihan and Arushi, got together and tried to see, can we make sense of these patterns? And let me explain why I was disturbed. If we take our simplest models, If we take our simplest models, we can either get that long waiting time with little adaptation, or we can get kind of the clumping of the three VOCs together. But it's very hard to get both. And the key variable in the classic theory would be the mutation supply. Either we would have a small mutation supply, and then you'd have a long waiting time while you're waiting for kind of your first mutation, your VOC mutation to arrive. But then, you know, the first one occurs, then you have to wait a long time for the next one. Then you have to wait a long time for the next one. And then you have to wait a long time for the third. So you do get the long wait, that's good. But you also get a long waiting time between VOCs. You don't get three in quick succession. Conversely, you can have a high mutation supply, plenty mutations. And then, yeah, you get mutations right away. And so all the VOCs kind of rise up together. So that's good. You get the clumping, but they rise right away. You don't get that long waiting time with nothing happening. So, you know, what gives. You know, what gives? How can we need to add to this kind of simplest model to get what we actually saw? All right, there's kind of two key factors that we thought might play a role. Number one is chronic infections. Okay, so I was already kind of thinking that chronic infections could be really important for adaptation because of some other work that I and Mahan had been involved in on inferring the transmission bottleneck size. Inferring the transmission bottleneck size between infections. And we had put together a method for inferring this from genetic data, and other people had taken that method and applied it to SARS-CoV-2 and found very tight transmission bottlenecks. In other words, typically just a single variant being passed from host to host. So what that does is it destroys most of the genetic diversity that accumulates during an infection. And so it makes it very hard for selection to act on acute infections. Selection to act on acute infections because they keep having to pass through this transmission bottleneck every time, very strong drift. Chronic infections don't have that problem. So, this was more a reason to be skeptical of adaptation at the general population level. And so you ask, what's the alternative, chronic infections? Then, on the more positive side, argued for chronic infections, people had found VOC-like mutations in chronically infected individuals, not the VOCs themselves, right? The VOCs themselves, right? But some overlap with the same mutations. So, this kind of suggested maybe those chronic infections could be serving as incubators for the VOCs. And so now we're going to see maybe this totally independent line of evidence, the dynamics of the VOCs are pointing in the same direction. Another possible factor that, again, Mohan and I had been thinking about a lot for other reasons was the fitness landscape. So, in that simplest model I showed before. Model I showed before, I was kind of implicitly assuming that there's basically one mutation that makes you become a VOC. But the fact that they had many mutations argues that no, probably many mutations are necessary. And so then it becomes a question of like, well, exactly how many of those mutations were really necessary to turn into a VOC and how do they combine? And we kind of considered a few limiting possibilities. One is this kind of cartoon simplest possibility that we did not expect to fit the data very well, but we wanted to be fair. Data very well, but we wanted to, you know, be fair and considerate. That's where just one mutation is enough, turns you right into a VOC. The option two is kind of your more standard picture where we say, okay, you need a bunch of mutations, and each one brings you a little bit closer to becoming a full-fledged VOC. You're getting better and better and better, spreading better and better and better. Well, you got them all. You have the full advantage. And option three was the one that we had spent a lot of time thinking about, the fitness plateau, where you get some mutations. Where you get some mutations, and the first ones don't help you very much. But then, when you get the good combination, the combination of all of them, boom, you're very fit. And there was some experimental evidence that there was something like this pattern of mutations not helping or possibly even hurting a little bit in isolation, but then combining well together. So, there was some reason to suspect that this might also be playing a role. And all right, so what we're going to try and do is take these ingredients and Do is take these ingredients and fit these basic observed dynamics. All right, so what are the key features that we want to fit? All right, we want three VOCs before Delta comes along. We want the first VOC, you know, late summer, early fall. So in other words, that long waiting time. We want to match that waiting time. And then not much longer to get the second and third. So we've got a long waiting time and then a short. Waiting time and then a short time to get all three. And then, in addition to those dynamics, we're going to primarily try and fit the dynamics, but we're going to remember that, in fact, many mutations were observed. And we're going to ask, do these different models kind of reproduce that feature of having many mutations per VOC? All right, so what are the kind of key model parameters here? First is kind of Here. First is kind of our population size of viruses, which is going to basically be our number of infections, number of infected individuals. And the reason why it's just the number of infected individuals, why each person just counts as kind of one virus, is because of that tight transmission bottleneck of a single virus that I told you about. This we have a pretty good handle on. We can estimate it from the deaths and ballpark, the infection fatality ratio. Okay, so we're fairly confident about the kind of trajectory. Confident about the kind of trajectory of infections. We really make this a trajectory. I'll show that later, but we track the number of infections over time. It's not constant. Another key parameter is how big of the advantage of the VOCs is. This one we can estimate from the early takeoff of those VOCs in their country of origin. Again, pretty good handle on this. You know, not exactly, but we have a pretty good sense of what's going on. The mutation rate. Okay, that's pretty well observed. There's, again, some fuzziness. There's again some fuzziness on this because exactly what is our mutation target size, unclear. You know, there's some deletions involved in the VOCs. Those are a little, those occur at a different rate from the point mutations. But again, ballpark, we kind of know what's going on. All right, now we start getting to the kind of the more troublesome variables. One is how much super spreading is there? We measure this with this dispersion parameter k, and basically, And basically, the smaller K is, the more super spreading there is. And it reduces kind of our effective population size. This is very uncertain. There's some recent work that suggests it might be as low as 0.01, but other work has suggested it might be not that much less than one. So we're going to have to kind of scan a range of possibilities here. And then we come to the two that we really don't know, but that we're interested in: the chronic infection. interested in the chronic infections and the fitness landscape. And we're going to for the fitness landscape, we're going to explore those three possibilities that I showed you before. For the chronic infections, we'll just try and fit their frequency. And for their dynamics, we'll treat it as largely a black box, but we'll say, okay, we just assume that substitutions accumulate at some steady, fast rate in the chronic infections. That seems to be roughly what's going on in observed cases, but we'll put a pin in that and remember that's something that maybe we should look at. That's something that maybe we should look at more carefully later. All right, so what can we, if we try and explore the space of models, what do we find? All right, the simple single cartoon, cartoon model of just one mutation to become a VOC does not fit the dynamics. All right, this plot's a little complicated, so let me try and explain what's going on here. First, we've got we're exploring some different possible amounts of super spreading from not so. Amounts of super spreading from not so much super spreading to quite a bit of super spreading. And we're checking how often do you get that correct number three of VOCs? And, you know, usually not. Usually, if you have only moderate super spreading, you get way too many VOCs. If you put in extreme super spreading, you get too few. There is kind of a Goldilocks number where you get the right amount. But then, if you get the right amount of VOCs, you then start looking at the timing. You then start looking at the timing. You look at how long you had to wait for that first VOC and how long you had to wait between the first and the third. The data lives here. And if you look, hardly any of the orange points fall within that rectangle. It's not zero, but something lucky would have, it's not lucky or unlucky, whatever. It would have to be an exceptional case to match the dynamics with just. To match the dynamics with just the single mutation model, and this leaves totally unexplained why the VOCs have so many mutations. So, you know, we didn't expect this one to work so well, but yeah, confirmed. All right. Let's say we have more than one mutation, but it's a straight uphill path. Each one is adding something. Okay, well, then if we pick the right number of mutations, say we say four mutations. Say we say four mutations are required. Then we can get right number-ish of VOCs and the timing we can get, you know, at a reasonable fraction. It's not perfect, but you know, things like that happen. And, you know, 16% things happen all the time. So we can match the dynamics. But if we're assuming no chronic infections, if we're assuming that this is taking place at the population level. Is taking place at the population level. We cannot match the dynamics of all the mutations because what you would see is: here's our VOCs taking off. But what's all this stuff here before? It's the intermediate genotypes. They would have already had an advantage and they would have already been spreading. So the VLCs could not have come out of nowhere. We would have seen the component mutations spreading on their own. So this picture cannot fit the data at all. Data at all. Oops, sorry, I went the wrong way. Now, if we mix in the chronic infections, then we can fit the data. So we add in the chronic infections. We say you need many mutations to be a VOC. And in fact, we make the number of mutations really big, or not really big, but substantial, at least maybe four or so. And what that does, it makes it. Um, and what that does is it makes it hard for the intermediate genotypes to spread because their advantage, their advantage is not that big. So, here is an example where we see the intermediate genotypes, they do start spreading, but they only reach up to about 1% frequency in the population by the time that the VOCs are really taking off. So, this is possible, but it's kind of hard because you see the intermediate gene types are spreading. Spreading. So it's iffy. If we then say, what if it's a fitness plateau? So those intermediate gene types do not have an advantage, then actually, even if we totally ignore chronic infections, we can already match the dynamics. We can find the right number of VOCs a substantial portion of the time, and occasionally we get the right dynamics. Right dynamics. But there's an issue. It's very hard to cross very wide plateaus because selection is just not guiding on the way. You're getting no feedback from selection until you're all the way there. So it's hard to match the overall mutation numbers. We can get the dynamics right, but not the large numbers of mutations. Okay, so maybe you can tell some story about why so many mutations accumulated, but again, a little iffy. All right, if we put together the two ingredients, we say there's Together, the two ingredients, we say there's a fitness plateau and evolution is primarily taking place in chronic infections, then we can match everything. We get a real nice peak right at the observed number of VOCs. We get plenty of outcomes, simulation outcomes landing right in the observed dynamic region, right waiting time for the first VOC, right time between VOCs. Everything works. And you can have tons. Everything works. And you can have tons of mutations. I mean, we did k equals three and k equals six here, but you could have much higher numbers. You know, k equals eight or nine, like really like the same numbers actually are observed in the mutations. So this one looks like it's the most consistent with the data. So yeah, I would say this is our conclusion so far that, yeah, we're pretty sure chronic infections played a role. Remember, this is an independent. Infections played a role. Remember, this is an independent line of evidence, you know, totally separate from the fact that there's this match in the observed mutations. This is just from the dynamics and counting of mutations. And we think probably that you need, well, it certainly needed multiple mutations to become a VOC. Probably the fact that they had to interact to become a VOC is also important. They probably were not independently contributing. All right, what about Delta and Omicron? And what about going forward? I think it's probably. About going forward, I think it's probably the same story. Um, why, uh, you know, that they come from evolution within chronic infections. Um, why? Well, number one, they don't descend from previous VOCs, which is a little bit surprising, especially for Omicron, right? Because Delta had totally taken over the population, the whole world by the time, you know, before Omicron arose. But Omicron does not descend from Delta, it does not, or alpha, beta, or gamma. It does not, or alpha, beta, or gamma, and delta does not descend from alpha, beta, or gamma either. So, why is that? Well, in the chronic infection story, it's very natural because they have to incubate for months inside a chronic infection. So, Omicron arose from a chronic infection that started before the Delta wave and was quietly evolving in that one person throughout the whole Delta wave. And then it pops out, it never even knew about Delta. I want to. I want to emphasize the weirdness of this. That, in some sense, what we're seeing is that the fact that they're tight transmission bottlenecks means that there's more power to evolve in one person than there is in the whole world, you know, the whole population of infections. So, this tiny, well, small, we don't know exactly, it's a small fraction of cases that are chronic. As far as I can tell, have driven essentially all of the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 so far, you know, all the VLCs at least. So it suggests that perhaps going forward, we should really aggressively track down these chronic infections and help these people, you know, give them whatever they need to get these infections treated. Maybe we could just stop the virus from adapting that way. That way. But there's a big puzzle that I really don't understand here, which is why are they evolving better transmissibility within chronically infected hosts? Because in that chronically infected environment, by definition, they are not transmitting. They are sitting in that one host, just growing there. So there's no opportunity for selection to act directly on host-to-host transmission, which is the defining feature of a VOC that it's good at that. So this, I think, there must be something. I think you know, there must be something going on here where somehow selection within a host is aligned with selection between hosts or something. I think it's a big mystery. Um, so yeah, it looks like, do I have a couple more minutes? I think so, um, because I got till 1230, I believe. So I then I'm going to use this as motivation to say there's still some questions we don't know. So what we're doing now is we're looking more carefully at chronically infected hosts to try and see if we can figure out what might be going on inside. Be going on inside them. So, here's an example of a patient who came into Emory. They had immune problems. And so they had SARS-CoV-2 for months until they actually died of it. And this is after being treated with antibodies and antivirals. So we did, I helped a little bit with several case studies of patients like this. That's in that's this work, a big team. And then a subset of that team is following up with a deep dive on this particular patient. We're focusing on this patient because if you know what these numbers are, this is like how much RNA we were able to recover. And these are really good numbers. So there's like a lot of high quality. Uh, see, uh, like high-quality sequencing data from this individual, but just sequence at these four time points. All right, so let's look and see what SARS-CoV-2 did in this person. Okay, so we compared our samples to what was circulating in Georgia at about the same time. And you can see, okay, all our samples cluster together. So it looks like this is one evolutionary tree within this one. Tree within this one person, no evidence of reinfection or anything like that. And the, but it's closely related to some other stuff that was in Georgia at about the same time. So this looks reasonable. This looks good. And this scale here is like a couple of mutations. When we look at the actual sequencing data and break it down by mutations, we see that there's tons of evolution. Mutations, we see that there's tons of evolution, particularly in the spike gene here. So, here we're looking at how frequent the mutations are in the individual and at different time points. And we see a big cluster of mutations near spike. And if we track them over time, we see that a lot of them come up and then they go down. So, that kind of suggests that there may be some fluctuating selection, perhaps related to the fact that. Perhaps related to the fact that there were antibodies and that there were antivirals, but they were not consistently applied. We just don't know. And if you notice, these are heavily non-synonymous, these substitutions. So again, that suggests selection is playing a big role. But all this stuff can't be spreading at the same time without substantial linkage between them. So we then tried to come up with a consistent story of different genotypes spreading. Different genotypes spreading over time. So, here we've got time going this way, and this is a Mueller plot. So, here we're plotting kind of the population and what genotypes we think were present in the population at different times. And what you see here, don't worry about the details, but the key thing that I want to show is we've got one genotype that we infer that then totally disappears and then comes back later. Later. And then we've got other genotypes that disappear and then come back later. So, and then here we've got long-lived coexistence of two different genotypes. So, it suggests that there's a lot of room for within-host diversity and preservation of that diversity over long times within hosts. And my guess is that this is some kind of spatial structure, you know, different regions of the lungs or the. Different regions of the lungs or the throat being infected by different viruses. That's a complete guess, though. Okay, so what are the big conclusions? We think that chronic infections are driving global adaptation, and it's not just that these chronic infections are evolving rapidly, but also that they're exploring multiple directions and preserving diversity. Okay, so I guess I'm taking questions after at the end, right? Questions after at the end, right? We have a little bit of time now that we can take some questions in. But yes, the breakout more in-depth discussion happens, absolutely. So, yeah, happy to take a couple of questions if there are any. Okay, thanks very much. Just a reminder to everyone that you can either unmute. You can either unmute yourselves and ask a question directly, or you can type it in the chat if you're joining online. If you're in person, well, you also have the option of just coming up to the podium and grabbing the microphone. So please don't be shy. Sally, there's a question from the yeah, go ahead, Sally. Sally. Sally, you'll need to unmute your audio first, I think. You're still muted. Maybe we should take the other question while we're all right. Ed, Ed, go ahead and then we'll come back to Sally. Hi, thanks. Thank you, Daniel. Very interesting. I guess my question is whether, I mean, you explained this mystery about why these variants of concern that come from chronic infections have such a transmissibility advantage when there's no obvious. Advantage when there's no obvious, well, there isn't any selection pressure for transmissibility within the host. But do we really need to evoke that? Because isn't the idea that you have built up such an amazing sea of diversity during this time of chronic infection that the thing you're going to see is the thing that happens to be most transmissible. You're not going to see all the other stuff that's the consequence of actually the selection within the host. So, isn't it just an Within the host. So, isn't it just a numbers game that you throw so many mutations at the thing over such a long time that something pops up that has increased transmissibility? Yeah, that's a great point. Yeah, it's a really important one. Yeah, it probably is the case that the vast majority of chronic infections do not produce a VOC. They go off in some totally different direction. And yeah, we just see the ones that unfortunately happen to stumble across that. Across that genotype. Now, there needs to be some kind of alignment because if we're talking like even, you know, four mutations, if you have to hit four like random arbitrary mutations, that's not going to happen no matter how. I mean, that's a combinatorially large number of infections that you need. So there needs to be some kind of push in the right direction, I think. Absolutely. But absolutely. But absolutely, yeah. Okay, yeah, thank you. Thank you. Okay, and then now we come to Sally. Um, if you guys have, oh, yeah, there we go. Um, let's see if we can uh okay, yeah, you guys are you guys are on now. The CMO account is on. Account is on. So, whoever's got the microphone for that should be able to. Sorry. Sorry. Oh, hey. Can you hear me now? Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, you know, how many PhDs does it take to figure out a microphone system? It's really complicated. Figure out a microphone system, it's really complicated these days, yeah. It's combinatorially difficult. We find the right stations, but so Daniel, super interesting talk. I, I, um, you know, I'm putting, I'm trying to put two pieces of what you said together in my mind. I wonder if you can help me out. So, you're talking about sort of the structure of the fitness landscape and evolution sort of along neutral networks there before the system finds the beneficial mutation. And that Mutation. And that makes a lot of sense given all the various pieces that you talk about. And you're also talking about, you know, you showed the evidence from the Emory patient with the chronic infection and the reservoirs are really interesting there. So can you help me put it together? So if there's reservoirs like that, so that the old viruses that are part way along the progress across the landscape are sticking around. Is that going to slow you down in your progress towards? Slow you down in your progress towards the beneficial mutation, or is it going to keep more options open for you? What do you think? Yeah, that's a really good question. I mean, one thing that I kind of didn't emphasize is those fitness landscapes, again, are for the transmission phenotype, right? The transmission level of selection, the between host level of selection. And then when we look at the within-host evolution, that is a different fitness landscape, right? I mean, a priori, there's no Landscape, right? I mean, a priori, there's no reason why those things should be similar. Apparently, there's some similarity, but yeah. So I think that what's going on is tons of selection within host. It's not going neutral at all. These are all being selected. And then it's only when we look at it at the between host cell that it looks neutral. Now, for your specific question, I think it's probably helping it because it means that each chronic infection explores multiple directscape. And so it has a higher chance of having one of those reservoirs hit the Those reservoirs hit the VOC phenotype. Thank you. Excellent. So we'll leave the rest of the questions for the breakout room. And now we have our next speaker. And that is Marina Escalera-Zemuyo. And she'll be talking about comparing the evolutionary dynamics of predominant SARS-CoV-2 virus lineages co-circulating in Mexico.
