In tangent categories. And so this is the differential geometric concept of connection. So the title of the talk is An Introduction to Connections in Tangent Categories. And so through this talk, we're going to fix a tangent category that we're going to work in. So I'll let x be a tangent category. X is a tangent category, and then M is an object of X. X. And we're also going to make some further assumptions about the existence of pullbacks, certain pullbacks, and more generally fiber products, so products in slice categories. We're going to assume that some of these exist and that they're preserved by the tangent functor from x to x, and also the iterates of the tangent functor, by which I mean the powers of the tangent functor, t to the power. Of the tangent functor t to the power n obtained by repeatedly composing the tangent functor with itself. So we'll have these kind of background assumptions about pullbacks, but we'll only impose them as we go, requiring the existence of certain fiber products and their preservation by the tangent functor and its iterates. But I won't actually even mention those just for the ease of exposition and all the details of the exact pullback requirements. Details of the exact pullback requirements are in the papers that I have referred to in the abstract there. So, as far as connections in tangent categories, the first paper was the one by Cockett and Crudwell introducing connections in tangent categories. And there's a reference there to a paper of mine where I give some equivalent formulations of connections in tangent categories. And there's also a reference. Tangent categories. And there's also a reference to a paper by Patterson in the setting of smooth manifolds. And there, Patterson gives a way of describing connections on vector bundles that provided part of the inspiration for part of the Cockett and Crudwell definition of connections in the abstract setting of tangent categories. Abstract setting of tangent categories. Okay, so here we're going to be looking at connections on differential bundles. So I wanted to say a few things about differential bundles. So differential bundles, in tangent categories, these provide a basically, they play the role of vector bundles in differential geometry. And so in this talk, we'll be working with them a lot. This talk, we'll be working with them a lot. So, I'll just say bundle for differential bundle. And so, a differential bundle over m would be what? Well, we saw these introduced in Ben's talk earlier. And a differential bundle E over M consists of an object E together with a morphism Q, let's write it as, down to M. And this morphism. This morphism is required to carry some structure. It needs to be a commutative monoid in the slice category over M. So it will have a fiberwise addition plus and also a zero section. That'll be a section of this morphism Q. And these provide fiber-wise commutative monoid structure. Of course, that's the way that it works out. That it works out if we look at set-based models such as smooth manifolds. But here, of course, the data is all given abstractly. We have a commutative monoid in the slice category over M. Okay, so we have these data, the additive structure, but then we also have one more ingredient as well called the lift, lambda, and it goes from E to T of E. And these data are really. E and these data are required to satisfy certain axioms, as we've seen in Ben's talk. Okay, so in the category of smooth manifolds, as we saw in Ben's talk, these are vector bundles, but admitting the possibility that the dimension may vary, the dimension may vary between components. So, we can, you know, often vector bundles are visualized by thinking of the case of By thinking of the case of a line bundle, so we can think of the base space, for example, as being one-dimensional, just a line down here. And then we can think of E as being sitting over it somehow. And so let's think of this entire region up here as being E, but I'm drawing a dashed line at the top and the bottom, indicating that this actually should. Indicating that this actually should go on indefinitely upwards and also indefinitely downwards. So that here, if we have some point x of m, then the fiber over it in E, I'll label the whole thing as E up here, the fiber over it in this example is just a one-dimensional vector space. And so we can use this case of a line bundle where the fibers, that is, where the fibers have The fibers have are of dimension one, we can use this case to help us visualize the concepts in this talk. And so, for example, we can think of the Mobius line bundle as an example. And in this talk, so with connections, well, one way of looking at connections is that connections help us to answer the question of how we can deal with. Of how we can deal with tangent vectors on a vector bundle. Okay, so what connections will let us do is they'll let us decompose a tangent vector to E here as decompose it in terms of a tangent vector along m or a tangent vector to m together with some elements of e. Some elements of E, and we'll see how we can do this later. So, this gives us a way of dealing with tangent vectors to vector bundles and more generally, differential bundles. Okay, some examples of differential bundles that we'll need in this talk. One important example is the tangent bundle of M, which I'll write in this way. And this is a differential bundle. This is a differential bundle where we take the object E to be T of M, and we take the tangent projection P sub M down to M, and then we have the fiberwise addition on the tangent bundle, and we have the zero section of the tangent bundle, and we have the vertical lift. And so, this is an example of a differential bundle. Also, another way of getting Also, another way of getting differential bundles is we can take a given differential bundle and we can apply t to it. So let's see what happens at that point. When we take t of e, well, what I mean to do is take, so we're going to apply t to this morphism up here, and what we get is t of e and the morphism t of q going down to t of m. And we'll apply. And we'll apply t to all the other structures carried by e as well. So we take t of plus, that'll be our addition, and t of zero. And then we'll take t of the lift followed by the canonical flip, C sub E. And so here I'm using the diagrammatic composition order, taking this morphism and then that one, and just juxtaposing the morphisms to it. Morphisms to indicate composition. Okay, so these are some ways of getting differential bundles that we'll make use of in the talk. Okay, so we have this notion of differential bundle. What about morphisms between differential bundles? In Ben's talk, we saw one way of formulating those. Here is another way of formulating morphisms using this formalism for differential bundles. For differential bundles here, which is the original one introduced by Cockett and Crudwell. Okay, so we'll define a category of differential bundles, and I'll write it as dbun in this talk. So these are differential bundles in X, the given tangent category. So objects of this category are bundles, differential bundles. And then morphisms. Morphisms are going to be what are called linear bundle morphisms. So, here we can actually have bundles over different objects. So let's say I have a differential bundle E over M with its projection. And then let's say I have some other differential bundle over a different base object N. Well, then I can ask for two morphisms. One here called G going from E to F, and also a morphism between the base objects or base spaces from M to N. And I'm going to ask that this diagram should commute. And then we also have other structure here. So we'd want to preserve all of the structure plus zero and lambda. But it turns out it's sufficient. And this is an interesting insight of these authors. These authors that we can just ask for the lift morphisms to commute, for these morphisms to commute with the lift morphisms carried by E and F, so that we have a commutative diagram like this. Okay, so a pair of morphisms G and F like this is called a linear bundle morphism from the one differential bundle to the other. One differential bundle to the other. And we get a category in this way. And also, another thing is that this category is equipped, of course, with a forgetful functor down to the given tangent category where we just send each bundle to its base space like this. Okay, so we have a forgetful functor like this. And what we can do is we can consider fixing just one base space. Can consider fixing just one base object, M, as we have here, and looking at just differential bundles over that one object, M. So this would be the fiber over M of this functor that we've just seen here. And so the objects here would be bundles over that one object M. And we can, you know, we can call these objects spaces if we want to. Okay, so bundles not M. Okay, so bundles not m, but rather bundles over m is what I mean to write here. And then the morphisms, well, here m is going to be fixed throughout. So the morphisms we can describe a bit more simply as well. We'll just have a morphism G going from one bundle to another required to commute with the projection morphisms down to the base space M. And we also agree. And we also again want the lift morphisms to be preserved, so that's the other requirement here. Okay, so commutes with the projections down to M and also the lift morphisms. And this category here, differential bundles over a fixed base object M, it is an additive category, and that's one thing that we'll use later. Use later. And this is an additive category, I mean, in the weaker sense, where we just require that the category be enriched in the category of commutative monoids. Commutative monoids, we're writing them additively. So we have an addition on the HOM sets and zeromorphisms subject to certain requirements. To certain requirements, so we can add morphisms here. Moreover, we have a commutative monoid enriched category and additive category, and we'll make use of this as we go along. Okay, one thing we can do with differential bundles, which I'm just calling bundles in this talk, is we can pull them back along morphisms. So if I have a differential bundle E over M, then we can, if we're given a more If we're given a morphism from some other object, n into m, so we have a morphism f from n to n, then we can hope to take a pullback if it exists. And as I mentioned, you know, I'm sort of not even going to mention certain assumptions about existence of pullbacks and their preservation by the iterates of the tangent functor. So suppose we have such suitable assumptions in place. Suitable assumptions in place, well, then we can form a pullback like this, and we can hope to equip this morphism with the structure of a differential bundle over n. So we can visualize this in the following way. Over here, I'll write E, E underline. This is our notation for the whole structure of a differential bundle is E underline. And so we have E underline being a differential bundle over M. So that's what I'm writing here. But then we have a morphism F going from some F going from some other object N into M, and we can form a differential bundle F upper star of E underline, which will be the pullback of E along F. And this is a differential bundle over N as we're depicting here. And it's equipped with a, like this square here underlies linear bundle morphism over F, and it's Cartesian. Over F and it's Cartesian over F. So I'll write that in here so we can visualize these pullbacks of differential bundles in this way with this kind of schematic notation. Okay, so at this point, I'd like to go into the definition of a connection on a differential bundle as defined by Cockett and Crudwell. So definition, this definition is due to Cockett and Crudwell. Is due to Cockett and Crudwell in the paper cited in the abstract. So it'll have several parts to it. First of all, a vertical connection. So this is one of our notions of connection, a vertical connection. And we'll be using this terminology a lot in this talk. So I'll actually introduce a A abbreviation here, VCX, vertical connection on E. So I'll write it as just VCX. What is this? It's a morphism. So we're working in a category here. We can describe structures in terms of morphisms. So here we just need one morphism going from T of E to E, and we'll write it as capital K, morphism in X, such that certain axioms are satisfied. First of all, Satisfied. First of all, we want for k to be a retraction of the lift morphism that's carried by our differential bundle. So we take our lift morphism followed by k. This is diagrammatic composition, lambda, and then k should be equal to the identity morphism on E. This says that k is a retraction of lambda. And then a couple more requirements. When we take k paired together with the tangent Together with the tangent projection for M, we're going to ask that this pair be a linear bundle morphism from T applied to the differential bundle E to E again. And we want this to be a linear bundle morphism. I'll just write linear just as a short form for that requirement. And then we also want K to be part of another. Part of another linear bundle morphism, this time going from the tangent bundle of E. So we just take the object E of the surrounding category X, take its tangent bundle, that's T underline of E. And taking this particular pair here, we will ask that this pair is a linear bundle morphism from the tangent bundle of E to E. Okay, so these are the requirements for a vertical. Okay, so these are the requirements for a vertical connection, and we'll look at this from several perspectives as we go along. Another notion of connection that is related but different in form is the concept of a horizontal connection. So, a horizontal connection, which we'll abbreviate as an HCX on E, On E is again a morphism in our category, but this time we want this morphism to go from the following object, the fiber product of E and T of M, fiber product taken over M. So this is a pullback in our category, this object, and the morphism will go from there to the tangent. To the tangent bundle of E, just the object T of E in our surrounding category. So just a morphism in X such that certain axioms hold. So I won't write out the axioms. They're a bit more complicated than the vertical connection axioms, but similar in nature. Similar in nature in a way, but the form of the morphism is completely different. We'll be focusing more on the vertical connections in this talk, but we'll see how these two notions interact, okay, and how we can express one in terms of the other under suitable assumptions. And then a connection consists of a vertical connection and a horizontal connection that are compatible. Connection that are compatible. So let's write this down again as well. So a connection, which I'll abbreviate also as CX in this talk, is a pair consisting of a vertical connection K. So it's a pair KH consisting of a vertical connection. So that's a VCX K and also And also an H C X H here, a horizontal connection. So we ask for one of each such that they're compatible, and that compatibility means that certain axioms hold, which I won't write down, but we'll see equivalent ways of formulating the notion of connection as well. One of which will be One of which will be quite directly based on the vertical connection concept. Okay, so as far as the relationship between these different notions, Cocken and Crutwell proved a number of important things that, first of all, each vertical connection is part of at most one connection. So if there is a compatible horizontal connection, then it's unique. And also each horizontal connection is part of at most. Horizontal connection is part of at most one connection as well. And also, if the tangent category x has negatives, then every horizontal connection is part of a connection. And again, under the assumption that x has negatives, if the differential bundle carries at least one horizontal connection, then every vertical connection is part of a connection. So there are these results which indicate... Which indicate that there's some kind of close relationship between these concepts. Okay, and in this regard, here's another theorem. So this theorem is one that I proved in the paper that's referenced in the abstract. A connection k, h on a differential bundle E is equivalently given by Given by a vertical connection K such that a certain condition holds. So we'll ask for one more condition in addition to the vertical connection axioms. This one will be in terms of the category theoretic concept of a limit. And so we'll look. And so we'll look at the following little diagram. So we have the tangent projection for E, and then we have T applied to Q. That's the projection morphism for our given differential bundle E. And then we'll also put our vertical connection morphism here, K. And we can add some more morphisms to this diagram, tangent projection for M down to M, and we'll have projections for all these down to M. Projections for all these down to M. We do have morphisms Q here and Q here again. And what we'll ask is that this diagram is a fiber product diagram. And what does this mean? It means that viewed as projection morphisms, these three morphisms exhibit E as a fiber product. Fiber product of the following objects, a fiber product over M. So a fiber product of E and T of M, and another copy of E, another instance of E, fiber product over M. And so this is a vertical connection satisfying another axiom. Conveniently, by just adding that additional limit axiom, we get a sort of very convenient formalism for Convenient formalism for connections so that we can just define equivalently a connection as a vertical connection satisfying this axiom. And so I wanted to just introduce a bit of terminology that I introduced for these, just calling these effective vertical connections. And they're another way of defining connections. So a connection is equivalently given by an effective vertical connection. And I think we have some. And I think we have some questions in the chat. So one question is: is it E or T of E? And we've got T of E somewhere. T of E is appearing up top. So everything is good, right? Okay, great. Thanks for the question. I think it's a line just below fiber product diagram. Ah, perfect. Sorry about that. T of E should be right here. I wrote E there, but of course it should be T of E there. Of course, it should be T of E there. So it's the one up here is exhibited as a fiber product of the three objects that appear in the diagram. Perfect. Thanks for that. So, okay, so we have these concepts, this concept of a connection in a tangent category. We have a couple of ways of describing them as a pair, KH, or as a vertical connection satisfying this further axiom. Let's take a look at an example. At an example. So let's go to the classical setting of smooth manifolds and look at something really simple. So we have x being smooth manifolds. And this time we'll just take m to be rn. It doesn't get that much more simple than that, other than maybe, well, we could take m to be just the reals. Let's take rn here and then we need a And then we need a vector bundle on that base space. What we'll do is take the tangent bundle, so t underline of m, that's the tangent bundle. And so that consists of t of m and the tangent projection here. But what is this? Sorry, I mean to write p subscript m down to m. Well, here it's quite simple. It'll be just Here it's quite simple. It'll be just the product of Rn with itself, the tangent bundle of Rn. And this projection morphism just sends a pair consisting of a base point, a point, and a tangent vector at that point. Well, we'll just send it to the base point x. Okay, and this underlies a differential bundle, a vector bundle. Okay, what about connections on this vector? This vector bundle. So, well, we need to look at t of e because that's what appeared in the definition. And here that would be m. So this will be the second tangent bundle of m. And when we take this tangent bundle, well, it's going to be m times m times m times m, which we can write as m to the power of 4. And let's look at the morphisms that appear in the diagram above. So we have the tangent projection first on the left. Let's take a look at that. So we have P sub T of M here going to T of M. And up top here, well, the elements here are four tuples. Let's write them as X T U V. So that base point is here. And this morphism just sends this to the sends this to the leftmost pair there x comma t. The next morphism that appears in our fiber product diagram above is t of p m and this also goes down to t of m of course and how is this one given? It sends a fortumple x t u v to the following pair. This time we'll take u here so we get the pair x comma u. We're always taking the base point in each of them. Always taking the base point in each of them. Everything is over m, but we have several different morphisms down to t of m here. Our last one, well, what we're going to do now is define a vertical connection, k, and I have to show you how we can define this. So one really simple way to get a connection here is to just take the remaining coordinate x, v. And so here at this point, well, it becomes. Point, well, it becomes quite easy to verify that this is a fiber product, exhibits T of T of M as a fiber product of these three copies of T of M, in fact, over the base space M. Okay, and this, in fact, is an effective vertical connection. Okay, so that's one example, but there are others as well. are others as well. We can also do the following to get vertical connections on Rn. So more generally, we can consider the map K that sends a for-tuple XTUV to something of the following form. X comma will take that top component V and add a certain vector to it. We'll take something that we'll write in this form. That we'll write in this form another vector where phi sub x is a bilinear map from m times itself. m here is rn, so we can look at bilinear maps. Bilinear map like that. And we want a bilinear map like this given for every x in Rn. So, and we want this to be smooth in x. Be smooth in X as well. So smooth in X. Excellent. So in general, the connections on Rn look like this. And this forms a bridge to classical formulations of connections in this particular case. Okay, I'd like to show you some further perspectives on connections in 10. Perspectives on connections in tangent categories. So there's a question for you. Yep. Sorry, you said this forms a bridge to the sort of classical theory of connections. Can you say a little bit more about what the relationship is? Yes, absolutely. So each of these phi sub x are supposed to be bilinear maps from Rn times itself to Rn. itself to Rn right so what we could do is we could look at each coordinate these the this is landing in rn so we could actually look at a whole family of bilinear forms landing in r and and so so so then having done that we can express each of these in terms of its matrix representation as an n by n As an n by n matrix. And then we actually, by doing this, we get an n by n by n matrix. And this, the matrix entries are the Christoffel symbols for the connection. Cool, thank you. Great. You're welcome. Okay, so to develop some further perspectives on connection. On connections in tangent categories, suppose we have a list of differential bundles, E1 up to En. So these are bundles over M in our tangent category X. And then we can take the product in the slice category. That's the fiber product over M. So I'll just use this notation that we've been using for our products over M, fiber products. So these are products in the slice category over M. So such a product is equipped with a morphism down to M. And the product here in X over M underlies a differential bundle. We can take fiber products of bundles and get And get bundles. And in fact, it's a byproduct. A byproduct is both a product and a coproduct. And so to introduce some notation for this, what we get is a bundle that is actually a byproduct of the given bundles, byproduct in the additive category of differential bundles. Of differential bundles over m. It's an additive category, so finite products are byproducts, they're both coproducts and products. And another thing we'll do, which is less standard, is that for each i, what we'll do is we can look at the projection from this product down to the i-th factor. This would be the projection. I'll write it as pi i. And these projections actually they too underlie. Actually, they too underlie bundles. So, this underlies a bundle, a bundle, which I'll introduce a bit of notation here just for the moment for this. So, it's going to be E underlined, but with a little I subscript to the left. And, you know, E is a differential bundle, but over M. Well, now it's going to become a differential bundle over E sub I, which is a new thing. And there's a way of doing And there's a way of doing this, which I'll describe in a moment. And then, when we do this, we call the resulting bundle the ith partial bundle of the ith partial bundle of the byproduct that we're given. So, we're looking at products of differential bundles, and we can get these partial bundles. So, the product actually becomes a bundle over each of Becomes a bundle over each of the factors, which is one interesting thing. Okay, so we'll make use of this. Now, just to indicate how we can do this, well, the construction is actually as follows. We'll take the byproduct of almost all the factors. We'll take the factors E sub J, where J is not equal to that one fixed I index. And that's also a differential bundle over M, but then we have a more. Over M, but then we have a morphism from E sub i to M. And so now we can pull this back to get a bundle over E sub i. And that's that pullback bundle, that's our partial bundle here, as we're calling it. And so we have a Cartesian morphism here indicating that we're taking this bundle and pulling it back along Q sub i. Okay, so this is how we get the I. Okay, so this is how we get the ith partial bundle. So we have several bundles here, the partial bundles. We'll use this terminology in the following theorem. So another theorem that I proved in the paper cited in the abstract is the following. Suppose that we have a differential bundle. So we have our standard notation for it here. We have the projection, fiberwise addition, and zero, and the lift. This is a bundle in our tangent. A bundle in our tangent category. And then here's a way of formulating connections. A connection on E underline is equivalently given by a map. So again, it'll be a map of the form of a vertical connection, but we won't actually mention that concept. That concept in this characterization will formulate the axioms in a different way this time. So, what we'll require is something a bit subtle, but I think it provides a kind of high-level perspective, kind of abstract perspective on what connections do. So, let's see. So, the requirement is that T of E underlies a differential bundle, underlies a byproduct. A byproduct of differential bundles of the following form. So, what we're going to require is that that object T of E is actually the underlying object of a byproduct of differential bundles of the following form. It'll be a byproduct of E and T underline of M, the tangent bundle of M, and then another instance of E here in this very In this very particular order. Okay. So it's a byproduct in the category of differential bundles over M with some further requirements. So as it appears here, we're asking that this object, just a plain object, T of E, that it should underlie some structured object, this differential bundle here that is going to be a byproduct. But we'll stipulate. Product. But we'll stipulate some further things that will actually make this structure carried by TFE uniquely determined by what we've already listed, what we already have given here. The requirements are that the third projection of this byproduct is K. So with third projection, K. So the projection from this bundle out to the third factor, to the third. Third factor to the third factor is going to be K. And secondly, the third injection byproducts have also what we can call injections or coprojections or insertions. And the third of these, which basically takes E and injects that into the byproduct, the third injection is going to be the lift morphism that's given as part of the bundle structure. And then a couple of more steps. And then a couple of more stipulations here. We want the first partial bundle of the byproduct to be T underline of E, the first partial bundle. So here we're making use of that concept that we've introduced. And we know these byproducts of bundles have partial bundles. Here we'd have three partial bundles. And we're actually requiring that the first partial bundle here recover. Partial bundle here recovers the tangent bundle of E. Secondly, the second partial bundle, we're requiring that it be, sorry, yes, that's right, yes, the tangent bundle of E. The second partial bundle will require that it should be T applied to E. We know we can get a bundle also by applying T to E. And so these requirements actually, you know. Actually, you know, these are stipulations about the byproduct here, and we're requiring that T of E underlies a differential bundle that is a byproduct with these properties here. But then it turns out that the differential bundle structure on T of E is uniquely determined by these requirements, uniquely determined by the given data K and lambda and so on. And so on. And so, now, more specifically, it's uniquely determined up to a certain choice of fiber products, but that's quite a subtle sort of further aspect of it, but it's essentially uniquely determined, not only uniquely determined up to isomorphism, but in fact, up to a very strong kind of isomorphism. Isomorphism. Okay, now I wanted to say a few more things about connections in tangent categories. So, one thing here is that once we have this result here, we can ask, you know, here we have something that looks like a vertical connection. Indeed, it's a vertical connection. How do we get the associated horizontal connection? Well, let's look at that. So, the associated horizontal connection It can be obtained from this byproduct structure as well. So in fact, we can take what we might call the induced injection for this byproduct, going from the product of the first two factors, just only take the first two factors and take the injection of this into the byproduct. So we just put Product. So we just put these factors into the first two factors, so to speak, of this threefold byproduct here. Okay, and so that's actually what ends up being the H, and we can recover the horizontal connection H in that way. And so this is, you know, there's actually some intuition that we can gain right from this perspective here that relates to classical perspectives. Classical perspectives on connections because we can think of this part of the byproduct here. So it's, and I mean, of course, it's T of E that underlies this byproduct, the whole byproduct. So it's like T of E is underlying this one here. And we can look at this part of the byproduct. So in effect, part of T of E is this part here. This part here, so to speak, and that's what we can call the horizontal part. We're injecting the horizontal part here into T of E. And so how does this relate to our kind of perspective in terms of line bundles? Well, let's take a look at that with our diagram that we had initially. So we've got our base space m here visualized like this, and then we can visualize Visualize, let's say we visualize E as lying over it like this, and we have for each point here a fiber over it, fiber over X. So here's E, here's the fiber over X, and we're assuming, you know, the way we're visualizing it here, the fiber over X is a one-dimensional vector space. Okay, so we can ask, you know, what. Okay, so we can ask, you know, what's a tangent vector to E here? And what a connection lets us do is it lets us take a tangent vector to E and decompose it as a horizontal part in the direction of the base space, so along the direction of the base space. So I could depict that vector down here as a tangent vector to the original the base space m. So we have So we have a component in the direction of the base space, the horizontal component, and we have a component which we can visualize in the vertical, the vertical direction here, the vertical component. So the horizontal component lies here. I mean, well, effectively, I mean, the tangent vector, sorry, the tangent vector to M lies here. And we have, of course, the thing. Of course, the thing is, this tangent vector to E, it is situated at a point in E. So that's the base point in E, so to speak, which already is an element of E. It's a vector itself in the first component. Second component, we have a tangent vector to M, so in the direction of M, that's considered the horizontal component, and then we have the vertical component here, also another. Component here, also another element of E, a vector in E. Okay, so that is sort of a sketch of some intuition for this, and you know, we can look at specific examples from that perspective. I also wanted to mention some other notions that one can develop in the context of tangent categories using connections. And so, there were various aspects of connections that are explored in the paper by. Explored in the paper by Cockett and Crudwell. So I wanted to mention a few. So we given a vertical connection K. Sorry, it's 646 after, or 346 after I wrap up. Okay, yeah, I'll wrap it up quite quickly. So we can look at the question of whether a connection is flat. And Cockett and Crutwell define this in the following way. We require Way. We require that when we take the following composite of morphisms, which I won't write out the typing exactly, but we can take these two composites and we require that they be equal. And this captures the notion of flat connection. We can also look at also torsion-free affine connections. So this would be the case where E is a connection on the tangent bundle and torsion freeness. And torsion freeness is the requirement that when we take the canonical flip, appropriate component of it and compose with k, we just get k. So we can define these notions in a tangent category. We can look at the covariant derivative induced by a connection, and we can also look at parallel transport. Cockett and Crunt will develop parallel transport with respect to a connection in a tangent category as well. So that brings us to the end of the talk. Does anyone End of the talk. Does anyone have any questions? Thank you. That's a thank Rory. Yeah, any questions, Rory? So maybe I'd like to ask, can we formulate the principle, the connection of principal bundle in that way? Yes, I think we. Yes, I think we can. So I know that Jeff Crutwell has worked on this kind of thing. I personally don't know the details, but Jeff can probably comment on that. But yeah, so that's, yeah, I would refer the question definitely to Jeff. And I mean, how can we, because for a bundle, we can have different connections. So, so like So like, can we in some way to classify this different connection on one bundle? It kind of like some kind of different kinds of decomposition. So, is there some way to classify that? That's a great question. I'm not prepared to answer that question, but perhaps someone. That question, but perhaps someone could okay. So, I did some work on trying to do connections on sort of more general types of bundles, maybe even just fiber bundles as well. There's some stuff in a talk I can put in the link in the chat. I haven't written a paper on it yet, but because there's still a question of sort of curvature for these connections. For these connections, which I didn't really understand. So I've got a talk anyways, which I'll put in the chat if you're curious about sort of connections on more general types of bundles. I think I saw Rick's hand was up earlier, but then you took it down. Did you have a question, Rick? No, I was just applauding. Cool. Looks like Tom Goodwill has a question. Tom, you're muted, I think. Tom, you're muted, I think. So this question of how to understand, think about all the connections on a given bundle. Of course, in the world of smooth manifolds, the connections on a given vector bundle form an affine space. I mean, it's right. I mean, the difference between two connections on the same bundle, the difference between the covariant. Difference between ovariant derivatives is a one-form, it's a section of another bundle, right? It's sort of a cotangent field with values in the given vector bundle. So there's this vector space of all such fields and the connections form a sort of affine space whose underlying vector space is that one, if you want to put it that way. I wondered if you've seen anything like that in. Seen anything like that in your world? No, I haven't. I mean, we, yeah, because I think that like I don't recall really looking at sort of like the totality of connections on a given differential bundle and that we, yeah, no, I haven't investigated this kind of thing. So thanks for mentioning that. A question from Marcelo. I was wondering, so for a differential bundle, we are asking for the existence of a kind of a lift. Is there any attempt to add also a kind of flip for a differential bundle also or not? Yeah, that's that's. not yeah that's that's a good question i think um so i this really this is really addressed by um work of um um um matthew burke and uh ben macadam because they they look at um what they call um so um i'm trying oh yes involution algebraids in tan Involution algebraids in tangent categories. And so these are kind of like bundles that have a given flip. So Ben, would you like to comment on that? Yeah, it's once once you have a flip and it's coherent, satisfying a list of axioms, if you know what a Li algebra is. Is that's that's kind of how you would, I mean, how they would classically in differential geometry axiomatize a flip. And then you would get, if you had a connection on your bundle, you would get like a notion of torsion and curvature. I think you get curvature on a differential bundle, though. Jeff or Rory might know that, or on just a So that on just a differential bundle, you have a notion of curvature, which Cockett and Krudwell call abstract curvature, and it's a map in the category. Yeah. Does that answer your question? Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. I was wondering, my question was related to the existence of torsion, because so far we had just defined torsion only for S only. only for a only for um a fine connection it's only for the the usual tangential channels so yeah and uh may i may i ask you please if you can add uh into the chat a link of this uh of this reference could you please oh uh sure thank you very much thank you thank you so much for the answer and brace has a question hi rory um is the category Is the category of differential bundles a tangent category as well? Differential bundles over M, let's say? If you like. Yes, so I don't think I know for sure, but I think that the answer is probably yes. And I think that there are some abstract perspectives on this kind of thing that Ben McAdam. Kind of thing that Ben McAdam can probably provide because I think that some of these structures can be described in certain categorically convenient ways that make it sort of more readily apparent that they would form tangent categories. But I can't definitively answer that question right now. I would welcome anyone to contribute to that. welcome anyone to contribute to that.
