Okay, uh, okay, uh, so good evening, everyone, or good afternoon, or good morning. And let's start a second day's section. The first talk of today is Professor, I should call Harachi, right? Yes, University of Tokyo. He will talk about the normal form for solar. form for solar hermition structure and the cellular kernel let's welcome you can go you go you can go okay so let me start by thank this organizer for giving me generous 15 minutes okay so it's after dinner in tokyo so the background is not real this virtual so it's my office i'm now at a living I'm now at the living room in my home. So, today I'm using a new application for the iPad. One of the graduate students to UTOKO make this. So, this is my first try. So, I hope it doesn't freeze. So, actually, I'm not writing, I'm recording this. So, everything goes three times faster than what I did. So, suppose omega is a strict shadow convex domain CN. So, n is always the dimension. n is always the dimension then suppose this is defined by a function rho the positive part is inside and suppose this is infinity so smooth then the first one show that the bergerman corner for the stoichior corbecks domain has such an expansion so rho is a smooth defining function phi and psi are smooth function up to apply a smooth function up to the boundary. So it's completely determined the type of singularity. So then the question is what are the these coefficients p and psi? What kinds of geometric property you can read from this? So the one question it's everyone will think about is the Ramadanov conjecture. He said if the long-term If the low term vanishes, then it should be the ball. So the only example we know for the strict shadow convex domain is the ball. So in that case, there's no log term. So no one ever calculates Begum can with log term. So it's an easy guess. So then when n equals 2, this is true. So Robin Graham. So Robin Graham proved it more than 30 years ago. So when I was a graduate student. So I will give a precise statement later. Then today I want to generate this to the ZGA kernel. So it's a little bit different and contains more information of the boundary. So, Robin's idea is to use Pfefferman's parabolic invariance theory. So, this is a very big theory, but what Robin did is quite explicit. In dimension two, you can really compute this log term to some order. Then, the kernel is Is a little bit different because you need to choose a contact form on the boundary to define the current function. I will give a definition in the next page. So in this case, you have to consider normal form for Sudo contact form, that's I call Shudoa Harmitian structure, and also use Pfeffermann's inbearance theory. So we have to combine these two, get some results on the Zieger count. two get some result on the zigger kernel so so long term of the i can skip so analysis of the bergeman cannot relate to the deformation complex for the shear structure and for the log term of the zega kernel you have to consider the roman complex so So these two complexes are similar and both known as a BGG complex for the shear structure. So all the argument I'll give later is quite parallel because you have the same thing in the background. So just let me write down the expansion of the Z kernel and compare with the Bergman kernel. Compare with the Bergman kernel. So this is the Bergman kernel. The Zke kernel looks quite similar. The only difference is this exponent. The Bergmann has minus and minus one order and the Zan has one weaker. So the coefficients are smooth up to the boundary and this is different from the one appearing the Bergman cannot. Okay. Okay. Now let me recall the definition of the kernel function quickly so I can go quickly just tapping. Okay, so always script always a homic function coming from OCA. Then A2 means L2 homic function. So this is a Hubert space. So closed subspace of usual L2 space. So I use Space. So I use, so this is the domain Cn plus C N. So you have a rubberic measure to define L2. Then take orthonormal basis. So it's infinite. Then sum up the norm, squared norm. It converges uniformly in size and give a smooth function and has singularity when the boundary is trickish convex. The boundary is Twickish convex, it has a Fiffermann type expansion. So it is an independent choice of the orthonormal basis, and you always get the same function. And if you have two domains which are biholomorphic, the current function are not the same. But if you put this volume form, this form is This form is biohomo invariant. So, here provoked boring form, we have the same thing. So, in this sense, Bergman can is a biohomo invariant. So, this is a basic object to study, and you can make Bergmann metric out of it. So, the zone is slightly different. You have to start with choosing a measure on the boundary. So, this is not coming from the shear abstract. You have to choose one. Then comes the L2. Choose one. Then comes the L2 function, which is smooth. Ah, no, no, which is homophobic inside. This is a very bad notation because there's no intersection of these two sets. This means so homogenic function with normal L2 boundary. Okay. So usual notation. So then take orthonormal basis. Then take orthonormal basis for this space. So, this is a function on the boundary, but also has a holomorphic extension to the inside. Then, sum up the norm. Then, you again get the smooth function. And so, today I'm working on the stoichioconvex surfaces. I can always choose contact form coming. Contact form coming from defining function and apply D and which and again, which will see the this should be the volume form, non-vanishing top order form. So I use this. So always fix contact form theta and then choose measure coming from that. So the z kernel depends on shear structure on the boundary that's determined the homology. The boundary that's the term in the homo function, and theta gives the L2 inner product. So, skip. So, let's just write S C the to emphasize that the Sega current depends on the contact form. Okay, then if you choose to change contact form by a multiple of E to Multipool of E2 pre-harmonic function, that means the linear part of harmonic function inside and which is smooth up to the boundary, then you have such a nice transformation rule. So in general, we don't have such a conformal invariance, but for the pre-harmonic function, you get nice transformation rule. So we can say that the Ziggy kernel is invariant under pre-harmonic scaling. So you have to Harmonic scaling. So you have to consider conformal geometry and the pre-harmonic function, not with respect to the smooth function. Okay. Now let me state the Lobbin's theorem on the Amadanov conjecture. So he proved the local version of it, which is in a sense stronger. So the Bergman candle has this type of expansion. Then Then pick a point on the boundary and suppose that the logoterm batch at a point near a point, not globally, then it should be spherical near the point. So this is a local version. Okay, so if you take up spherical means the boundary point can be sent to a boundary point of the ball. To a boundary point of the ball, and the inside near P is mapped into the inside of the ball. So the boundary is sent to the sphere, so we call it spherical. This is a flat model for the shear of geometry. Strict should look on the shear of geometry. Okay, then the theorem of Rami Gram with some results announced. There is the Dan Burns and the Potato Mombe and myself. Dedombe and myself. So, some parts are missing in the first paper. So, combine these, you get a seven. So, that means when n equals two, this is two dimensions, that's crucial, and the robot term vanish to the second order, then the boundary should be spak out near the boundary. So, this is an optimal result in this case. In this case, so all y is nothing not sufficient. This is exactly the order we need. So, for higher dimension, there are counter-example. Okay, so I'm not too interested in the counter-example today, so let me just go quickly. So, Engris and Chan computed the Berguman Khan. Is a Begelman karner for a disk bundle of a complex manifold. Actually, this is just a Grassmann manifold, homogeneous Grassman. So you have a homogeneous bundle and there's a disk bundle. And for that case, you can really compute the Begum kernel. And it has no rogue term. It's quite explicit. And you can also show that the boundary is not spherical. So you have a logical example. So you have a local example with no long-term Begelman panel. This is not a counter-example to the Lamadanov conjecture because this omega is not contained in a Cn or this is not. So it it contains compact trivia complex manifold things like Be a complex mindful style, but this is not a counter example, but counter example for the local conjecture. So, so this is, in a sense, good news for me because you cannot do this. So, consider, you should not consider local rather amount of conjecture by computing explicit the log term. That's too difficult. Okay, so now let me turn to the ziege, okay? Yes. Okay. So n equals 2. Again, there's a counterexample. So this is classical. 1960 should be in Russian and this year should be the translation is this year. So suppose you have such a tube domain in C2. So this is simple. Is simple so this is a strictly convex, so this is a tube domain strict shadow convex. So, in this case, you can choose such a defining function, then pick a contact form, then the jagger counter expressly given. Yeah, that's all, so no longer. That's all. So, no long term. And also, the boundary is not, this is homogeneous, query, not spherical. So you have to compute the curvature for this. But in this case, the Bergman cannot have log term. So I can show that the Bergman can have negative log term in it everywhere. Everywhere. So, this is not bounded. So this may not be a global counter example to the Lamadado conjecture. But you can localize it. So the Carnegie function can be localized. So if you choose a bounded domain which share a boundary, then Then again, the log term banish. So, local barge on Lamadan conjecture is not true. Okay. But global results hold. So this is my old results when I was a graduate student. Essentially, this is my first paper. Suppose the boundary has transversal symmetry, so you have Has transverse or symmetry, so you have a SN action. Then if the log term of the digital kind of vanish to the third order everywhere on the boundary, then the boundary is fake out. This is a global result. It doesn't contradict with the Fuchs result because this tube domain is not bounded. So it has an infinity, may have some problems. May have some problem. And it is improved by the Yuya Takeuchi. He is a former student of mine, so published last year. He showed that a shear panet operator in two dimensions has kernel, which is exactly the pre-harmonic function for the embedded shear manifolds. So using that, he can omit. Omit this unnecessary assumption. So this is the final version. So for C2, the Ramadan's conjecture is true. But still, the Hooke's example is quite mysterious. What's going on here? So that's the main part of this talk. Okay, so now we have two log terms: Bergmann Carner and Zegelkan. Here I B and S for the Bergman-Ziegelkan, but maybe later I use theta for here. I will change this notation later. Sorry. So the boundary value of the Bergman can is also called the obstruction function. So I will. function. So I will explain later what this means. So for the first example, this obstruction, the log term of the Begamarka is negative. So we have to exclude this to show some version of the Ramadan conjecture. So this is my theorem I'm studying today. So here I'm changing notation. And change notation. This is the log term of the ZG kernel depending on theta. Suppose you have the log term of the Z kernel vanish to third order, one or the higher than the one given by the lobbying. So then two case, one of the two cases happen. The boundary is vertical or obstruction. All obstruction is negative. So I have to exclude this. But this is the only case we have to exclude. More precisely. So if Logan Barnes is the first of the this is just a Q curvature. So Q curvature appears in the Paul Xian's talk last night. Last night. So it's the same thing, but I'll give a definition in the next page. And if the log term banch is the second order and the logitum of the Beggar colour is non-negative, then this should be Schudo-Einstein. I will also give a definition in the next page. Then the balance to the third order with this condition gives the spherical. So I have three steps. So I have three steps. So and to two terminology, what is shouldowine stand, what is Q curvature, and also what is obstruction. I have to recall this. So this is coming from complex Mon Jumper equation. So this is basically the parabolic invariance theory. Parabolic invariance theory referring is set up. So consider following Mon-Jamper equation on the domain omega. So the equation holds on inside and the boundary is at R is a defining function. At least I can assume this is G2 and the indices means partial derivative in holomorphic and anti-homomorphic direction. So then this equation has unique solution. Unique solution, which is 3C2, but not smooth at the boundary, and you have such kinds of expansion. Again, the coefficients are smooth. So the existence of solution is proved by Cheng and Yao, and Li and Meiros prove this asymptotic expansion. So, the first log term is called obstruction because this is again a serum by lobbing gram. So, if obstruction vanish at the boundary, all other logoton, all the log term vanish, so it becomes smooth. So, O is the only obstruction. The only obstruction for the smoothness of the fruition. Okay, so that's a name for the obstruction. Now, so the Montgomery equation is just an Einstein equation. So if you have a solution, apply login, apply db bar, and the negative that is the Einstein-Kera metric. So this is a bi-homo invariant. This is a biohomo invariant, so I use this rater. So now I can define Schido-Einstein structure. So from the Chenyl solution, you can define one contact form. Then you can scale this by some three-harmonic function. This is called Schudo-Einstein. This is a nice choice. Is called Schudo Einstein. This is a nice choice of context form. So here's a typo. So this should be three. So his dimension is three. Then this should Einstein mean the wave stack rich curvature is proportional to the raviform. So that means Einstein. So the name comes from here. So this is a terminology of Jacques Lee. He defined Shido-Einstein condition only for the n equals. Condition only for the n equals greater than three. But now people use this for the because this definition holds for any dimension. Now it is also called Schider-Einstein even for n equals two. So this is just a historical reason. Doesn't make sense. So what is the Q curvature? So for the Shear case, the definition is quite easy because you have a good contact form that should Contact form, that is Schudo-Einstein contact form, then with respect to a choice, you pick a scaling factor. So this is a Schider-Einstein. Given any contact one, you can choose a scaling factor, which is just smooth, may not be pre-harmonic. Then extend U to the inside by solving this Dirker problem. Now this G is Einstein care and Einstein care and is complete, it degenerates at the boundary, so the regularity doesn't hold. So even if the boundary value is smooth, it may not be smooth. Again, you have a log term. So Q, let me call this log term Q. So Q is a function. So, Q is a function defined inside and smooth up to the boundary. So, this is a Q. So, it really looks like this expansion. And O is the first log term coefficient. And Q is the first log term coefficient. This doing the almost same thing. The higher log term coming from the non-linearity. So, if you linearize, you are almost doing the same thing here. Okay, so. Here. Okay, so let me call Q on the boundary the Q curvature for this contact form. So by this definition, it is clear that for the Schudo-Einstein contact form, Q is zero. This is the definition. Okay, another important thing is if the boundary value of Q vanish, then it vanish. Then it banishes by solving this equation. So it's similar to this case. If the boundary value of the obstruction eta1 vanish, then it vanished to the infinite order. So the boundary value is important. The boundary value determines all the jet. Okay, so now I have all the definitions. So, curvature expression. So, the definition I've given is quite easy, but you can also give a differential geometric definition using curvature. I don't have to use this today, but maybe people familiar with this, it is better to have some formula for them. So, contact formula. Contact form is a levy form on the CR bundle, and there's a natural metric connection, which is not torsion-free, but you can have connection form or connection form and curvature and torsion. Okay, then so n equals to shear tangent bundle is one dimensional, so the curvature itself is scalar, and the index is just one, always one dimension, so only. One, always one dimension, so only have one. So apply derivative once and take a divergence subtortion. That's W1. Then Schudo-Einstein condition is given by the vanishing of this curvature expression. So it doesn't look like an Einstein equation, but this is coming from the characterization I've given. So Q is just a divergence of Just a divergence of W1. So if you compute the X P, this is a sub-replace applied to curvature minus some torsion term. So this is a curvature expression for the Q curvature. Now I have to define curvature for the shear structure. So just for n equal to, which is easier. So this is a classical result of Mosul. Mozzle for a given boundary point, you can choose a coordinates such that the point P is the origin for the new coordinate. And if you take a layer on the imaginary part, the boundary is locally given by a graph. So Z square is a Levy form. And these coefficients are, these are just complex numbers, should be Hermitian in June. J and it should have Hermitian symmetry, and these coefficients can be normalized to be zero. And it converges when the boundary is real analytic. And if the boundary is smooth, it's just a form of power series, but still it has meaning as a curvature. Okay, so it's worth writing down the Down the diagram for the which parts vanish. So J and K, and this box is zero. So the important thing is here. The lowest order term is the Carlton tensor. And this is the obstruction. So O is some constant, positive constant multiple of the A440. A four four zero. So when you compute the O in this coordinate, it's given by this. The constant is some expression number. And A is called Caltanka. And if at each point you compute this and it vanishes, then it should be spherical. So this is the most important curvature information of the shear structure. Structure. Then I can explain how Lobby improved the Lamadanov conjecture. So, what he did is write down the log term of Bergoman Carnell as a leading term is obstruction of the Mon-Jumper equation. So, let me write the expansion to the input. Write the expansion to the inside. So this should be the eta one, but I'm only using the O also for the extension to the inside. And then, so you have these extension to the inside. So the substrate these two, it binds to the first order and the coefficient should be the this Carotan tensor square norm and higher order. So and these two coefficients are not Two coefficients are not zero. So I know the numbers, but it's not important here. The signature is not important here. So if you banish the second order or banish, then obstruction banish identically, then banishing the oxygen to the second order forces this coefficient to vanish. Coefficient to vanish. So it is fake out. This is the argument. Oh, it's not nice. Okay. So long time of the Zigger kernel. So I see that is also so the zigga colour. So, the Ziggy kernel has transformation rule and the pre-harmonic scaling. So, the log term also has the same property. By using this, you can apply Fehmann's parabolic invariant theory and determine the expansion. But in this case, you have to make a normal form for the contact form, modular pre-harmonic scaling. So, the pre-harmonic scaling is important. So, the pre-harmonic scaling is important. So, suppose the omega is already given more than normal form and you choose a Mon-Jambay resolution. So, this is a from the coordinate, you have such a choice of Schudo-Einstein contact form, and there's a scaling factor, which is just smooth. Now, we normalize this by adding or subtracting pre-harmonic function, then the best possible is this. Best possible is this. So you can kill pure homophobic part and anti-homoric part. These are pre-harmonic. Also, you can kill this one, one part. So this case is easier, much easier than the more the normal form. So you only have one coefficient banished. Then these are leading terms. And this is in the middle. And this is in the middle on the diagonal. So in this case, the leading term is a W1 I've defined. So this character is Schudo-Einstein structure. And B22, the diagonal leading term is the Q. This is a divergence of W1. So this gives the expression of the log term of the ZGA command in two dimensions. Z camera in two dimensions. So now the leading time is not obstruction, leading term is Q. So I have a Q here, and then obstruction appears again here. And here is a leading term B and then higher order. The important thing is the leading term, this is non-zero, and I know the number. C1, C2 has. C1 C2 has the same sign. I haven't computed it yet, but from the Fox example, I can tell that this is the same signature. Then I can do this argument. Suppose the logitone banished to this first order, a second order, then Q should vanish to the first order, then Q should vanish identically. Should vanish identically. So the top term just goes. Then the second term, this should vanish because this is just zero. Then if all is positive and this has same sign, that forces this to be zero. Or this is negative. So, in the Fox example, O is not zero, but O is not zero, but the issues cancel with this. So, again, the contact form appear in Fox example is not pseudo-Einstein. Okay, here's some detail of what I said. Okay, so Banish. So if B two and Banish, then Zitai is Schudo Einstein. For the Schudo Einstein contact structures, you can apply Shear version of invariant theory and write again that the log term of the zigga kernels. term of the zg kernels is in this form so the leading term and the second term vanish and then comes row to the two and this is a curtain tensor and higher order and this is three is not zero so it's banished to the third order checkout contents are banished and you have a spherical surface okay it's a little bit complicated It's a little bit complicated, but we can really write down all the curvature expressions for the zero kind to this order. Oh, this is about remain complex stated in the beginning. Okay, so this looks like a This looks like the composition of drum complex. So E is just a function, real value of the function. Then you have a D V and D bar B going to the one form, but when N equals 2, this is just a line bundle. So it's again E1 is just a complex variable function. So this is first order, first order, and these are adjoint. And here comes And here comes a second-order operator. It looks like a sub-lapless. And all the operators appear in here turns out to be CR invariant. So I should have put some weight here to make it really CR invariant, but this is the complete diagram of invariant differential operator between. Differential operator between this irreducible bundle for the sphere, three-sphere, and can be generated to the three-dimensional shear manifold. The important thing is that any composition give the same operator, which is called P. This is a fourth-order operator because it's the first, second, first. So, this is a fourth-order operator. So, this P appears in the transformation rule of Q. the transformation rule of Q and that is used in the global theorem and so for the contact form to the W1 this is the first derivative of scalar curvature this is a third order operator it's correspond to this composition with the scaling to the one tensor is then take divergence Then take divergence. So the scaling factor to the q car budget, the fourth order operator. And if you scale q, you get this p, this fourth order. It makes sense. So this is for the lumin complex. And I have used this w and q in the expression of the zigger colour. And for the Belderman colour, what we get is A2 A420 in the Mozan normal form coefficient. That's coming from a deformation complex. Deformation complex, again, starts with real value function to the, this is a symmetric product of this space. But again, this is Lyme Bandals. This is just a complex value function. But the difference is a second order derivative, this one, one derivative. And again, here you have a And again, here you have a fourth-order operator, and it should be adjoint. Now you have second, fourth, second, so it's a sixth order operator from here to here. That you call supercritical GJMS operator. So, and here, the important thing is that this corresponds to the defining function. So, this curvature term is a six derivative. six derivative because a four two means four times form of derivative and two times six underscore derivative so the six order derivative and then double divergence of a2 a42 gives a44 that's obstruction so from the point of view of this complex a42 appear here and obstruction appears here it's it's really powerful to Here it's really powerful to this setting of W1 here and Q here. That's again appearing in the log term of the Z corner and the Beggarman corner. So, the question, natural question, are there any other complex we can use to give some curvature or geometric structure? Okay, ah, oh, I have written this. This is sixth order. I already explained this. Okay, second order. Okay, second order. In general, so k means k density. So first apply k plus one derivative and take adjoint or the k plus one, k minus one, and this is two k plus two. So for for shear manifold, there is a such complex of the invariant differential operator, which is shear. invariant differential operator, which is shear invariant for given k integers. So k equals zero, k equals zero is the remaining complex, Riemann complex, and k equals one is the deformation complex. So there's a series of such complex. I believe for maybe k equal to two should some meaning and we should have some curvature expression corresponding to this operator and some This operator and some obstruction or Q curvature corresponds to this long operator. So that's a long time goal for me. So I've been thinking, but still no good idea for this. Okay. So differential operators already said that. So these are called. Already said so, these are called BGG Bernstein Gerfant Gerfant complex, and this is a machinery creating producing such a complex, and it should have some geometric meaning. But I don't know how to apply this to the serial geometry. The last slide, okay, already said. The last slide is Alimak about the global Ramadan of conjugate. About the global Ramadan of conjecture. So if you consider globally, the situation is a little bit different. Just consider banishing to the first order. A few years ago, Sean Curry and Peter Ebenfeld showed that for the domain close to the ball, if it banished to the first order, it is all First order, it's already ball. So you don't need second order vanishing like a local version. So this is just an obstruction. So obstruction flat already means this is a ball. So you don't have to look at this higher jet. So this is also true, and they prove this for a little more general setting, but not fully general. So this is still mysterious. So what are the observed? So, what are the obstruction flat shared manifolds? For higher dimension, so I claim to prove this. The same is true for the ball, domain near the ball, but still in preparation. So there's some reason. There are so many things which actually it's not been proved. It's not been proved. So, the problem. Brandon Dushen announced some slice theorem for the shear structure on the ball, but the proof is not published. And actually, it's not proved in the way they stated. So, I have to really give the proof. It takes some time. So, but I think this is okay. So, I can finish the paper in near future in few months. Future in few months. Okay. Okay, that's all. That's the end of the story. Thank you for attention. Okay. Any questions? Thanks. Can you hear me? Yes. We know we have a Q plane curvature, right? A Q plane. Acute plan does Q plan character play a role in your yeah that's a very good question yeah Q prime yes Q primes I've been thinking that's a very good question I have no answer So far, we don't know any law. So, Q prime is not invariant under the scaling by preharmonic function because transformation rule for Q prime is a P prime operator. The kernel of P prime is not preharmonic. So, it's different from the Zigger kernel, which is much more difficult, and maybe that's more. And maybe that's more globally defined object. Yeah, but the integral of q prime is invariant. Yeah, yes. That's again good point. So for the zigger kernel, so if you integrate log term, you always get zero. It's like a q curvature. So integral is invariant, but always give zero. So if since q banning, if q banish. If Q banished, it should be reasonable to define Q prime from the ziggy corner, but I don't know how to do this. I have a related question. So what are the nice nonlinear PDE that you can construct out of this rooming complex? Complex not at all. I see non-linear PDE I never thought in that way because linear version is easier because we have easier easier problem why I have to consider a difficult one. So yeah, maybe. Maybe. So, my definition of this queue is not so nice because I have to pick one reference contact form and then choose scaling. So, if you don't want to do that, you may have to use non-linear PDE. Yeah, just mixing up Mon Jam Pero and the Dirker problem, but which makes problem difficult. I have no good answer to your question, but it should be interesting. Okay. Yeah, go ahead. Question. Yeah. Yep. So, Kango. Robbing. Yeah. So, two questions. One is. Questions. One is I dismissed something in one of your arguments. So, in the argument in your main theorem, you have this linear combination of the B squared and the O. And then there were two cases. One is where they both vanish. And then you gave the argument for the B squared. And the other one is what if the O is less than zero? Yes. Yeah, so is there some argument you have to what's the argument for that case? Okay, so here oh so the sign sign of these two coefficients should be the same. Yeah, so this is always positive. Suppose both both positive. Okay, so this is always positive. So try if you want to make this zero. If you want to make this zero, it should be negative. That case is this. Otherwise, both should be zero. Right. But then you gave the argument below if b squared is zero, then you completed the argument. But what about the other case when O is less than zero? Yeah, that's end. There's no spherical condition. No, no spherical condition. Oh, I see. That's right. Oh, that was the end. That's the end. Right. Yeah, this is disappointing. Yeah, I see. I see. Yeah. For this case, I don't know how to deal with. So this is a example. I see. I forgot the statement of the theorem. Yeah, so this is disappointing. I see. I see. Okay. And then one other question, just to make sure I'm clear. So, in the result of Takeuchi that you stated, that's. Yeah. That's that's for so this is uh for the Sega kernel Yes Okay, going back to the yeah so this is this is for any contact form is that right yes but uh banishing of banishing of logutan forces Sita to be pseudo einstein. Seta to be pseudo-Einstein. I see. Yeah. So if the so what Takeochi proved that if logoton banished of a Q vanishes, then it should be Schudo-Einstein. That's his theorem. I see. And then and then and okay. Q franc means Schudo Einstein. Okay. For this case. I see. Yeah, this is not true for the non. This is not true for the non-imbedable case. It should be a difficult question. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Any further questions?
