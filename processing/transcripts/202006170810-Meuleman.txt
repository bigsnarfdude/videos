Okay, great, thank you. So, yes, my name is Walter, and I'm going to talk about our efforts on analyzing large numbers of DNA-seq data sets. And hopefully, this is going to start a discussion on how these data can be used as a scaffold for integration of other data types, such as signal cell data. All right. Alright, so I'm going to start here by change that. Let's see. Everybody should be familiar with this picture of chromatin packed in a cell nucleus. And the objective that we have here in DNA-seq is to basically find these regions of open chromatin. And these regions of open chromatin are regions that are not protected by any kind of nucleosomal structure where the DNA is tightly wrapped around histamine. The DNA is tightly wrapped around tastelinoptomers, but instead they're accessible for other sort of DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors to bind. And so, what we do in the lab to identify these regions is use DNA-1, enzyme that is basically very good at cleaving naked DNA. So, whenever DNAs encounters unprotected or accessible DNA, it'll cut it. So, the result of this is hundreds of millions of these DNAs hold fragments, and we use paradigm sequencing to sequence. And we use paradigm sequencing to sequence these fragments, and we map the five fragments to the genome. And then you get a picture kind of like this that should be familiar, sort of a familiar look and feel to most people, where you have regions that are a very low read count, meaning that they are essentially protected by these nucleosomal structures and not accessible. And then there's regions where you have huge numbers of piled up reads, indicating that these regions are accessible. And so these accessible regions, we call them DNS-1 hypersensitive sites. Them DNS-1 hypersensitive sites or DHSs. And these have been sort of the gold standard for chromatin accessibility for more than 40 years now. So, one of the challenges in these kind of regulatory genomics analyses is that there's no real good common coordinate system, let alone any kind of useful and interpretable annotations. So, for instance, if you look at RNA expression data sets, then you always have the huge convenience of being able to map this back to sort of known gene annotations, which each have their own unique identity. Have their own unique identifiers and additional annotations. No such thing really exists for regulatory genomics. And I think if we would have such a thing, that would really open up the opportunity for integration of complementary essay data, and in particular, single-cell data, which is often too sparse to even do something like de novo peak detection of. And so moving on from that single erythroid cell type I showed you. Erectroid cell type I showed you, we now scaled things up considerably by performing DNA-seq across more than 700 different biosamples, spanning more than 400 different human cell types and states. And I'm just going to show you a very small subset of samples here. This is just a number of biosamples from the hematoietic lineage for a very small, only about 50 kB region of the human genome. And what you'll be able to see here is that there's already a huge. Be able to see here is that there's already a huge variation in possible patterns of these DHSs occurring across cell types. So, here you have a DHS that shows up across all or nearly all shown cell types, whereas this one is restricted to the erythroid lineage and other ones might be completely exclusive to an individual bio sample. So, this is kind of where the problem of a common coordinate system comes in, where if we assume that each of these is essentially an These is essentially an imperfect guess of where the actual region of hypersensitivity is. Then, what we can do is we can exploit the fact that we have so much data to try and come up with a more precise delineation of where the region of accessibility is. And the way we do that is we simply call these sort of accessibility peaks along with their summit positions across all data sets. So, we have more than 75 million of these. And we just project them down onto the genomic axis, after which we Axis, after which we delineate their start and end positions using a terminology from mostly used in physics and actually a lot in proteomics as well, called full-width hat maximum. And this gives us a start and end position that is supported by at least half of all the full delineations across all the data sets in which we found the peak. So in this way, we identify no less than 3.5 million of these DHS delineations. These DHS delineations that not just have a start and an end position, but also have an estimate of the center of mass or the centroid of these elements, as well as an indication of the positional variability of these regions. We also have, I think, kind of a cool unique identifier for these things that is actually interpretable. Feel free to ask me about this later. So now, of course, this works for the clean case. Works for the clean cases, as you would expect. These things are delineated quite nicely, but they also work for these a little more hairy situations where you have VHSs that are either super dispersed or kind of like skewed to different directions. And we're still able to sort of nicely delineate these areas with the difference that the positional variability is much larger, as you would expect. Also for regions such as this one that may appear as a single DNA hypocenter. As a single DNA is hypersensitive site, if you really zoom in, very often these resolve into multiple ones and we're able to resolve these separately. Now, now that we have this sort of common coordinate system of these regions of accessibility, we can build a matrix such as this. This is going to be very familiar in terms of conceptual look and feel to most of you, where we document for all of the 733 data sets, which Three data sets, which of the three and a half million DHSs are accessible or not. And so, one thing you immediately appreciate here is that there's a lot of data around the diagonal, which is what you would expect, right? There's a lot of similar cell types that show similar behavior of DNA accessibility across many DHSs. But you also see a lot of these sort of off-diagonal patterns here where you Patterns here, where you have, like, in more or less related cell types, you have similar DHS patternings showing up, such as here, zoom into this one across a number of epithelial and fibroblast cell type, but also in fetal one, for instance. And so we figured that, you know, in order to try and take a stab at like annotating these three and a half million DHSs, which heretofore have never been really annotated except for whether they are close to a promoter or close to which gene. To which gene. We decided to instead use a decomposition approach. And again, this is something that you've seen many times already before today and in your own work, where we use NMF non-negative matrix factorization to basically reduce the dimensionality of this sort of large matrix from 733 dimensions to only 16 components. I'm happy to talk later about how we chose that number of components. And every component here is. Components. And every component here is represented by a color. And so every DHS is represented by a mixture of these components. So a couple of examples here, you have a DHS that is primarily showing up in this yellow component. Here it is a mixture of two or slightly more components. And on the far other end of the spectrum, you have these DHSs that really show up in pretty much all components. Now, what does that mean, right? Because this is not an annotation. This is not an interpretation of the data yet. It's just a reduction of. It's just a reduction of dimensionality. And so, what I'm showing you here is for every of these components, I'm showing you what sort of the major cell type was or the major data sets corresponding to it. So, just simply the data set with the highest loading for each component. And one thing you can observe is that if you are mostly in one individual component, then you also tend to show up in only one particular sort of cellular context. So, here in this case, this DHS is So, here in this case, this DHS is all in the yellow component and shows up in this placental trophoblast cell type. Here, there is mostly orange DHS that shows up only in these CDA T cells. And then these mixtures start encoding different combinations of occurrences of DHSs across CELTA. So here, there's orange and red, and it shows up in CDAT cells and also in arachloid red blood cells. And again, on the far end of the spectrum, we have these guys that are completely, you know, rainbow. Guys that are completely, you know, rainbow mixture of all these components, and they tend to show up in all or nearly all cell types. And so, this gives us an initial sort of preliminary labeling for each of these components, but we further looked at the enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs in DHSs that are primarily in these components. And that gave us another, these are just the top one scoring ones. So, these are not cherry-picked, but just the very top enriched both. The very top enriched motifs and motif families. And you see that this is also in line with, to a large degree, with the patterning you see here in terms of like you have immune-related factors showing up in these, in these sort of T cell-like component, neural factors in the brain component, and so on and so forth. So, this allowed us to come up with this very likely imperfect, but hopefully useful labeling of these components. And now, to make things a little And now, to make things a little simpler going forward, from now on, I'm just going to talk about the majority component for every DHS. So instead of assigning the full mixture of all these components to each DHS, I'm just going to simplify things and just assign them to their majority components. All right, so they can breathe it there. So now what we have is we have a DHS index that has three and a half million DHSs that are originally annotated and indexed across. That are originally annotated and indexed across cell types, along with their assignment to a component. And so we have a browser for sort of looking at these regions at your own leisure around your genes of interest. Do we need another browser? Well, not really, except that this amount of data seems to be very hard to visualize in something like the UCSC genome browser. Then what we can do with these data is we can start learning something about the regular. We can start learning something about the regulatory landscape of genes. So, for instance, if we look around the GATA-1 gene here, we notice that there's a lot of DHSs in and around the gene that have a similar component annotation. So, here there's a lot of red DHSs, which is the myeloid erythroid component. And that's in line with the central role of GALA-1 in the erythroid lineage. So, we reasoned that this might be something that generalizes. So, what we did is we did essentially test it for over-representation of all these components. Representation of all these components across all Gencode annotated genes. And what we find is that quite often you're able to sort of functionally annotate, or I should be careful with the term functionally annotate, but at least you're able to assign a possible biological sphere of activity for these genes just simply according to their DHS patterning in and around those genes. So, here, for instance, FOXP3 shows up in a lymphoid component. And so, we're able to do this quite. And so we're able to do this quite well for pretty much all components. And these, I'm just showing you here the top five of annotated genes for these protein-coding genes, these various components. But even in particular for transcription factor genes, the subset of protein-coding genes. And here, for instance, look at the cardiac component, and these top five are essentially representing all the main known cardiac lineage specifiers. So that gives you a sense of what the So, that gives you a sense of what the usefulness of these annotations could be. But it turns out that they also very nicely capture trait and disease heritability signals. So if we perform LD score regression with partition heritability, we're able to figure out to what extent these DHS components are capturing heritability, are enriching for heritability in these various traits. And what we see is that, surprisingly, that these DHSs. Surprisingly, that these DHSs do extremely well if you first stratify them based on the component for which they were annotated. So these are the top three baseline annotations for this particular trait, this particular blood trait. And it turns out if you start looking at just the annotated DHSs, the enrichment really shoots up. And this is particularly true, interestingly, for these core regions that I talked about. So this is sort of the core. The sort of core center regions of the DHSs that are capturing 95% of the DHS summits. Really showing that our annotations are really honing in on where the most relevant signal is. Also, interestingly, but I'm going to skip over this for the interest of time, largely, is that we find that a lot of this genetic signal is actually concentrated in these sort of labeled genes. So, for instance, the GATA1 gene has a lot of red. Gene has a lot of red DHSs, and of course, also a very large number of non-red DHSs. But it turns out that a lot of that genetic heritability signal is primarily concentrated in these component concordant DHSs, as opposed to the non-whether the discordant DHSs or other controllable DHSs. I think that's kind of a new way of looking at these GWAS data sets. And now, coming to the last part that's more relevant to what we're talking about. That's more relevant to what we're talking about this week. Is that I think that now that we have this very comprehensive set of annotations, it might be time to start moving from a sort of a discovery era where we try to find these elements to more of a detection era where we now can use unseen orthogonal data sets and see to what extent we can A, sort of project them into this existing space. So, what I'm showing you here is a UMAP plot. For all of the 733 biosamples or data sets that we have. And what I've simply done is I've taken a number of completely unrelated, unseen immune data sets, and I've just projected them into this same NMF immap space. And that seems to work quite well because these all sort of cluster around these already mapped lymphoid component samples. But more interestingly, you don't necessarily need these DHSP calls for this. Need these DHSP calls for this, right? Because remember, you know, for a lot of the single-cell data sets, you don't necessarily have these sort of de novo p calls because the data might simply be too sparse. And it turns out that even without using p-calls, you're actually able to do pretty well in terms of recovering these p-calls just from the raw data using this index. Imagine you have all these three and a half million index elements, and what you can do is you can simply look up what the signal is in your underlying data set. Signal is in your underlying data set, and just treat it as like a classification problem of whether you're able to recover or not these peak calls. And it looks like you're able to do pretty well for this particular trophoblast sample. And interestingly, it's quite specific because this is where the trophoblast sample falls instead of the area under the curve, as opposed to all the other biosamples. And interestingly, if you now look at what the other ones are, the other seven. Are the other 732 samples that are most close to that particular winning trophy glass samples, and they're all sharing similar characteristics. And now to sort of go full circle there, we now take one of these sort of 34 immune samples and we do exactly the same thing. We just pretend we don't have any p-calls for them. And we also look up what their closest matches are. Then we also again find this nice match with this existing CD4 sample. So I think this is. So, I think this sort of really provides a nice scaffold for now taking other data sets, such as single-cell NMT-seq data, or other data sets, and see to what extent you can enrich those data sets by using this DHS annotation. And so, these are the take-home messages. The slides are also going to be available online. These are acknowledgments. Sasha did a lot of the work with me on the NMF decomposition. And these folks generated the data over many, many years. There is a paper pre-printed available with most of these things that I showed: UCSC browser, as well as our new index browser. And then all the data and as well as the associated code is available as well. Thanks. Thank you, Auto. And so I think a lot of us are very appreciative of all the visualization that you created for your major. That you created for your matrix factorization results. There was some comments discussion about how you select the 16 components, what you recommend for DHS data, and that Aiden was also saying 16 components seems quite low for something that complex. Yeah, it is. And so, I mean, this is always the classic thing, right? It's a trade-off between how much of the complexity do you want to capture, how interpretable do you want things to be. How interpretable do you want things to be? And so, so we did it. We did a lot of work on trying to figure out what that number should be. And in the paper, we outline exactly how we did this. We have metrics that are purely objective in terms of, for instance, as you add more components, to what extent does the F1 score change? And at what point do you see that it doesn't really make sense to add additional components? But also, from an interpretation point of view, at some point you really start seeing very meaningful splits in terms of. Very meaningful splits in terms of, for instance, the hemotopiatic system splitting up into myeloid versus lymphoid, right? And that would be a meaningful thing to capture. But I think more importantly, in terms of the presumably lone number of components, I totally agree, except the number of combinations is, of course, nearly infinite, right? So the number of possible mixtures you get with these things is still a very, very rich representation. And that's actually something I wasn't able to show today because of time. Show today because of time, but if you look at sort of a differentiation trajectory, right, if you look at CD34 hemosphere stem cells all the way to other sort of either erythroid, myeloid, or lymphoid cell types, you see that it's particularly these mixtures of myeloid versus lymphoid that are relatively changing over time or over time through differentiation. And so I think there's a lot more information captured in those mixtures that we haven't even touched upon here in this work. Here in this work. And if you are interested in that, then again, all the raw data, the matrices, but also these sort of decomposition matrices with the full spectra of all the components is all available here. Okay, maybe we just take the last question from Emrit, which is what is the framework you're using for the web app? And how do you maintain speed, performance when you display such large data sets? Yeah, so that's the only reason why we actually made this browser because they're finally Actually, made this browser because there finally became something available that was able to do this. Because none of the existing browsers really met our criteria there, because it's just not a pleasure to browse, right? Like if you're in a certain browser, you have to say like zoom out 10, you have to wait a minute, and then it just doesn't become a way of actually exploring the data. And so there's this thing that came out called HighGlass, which is actually used for browsing high C matrices. So these huge like chromatin interaction data matrices. Data matrices. And so we have repurposed this browser framework to be able to accommodate this. So you can actually, you're basically ingesting the data at different scale levels. And therefore, you do a lot of pre-computation. And then you can sort of seamlessly zoom in and out of the genomes. It's quite nice. Thank you very much for your talk. And I would like to congratulate all the speakers.
