Tell us about the lo Romenikovsky inequality and local period. Okay. First of all, thank you to the organizers for inviting me to this very wonderful and very cold place. I'll also talk about log VMs. I'll specifically concentrate on how you get from local log VM, which already Galena talked about, to global log VM, which there are now two very, very different There are now two very, very different approaches as to how to do so. Okay, so I'll again go over the log VM inequality. I'll mention some alternative formulations, specifically the ones which arise in actually proving the local to global. And then I'll hopefully have a lot of time to talk about how you go from local Lagdian to global Lagdian. Okay, so we have Um okay, so we have Run Minkowski. We can you know think of this, uh think of Romankovsky as interpolation between two convex bodies, as Guling already talked about. And we think of the Minkowski sum as really deriving from the Minkowski sum of, or just the sum really, the weighted average of the support functions. And already over 50 years ago, And already over 50 years ago, yes, the equality condition is going to be important later. Already 50 years ago, Fairi decided, you know, discovered that we could talk about other ways to sum convex bodies. So if you take the support functions and sum them in a sort of LP fashion, or take their weighted average in this LP fashion, then you also get Then you also get an inequality, and this turns out to actually be a convex function, if p is greater than or equal to 1. If p is less than 1, then, well, we have the BLYZ conjecture from 2012, although Galina said 2011, which, hmm? What? What? Okay, I don't know what the correct year is. And this applies only to centrally symmetric convex bodies. The sum is the same sum, but the meaning of this sum is actually becomes rather different because all of a sudden, this is no longer a convex function. So this is not actually the support function of this Pean-Minkowski sum. This is called. This thing is called the wolf shape of a function. Just taking the intersection of all the hyperplanes defined by this function. But it's in general, the actual support function of this will be less than or equal to this thing. And this is going to cause problems. So that's L P Brunminkovsky. You take the limit as P goes to zero and you get Log Brunminkovsky. The equality condition now becomes somewhat different. It's more general than. Somewhat different. It's more general than if K and L are homothetic. We'll talk a bit more about that later, but not in any great detail. Okay, yeah, of course the same thing holds. This isn't a convex function, so the support function of this body is not that. Fine. Okay, one thing I will not mention a bunch of applications that Galena already talked about. I will mention something that she mentioned. Something that she mentioned, but not in any great depth, because it's really where I got into Lagrangovsky, and that's the B conjecture for uniform measures, which we can write as the following. It's really very simple to stay. You take two convex bodies, you expand one in some sort of, you know, in different rates in each of the coordinate directions, and you ask whether the volume of Ask whether the volume of this thing is log concave. If you actually want this expansion to be isotropic, then that's called the Weakby conjecture. And Sir Roglu showed that this is very much related to Lagrange-Minkowski, specifically in the following way. And the way he actually showed this is to reduce the case of polytopes, which is how I'm going to do local to global as well. So this is where I got into it. Okay. That's as much as applications. That's as much as applications. Ah, yes, now and both of whom are here, right? Well, we already heard from Thomas, showed that the V conjecture holds for the L1 ball and the L2 ball, but we would like it to hold for the cube, which we do not yet know. Fine. So now I'm going to start talking about things which aren't really applications of Bruneminkowski or Lav Bruneminkowski so much as alternative formulations that, again, Alternative formulations that again, Billy and already started, spoke in this direction. So we have this thing. The volume of the Minkowski sum or the Minkowski average of K and L, which is supposedly a 1 over n concave function. That's what Torn Minkowski tells us. And therefore, if you compute its derivative, the tangent line of the volume of this function. The volume of this function, the tangent line at zero of this function should be above the secant line between zero and one. And you get precisely this thing with the same equality condition. And you can do the same exact thing for Lagrang-Minkowski and get the Lag-Minkowski inequality with the same equality condition, which I believe I will discuss in my next slide. Which I believe I will discuss on the next slide. And fine, you have this function defined on 0, 1. If you have log Run Minkowski, you know that this function is log concave. This should be log, of course. Sorry about that. You know this function is log concave. You use the tangent in the secant line and get that. Okay. There's a a third thing which is very much related to Very much related to Brun Minkowski and Minkowski's first inequality, which is the Minkowski uniqueness theorem, which states that surface area measure basically defines uniquely a convex body. And what's really nice is that the proofs are the proof of one from the other is one line in one case. One line in one case, it's two lines in another case. I'm not going to go over it. But so you can see that these are very, very short proofs. And the same thing you can do for Lavminkowski. Here I have actually deigned to define what similarity is. I'm not going to bother discussing this in general. I'm just going to say that similarity in two dimensions, which is the case treated by BLYZ. Which is the case treated by BLYZ in 2012, is either homophidy or two parallelograms with parallel sides. And yeah, it's very easy to see that if two bodies are similar, then they in fact have the same quantum volume level defined like this. And the conjecture is that this is in fact the only case. And these are completely just You know, completely just as easy to get from one to the other as on the previous slide for the usual Bruneminkowski. And of course, you can also do this for L. Pieminkowski and Brunemakowski, etc., etc. Okay, so now we can start actually talking about local log Ronnukovsky and where it comes from and why. So we have again our have again our interpolating our interpolating body and this isn't I already I already stated this it's not completely immediate but it it's not hard either to that log Runinkowski is equivalent to the fact that the log of the volume of this interpolating body is a concave function and okay so if log Runinkowski holds then we have information about the not just the first derivative but about the second derivative Not just the first derivative, but about the second derivative of this function. It's negative. So we'd like to actually take the second derivative and see what happens. So Kolzanti, Lufschitz, Marcignetti, and Masaka-Milman, both of which were mentioned in Galina's talk, did all this in the case of smooth and strongly convex bodies. You can actually take the second derivative here. And I did it in the case of strongly isomorphic. Of strongly isomorphic polytrophs, and we'll see what happens. So, well, we'll see what happens. I mean, the answer is the local Lagrunikovsky, right? This is precisely the second derivative. No need to keep you all in suspense. And, well, this Galen already talked about. This is what you get when you take K to be the ball and L to be some other. And L to be some other smooth and strongly convex function, you get something which turns out to be negative. Either, you know, you can call this the Poincar√© inequality for even functions of just say Paul's from spherical harmonics. And Koles-Nikov-Willman did all this in a slight, in somewhat more general setting. And they obtained this, the local L.P. Brun-Minkowski inequality. They proved this using spectral methods. Using spectral methods. And this inequality is what I'm also going to find in the case of strongly isomorphic polytopes. Okay. So how do we get from local to global? And first of all, why is this difficult, really? As I said, Kolestnikov-Millman and also Kostanti Lucis-Marsiglietti know perfectly well how to take the second derivative. Perfectly well how to take the second derivative of this function. If you actually know the support function and it turns out to be the p-weighted average, p lambda average of hk and hl, then you can simply compute and you get this thing that which you want to show is less than zero. So in particular, if you start from a from a You start from a strictly strongly convex body, and you take another strongly convex body, and you take a small enough lambda, then in a neighborhood around zero, then this thing will still be convex. Since it's still convex, then h, then that's still going to be the support function of your interpolating body. And then you can take the second derivative, and if global LPB unholds, then Global LPB unholes, then the second derivative has to be negative, and you get that local LP Bernankauski Hollands. But in general, as I already said, this is not true, and you can't take the second derivative. The first derivative you can still take by Alexandro of Salema, but the second derivative, who knows? Fine. So there are two extremely, very different approaches to how to get around this problem and show that local Brunikowski. Local Brunetkowski gives you global Brunetkovsky. How am I on time? When did I start it? It's done a few more minutes. Still a lot to cover. Okay. So the first approach is the approach of Chenwang Li Yu, and it actually goes via Minkowski. And it actually goes via Minkowski uniqueness. So first of all, we have that L P Brun-Minkowski is equivalent with its equality condition is equivalent to L P Minkowski, the first L Minkowski inequality with its equality condition. We also have that L P Minkowski with its equality condition is equivalent to L P Minkowski uniqueness, which I didn't actually state in any place, so I'll just write that, well, the usual Pieminkowski well, the usual Minkowski uniqueness says that the surface area measure of a convex body characterizes it. Log-Minkowski uniqueness says that the cone volume measure of a convex body basically characterizes it. And L. P. Minkowski interpolates between them by putting one minus p over here. This is the p surface area measure or whatever. And this is supposed to characterize a convex body. That's the conjecture. A convex body, that's the conjecture. And uh oh, okay, yeah, also Lp implies LQ with equality condition, phi. So if you have that local, if you have local LP Bruneminkowski for P less than one, which Kolesnikov Mellon gives us, then you also have a local uniqueness statement. Given a body with a given surface area, or LP surface area, Surface area or LP surface area measure, then there's no body in some neighborhood of it with the same LP surface area measure. And Chen Wang Liliu used PD methods, which are totally outside of my scope at least, to show that if you have a local uniqueness statement such as Kolesnikovin gives you, you actually get a global uniqueness statement for a Puminkowski condition. And then you can actually go back. And then you can actually go back up these chain chains of uh chain of equivalences to get uh that local local log, local L P Brunminkowski gives global L P Brunminkowski and also proves global L P Brunminkowski for some P less than one, which is very amazing. Okay, so that's one approach to go via Pieminkowski like this. My approach is My approach is extremely different. I'll outline it here, and then, based on time, we'll hopefully have some time to go into some of the details. It goes using strongly isomorphic polytopes, which are, I shall remind you, polytopes with the same face structures. They have the same facets, but also their facets intersect or don't intersect in the same way. In the same way. If there's an n minus two-dimensional face defined by two facets in one, there's an n-dimensional face, n-2-dimensional face corresponding to one in the other, and so on and so forth. Fine. So these are strongly isomorphic polytops. It's a theorem that given any finite set of convex bodies, you can approximate them by n bodies which, n polytopes which are strongly isomorphic to each other. Which are strongly isomorphic to each other, fine. And what I'm going to do is explain how you can compute the volume of k lambda when k and l are strongly isomorphic polytopes and get the same local L P Brinminkowski formula. And then I'm going to explain why, in this case, the local behavior is sufficient, basically, because there are only a fine Sufficient, basically, because there are only a finite set of points at which strongly isomorphic polytopes do not behave well, which is not the case for general convex bodies. And this gives local to global for strongly isomorphic polytopes. You extend by continuity and get local to global in general. That's the outline. Okay. Yeah. So the main lemma on which basically everything depends is that you have you take I stay this for Log Runmink. The next two slides are all Lagrun Minkowski, but the same thing holds for L. P. Runlinkowski. The formulas are a bit more ugly. And basically what I'm saying in this lemma is that you have two strongly isomorphic polytops defined by a given set of support numbers at a certain set of vectors. Vectors, then the Log-Minkowski sum tells us to interpolate a certain function at all the I'll write it out I guess. We have that K is defined by that x u i is less than or equal to h i for some finite set of i. hi for some finite set of i and the same for L and then we have that k plus or 1 minus lambda k plus lambda L is X U is less than or equal to lambda H K or H K U to the one minus lambda H L U to the lambda so So this Logminkovsky combination involves all the u, involves all the vectors on the sphere. It doesn't just involve the support vectors of the original polytope. So it's not immediately trivial that when you write this Logman-Kovsky combination, you can actually say that this is actually equal to xu. To Xu is less than or equal to HKUI, 1 minus lambda HLU I, implying that only the support numbers at the facet normals actually matter. And the second you have this lemma, then that implies that k lambda is a polytope for all lambda and has the same facet normals. Well, not exactly perhaps. It doesn't say that Klembd actually has facets corresponding to all the UI. Perhaps some of these inequalities will turn out to be redundant. If you have a polytope defined by three inequalities and then one of them and then the other one ends up outside, then which could totally happen, then you don't. Then you don't need this inequality, but all the same, the point is that you don't need any more inequalities than this. Fine. And the next lemma is just how do you compute derivatives of volumes of polytopes with time-varying support numbers? And this is very clear from geometric intuition. If you have a polytope and you vary one of its support numbers, then the derivative in that direction is just. The derivative in that direction is just going to be the face volume, the facet volume, facet, surface area, whatever. And that's all this says. Okay, so that allows us to compute, given that we know that k lambda is going to be a polytope just like K and L with the same facet normals, then we can compute the derivative of volume K lambda. We can do a bit more. Do a bit more. If the k lambda is strongly isomorphic, then each facet of k lambda is also going to vary, is also going to satisfy the assumptions of this lemma. And then we can compute the derivative there. And then we can compute what we want to compute, which is the second derivative of the log of the volum k lambda. And then we get the local log BM formula. This is all very well and good, but it's not. And good, but it's not yet what we want. We want to go from the local to the global. So, what do we have so far? We assume the local log Bernlink-Kowski inequality. So, at any point at which we can actually compute the second derivative of k lambda, at any point at which all the k lambda are strongly isomorphic to one another, and you're just expanding or contracting facets and figures. Expanding or contracting facets and faces, but not removing any faces or facets, then local log BM tells us that the volume of k lambda is log concave, just like we want. But this isn't sufficient in general for the same reason that this isn't sufficient for smooth and strongly convex bodies, that it doesn't tell us that it doesn't tell us what happens when bodies are no longer strongly isomorphic. Um so the question is whether when when k lambda actually changes its strong isomorphic cla uh strong isomorphism class when it loses a facet or a lower dimensional phase. So the simple question is when if we have a polytope defined by various support numbers, when does it lose a facet? And once you state a question clearly and precisely, it's not hard to answer. Not hard to answer. Well, you can say this in a number of ways, but I'll say it this way. A linear inequality involving a certain support vector is going to be irrelevant if there's a facet, a facet defined by all the rest of the inequalities, which, a facet of the polytope defined by the rest of the inequalities, which is in any case under, in any case, under. In any case, under where your hyperplane. So this becomes redundant. And if this facet is under this hyperplane, it basically says that this vector, this vector on the sphere, is a normal vector, a generalized normal vector at this facet, which says that you can write this vector as a convex, as a positive Positive, uh yeah, convex combination of the vectors defining the facet. So you just write that out, and you get that this is that this being above this is a linear inequality between h at uy and h at the rest of the at the vectors defining this facet. And that's all well and good. And the same holds true for lower-dimensional faces because their support and. Faces because their support numbers are linear combinations of the original ones. And now Hi lambda, either in the Lach-Bruninkovsky case in which they're exponential, or the LP-Bruninkowski case, in which they're these p-power things, then they're analytic, so you have a linear combination, or a linear combination of them. Changes sign only at a finite number of points. It only has, this function has only a finite number of zeros. And then And then that implies that we have the interval 0, 1. At every point except for a finite number of points, we have intervals where we can compute the second derivative and use local log vm to say that this is going to be decreasing. At these finite number of points, you have to say there are no jumps, so you need a continuity argument. And that gives you that this is. This is concave. And, okay, again, once you have it for strong isomorphic polytopes, you have it for everything. How long do I have? Another five minutes, right? You have to point to five for you because it might be. Excellent. Okay. So that's local to global. Since I have time, I will tell you something else, which is why local to global gives you a very short proof of Lagrangovsky in the play. In the plane. And define the in radius and the circumradius of two bodies in the plane. There is an inequality which BLYZ also use in their proof of plane-logon casket in a totally different way. There's an inequality which gives, which says this for NET between the in radius and circumradius. We can substitute this, integrate, and basically it. Basically, it immediately gives local log-Bruninkowski in dimension 2. It's two lines. And that's the new proof of Log Runinkowski in dimension 2. That's all I have. Any questions? Any questions? Don't want to be in front of you. Jeska, please. So I think what would be extremely interesting is to get a lot of the global. is uh to get a local local version is a fixed function. That's similar to what I was saying. Do you know of at least affirmative functions? Do you have any such results? If you know that for example you fix a function, this function you don't locally or family functions, which far as a particular function, you know. Do I have any any interesting cases on when local Lugman caused kills? That's the No, and when local implies local. Can you so you can show So you can show the local number is local if you know it for every k and for every n. Now suppose we know it for every k and for every subm. So I don't have such a result. I am looking. It would be, I agree, very interesting. Any other questions to Ellie? If not, thank you. And we'll start then.
