Okay, the next talk is Professor Geraldis Kronk. The title of his talk is Yamabi Flow on Some Singular Space. Okay, thank you for the introduction and thank you also for the invitations to give me the opportunity to do this very nice online conference. So I'm going to report on John. Great report on joint work with Jorge Olseppi and Boris Gerapa from Odelo. So, let me first give the plan of my talk. You have the first briefly on all what is the Yamat before setting. We have to add the talk, but we don't have to set something. Yeah, I'm sorry, but your voice is not so clear. Is that okay? It's okay. Even this is the plan of my talk. It's better, it's better. Yeah, sorry. Here is the prime first recall: what is the Yannabe flow on the smooth setting and some results? And so we already have a talk on Sunday by Eric Shed on the Yanabflow. And then I will discuss and describe our singular setting in order to understand the singular setting. Then I will give a result. Give a result about the existence of the Yama-Bay flow. And then I will discuss at the end of the asymptotic behavior for large time of this Yama Beflow in the singular case. So the Yama-Bay flow on the closed manifold has been introduced by Accupton, and this is a gradient of the inverse functional. So this is the integrals of the scalar temperature on a conformal class where we fix. Well, you fix the volume. So you consider a whole set of metric G that are conformal with the factor exponential to F with a given metric, whose volume is fixed equal to one. So and the question was to solve by paragonic method the Yamabi problem. The Yamabi problem is to find in a conformal class. In a performable class, a metric with constant scalar curvature and by composition say equal to one. So the existence of Yamabimmetry for close movement folds is not well done. So if we introduce the Yamma Bay invariant, that is to say the integer of the integral of the scalar temperature for all electrically conformable classes in volume one. Class with volume one, then we wanted to now we know now that there exists a conformal matrix with volume one whose scalar curvature is constant equal to this Yama Be invariant. And this problem is solved, a long story by Yamabay, Truniger, Obinch, and a very brief abstract of the story. We have first resulted by Aubin in 1974. He saw that we have a You saw that we are we have always that for any closed Riemannian manifold, the Yamma Bay invariant is less or equal to the one of the sphere. And if the gamma B invariant is strictly smaller than the one of the sphere, then you can find a smooth conformal matrix whose scalar curvature is constant equal to the gamma B constant and volume one. And then And then OBAR ensured shows the visit result that if the gamma-bay invariant is equal to the one of the sphere, then in fact your metric is conformable to the round metric of the sphere. In this case, there is indeed the metric that is conformable. It's constant scalar curvature. It is a round metric. Okay, so now if you try to do a parabolic The parabolic method, so you get the gradient flow of the functional side of a class fixed. Then, a brief summary of the result is that the Yama B flow exists for all times. And then we know that there is either convergence or concentration, that is formation of bubbles. And then the positive mass period typically prevents the formation of bubbles. This is mostly resulting. This is mostly a result from SF, 2003, by Brendel, 2005 and 2016, and so on. So bubbles means that part of the manifold become conformally deformed, like a big sphere. So now let me now describe and spend some time the descriptions of the geometry, we bonk singular geometry we don't look at. Geometry, we want to look at this. Uh, geometry is the geometry of iterated code matrix on stratified space. So, I will first give some example, geometrical example of such a space, and then I will give the introduction definitions. But really, let's start from definition. So, we look at two-dimensional objects, geometrical objects. This is the surface of a cube. This is the surface of the cubes. So look at the geometry of the surface of the cubes. So it's a 2D object, surface with signal. Now, if you are on the face of the clip, then the geometry is really a geometry is flat. It looks like a Euclidean disc. Now, if you are on the point on the edge of the Euclidean disk, then what you have is Then, what you have, it's still a cradle, it's folded, but it's folded inside R3. From the geometric point of view, you don't see the difference between the flattened. So, when you have a point on the edge of your clothes, then the geometry is flat. And now, if you, more interesting, if you are at one vertex of the cube, then what you see is this feature. So, what do you have to do? You have three pieces of papers which make a right angle and you glue them together. So, what you have, in fact, is a core over a circle whose length is not 2Ï€, but it's 3p over 40. So we resume the geometry of this stratified space, which is the surface of the cube. So the geometry of the surface of the cube, you have a decomposition, two pieces, you have the singular set, it's given by a collection of eight vertex, and you have a regular part, the complement of this eight vertex where the geometry is equivalent, and nearby the eighth vertex, the geometry near this point is exactly a flat curve over a circle of Over a circle of language scriptiography. Okay, let me go to a second example: the surface of a pillow. So you take a sheet of paper and you identify that you have a pillow and you can go through it. Okay, so here you you have a similar picture, but you have four singular points where the geometry is in fact a cone over a circle of like a part. A circle of like part, and nearby each point elsewhere, the geometry is located. So, let's now to our third example: the surface of a bell angle. So, it's still a 2D object, but we don't describe a 3D object. Okay, so how it's made? Surface of a bell angle, you take a you cut a whole sphere in eight pieces with right angle, and then you glue together two such pieces. Together, two such pieces. So you have this feature, and then when you glue along the edge, like this one, you don't see the singularity. So again, you have only three circular points. And the circular point, to see at the geometry, you look at the top here and you have to identify what you have, it's a circle, a cone over a circle a length pi. So the surface of the bare language. So, the surface of the bare language, you have still a decomposition. This is the smooth part where the geometry is spherical, so it's remanial, and the collection of three vertex, so that near each of this vertex, the geometry looks like a code, so it's not a code because rather you have to get a sine code over a circle of line to pi. So, let me give the last example: a solid cube. So, you keep now, it's a 3K object, and what you're The 3D objects, and what you're going to do, you are going to take the solid cubes and you identify together you take the double okay and you identify the faces together. You identify like this one. But let's discuss about the geometry. So if you are in the interior on the face of the cube, the geometry is uglided. You really see around you, you are in an ugly room. So if you are on the edge, in the interior of the edge of the cube, so you have this picture and then you have to identify the two phases. If you cut, you have these pieces, so it's the geometry is a product of a line and a 2D object, and your 2D objects, what you have to do, you have to take an half disc and you have to glue together the half discs. The alpha disc, the two radius. Okay, so it's code over a circle of length pi. Okay, now and more interesting is what happened at the vertex of the cube. So now it's a 3D object. What you have to do was to glue together take the double of these solid pieces that is drawn here. Okay. And so what it is, in fact, this is a code. What it is, in fact, this is a code over the bare language. You have to take the sphere, you glue them together, and then you make a code. So, what you have here, what you see, the code over eight part of the sphere. You have to do that together. So, what you have, you have a code over a bare angle. So, let me say what we had for the geometry. What we had for the geometry of the double-celled solid cubes. So you have a decomposition three strata. Here, you have on the top strata, sorry, forget the edge, the geometry is Euclidean. You are really like the Euclidean space. When you are along the interior of the edge, you have 12 units. We have 12 unit segments, and at each point of this segment, the geometry is exactly the product of the interval with a code of length over a circle of length 5. Okay, and eventually you get the eighth vertex, the eighth point, where the geometry near this point looks like a cone over a barrel. Over a berlin. Okay, so it's code over a singular space. So it's really this feature that we want to generalize that is generalized with the definitions of a stratified space. So the budget object to understand the geometry of stratified space with iterated code singularity is a code. It's cone over a metric space. So when you have a complete metric space, the cone over sigma, you take the cone. cone over sigma you take the completion of the positive half-line space sigma and you complete with this distance so what does it mean it means that if you have two points so p is t and x and q is s and y so t and s are real numbers and x and y are points on your sphere on your link on sigma if you want so if this point on the link are far away at distance larger than pi then the shortest distance Than pi, then the shortest distance to go to one point to another is to go to the tips of the cone and go back. So the distance is t plus s. And whereas if the distance is smaller than pi, then it's the distance that you can compute in the 2D objects with the al-cachi fobulum. And then at the end, to understand the topology of this code, you have only to blow down all points. So now what are stratified space? Exactly stratified space of dimension n is a compact metric space with a stratification such that we are each point in the regular part, so that mix. On both sides here, singular space, same to singular set of dimension n minus two. The geometry looks like Riemannian, so it's an up x minus x subscript n minus two. It's an open set and though with a smooth Riemannian matrix. And now nearby the strata, you impose some conditions on this Riemannian metric. Only take care about this fatification. Stratification. So if you have a point in the strata of dimensions K, but far away from the strata of dimension K minus one, then the geometry looks like a product of a Eugenian space of dimension K and the cone over some stratified space of lower dimension. So the cone can be similar. So it's a very, it's a inductive. Very, it's an inductive definition like for the cubes of the double of the three cubes. We had, in order to understand the geometry, we had to understand the Berlin go. Because at the vertex, what you add is a cone over some stratified space of a lower dimension. So it's really a definition by induction. And if you are, and the If you are in the k-dimensional strata, but far away from the k-minus one-dimensional strata, then the Erka direction you see here, they are tangent in the stratum xk af dimensions k. So now the Yamabe flow on the smooth part will be a parabolic flow, so you can write down the equation in this way, okay? So it's a Okay, so it's the conformally deformed your original matrix by u to the power 4 over n minus 2. And you have an equation that tells you that the derivative of u is some multiple of u times u to the certain power multiplied by the gamma bay operator applied to q. And sigma t is exactly the integral of the scalar curvature. integral at the scalar curvature. This is done in order to preserve the volume. The first term, sigma tu, is made in order to rescale the flow in order to fix the volumes v1. Okay, be careful that my conventions for the Laplacian is that the Laplacian is the one you write as the minus the second derivative, so that it's a positive operator. So let me give the first result. Our first result is that if you have a stratified space of dimensions strictly larger than 2, and G0 is a Riemannian matrix, good compatibility conditions on the regular part, such as the volume is 1 by normalization. And the scalar curvature gives it L P where P is strictly bigger than L over L. P is strictly bigger than n over 2. Then there is a long time existence of a Yama develop starting in Adgenus. We have better more precise descriptions. So it's a kind of parabolic counterpart of some existent results for the Yamabay problem and stratified space that I've shown with Kazuo acquisition. With Jazu Akutagawa and Rafe Macio, seven years ago. Okay, so let me explain from where we get the existence of the local existence of the Yannada flow. So in fact, what we use, we use a functional analytic method to get existence of solutions of flows, equations, of the times derivative of u is equal to u to the power beta. equal to u to the power beta multiplied by l u plus v u where i'm going to explain in which setting so in a this analytic framework the turtle space so the quadruple x g u and d were the first two three letters say that we have a measure a metric space with a volume one so use a probability measure Use a probability measure. E is a closed, densely defined quadratic form, and L is the Fredericks essentially of this quadratic form. That is to say, A of U is exactly the scalar, L2 scalar product between U and L of U. And the third fourth is a potential is the subolef inequalities that say that if you want the That says that if you want the graph norms in the domain of the quadratic force, it is always bigger than the Ln over L minus two norms, Euclidean sub inequality, the local sub of F inequality. And if V is in L P for P larger than N over there, then we can use very, very general results to show that you have. General results show that you have local existence of this type of flow starting from a bounded positive volume. So, be in mind that this framework in fact generizes the Tiriclet energy. The fact that the smooth manifold, T of U is only the integral of the square length of the gradient. Okay, and for this existence, we only apply very general theorems that you can. Theorems that you can find in these very good books by Alexander Argonne, Analytics of the Group and Optimal Regularity of Parabolic Problems. So it's really checks that everything is good to apply these methods. So these general durants provide us with some useful information about the regularity of the scalar curvature. Because a priori, we don't know, for instance, that the scalar curvature, when it evolves by time, generally When you evolve by time, generally, so we don't know if the Laplacian's G naught applied to the scalar temperature is in L. But really, the general terms, what's guaranteed to you is that you do not know if the Laplacian C naught applied to the scalar curvature is in L D, but you know that the Laplacian G applied to the scalar curvature of the metric G is in L. And in order to show you, you And in order to show you you have a long time existence, you need to perform the integration by part and so on. For this, you need this regularity of the scalar curvature, because the scalar curvature is not satisfied, it's a parabolic equation, and this is also true in our setting. Okay, so we can play in this formula, like in the the smooth case, in order to get uh long time integrities. So let me uh finish in the four remaining minutes. Finish in the four remaining minutes about the hope we describe asymptotic behavior. So, we also have a dichotomy between compactness and concentrations, that is formation to bubble. So, if you don't have compactness of the flow, it has sublimits, then you have necessary formation to bubble. And if you have no bubbles, you have sublimit of the flow. Okay, in this setting, we do not have a positive theorem, it's not that it's. Positive theoretics note that singular setting don't have positive mass theorem. And because of this, because there are examples where you do not find a conformal deformation with constant scalar curvature, these examples the Yama Beflow, only concentrations can occur. And if I have two minutes, I'll describe the last result. I'll describe the last result is that if you add some hypothesis, we are able to give a very precise description of the bubbles that are forming along the Yamat flow. It's really the same story as the case of smooth manifolds. So we make the following hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the peachy curvature is bounded on the regular part. And moreover, we make the extra assumptions as The extra assumptions as con angles along the tangents of tangent space along the co-dimension two strata are all well less than two pi. In this case, if you have a solutions of the Yamabay flow, we can find a sub-sequence that goes to plus infinity, find the solutions of the Yamabay equations on the smooth part so that u of t k converge weakly in h1 to each infinity and moreover. And moreover, you have finite numbers of bubbles such that if you add these sums of the bubbles to your solutions at infinity, in fact, you get strong convergence. And we also have a very good description of these bubbles. These bubbles, they are given by a spherical blow-up, if you want. So exactly in the like the Pidian or Riemannian case. Riemannian case. And we know that the last condition here is to say that these bubbles do not interact one to the other. So you get very good bubble tree descriptions of the blowout profile. So I think my time is over, so I won't stop here. Thank you. Thank you. So any question, comments? Any questions, comments? May I ask one? Hi, may I ask one? Yeah, sure, please. Yeah, why do you need the scalar curvature in L P with P larger than N over two? Yeah, it's to because if you do not do this, what can happen in practice possible, but In perhaps it's possible, but in this case, what can happen is that the conformal factor will become very big and certainly. Okay, because this condition was simple suffusion. If even one conical singularity, only one codical singularity, this condition says essentially that the scalar curvature on the link of a code is equal or bigger. Is equal or bigger to the one of the sphere. So if you do not do this, the metric you will find will vanish on the tips of the code. It's perhaps possible that with other type of conditions you get, but then you lose the certainty because at first, for very small times, your factor will be very small. Your factor will be very smooth as because you have a kind of an activity. So it's really sure that. And you know, if you are in the Euclidean space, if you look at the Schrodinger equations with potentials that are larger than L P will be larger than the dimension of L, then solutions enjoy nice ultra regularity, whereas if you ask for For I see, okay, okay, so it's exactly the same reason. Okay, thanks. Yes, any question? I have a question. Yes, do you have information on the rate in time of the convergence? No, because we don't have convergence. Because we don't have compactness. We have either compactness or so. What can happen is you can a priori not exclude that for several subsequents, you get different sequence, you get different minutes. And this issue is not even in person case, it's not so easy to do the work of random. Than basically gets true. They are very involved. So, in order to the first step to write this analysis, it's ready to have these very good descriptions of the bubble trees. But as you know, these bubble trees are, yeah, you don't have enough smooth structure to yeah, perhaps it's possible that there is a lot of technique because if you want, in order to have the positive master element. In order to have the positive mass theorem as you explain to the tools, you need the metric to have enough smoothness in order to run expansions around the blow-up point. For instance, this setting works if you have not a smooth matrix, but for instance, a W2P matrix. Okay, thanks. So, if you have a W2P matrix, do we in this case we don't have the positive master? So, and so So, at that the story of the Yamabay equations on the smooth manifold, but with a non-smooth matrix, I don't think we have an answer. Okay, because our limit of time, we may discuss later if you have any questions. Thank you for Professor Gareth Kroh, for your nice talk.
