So, now concerning the title. So, the theory has been developed to big maturity and it is actually a very beautiful and attractive theory which describes features of basically of all integrable systems, but sometimes. Systems, but sometimes we are confronted with the question: what is the added value of this beautiful structure, which we know for integrable systems? What can we do with this structure which we cannot do without? And my talk will be an attempt to give a couple of examples which could contribute towards answering this concrete question. This concrete question. Actually, there will be three interrelated stories, all based on pretty old papers of mine with collaborators. But I think that all three stories have not been arrived at the community like they should be. So let me start with the first story. A first story, the story of Beckland transformations for Toda-type systems presented in this paper. So we are speaking about Beckland transformations for the Toda chain or its relatives. I will just concentrate on the case of the Toda chain, of the classical Toda chain itself with finite number n of particles. The corresponding differential equations can be put either of Either under open end boundary conditions or under periodic boundary conditions. And here is the formula for the backland transformation with a backland parameter lambda. It is a one parameter family of symplectic maps. Actually, the maps are symplectic because they are just an instance of a discrete time Lagrangian system with these Lagrangian. This Lagrange. Now, if the boundary conditions are open-ended, then the equations of motion clearly give an explicit single-valued map. But in the case of periodic boundary conditions, the situation is much more delicate because the map cannot be solved explicitly and Explicitly and actually, it is a double-valued map. The best way to see these is just to try to express from the first of the Lagrangian equations of motion the updated values of x and through the canonical variables x and p, like on this formula. And we see that the result is nothing but n-periodic continued fraction. So the So, the values for n-periodic continued fractions are just fixed points for the corresponding Merbius transformations, and generic Merbius transformations have two fixed points. Therefore, we get actually a quadratic equation for the updated variables x. So, we have two values for each of xk, tilde. Actually, Actually, the discriminant of the corresponding quadratic equation will not depend on k, as one can easily see. Therefore, one can choose one and the same root, square root of the discriminant for all xk. So the global map for all the coordinates will be really double-valued. Now, the Backland transformations are known. Are known to commute. So, just for general reasons, we expect that two such background transformations f lambda and f mu for two different values of the parameter lambda and mu should commute. But there are, of course, two questions. First, how to prove this, especially in the case when we are dealing with periodic boundary conditions. And an even more important question is how to understand common. Question is how to understand commutativity of a non-single valued map. So, if we try to build a commutative diagram out of them, we will see that we will have two values after the application of f lambda, two values after the application of f mu, and then the things start to bifurcate. We will get four values after the next application of lambda. Next application of L lambda and another four values after the next application of FÎ¼. And the question is: what can we say about the values of X and P, which can be considered as the right top corner of the commutative diagram? Are there really any closures of those arrows? Do they point to something coinciding or not? Coinciding or not. And this looks like a complicated problem. And it turns out that the solution, getting the answer to both questions, how to prove commutativity and how to understand commutativity in the first turn, can be obtained on the pleuri-Lagrangian way. So let me give you a very quick reminder of the pleuri-Lagrangian problem because it is a special Because it is a specialized conference, and I assume that everybody in the audience knows what the Pluri-Lagrangian or Lagrangian multi-form story is, but nevertheless. So discrete one form is nothing but a skew symmetric function on directed edges of a multidimensional square lattice, depending on some fields sitting at the vertices of the square lattice. And a discrete curve in the square lattice is just a concatenation of edges, like here on the picture. We form an action along such a discrete curve just by integrating or summing the values of the discrete form along the corresponding edges. And then we ask for fields defined on all vertices of a multi-dimensional lattice which deliver. Which deliver critical points for this functional along any discrete curve. So we are speaking about one-dimensional object, discrete curves in a multi-dimensional lattice, and we ask that the fields deliver critical points for all curves simultaneously. Now it is well known that solutions for this Pluralagrange. Solutions for this Plural Lagrangian problem is delivered by the solution of the so-called corner equations, which are nothing but the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. Corner equations are sitting on such corners of a square lattice which exist. So four of them exist on any elementary square. Exist on any elementary square of two-dimensional direction spanned by coordinate x's i and j. And of course, it is necessary that all these corner equations are consistent so that there exist fields which provide solutions for all this system of corner equations simultaneously. And if such And if such fields exist, then we get actually a system of commuting symplectic maps along each coordinate direction. We can enumerate these maps by the number of coordinate direction. And it is actually a one-to-one correspondence for each system of commuting symplectic maps. We can provide. Maps, we can provide a corresponding one-dimensional Plurio-Lagrangian problem. Important but nowadays trivial remark is that the standard discrete time Euler-Lagrange equations, which correspond to two adjacent edges of one coordinate direction, are nothing but consequences of two corner equations. So if we sum up two corner equations corresponding to two adjacent corners, Adjacent corners, then the result will be just the one-dimensional, one-direct, unidirectional standard single-time Euler-Lagrange equation for the corresponding map Fi. Okay, so for the toddler chain, the corner equations can be written. Here are the corner equations for four corner equations. Four corners of one elementary square, which I will show on the next slide. So, here are the four corners of one elementary square. I will denote the shifts in the corresponding coordinate directions by tilde and hat just in order to save subscripts, because the subscript k stands just for the component of the field, just for the number of particle xk. So, we see four corner equations. We see four corner equations: one centered at xk, one centered at xk tilde, one centered at xk hat, and one centered at xk tilde hat. But they still have the same problem as before. They are quadratic equations with respect to the variable at the center. So, for instance, here we see e to the power minus xk and e to the power xk, which means that this is an equation which is quadratic. Is an equation which is quadratic with respect to the e to the power xk, and the same is the case for all other four equations. For instance, this last equation centered at xk hat tilde is a quadratic equation with respect to this variable. It contains e to the power e x k hat tilde and e to the power minus x k hat tilde. So, what to do, how to resolve this problem, how to resolve the This problem, how to resolve the double-valuedness. The way out is to find some further equations which we call superposition formulas. And I will comment on the origin and of the nature of these superposition formulas later on, which do not suffer from this drawback anymore. For instance, so we actually have two superposition formulas, both formulas both containing x k tilde hat but only in a linear fashion. So here we only have e to the power x k hat tilde and in the second equation we have only e to the power minus x k hat tilde. So both equations would allow us to express e to the power x k hat tilde uniquely in terms of other ingredients of these. Of other ingredients of these equations. And this is the desired feature of these equations because, as we can now see, the problem of multivariateness has been resolved. So suppose that we start with the corner equation E centered at xk, and we start with the fields x tilde and x hat. And x hat related to x by this corner equation e. Then, in principle, after application of the corner equation e1, we have two values, two candidate values of x tilde head, and the same for application of the corner equation E2, which relates these three points. But now we can say that exactly one of those candidate values. One of those candidate values satisfies the corner equation E12, namely, this is the field provided by the superposition formulas. Or we can express this also in another way. Actually, each of the compositions of our symplectic maps F lambda and F mu is four-valued, as seen on one of the previous slides. One of the previous slides, but these eight values altogether glue together in four couples. Actually, there are exactly four values of the resulting map such that they are obtained as the result of the application of one branch of f lambda and one branch of f mu. And this also follows from the previous theorem because. Folllows from the previous theorem because it gives exactly one value of x tilde hat for each of the four possible combinations of the fields x tilde and x hat. And these four results will satisfy all four corner equations. So actually this is the first answer to the question. First, the answer to the question: What is good about the Pluri-Lagrangian theory? Because it gives an exhaustive and clear explanation of the phenomenon which has been completely unclear before. But in this theory, there is also another aspect which I would develop also in the second story and in the third story, which is the close. Is the closeness or almost closedness of multi-time one form? Actually, it turns out that if the one-dimensional plural Lagrangian problem is compatible, is consistent, then the multi-time one-form is almost closed on solutions of corner equations. Namely, the exterior derivative of this one form, it is a discrete two-form assigning this value to each oriented. Each oriented two-cell of the quadratic lattice is guaranteed to be a constant on solutions. A constant means that it only depends on i and j, but not on the concrete square and not on the concrete solution of the problem. And actually, vanishing of these constants, Li. Of these constants. Lij would mean that the multi-time one form is closed on solutions, and this is actually the requirement put by the lead school on the whole theory, the closeness of multi-time form on solutions. It means that the extremal value of the action functional does not depend on curve connecting to given points in the square. Connecting to given points in the square lattice. So, in our particular situation, when we are dealing with one parameter family of commuting symplectic maps, we can speak about this exterior derivative of the one form for any two of such maps, for any two instances of the parameter lambda and mu. And therefore, the corresponding quantity will be just. The corresponding quantity will be just a constant depending on lambda and mu. And now we can give another remarkable statement, which I consider as another application of the plural Lagrangian theory to the mathematics, which goes behind actually the interests of the plural Lagrangian theory itself. Granger theory itself. Namely, we will see in a minute that a partial derivative of the discrete one form with respect to the spectral parameter, with respect to the parameter lambda, is a common integral of motion for all commuting maps F mu simultaneously. So this is a very mysterious and non-obvious. And non-obvious object, the derivative of the Lagrange function or of the one form with respect to the spectral parameter. And actually, a similar statement appeared under the name of spectrality as long ago as 98 in the work by Kuznitsov and Sklanin. But they actually required the existence. Required the existence of a Lex representation for the maps, for the commuting maps we are speaking about. And in our formulation, no previous knowledge of the Lex representation is needed. Actually, the term spectrality comes from the Lex representation because they demonstrated that this quantity serves together with lambda lies on a spectral curve of the Lex representation, and now we do not have a spectral curve at all. We do not have a spectral curve at all, we do not have a Lex representation, we only have the fundamental object, which is the one form or Lagrangian function, and the derivative of this object with respect to the spectral parameter is a common integral of motion. Let me give you a very quick proof of this statement. Actually, Actually, the quantity L is skewsymmetric because it is an exterior two form. It is skew symmetric with respect to the exchange of the parameters lambda and mu. And for such quantities, vanishing is equivalent to independence on one of the parameters. So the partial derivative of this quantity with respect to the parameter lambda is equal to zero. Then if we zero. Then, if we differentiate the discrete two-form with respect to lambda, then it will depend on lambda through all the variables sitting at the corners, but through the corner equations, so the corresponding partial derivatives will vanish, and just the explicit dependence on the spectral parameter, so the corresponding condition will look like this. Condition will look like this, and this is nothing but conservation of this quantity under the shift in the head direction. Or in other words, it is equivalent to this quantity being an integral of motion for the shift in the head direction, which is just the map FÎ¼. And due to arbitrariness of lambda and mu, our statement is proven. So, what does it give? So, what does it give for the toddler chain? For the toddler chain, we can compute the corresponding quantity just from the definition, and this will give us the statement that the multi-time one form is closed if and only if this quantity is an integral of motion for all mu's. In other words, if this condition is satisfied and this condition. Satisfied, and this condition can be proven with the help of the same device I presented already, namely with the help of superposition formulas, because the superposition formulas can be shown to be equivalent to this thing, and this thing is clearly closed with respect to multiplication over all case, because we have the same expression in the numerator and denominator with the shifted indices. With the shifted indices. So the product of all such expressions over all k's will be equal to one, or in other words, this quantity will be equal to zero, or in other words, this quantity is an integral of motion for f mu. And this means that the exterior derivative of the Lagrangian vanishes. So the multi-time one form is closed for the Is closed for the Toda chain, which is the first statement of this theorem. Equivalently, this quantity is an integral of motion for any of the commuting maps, of the commuting Beckland transformations. And very remarkably, just the first equation of motion of the Lagrangian system allows one to represent this later quantity as an eigenvalue of. Value of a function and this function is nothing but the Lex representation for the total chain. So we can say that the Lex representation for the Todd chain can be derived in a systematic way just from the Lagrangian representation. And this is just another added value of the multi-time Lagrangian theory for the Todd chain. Needless to say that all this is true not only for the Todd chain. Is true not only for the Toda chain itself, but for all its relatives. And the list of relatives includes also the so-called relativistic Toda systems, where the corresponding results were obtained in a later paper by the same team. And also, this development led us to understanding what are the corner requirements. What are the corner equations in dimension two? And this is the next story which I would like to present here. So now let us quickly speak about two-dimensional discrete Plurial Lagrangian problems. Now the story starts with a discrete two-form skew symmetric function on oriented squares, elementary oriented squares of a multi-dimensional lattice depending on fields, sitting again at vertices. Sitting again at vertices of a multidimensional square. And for any two-dimensional quad surface in a multidimensional square that is like this, for instance, we get the corresponding action by integrating or by summation of the values of the discrete two-form evaluated at the corresponding elementary quads. Quads and two-dimensional plural Lagrangian problem consists in finding the fields which deliver critical points for the functionals for all quad surfaces simultaneously. Or in other words, if we fix the boundary of such a surface and perform flips of the surface just by say changing choosing for each triple of corners of an elementary cube. Corners of an elementary cube, another triple of corners, then under such flips the action should remain critical. So this is the definition of a two-dimensional pre-Lagrangian problem, and the definition of multi-time Lagrangian problem would also involve the requirement that the critical action is invariant under such flips. Is invariant under such flips. Again, it turns out that the almost closeness of a discrete two-form is a built-in feature of this theory, namely an exterior derivative of a two-form, which is obtained by summation of two-forms along all six sides of any elementary cube. Elementary cube of the lattice is a constant. So it is proved by just computing the partial derivatives of this quantity with respect to all involved variables. So this is a constant which only depends on the coordinate, three-dimensional coordinate direction, but not on the choice of an elementary cube of this direction and not on the given. And not on the given solution of Lurie-Lagrangian system. Symbolically, this is usually denoted as vanishing of the vertical differential of this exterior derivative. So the plural Lagrangian Euler Lagrange equations for this two-dimensional problem are nothing but Are nothing but the so-called 3D corner equations. And these 3D corner equations are just discrete Euler-Lagrange equations for these elementary building blocks, which are just three squares adjacent to a common vertex, three squares of three adjacent two-dimensional directions. So, and it is required that all eight corner equations. Corner equations for one elementary cube are consistent. And this is the condition on the consistency on the existence of non-trivial solutions of generic solutions of a given two-dimensional plural Lagrangian problem. It turns out that any vertex star of any oriented quad surface can be represented as a sum of oriented surface As a sum of oriented 3D corners, just by extending the surface in additional direction. And therefore, these 3D corner equations are actually, build actually the full system of Euler-Lagrange equation for this problem. So, as I already said, for any triple of coordinate direction, the The corresponding exterior derivative of the two-form or the action over the cube is constant on solutions. And now I would like to shortly stay with an interesting and important particular case of two forms. These are the so-called three-point two forms, which for any elementary square like Any elementary square like this at the bottom of this cube only depends on three fields sitting at three vertices of this elementary square. For the direction ij, these are vertices x, xi, and xj. So the corresponding two-form only depends on x and xi and xj. And it turns out, and have been demonstrated by the Berlin team. The Berlin team for all equations of the ABS list of quad equations that the corresponding 3.2 form of a very special shape, namely consisting of expressions sitting on two edges and one diagonal of this elementary square, that this serves as the plural Lagrangian structure. The plural Lagrangian structure for ABS equations. Actually, for such a three-point two form, the exterior derivative, the sum of these two forms over the eight sides, over the six sides of the cube, depends not on all fields. It does not depend on two distant corners, x and xi. Corners X and X I J K, and it only depends on the vertices of an octahedron, which is inscribed into this cube. Moreover, it only depends through the edges of this octahedron, which are shown in strong lines on this picture. The corner equations in this case are also not generic, they are Generic. They are four-leg equations, all containing two short legs corresponding to the edges of the squares and two long legs corresponding to the diagonals of the squares. And they have this special form. It turns out that the planar Laplace equations, which are actually nothing but Discrete relativistic total type equations are consequences of 3D corner equations, exactly like it was the case for the one-dimensional problems where the standard Laplace equations or Euler-Lagrange equations has been consequences of the corner equations. And this is the explanation of the superposition formulas for Superposition formulas for toddler chains. Actually, the corner equations for the toddler chains, if we look at them, they are nothing but the side views of two-dimensional equations. And these two-dimensional equations are nothing but corner equations or just their combinations. So, I have unfortunately no time to explain this in detail, but the two-dimensional But the two-dimensional corner equations for the vector transformations for total chains or relativistic total chains are nothing but 3D corner equations as seen from side like on this picture and also the superposition formulas for total chains which were a bit a bit A bit mysterious when I just introduced them in the first part of the talk are nothing but the exterior derivatives of the two-dimensional Lagrangians just in this concrete three-point situation. So, this is the domain of the superposition formula. It also includes one includes one xk hat tilde sitting at this corner and this renders the corresponding superposition formula explicit with respect to this variable. It does not include the corresponding neighboring vertex. Also this two-dimensional plural Lagrangian formulation allows one to derive conservation laws. Uh, conservation laws, parameter-dependent families of conservation laws, and this is the analog of spectrality and is proved actually in the same way. Actually, the closeness of a two-dimensional Plural Lagrangian form is nothing but a conservation law for the corresponding system. So, this is another application of the theory. Another application of the theory, the derivation of conservation laws just from the first principles requiring no further knowledge. This is exactly like the spectrality is the way to derive integrals of motion from the Lagrangian structure itself without knowing any further structure. So, this was the end of the story number two, and the story number three. The story number three also has to do with the spectrality property and with one-dimensional Peri-Lagrangian systems. And it is an application of these in somewhat unexpected context, namely in the theory of billiards. And it allowed actually to derive a novel, so-called non-standard. So-called non-standard variational formulation for billiards, which recently plays an important role in the general theory of billiards, not necessarily integrable billiards, and in efforts toward proving a famous Birkhoff conjecture for billiards. But let me give you a quick introduction into the theory of billiards in quadrics or in Quadrics or ellipsoids. We consider a billard in an ellipsoid in an n-dimensional space. I will illustrate it with the two-dimensional situation on the next slide, but you definitely know what a billiard is. So we consider a billard just by shooting a billiard ball until it hits the billiard table. Billiard table, and then it is reflected with the condition that the angles of reflection and incoming and outcoming angles are equal. And this is the orbit of a billiard. These are three consecutive points of the billiard orbit. And the unit vectors along the corresponding lines will be denoted by corresponding VK. So what we see. So, what we see on this picture is a well-known dynamical feature of Willards in an ellipse, namely all segments of the corresponding orbit are tangent to another ellipse, which is confocal with the original one. And actually, this another ellipse is an expression of. An expression of integrability of this billiard, namely the parameter of this ellipse in the confocal family is an integral of motion. So if we write the Billiard map in coordinates xk and vk, we will see something like this. This tells us that vk is a unit vector along the segment xk, xk plus 1, so that mu k is One, so that k is just the length of the corresponding segment. And this tells us that the angle is preserved, so that the vectors Vk and Vk minus Y form the same angle with the normal to the ellipse. So this gives us. ellipse. So this gives us the way to compute the corresponding factor nuk just as a normalization factor in the second equation. If we eliminate Vk between these two equations, we will get the standard equation for the billiard orbit. It is a second-order difference equation, which is a Lagrangian equation. It comes from a standard discrete Lagrangian. From a standard discrete Lagrange function for the billiard, which is just the length of the corresponding segment, so that the action for this system is just the perimeter of the corresponding orbit. It is well known that another expression for the integrability. Expression for the integrability of the pillar in an ellipse is the commutativity. So, actually, commutativity is the following statement. If we consider billiards in two ellipses, then the corresponding maps will be commuting. In what sense? So, here is the picture. So, we are considering now two billards in two ellipses, gamma one and gamma two, which are conformal. Gamma one and gamma two, which are confocal. We start playing Billard in the ellipse gamma one. The trajectory is reflected in the billard, in the ellipse gamma one, and then the second segment is reflected in the ellipse gamma two. So here is the corresponding trajectory. Or we can do it in the opposite order. The trajectory, the line, directed line L is first reflected in the ellipse. Is first reflected in the ellipse gamma two and then reflected in the ellipse gamma one and the claim is that the corresponding lines coincide, one is one in the second line. So when we are speaking about the commutativity of the maps, of the billiard maps in two ellipses, then the right way to formulate these maps is to speak as maps on Maps on directed lines, on oriented lines. So we should orient, we should interpret B not as a map on points, on ellipses, because then it makes no sense to speak about commutativity of maps on different ellipses, but as maps on directed lines. And as such, this space of directed lines can be identified with a cotangent tangent bundle of a unit sphere and then we are speaking just about the maps on cotangent bundle of the unit sphere and then it makes full sense to speak about the corresponding commutativity of two such maps. And here the theorem is that for any two quadrics for Quadrics from a confocal family, the corresponding two maps interpreted as maps on the cotangent bundle of the unit sphere commute. This is a very classical theorem, but it turns out that one can give a pluri-Lagrangian proof for this theorem. And for this, one has to find a Lagrangian formulation for the maps in terms of the variables Vk. Variables vk. So one has actually to eliminate variables xk and get a second order difference equation in terms of the variables vk, which sit on the unit sphere. These are just unit vectors. So here is the corresponding equation, and it turns out to be Lagrangian with respect to a new Lagrange function. And this Lagrange function seems to be have have Be have been unknown classically, and as I said, it has now been generalized not only for this elliptic context, but for arbitrary billiards and plays an important role in the theory of mathematical billiards in general. So, here is a non-standard Lagrange function for unit vectors. As a consequence, this Lagrange This Lagrangian map preserves the canonical two-form on the cotangent bundle of the unit sphere. And it turns out that the Pluri-Lagrangian theory allows us to prove the commutativity and moreover to derive the integrals of a billiard maps. This was originally a result by JÃ¼rgen Moser, but now we derive. But now we derive these integrals just from first principles, and nowadays one doesn't have to be a JÃ¼rgen Moser and to have the ingenuity of JÃ¼rgen-Moser to find these integrals. They just follow from the Lagrange function and the spectrality property, which I quoted previously. Here is a quick derivation. We just consider the exterior derivative of this ultra. Exterior derivative of this alternative Lagrange function for two values of the parameter lambda and mu, and one can evaluate this value on a very trivial concrete billiard trajectory, say a billiard trajectory along the peak axis of all the ellipses, for which one immediately sees that this quantity vanishes. So, vanishing of the exterior form is equivalent for Equivalent for the derivative of the Lagrange function with respect to the spectral parameter to be a common integral of motion for all the maps and also to the commutativity of all the maps. And so we just proceed and derive the integrals of motion of the maps by the standard procedure of differentiating the Differentiating the Lagrange function with respect to the spectral parameter, and upon a small amount of manipulations, we actually end up with Moser's expressions for these integrals of motion. And the moral of the story, once again, now these integrals of motion and commutativity of the billiard maps in confocal billiards follows just Follows just from the Pleurio-Lagrangian theory, and the integrals themselves follow from the spectrality property, which is one of the major features of the Pleurio-Lagrangian theory, and which is now the contribution of the Pleurio-Lagrangian theory to something which lies outside of it. So I think that this is the end of all third all three stories. Let me quickly summarize. Let me quickly summarize what are the added values of the plural oranges and theory. First of all, we understand and can prove the commutativity of multivalued maps with the help of the Pluri-Lagrangian formulation. Then the closeness of the Lagrangian form in one dimension allows us to find integrals of motion of the corresponding systems. In two dimensions, Systems in two dimensions it allows us to find the conservation laws for the corresponding system. Actually, it also works in the high dimension, but I had no opportunity to study this in any detail. It turns out also that the involuntity of the Hamiltonians in one-dimensional situation in the continuous time case is also related to the closeness of the multi-time Lagrangian one. Multiple-time Lagrangian one form. And also, this approach can be used and has been already used to classify plural Lagrangian systems, which is an important task in classification of integrable systems. So plural Lagrangian theory is one of the ways to attack the long-standing problem of classification of integrable systems. So, this is the end of the story, of the talk. I thank you very much for your attention.
