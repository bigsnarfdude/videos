Thank you, Zoom Robot Lady. I'm going to talk about illuminating polyhedra. Start with illuminating convex bodies in general. So imagine some blob on a plane because it's easy to draw. We pick a direction, illumination direction, and then we shine a spotlight in this direction. So we consider all the parallel. So, we consider all the parallel rays with this direction. Some of them hit the body, some of them don't. And part of the boundary is going to be lit up, and part of it is going to be in shade. And there's also some points that are kind of neither, right, between light and dark. We do not consider them illuminated. We only consider the boundary point illuminated if the ray hits it and then pierces the interior of our body. And for a convex body, And for a convex body, L of K illumination number is the most efficient set, like smallest possible number of directions that completely illuminate the boundary. And their conjecture says that in a d-dimensional space, one can always eliminate any convex body with two to the power d direction at most. And most of the times it's fewer, right? The conjecture also says that it. The conjecture also says that you only need actually two to the power d if you're eliminating an affine dq. Problems wide open. The complete proof is only available for two dimensions and even for polytope results. There is a proof for 3D polytopes with a symmetry, like rotational or mirror symmetry. And there's also proof for zonotopes, but There's also proof for xenotopes, but I think that's about it. So, and yeah, thank you. No, I think that that wasn't about it. So, when you illuminate a polyhedron, you essentially you only need to illuminate vertices. That's enough. Because suppose you have some polyhedron, you shine a ray on it. Some vertices are if they are. They are okay. Right, these ones are lit up because the ray hits them and then pierces into the interior. As for the vertices, like no more vertices are lit up, but you can see that the relative interiors of all the adjacent edges. Adjacent edges, right? Like this edge is lit up, this edge, right? All of them. And all the relative interiors of all the adjacent facets are also lit up. So if you illuminate the vertices of a polyhedron, you have illuminated the whole polyhedron. And my first idea was: what if we try and just take off vertices one by one until we cannot do it anymore? We cannot do it anymore, but that does not have a consistent effect on the illumination number. Sometimes taking away vertex increases an illumination number, sometimes it decreases an illumination number. So what if you take away the facets one by one? I don't know, but still I'm trying, right? So suppose you have, you know, you start with this cube with a hat, right? And you, right? A polyhedron is a, right, it's defined. Is uh right, it's uh defined by the bounding half spaces, right? And we start just what happens if we take the half space away from the set. Well, two things can happen: either you know the passage was safe, you know, if you imagine that there's something inside your polytope, like radioactive waste or expensive wine, something you want to contain safely, right? You remove this facet, the result is still bounded, spilled a little bit. Is still bounded, spilled a little bit, still contained. So, this facet I call redundant. And the word I just wrote is redundant. But what if you take away the bottom facet, right? It becomes unbounded. It spills infinitely, right? So it's no longer a bounded polyhedron, right? So this facet facets like these. Facets like these I call essential. And yeah, again, the process I have in mind, right, is we take off facets one by one until they're all essential, right? And the polyhedra where every facet is essential, I call them facet lean. And here are the results. And here are results. I classify these polyhedra. A polyhedron is facet lean if and only if the outer normals to its facet are a positive basis in our Euclidean space, which is also equivalent to a polyhedron being the product of simplicis. And from the last part being the product of simplicis directly follows the illumination conjecture for facet lean polyhedra. And the central idea of a proof is the fact that there's a paper from the 50s that done all the work. Here's what I don't have, right? And what I would like, would really like to have. I haven't found a counterexample yet. I know that taking away vertices one by one, right, it can increase or decrease the illumination number. I haven't seen the example where removing a facet decreases the illumination number. Decreases the illumination number. And since I know that we can illuminate facet lean polytopes by two to the power d directions, right? If on every step of the way the illumination number does not decrease, that could potentially lead to proven illumination conjecture for polytopes, which would be nice. Any questions so far? Yeah, I have a question for the men as well. Yep. So spaces limit means that if you can delete any faces and the if if if you delete any faces that the remaining part will be unbound. Yeah, exactly. So then it means that you have at most 20 facets basically and it's the necessary and sufficient condition that geometrically that just the normals contains the origin in the interior, in the interior of the convict scale. This error of the combined scale. Sorry? So that the normals contains the origin in the interior of the convex hull. And for what is it a necessary and sufficient condition? That it's that they are what is that these facets form a boundary. These facets form a bounded facet. So, yeah. I think I'm going to try to answer, and then you tell me if I answered your question or some other question. So, positive basis, right? Like, you know, linear basis, right? And positive basis is like that, but positive. Instead of linear combinations, we're only looking at combinations with positive coefficients. And a set of vectors is a positive basis in a two-dimensional space. A two-dimensional space if these vectors are all positively independent, right? And if they are positive whole, right, spans the space. I think one part you just get for free for being a polyhedron. Yeah, the other part you also kind of get for free. Like I said, it's yeah, does that answer your question? Okay, good. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that's kind of what I'm doing now. There's a paper from 54, theory of positive independence by Chandler Davis. I have a reference at the end, right? And it has the criteria for positive basis, right? If you have a set of vectors, it positively spans your space if and only if, for any point in the space, there's someone in your vector set who has a positive vector. Vector set who has a positive vector product, right? So everybody in your space has a friend in a vector set. And if you consider a polyhedron intersection of half spaces, it's bounded if and only if it contains no rays, right? Which happens if and only if any ray is not contained, right? Any ray you start from the origin is blocked by some half space, right? Which, and when is the, if you just imagine a ray from the origin, when is it? Just imagine a ray from the origin when is it blocked by a half space when the inner product with the outer normal is positive, so which is exactly the criterion, right? It positively expands if and only if we have bounded polyhedron. And here's the second part, right? Our polyhedron is facet lean if and only if outer. No, don't do that. The positive independence condition, right, is for any vector in your basis, there's some point in space such that the inner product is positive for that vector, but negative for all the other vectors. So, this is like everybody in your vector set has an exclusive friend. Vector set has an exclusive friend in the space who's no one else's friend. And again, okay, these are all straightforward. If you have an essential facet of your polyhedron, when you remove it, now your polyhedron has a ray in it, right? Which means this ray was blocked by your hyperplane H1, but it's not blocked by any other hyperplane, which means exactly this, right? Positively independent criterion. Criterion. And that's if we bring this together, right, we get the fact that a polyhedron is facet lean if and only if the outer normals are a positive basis. And another theorem I'm using: given a Euclidean space and a positive basis, any spanned subspace is a linear sum of minimal subspaces. So So spend our positive basis, right? It's we can have like for linear basis, they're all kind of same, right? But for positive basis in space, we can have we have options. So span subspace is when our basis has a proper subspace, subset that spans some linear space. Some linear space. For example, and the minimal, our basis is minimal if it has d plus one vectors. And minimal subspace is a span subspace where you have a minimal basis. Like, for example, go away. In 3D, you can have three options essentially. You can either have a positive basis of four vectors, just outer normals to a simplex. It is a minimal basis in each. A minimal basis in E3, four vectors, three plus one, and the only span subspace here is the actual space E3. You can also have five vectors, outer normals to a triangular prism. Then we have two span subspaces, right? Either this plane is a span subspace, and it's also minimal. And the vertical line is also a span subspace, that's also minimal. That's also minimal. And the third case is when we have six vectors, which are just plus/minus linear basis. Then we have six possible span subspaces, three lines and three planes. The planes aren't minimal, right? Only the three lines are minimal span subspace, right? In each line, you have two vectors. And for example, xy plane, it is spanned by these four vectors. They aren't a minimal basis in this plane. Minimal basis in this plane. So ask me a question because I should have written some of this down, but I didn't. Yes. So when you say any stand subspace with any positives, yeah. Yes. Oh, okay. Yeah. Thank you. Any standard subspace in this sentence with any possibilities. Yeah, yeah, exactly. In this sentence and everywhere else. Yeah, I mean. The minimum means that they're not they're not multipositive buttons. Sorry? Minimal means that it has D plus, like if it spans some D-dimensional space. Positively, yeah. Okay. If it span... I will finish my sentence and I will get back to you. Sorry. Yeah, if it positively spans a D-dimensional space, minimal just means that it has G plus one vectors. One vectors Davis or was that this number two? Yeah, yeah, I I have a reference in the end. It's it's the it's the yeah, it's this linear paper. Number two is Chandler Davis. Yeah. Two is Chandler Davis. Yeah. And yeah, this is given a space, a D-dimensional Euclidean space and a positive basis in it. Any spanned subspace of ED is a linear sum of its minimal subspaces, right? Positively spanned subspaces, including ED itself, right? So what it means is we can take our minimal basis, we can take our space and present it as some, linear sum of spaces. Of spaces, right? And in each one of these spaces, there's going to be some positive basis out of our u. Just again, like previous example, right here we have just one minimal basis, right? This is two minimal bases, right? And E3 is sum of line and the plane. And here we have three minimal bases, and E3 is sum of three lines. And each one of these minimal bases in its own subspace is a set of outer normals to a simplex. So our limitations on our polytop, right, we have, because our limitations are these half spaces. If we, the projection on each subspace is a simplex, right? So our polytope, our facet lean polyhedron, is a product of. Hedron is a product of those simplest. Any other questions? Yeah, I just kind of copied it from the paper. That's yeah, I'm only using the part of this theorem, right? I'm only saying that, yeah, I'm only using the fact of E that E D is linear sum of the minimal subspaces. I just, that's the way it was in the paper. That's the way it was in the paper. It works. So, yeah. You have these minimal subspaces for each of these type of planes. So, we have to do this. Oh, we have a direct uh sum of uh for the space yeah, but then you just uh what I think is in the end we just uh illuminate the corresponding subspace, and then it is a direct product. I'm just trying to understand what does the boundary space are about any oh I think that and So yeah, what the theorem says? Yeah, what does mutually span subspace? Well, yeah. Any positively spanned subspace. Yeah, so you you can uh yes, okay, okay, yeah, I think I get what you mean. Like the spanned subspace, right, is it is a it's uh it's a special term. It's a special terminal, right? It's kind of like two words. It's not exactly the subspace that's spent, right? It's a subspace such that there's a proper subset of our positive basis, right? So like for example, X, Y, Y, Z, and all the other planes. No, I started talking. I like answering, I like when I can answer questions. Let me have this one. Oh, good. So you have X, Y, Y, Z, right? You have these planes, right? You have these planes, right? And for each one of them, you can pick a proper subset of four vectors that spans them, right? But you can also say, well, I don't know, some cross-cutting plane is also a linear subspace. Isn't it positively spanned? Well, not in our terminology, because spanned subspace means we can pinpoint a proper subspace, subset, thank you, that lives there, right? And that does the job. Right. And yeah, we have we can split our positive basis into a bunch of outer normals to those simplices, right, in these subspaces, and our polytope turns out to be a product of those simplices. And then, yeah, the product of illuminate the illumination number of the products is less or equal than the product of illumination numbers. It's exactly what it says in the It's exactly what it says in the box, right? If you have two polytopes in two different spaces, right? One has some illuminating configuration, right? I don't know, vertex V1 is illuminated by U1. And the second polytope has a vertex V2 that's illuminated by direction U2 in this space. Then when you take a product, you just concatenate the vectors together. Then all the vertices of a product have this form, right? V1, V2. form right v1 v2 and each vertex like that is illuminated by a corresponding direction u1 u2 so essentially you can just take pretty much same configuration right you don't even need to alter it you just like multiply them by each other and it works right so that's what i'm using and that gives me the illumination conjecture for the facet lean polytopes polyhedra because since my Because since my polyhedron is a product of simplices, P1 Pm, I can write on this that its illumination number is less or equal than the product of the illumination numbers, and illumination number of the simplex is always number of its vertices. Yeah? Uh U is a lean polymer. A lean, yeah, yeah, exactly. Product of segments, segment is a simplex. So, yeah, you have you have these subspaces, right? You have this condition: d1 plus data plus dm equals d, right? And the way to maximize this product. The way to maximize this product is to have a product of segments, which concludes my talk. Thank you. Going to answer questions. Is it like okay. No, I would like online people to hear me. Oh, okay, I'll take this. Okay, of course. Can I can I ask a question?  Oh, can I ask a question?  So, my question would be that for the conjecture about removing faces, it was just that there exists a face that you can remove, right? Yeah, yeah, that would also work. Yeah. Yeah, but because it's not true that you can remove any phase. You can remove any phase, yeah, yeah, exactly. You're removing a facet that still keeps your polyhedron bounded. Yeah, that if your polyhedron is not facet lean, right, that then there are some facets we can remove, keeping it bounded. And yeah, you're right. Among these facets, there is you know, there is a facet such that removing it would not decrease elimination number. That would also. Number. That would also work. Yeah, but what I said is that it's not true that you can remove any facet. Can you give me an example? You just take the cube, the unit cube, with faces. Each coordinate is equal to zero or one, right? Yeah. It's two-hand faces. And then you take the face where the sum of the coordinates is d minus one-half. And now you can remove all the faces, which are each coordinate is equal to one. are each coordinate is equal to one and you are left with the you are left with a a simplex which has d plus one elimination number but your original body had two to the d minus one sorry can you can you uh go slower with the construction i'm going to i'm going to i'm sorry just take a cube and cut off one one one of its vertices well but we're not uh cutting off vertices removing a facet right means we Right, means we no, no, no, this is the polytope. The polytope has two D plus one faces, yeah, sure. It's the faces of the unit cube, uh-huh. And then one more face is where you cut off one corner. Yeah, sure. And the problem is that you can keep that face. Obviously, if you remove that face, then the number increased, but you keep that face and the other D opposite faces. So you remove all the faces which are adjacent to this. Which are adjacent to this small corner phase, then you are left with a simplex. So obviously, you had to decrease the illumination number. Okay, and what's the illumination? Okay, and if I just start with a cube with a cutoff corner, right, what's its illumination number? Well, the other corners, because the the the the it's two to the d minus one. Oh, you cut off all the corners but one? No, no, no, just one corner. If you cut off all the corners, then it's not true. If you have all the colours, then it's not true. Okay, thank you. Yeah, it's that, right? Okay, that's my polyhedron, right? Yes. Yeah, what is its illumination number? Like in 3D, for example? I would say it's at least seven, because there are seven corners which I didn't. Which I didn't well, there are uh, but and you need seven, so so it's at least seven, yeah. That's I'm a bit, I'm a bit slow with an audience, so I'll it's it's likely that it does contradict the conjecture as I stated it, right? So, yeah, I'll just need to give it some more thought. But yeah, thank you. Okay, any other question? Any other question? Okay, if not, then we thank the presenter.
