I'm David and the rest of the organizers for the invitation. It's delightful to be here, despite the weather. So I will speak about the topic that is the motivation why to start this research is rooted in my interest in Anderson localization, but at least the beginning of which that I have to motivate is somewhat independent. Is somewhat independent, so I ask for your patience in a topic that is maybe not so embedded in this community. Be that as it may, the way that I'd like to sell it to you is think about Anderson localization, which is maybe a sequence of statements that you'd like to make about a random operator. And these statements you'll make maybe almost surely, or maybe you'll make them in expectation. Or maybe you'll make them in expectation about some random variable. Go ahead. And we do know that given any one realization, any one random realization, which does exhibit Anderson localization, moving arbitrarily epsilon away from it in however you want, like in rank one epsilon distance weight, you immediately break everything like suddenly this. Break everything like suddenly the spectrum is singular or continuous, suddenly the transport may change. So, in a way, this study, this topological study, I would like to contain it to you, send it to you as a, there is yet another way to look at this question of stability of Anderson localization that is yet from another person, you do have to change the perspective because that one That one result due to Simon and collaborators decades ago. I mean, it just tells you that you cannot expect honestly some kind of stability of this phenomenon. All right, so to enter into this, I now completely change gears and I speak about some new thing in condensed metal physics, this topological physics. And there's this Um and uh there's this very beautiful table that uh uh uh is due to Pitai. Um he's the person who who organized it around 2001 and what he was saying is essentially take the space of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians and give it some kind of topology and calculate the TAF components of it. There's going to be some list of demands from these systems, for example, that they are insulators, and then in very Insulators and then in very symmetric clusters they will have these path components. That's a table that corresponds to dimension one. That's the focus of my talk. And in particular, when you have no symmetry which corresponds to the Anderson model that we all know and love, then there's just one component, one path component to this. And when there's this so-called scalar symmetry, which will play a role in this talk, then there's actually infinite. Then there's actually infinitely many components that are separated from one another. Actually, there's a whole thing. And this table would continue for up to eight dimensions. I'm not quoting them now. And then it becomes periodic. So it's some kind of new periodic table of exotic materials. So the way that I'd like to enter into this field is essentially understand this table where now the node. Be stable, well, now the notion of the insulator will be coming from under some localization rather than you know the physicists very bare-bones understanding of what an insulator is, which is something that is translation invariant and has a spectrum gap. All right, so that's the goal here, the ultimate goal to understand this table in terms of endosomal correlation. The end result that I present, which is together with my student Chung, is not a full solution to this problem, but I hope at least advocate why this problem is interesting. All right. So first, let me try to explain a little bit more precisely what is meant by this table. So we want non-interacting electrons. And we take them on the lattice, so we have some Hilbert space, which is this one. For the time being, I keep the dimension arbitrary, and I also allow some internal degrees of freedom. And then to specify a model, I take some self-adjoint Hamiltonian. It's a sufficiently little thing to restrict to bound. Efficient latest thing to restrict to bounded operators, so why not? And moreover, than being self-adjoint, I need them to obey two additional properties. First one being locality, which is just, so I take the xy partial matrix elements, that's now going to be an n by n matrix, and then take whatever matrix normal is, and I ask that it has exponential decay. Exponential decay in the distance. That's one thing that's definitely necessary, otherwise nothing makes sense. And the second thing is, well, it's in the title of the talk and it's a main feature, although now physicists are talking about systems that are not insulators, like semi-metals or actual metals, and asking such questions, but for now let us concentrate on insulators. Concentrate on insulators. So, what does it mean that this operator age is an insulator that requires some explanation of the majority of the major So, there is this concept of Fermi energy, and you can only say that it's an insulator of edge energy. And one way to understand it is to do what we call a linear response of Cubo formula. So instead of H, I will now perturb it to some H plus epsilon of V, where here V is an operator that corresponds to a constant electron. To a constant electric field, so for example, just a position operator, let's say in the J-f direction. That means I apply a field in the j-th direction, and I want to do perturbation in this epsilon. It's a little bit more complicated because you have to turn it slowly adiabatically in time and so on. But the end result is when you do this type of Kubo perturbation theory in epsilon, you get a faux, and let me quote you. You get a forward, and let me quote it. It's the conductivity along the i th direction due to this perturbation in the jth direction. So we're doing perturbation to the observable, which is the quantum mechanical current along the i th direction. And that, when you have time of erosive symmetry at least, equals the following expression. Expression that we all know so here I'm invoking the Greens function, which is the matrix elements of Of the resolvent. So the I and J just went from one to N or what do they do? I and J one. One dimension. So right, so this this discussion is general dimension, and so they would be in uh one to T. 1 to D. Or 1 to D, okay. Right, because for now it's still in D dimension. Okay, and where's the N come in here? N is not part of the game. It's not part of the game. Right, so we have that formula that at least when you have time-overs of symmetry, then you know it holds. When you have a random operator, then you put expectation value here. And from this formula, we get the meaning of what the meaning of of what an insulator is, because then the most naive definition, which is also the simplest one, is simply that the Fermi energy is not part of the spectrum of this operator. That's the spectral gap condition. And obviously, you see that when you have this condition, then you have what we call the Comp Thomas estimate, which means that. Which means that this kernel here is going to decay as epsilon goes to the real axis. So here you will have some ability uniformly in epsilon so that this whole thing is finite. And then of course when you take the limit epsilon to zero, then you get zero conductivity. So in the spectral gap region, this formula is somehow, you know, trivial, it's zero. It's just not interesting. So that's a stronger condition, but in particular, it means that at that Fermi energy you have zero conductivity, and so you would be content to call such a system an insulator at that Fermi energy. And another one, which is the more interesting one, is the mobility gap regime. So it's the one where you would say that the supernova of epsilon of epsilon times So that whole super room goes to has exponential decay. So it I'm I'm switching gears in between these two variants of conditions in two point A. I'm talking about deterministic operator in two point B. Operator in 2.B, I would say, well, if you have a random operator that for whatever reasons has this estimate, then the random version of this, which is by adding expectation value here, that thing is also going to be zero. You take one epsilon here, you get some mobility, and then the other epsilon will set you to zero. So that kind of condition is what I would call the mobility gap. They would call the mobility gap condition, because, in particular, it means that there is no mobility in that scenario. So, this is what would be most interesting, but let me start by talking about spectrograph. Yes. Yeah, but to make this actually, you don't need a full epsilon, right? I mean, you could take, sorry, in the formula 2.b, you could take a power which is larger. Epsilon could be with a power which is between 1 and 2. Which is between one and two. That is correct, but it just so happens that this is what people, I mean, there's a certain tension between what you would need and what actually proved. So Piccolo indeed proved the full power of this. That this is, you know, slightly stronger than the fractional moment's condition. You need to apply a finite rank perturbation perturbation theory one more time. So, you know, that. Time. So, you know, I think Jeff Schenke has some weird examples where you have functional moments, but you do not have these. So it's slightly stronger. All right, so and then to get to here, you actually need a little bit more. You you need also maybe symmetries. So the symmetries that you might may want to require are the following ones. Want to require the following. There are many possibilities, and physicists are the masters of generalizing to any kind of directions, but what became sort of standardized by now is these symmetry classes due to Auckland and Silenbauer that come from random matrix field, and they basically correspond to the following possibilities. So you have time reversal and you have particle whole. And you have a particle whole. Both of these are anti-unitary. And based on the type of system that you have, they could square to plus one or minus one. For example, if you have fermions, then time reversal should square to minus one. So each one has these two values. One has these two variants, and somehow there is a chiral symmetry which is the composition, and there is a somewhat exotic possibility of having only the composition, but not each one individually, which is exactly this rule here. So, if you count all the possibilities together, and by the way, And by the way, the way in which these constraints come onto the Hamiltonian are different. For example, for the first one, it is a commutation. Namely, we say that Hamiltonian is timevers of symmetric if it commutes with tetra. On the other hand, for particle whole, it's anti-commutation. And as a result, And as a result of this composition of twantunita, is unitary. Its square doesn't seem to matter, it can be gauged away. And because of these two conditions, for chiral Hamiltonian, it's called chiral if it anti-commutes with this pi. So, this is how these symmetry operators enter. And altogether, when you count them, you see that you have ten possible symmetries. This is also related to the To the 10 symmetric spaces or 10 Clifford algebras. It's actually all really beautiful connections if you have a flavor for algebra. So altogether you have these tens symmetries and once you fix this, you fix a space of Hamiltonians that have locality, that have some kind of gap, that have a fixed symmetry of one of these ten, then One of these 10, then please calculate for each pi 0 the path components and find this table. That is the charter that you are given with. This forum is not new, it's actually old, has been done. I mean, there's the table switch has already been done. First, it's been done when you assume translation invariance. Translation invariance, and that is the work that Kita have organized. When you assume translation invariance, and of course, it goes without saying that you also work in 2.A and not 2.B. Then, you know, there were the more sophisticated, non-commutative geometry people, Valisard, Schulz-Baldes, Podan, who managed to work in this In this disordered setting, so they do not assume translation invariance, but they do assume a spectral gap. However, they're using very sophisticated tools of algebra, so they can't quite calculate pi zero, for you instead. What they calculate is k0, which is a slightly weaker structure that is not exactly what we would want. Would want it's uh you know, I can't say, you know, for example, that that if K0 is empty, then there's still, you know, not further islands that would be detected by Pi zero. And so, what we did in this paper is do away with K-theory and perform this analysis entirely using basic tools. You know, basic tools so that you manage to recover the path components and not just K0. This we did assuming 2.A. I'd like to briefly explain this now and try at least to give a vista towards 2. So when you're deforming these things, you're doing your path calculation. So you assume that the symmetries are preserved, and you're assuming there's a gap all the time. You assume there's a gap all the time. That's correct. So it's a very, you know, that's exactly the point. It's a very natural thing because the space of invertible operators is open. So it's very easy, but the space under some localized operators is telling, I don't know what it is. But that's kind of the issue here. So let me try to give some flavor here of Flavor here of what what topological classification may mean. So let us indeed assume translation in biance format. What does that mean? It means that the kernel That the kernel doesn't care if you move along the diagonal. Right, and you know that in that scenario, when you have such a kernel for the Hamiltonian, then the Fourier series would partially diagonalize the operator, right? Partially, because there's still the CN part of it. So now with this. With this spouse series, I get a multiplication operator by the following, let's call it h hat, it's a function on the d-dimensional toes into Hermitian n by n matrices. And that map has several properties. Properties that stem from one, two, and three. So, for example, out of one, I know that this age, that this map is actually regular. So, actually, you know, for Wilman and Beck, that the more decay that you have, the more regular it is. And I think I wrote down exponential decay, so I think that would correspond. Case, I think that would correspond to being real analytic, which is something extremely natural that you have a duality in k-space if you have decay in dual space. Furthermore, I have two, so let me take two point A. Again, it is the natural thing to do when you have translation invariance. That means that if I now decompose the spectrum, then there are these eigenvalues that I can follow along the toes. And there must be some line, which is exactly the Fermi energy, that I will not touch with any of these eigenvalues. So it is not just any Hermitian n by n eigen. Any Hermitian n-byn matrices. These are n-by-n matrices, which moreover have some separation of the two eigenspaces below EF and above EF. Let's say the number of levels here is lowercase n. So actually this Hermitian n by n matrices are going to be replaced by the Kth Gossmannian over Cn. Cn, that is the space of, so not k but n equals, that is the space of n-dimensional rank n self-adjoint projections within Cn. And so actually it's a real analytic map into this. That's the spectral gap condition. And the symmetries that I require are going to change further this. Going to change further this Gosmania. So, for example, think about the case of having time-reversal symmetry. If time-reversal squares to plus one, then I have an anti-unitary that defines a real structure. So instead of taking the complex Gaussmannian, we will take the real Gaussmannian. If time of S close to minus one for fermions, then I'll take a quaternionic Gaussmannian because it defines a quaternionic structure. Let me Uh let me um give as an example uh the Keirl symmetry. Um so as a further example It turns out that when you have this so-called chiral symmetry, the Hamiltonian is given by this off-diagonal of this form, this supersymmetric form. And now if H has a spectral gap around zero, then S is invertible. It goes hand-in-hand error. So instead of taking this length end projection, These length n projections, you take the projection that is associated to this Hamiltonian, that gives you a unitary here, and the unitary is the polar part of this inverted process. So in chiral case, you take u n, the group of n by n, or n n of the two unitary vectors. Okay, so with that you you can already see Okay, so with that you can already see the non-trivial examples that would arise, and that is precisely essentially how K-theory is built. So particular examples you take D equal to 2, n equal to 2, lowercase n equal to 1, so no symmetry. So, and no symmetries, no symmetry in dimension two is exactly the integer quantum Hall effect. And so, I'm just concerned with maps from the two-dimensional toes into the one-dimensional Russmanian over C2. But this one-dimensional subspaces within C2, that's exactly the two spheres. So space, the homotopy classes of space, of maps, of Luleanalytic maps from the two tallest spheres turns out to be equal to be projected to z. And this map here is exactly what Physics called a churn number. So that that you know that's the mo most famous example within this business. Within this business. Then there was another example which is famous, but it's even simpler because it's in one dimension. And in one dimension, I will now, you know, the one to us is just a circle. So I take maps from the circle. And because I'm taking Harall symmetry, then it's just U1. So it's maps from the circle to the circle. Maps from the circle to the circle, that's just a winding number. It again has Z clusters. So that's how this table with eight possible dimensions was first constructed. Just for fun, you know, if you have a fermionic time reversal, then you take Then you take in two dimensions, then you take maps from the two toes into the quaternionic Glossmannian, and that turns out to be Z2. So these Z2 indices are quite exotic. There's, for example, no trace for one. If you know about it, then you mention it. Otherwise, you can ignore it. Alright, so that's kind of motivating you in case you like. Motivating you in case you like these pictures of toy and spheres. Now, back to analysis. So, let me concentrate now on the So for the remainder of the time, I want to drop translation imbalance. And at least as much as I speak now, I'll talk about the spectral gap condition. So that was 2A from before. Than before, and speak about this Kyler one-dimensional case. Why that? Well, because the Anderson model is just trivial in a sense, it's not so interesting to study that, although that is also part of the paper. But here you can kind of benchmark whether what you're doing actually gives you the desired result. So, alright, so I take this and so. And so I'm concerned with such operators, and because of the chiral symmetry, that really means that I have an operator S, which is local, as before, it has some kind of decaying kernel in the position basis, and it should furthermore be invertible. And I'm asking about taking some topology on this space of boundary. Topology on this space of bounded operators. And if I define the topology properly, then I should somehow find that it has z components. That's the goal now. The first observation that I'd like to make The last observation that I'd like to make is if I drop the word local, then things are going to be very simple. Then there is this famous theorem called Koiper theorem that tells you that invertibles invertibles have connected. So somehow somehow a locality has to enter in a crucial way. By the way, what what is this Koiper path? How is it made? It's maybe not how Koiper initially wrote it down, but Koiper would make a polar decomposition of your operator. You would then say, well, it's invertible, so the positive part I'm connected. Positive part I'll connect to one with the straight line homotopy, and then I still have to connect an invertible to one. So, how would they do that? Well, you can just take the logarithm, right? So, you have the measurable functional calculus, and that allows you to define the logarithm, and that's it for you. You connect it to one. So, somehow we need to contend with the fact that things are local. Second observation that I'd like to make is going to be crucial for the mobility gap question, which is kind of a famous question in condensed metal physics, in this field of topological phases in condensed metal physics, which is what are you actually classifying? Are you classifying states? Classifying states, or are we classifying Hamiltonians? So, in the single-particle spectrally gapped setting in which we're working, I claim there's no difference at all. But otherwise, this is actually an intricate question. So, in versus ground state. Ground state. So the many body ground state brought back to the single particle setting is exactly the Fourier projection. For reasons I will not elaborate on now. But the question is: you know, should you classify projections or should you classify spectrally gapped self-adjoints? Well, when you ask the spectral gap condition, it doesn't matter, but they The spectral gap condition doesn't matter, but they claim that in the mobility gap regime, in the interacting regime, it actually is a very different question. So, what's the technical term here? The technical term is that flat Hamiltonians, which are equivalent to Fermi projections, flat Hamiltonians are deformation diffraction. Are the formation diffraction of Hamiltonians? What does that mean? Well, I mean, you have your space of four Hamiltonians and full homotopy. You somehow squeeze all of them just to the circle. That's just a metaphorical picture here. But the actual homotopy that I have in mind. Actual homotopy that I have in mind is this one. So sine is a measurable function that you can apply on the Hamiltonian. In the spectral Gappy, it can even be taken as continuous. And I claim that because of the spectral Gappium, this is a continu a no operator non-continuous function of the Hamiltonian. Continuous function of the Hamiltonian, so that this is actually the formation of the fraction. Foucom Thomas, it preserves locality. It's also because sine is an odd function, it preserves the symmetry, so that actually in this space of, you know, opposed by 1, 2, point A, and 3, this is actually the formation of the fraction. So it is for me sufficient to calculate Pi zero of flat Hamiltonians. Well, in the Kyol setting that I'm concerned with, flat means instead of taking an invertible, I take a unitary. So now I'd like to show that phi zero of unitaries, which are local, Which are local is z. Right, so uh, how do we do that? Um, there's an elegant way and there's a less elegant way. The elegant way involves a very slick function of analysis, but the price to pay is that that notion of locality is a little bit different than the one I presented. So initially I said that locality is going to be the exponential decay in the position basis of the kernel of the Hamiltonian. Now however, I'll say that I decompose my only in 1D, locality in 1D. I'm going to tweak the definition up. So I have in 1D a separation of my system. Want a separation of my system into left and into right, and so I can say lambda is projection to the right. And I'm asking, any operator can be decomposed into this left-right decomposition. And in principle, there are going to be matrix elements between left and right. And I'm asking that these matrix elements are compact. That's what locality will mean for me now. Why do we choose that? Because a compact commutator condition is inherently functional analytic. It's something that is a sister algebra. It's very easy to deal with. It's, for example, going to be preserved under the functional calculus. So now I'm concerned. Now I'm concerned with the following question. I'm concerned with unitized u, which have a compact commutator with a fixed projection. And I'd like to show that the number of path components is z so I won't have really time to explain. I won't have really time to explain why that is true, but let me give you two flavors for this. So here's one point, which is that if your uh unit that you started with happens not to cover the whole unit circle, Unit circle. So its unit spectrum is somehow a subset of the unit circle, but let's say it has a gap. Then it's going to be very, very easy to locally connect it to the identity. Why that? Because now in the logarithm of U, let's say this is the gap. This is the gap, delta. I can take now an analytic version of this logarithm that has the branch curves in delta, and if I do that, then the analytic function on calculus is going to preserve this modelity. It's actually very easy. All it would ask is that the logarithm is continuous. So in that miraculous concept, In that miraculous condition, where somehow this unitary has a spectral gap, then it's very easy to form the local path to the identity because you just take a coiferous path that's disking. And that connects you to the identity. But okay, so what? And another observation that I'd like to point out is if somehow, for whatever miraculous reason, you have zero commutative, not just compact, but really zero, that actually in this left-right decomposition, it is of this form. Right? That's what it means, to commute with Lunder. And each of these values. And each of these blocks, ULL and UYTY, is separately unitary. It shouldn't do anything with the system. So each block is separately unitary. And if that's the case, then I can take Coypel's path on each block independently. And all I need to obey to keep this condition is that the off-diagonals are compact, but actually they're going to be kept zero throughout this path, which happens only in. This path, which happens only inside of the block. So, in this miraculous condition, you also know exactly which kind of local path to take towards. So, what's now the general solution? So, you take arbitrarily u and z, which are unitary. And have a compact commutator with lambda. Then I need a way to locally connect U into V, but not always, only when they happen to sit in the same island, in the same path component. How do we measure that? Does an index which is There's an index, which is a non-commutative version of the winding number. It's exactly this. Only when the two indices are the same should you expect to be able to connect these two logons. This is a third horm operator exactly when the commutator is compact and when the two third hormones And when the two third-home indices are equal, only then should you expect to connect them. But this index obeys a logarithmic property. So instead of connecting u to v, I can, which have the same index, I can connect u v star to the identity, and u v star, if u and v have the same index, then u v star has index zero. So now the question is how to connect an index zero to the identity, and in terms To the identity, and it turns out that only if there is an index zero can you take a generic unitary which is local and decompose it into a product of two of these cases. The general maybe I'll end with this. So if u is local and And the index of it is zero, then u equals A times B, where the spectrum of A is not the unit circle and B actually honestly commutes with lambda. That's a a factualization here that you can prove. Here that you can move. So, this gives you now basically the full solution to this problem, but in the spectral gap regime. Now, trust me, that there is a way to do this in the whole symmetry clusters. The proofs and the factorizations are different, but there is a way, that that's the content of this paper. And if I had more time, then I would explain to you to what extent can you say something about two point B. Say something about 2.B, rather than 2. The spoiler is you can say something, but it's not extremely honest. So, thank you. Thank you very much. Any questions? Yes. I have a question concerning your warning that in this interacting case, it makes a difference whether you classify Hamiltonians or whether you classify ground states. Ground states. Is there a physical reason that one should classify either of them and the other one is less useful? Or can you just say a little bit more about it? So I think for the question of our community, like understand localization, it is definitely the classification of Hamiltonians that we want. Because we'd like to understand, you know, too, if we change the distribution of the potential, just the potential function itself a little bit, you know. Function itself, a little bit, you know, what's the fate of Anderson localization, which would essentially be the fate of the decay of this thermal projection in a very vague way. So I think for us it's very clear what's the right answer. Then for physicists, they repeat all the time that it's only the ground states that make sense to classify for many body quantum systems. Because that is your system, that is how you prepare the experiment. You put it in a certain ground state, and then you want to see that you can or cannot homotopy to another. I have to confess, you know, that this answer, when I spoke to physicists, it was never very deeply motivated. That's just what they said. So the K0 you talk about? Which K0 are we talking about? And so what you talked about in the end reminded me more of a K1. Is there a connection there? That's very observant. So very generally speaking, if you have a vector bundle of a sister algebra, then K0 would be the classes of projections and K. Projections and K1 be the classes of uniters on that sister algebra. So, indeed, you know, here we ended up talking about uniters, that's actually K1. So, in the sister algebra, sort of the smaller sister algebra that contains the class of operators you can separate? Yeah, basically. I mean, very seldom collaborators, they define this non-commutative real and so on, et cetera, but yeah, you could take, you know, the sister algebra generated by the Hamiltonian by you know, by a by a good specimen Hamiltonian. Good specimen Hamiltonian. For integer quantum Bohr effect, you know, it is the projections that you want to classify. If you happen to have some symmeters, then suddenly you go to K1. In the real classes, you go to K5 or whatever. It depends on the symmetry. But there's a way, you know, instead of talking about different K1 or K5 or whatever, you always talk about K0, but the field on which you're doing quantum mechanics is now free. Mechanics is not a critical algebra, it's a complex algorithm. Well, we have no further questions, let's take Jack of the time. So, I suggest we actually take a ten-minute break and resume at four, is it twenty-seven? Something like that. Ten minutes from now. You want some seats or I'm gonna point this nice little chair.
