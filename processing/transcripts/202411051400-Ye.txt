So, my topic is about cell migration. I just heard from Professor Tong. Actually, there were a few talks discussing about cell migration already. It's glad to know that. So, this is the outline of the talk. First, a little bit about the introduction. Little bit about the introduction. I believe most people here know all this problem better than me. So, cell migration, we all know, is important to many biological processes, including wood healing, embryo development, and also tumor invasion. So, our interest is on about how the extracellular matrices may. Matrices may regulate the behavior of cells, in particular the cell migration. So, we all know from a physical point of view or mechanical point of view, so ECM is a disordered 3D network. It's a protein fiber cross-linked by some folding as well. So, it forms a disordered network, but it has a multi-level complex structure. We want to understand how the Understand how the mechanical property and maybe also visco elastic property or the ECM and this microstructure or ECM therein may influence the cell migration and how do they mediate intercellular communication. So I will explain from three levels. First, we want to understand how this We want to understand how this ECM may mediate this single cell dynamics. Then I move on to mechanical communication between cells and then collective cell behavior. So this is the main setup we will use in our experiments. So we have a set cultured on top of gel, collagen gel mostly, sometimes match gel. Mostly sometimes match gel. And we have bees embedded inside the gel. So we can check the displacement of the bees. And then from the displacement, then we can get the deformation of the gel. Then we know the force exerted on cells. So now we mostly check the trajectory of cells. So this is just a typical example. Is just a typical example of the trajectory we observed. On the left, we are showing it like the trajectory of cells on top of a collagen gel. On the right, that's trajectory of cells on top of a solid patch dish. Now we can see clearly the difference, right? So for the trajectory on the left, it's more persistent. So it's like if we, and here it's much less persistent. Much less persistent. So that way we can say the ECN really enhances this mobility of cells. We can further quantify this mobility or mortality of cells. So mostly we look at this MSD, how the mean square displacement of cells change with time. So then we can get a slow. So, then we can get a slow and then we can compare how the cell mobility changes. So, then we move on to investigate a few particular type of cells. We first focus on a mycoglia, which is a type of immune cell in our brain. So, we all know it's important to maintain a healthy brain and also a lot of studies. And also, a lot of studies have shown that microglia has this chemotaxis properties, which means it can respond to chemical signals. It will move toward the direction where chemical, the concentration of some particular chemical molecule is higher. So it will move towards the higher position. And also there are some studies showing. And also, there are some studies showing it's a durotaxis, it can have this in addition to this chemotaxis, it also shows this durotaxis behavior. That means it can respond to a mechanical signal as well. So, here we just first we focus on see how the trajectory evolves with time. So, we can see now for a single microglier, so we So we can divide each trajectory into two parts. The blue, as I show in this movie, blue parts and the red parts. So blue one, you can see cell will move slowly, for in the red part, the cell actually move very fast. So then we can further, so we call it one, the red part is like a motiles. part is like a motile motile state and the blue part is a quiescent state. So and if we look wait long enough and also look at many cells, we can see actually the cells that will update is a random walk model. So it's purely the direction is isotropic. It can move any direction obey this isotropic symmetry. Isotropic symmetry. So, if we apply a signal, a mechanical signal, so now the cells will actually move toward where the mechanical stimuli is applied. So, now it's not isotropic, it's anisotropic. So, the direction distribution of the trajectory, you can see clearly here. It's sorry. Yeah, yeah. So, most Yeah, so most of the orientation of the trajectory is pointing toward the source of the mechanical stimuli. So then we further quantify this distribution of the duration of each run or the fast or slow state. So we can see now that these two states, we compare it to the when you're talking about It to the, when you're talking about two states, this reminds us of this famous Luang and Tambu model of bacteria. We all know bacteria have this famous Lang and Tambu model. It will swing fast toward some particular direction to get food or whatever reason. So then it will stop and tumble and decide where to go next. So that's the strategy of bacteria. The strategy of bacteria to be to survive and to find the source of foods. So, and now, so for the two, for this long and thermal model, one most important characteristic is that the duration of each long state or each thermal state will obtain exponential distributions. So, you can see here now, this is for long state. For long state, these are for the tango state. So, this is a log semi-log plot. So, it's a straight line. So, that means they obey an exponential distribution. Then, if we compare now our distribution from this microclier, so this fast and slow stage, the duration of these two states distribution also obey. Distribution also a bay is an exponential distribution. So, and we can also compare the other characters, this orientational, how they select the orientation of next step. So, they also obey this runtime diffusion process. So, these two are actually quite similar to each other if we compare this trajectory. This trajectory and the orientation and all this distribution of the intervals. So they are quite similar to each other, but somehow these two systems are actually quite different from each other, very distinct from each other. So for the bacteria, they live in a fluid space. And for cells, they live in a tissue. For bacteria, they live in our brain. Brain and well-packed environment, and then for the basically for the bacteria, so they respond to chemical signals. But here, of course, the microarray also respond to a chemical signal as well. But mostly now, in our experiments, they respond to mechanical signals. And the physics behind it are different. One is this low Reynolds number fluid mechanics. Fluid mechanics, one is the mechanics of this physical elastic medium. So they are dominated by a different physics, and the scales involved are also quite different. But somehow, from a statistical point of view, they obey the same mode or motion. So, and we also look at the other type of immune cell as well. So, we observed quite a few immune cells. Immune cells and they actually obey the same statistics, the same as actually as the GLIA we just showed. And also we move on to look at other type of cells, not just the immune cells. So now we look at this epicilia cells. So and for the what happened to the not to the trajectory of this adherent type of cell, the epicilia cell. Epicidia cell. Now, they we found so the one big difference now for uh microglyer most time they they don't move only 20 percent 20 percent like out of the total time the sales are moving but here for every cells so 80 percent of time they are moving so and also one another difference is like even when they turn here when we see here when Here, when we see here, when we see turn, they still move quite fast. We cannot now distinguish this turn and the straight, moving straight, these two states by their speed. We have two now, but still now we change another type of description. We can still distinguish these two states from their angular velocity. So now for this, they are moving like it's like a straight. They are moving like it's like a straight line, so the angular velocity is quite small. And for at this point, the angular velocity is large because they change the direction. But during this turn, all this run state, their speed distribution is actually, they are similar to each other. We cannot distinguish from the speed itself. But now, if we like now. Except that now we can divide these two states according to the angular velocity, then we can see now this distribution of the interval or this we still call it Luang and Tambo state. So they still obey this exponential distribution. So we can see now this two state model still holds, but now we need to use But now we need to use different criteria. So that's something we recently found quite interesting on the single cell level. Then we move on to the second part. Then we want to ask what happened now for not just one cell. Then if there are two cells or many more cells. So first on the like two cell couples level. So we all know now. So we all know now cell moves, so they will actually exert force to the surrounding ECM. And then the force can be further transmitted to a large distance. And the cells that move close enough to the cell, to the cells exerting force, we can see the cell will be pulled and To be pooled and two sales will be attracted quickly. So, and also there's a threshold between these like two cells when they can feel each other. When it's large enough, the distance large enough, they they actually don't feel the presence of each other. Only when they stay close enough, then they feel the the the force and will be attracted. Force and will be attractive. And the threshold distance actually decreases when the stiffness of the gel increase. So the softer the gel is, and the larger the thresholding. So because we can explain this qualitatively, but we don't still have, don't have a theoretical model to exactly. Model to exactly reproduce this, and I hope Jimmy or someone here can help us. That would be great. So, then we further we can to verify this, we can use a laser ablation technique. We can cut the collagen fiber between the cells. Then we can see now the cut will be pulled larger and larger. That verifies that the force, they really are. Force, there really is a big force existing between these cells because of these elastic fibers. In contrast, if there's no cells, no force, then if we cut the fiber, so the cut stay in a line shape, nothing will change. So then we start to develop some model, but Model, but we obtained some results, but still not quite what we want. So basically, we model the ECM. It's just a disorder network. There are fiber and cross-link, and then there are focal adhesion from the cells. So the focal adhesion or the cross-links of the network, there is a dynamic formation probability. Formation probability. So the probability is proportional to the configuration of the whole system is proportional to the harmonium, is determined by the harmonium of the whole system. So if the energy of the whole system is higher, then the probability of such a configuration will be lower. So then we can compare. So then we can compare the results from the simulation with our results from the experiment. We compare the shape, how the shape change with time. Then we can get some sort of estimation about the force between the cells. Then we move on to so the results I just talked about is for my For my epicilia cells, then we want to understand what happened when we change the cells to neurons. And the similar thing happened here. So now neuron, the synapses, they will extend along the fiber here. So I mean, this collagen fiber will guide this connection of neurons. So this you can see here. So there is a fiber. So this synapses. Synapses, so they will extend along this fiber. And during the extension, so the gel will be deformed. Now we change the neuron to microphage and the cancer cell. So we can see now the cancer cell because they will deform the collagen gel. And then the microphage. Then the microphage can sense this mechanical signal. They can move toward the cancer cell and kill the cells. So the targeting efficiency with the presence and without the presence of the ECM. So the efficiencies are quite different. So with the presence of extracellular matrices, so the targeting efficiencies can reach Age can reach larger than 50%. But result that on the macrophage and the cancer cell on solid patches, the efficiency is only about 10%. So then, so it's like now we have cancer cell, so cancer cell will deform the substrate. However, microphag them cells don't produce that much Deals much deformation on the ECM. So, microphages here stay as like more like a signal detector. So, but for cancer cell, it's more like a signal generator. So, they will send out all these mechanical signals that will be received microphase stay nearby, and the microphage will move toward the cancer cell quickly. The cancer cell quickly. Then the question we ask is: now we know cancer cells, there are many, many different types of cancer cells. Some are more invasive, some are less invasive. So for those less invasive, in situ cancer cell, what will happen? So for in situ cancer cell, we can see this generate also large force. They can deform the ECM. Can deform the ECM very effectively. But for this metastatic type of cancer cell, so that's much less invasive. So this type of cancer cell, if we culture on top of the colin gel, we don't see, actually, we don't see much deformation of the ECM at all. So the further deformation field you produced is Information field is produced is somehow undetectable. We don't see any. So it's like a metastatic cancer cell, very weak mechanical signal will be sent out, like microphase. So then now what will happen if we now co-culture the cancer cell, this metastatic cancer cell together with microphage, also on top of ECM. Now it's a ECM. Now, if we compare these two together, here on the top, now we have this in-situ cancer cell with microphase. So, because of the large deformation produced by the in-situ cancer cells, the microphage, this here is a red one, red one microphage, they will move quickly to this in-situ cancer cells. Tissue cancer cells. But for metastatic cancer cells, highly invasive cancer cells, the microphage, they don't detect, they don't know the cancer cells are there. So because the in-situ and the metastatic cancer cells, they don't deform the ECM at all. So this here we showing some this uh uh structure of the ECM. Of the ECM. So here with this in-situ cancer cell, you can see the structure greatly changed. But for this metastatic cancer cell, the structure somehow stay more or less similar. Author, the cell couched for six hours. So that way we can see now the metastatic cancer cell can achieve this immune scape. This immune scape by hiding its mechanical signal from the microphages. So they don't trigger the microphase checking at all. That way they can like escape and maybe migrate to otherwise. So then we want to verify. Then we want to verify that the mechanical signal really matters here. So we can apply some mechanical stamina to microphages. So we will compare what happened if there's a large mechanical stamina compared to a small mechanical stamina. And all these results confirm our observation and our assumption about this mechanical interaction between microframe. Interaction between microphage and between the cancer cells that play an important role for this cancer cell immune scheme. So now let me move on to the last talk. I believe I still have five minutes. Okay, I will move on quickly. So we talked about single cell cell couples. Now we want to have Cell, cell couples. Now we want to happen what happens there if there are a lot, a lot of cells. As a physicist, we are more interested in such type of questions because we want to say after what we want to use the word collective. We want to start with physics can be used more effectively. So, anyhow, so now we compare this. These are from experimental observation and these are from simulation. This is from simulation. So, for a cell group with small density cultured on top of collagen gel, they stay away from each other. They don't remain segregated. But for the cells with a larger dense state, culture on top of ECM, on collagen gel, so they will aggregate, they form this aggregated pattern. They form this aggregated pattern. So, also, we do some simulation with something we call it active Brownian particle model. Each particle is like a Brownian particle, but there are some interaction between these particles with the force, which is proportional to one over alpha, R to alpha. Alpha is like now the this index alpha. This index alpha, the value of the alpha will depend on the microstructure and the mechanical property of the gel, which is usually like smaller than one because the gel has some sort of structure. Now, and we further want to ask if that there is a shape for the boundary or the cell population has a shape. Population has a shape, how will the shape influence the final pattern of cell aggregation? So we compared like three type of cell boundary. One is like data hole inside a cell population, and one is like this is like the cell. Now it's a circle boundary condition. Cell stay inside the circle. Inside the circle. And then there is another third type of like there is a line or there is a gap between two cell populations. So basically, there are two cell groups divided by a large gap. So then we want to ask what these three patterns end up. So if there is no force purely from this random motion, right? random motion, right? All these, so this will expand if they are only random motion. So this they will expand and become diluted and diluted. And here for this pattern, the hole will be filled. And also here, the gap will be filled because of the random motion. But now the situation is different because there are force transmitted by the ECM because we ECM because we now all sell the culture on top of ECM. So then the results are quite different. Now, for this pattern, so first let's start with this one. So for this pattern, now the cell will be attracted to each other because now the density is high enough, as I mentioned in the beginning of this part. So there will be a Part so they will be attracted to each other, they will stay aggregated, and then for here for this line shape, this gap will become wider and wider. So, because of same reason here, so this cell, this all these cells, they will be attracted to each other. They will be moved toward the center of this side, and this another part here, they will move toward the other side. So, the gap. Toward the other side. So the gap becomes wider and wider. And then for this here, so it's actually hard to predict what happened. But for this, for the side of the hole we use, we can see now this hole will be filled up. That's because if we look at the boundary, now the cell, they pull, that force is like transmitted tangential to this circle. The circle. Then that way they will somehow produce this force pointing into the center of the hole. So that way the hole will fit on. And the really matter here is not because of the force transmitted by the ECM. So we can to verify that now we also detect the stiffness change during this process, so aggregation. Uh, process so aggregation. So, and also we compare three different cases when there's no cell, so the stiffness of the gel is the smallest. And when the cell density gets larger and larger, this stiffness of the gel gets larger. And also, we can like weaken this fiber bundle formation, and then we can see now. And then we can see now this weakening of this five bundle does reduce sales migration. And also, we do some simulation, but I don't go into details. And then we another part, like now we mix cancer cell and epicelia cells together, but with the presence of the ECM as well, we want to ask what happens. And then we also observe something abnormal. I'm going to skip all this and run to this part here. So, for such a system, we then can get a phase diagram. So, now we have this y-axis, which is the force transmitted by the ECM. And the x-axis, now here is, we call it the effect of temperature, basically that how fast the sales, epicla sales. And how these cells may, how the swounding cells may affect the pattern of the cells we are interested in. So we can see now if the swounding cells moving that fast enough, they will cause the aggregation pattern change just to a mixture pattern. So that's it's like an effective temperature. We all know temperature increase and the system will change. The system will change. And so now let me jump to this summary part. I will stop here.
