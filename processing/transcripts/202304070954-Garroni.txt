We'll talk about three-dimensional high-intension limits or nine similarities and applications. Thank you, Maria. So, well, first I would like to say that this conference has been very nice, and Saturday today is cloudy because I was hoping to have a nice walk in the afternoon. But it's a very nice place, and that was very nice, so I enjoyed it very much. So, I'll try to somehow give you some ideas. Somehow, give you some ideas on some three-dimensional models for line singularities that I had in combination, some three papers with different combinations of Sergio Bonte. Martino Fortuno is a student of mine, Roberta, Marciana, and Carlos Cano. And well, I mean, just a general general uh uh introduction, not really want to stress too much this. I mean uh the idea is that uh uh these light effects and increased doubts are responsible for many effects and these effects are visible at different scales. So you can you see here some sort of microstructure of effective crystals. These are called low energy dislocation structures, so are believed to be related with related with some uh sort of uh energy minimization uh uh uh results. So some of uh we we know that plasticity is about moving dislocation, like you discuss, but uh somehow there are many interesting effects that are responsible for armpoling and and and so and so forth that uh are related with the leading minimization of energy. And this is the the case of uh And this is the the case of microstructure of dislocation and somehow is also the case of the repair. So the idea is try to go a bit somehow at the beginning of the story and so look at the problem from the microscopic point of view, if you want. So start from the crystal effects and try to model these blind effects. These line defects at the scale, you should just see the energy concentrated on these lines. So, this is the picture that also Tom showed yesterday. Lots of simulations that are based on this idea that somehow these line effects can be modeled at some scales with energies which are concentrated on design. So, these energies of some ideas. These energies are. These energies are what I'm calling line tension. So, just on a general approach, you start with the idea that you want to derive some energy which is concentrated on lines in 3D. So, there are these objects that I will expect more in details. Most of you already know very well, but just give me the vocabulary, the gifts of this field. This filter, so you have this object which are one-dimensional rectifiable lines in a 3D, and at each line you attach a multiplicity. This multiplicity is a vector, so this vector belongs to a set of admissible vectors, the so called Brugel vectors. In general, it's a lattice. So for in this talk will be V da V or a multiple of V dash V, but I mean this is not really a constraint. This is not really a constraint, just uh just to simplify the notation. And uh and uh for topological reasons that will be clear in a minute, uh this uh this measure is uh so similar to what was uh the one who was testing. So this uh this these lines are in general loops with constant multiplicity because multiplicity is quantized. Or if they have branch points, if branch points, the multiplicity should be summed up to zero according to the orientation. To the orientation. So, a quick way of writing this is a matrix value measure osmotri with B times for T, where T is the tangent gamma times the one-dimensional outward measure constant. Okay, so these are the objects I would like to describe. These are the so-called discriminations, and so just they have been described already by Tom, quite detailed. Quite details, but let me just give you these two alternative descriptions, which, in my view, correspond to two different possibilities of describing them with some continuous variables. So, one point of view is just to look at the situation at the discrete scale in which you see, so the situation is exactly the edge of this extra plane of atoms that you see in this. Extraplane of atoms that you see in this picture. So, in nature, they are kind of identified. If you have a sort, essentially you are locally in a single crystal, so you are in a region in which you have a local order, but at some part of the crystal you have some somehow misfit, which is due to the fact that there is an extra lane of atoms. So, dislocation, in a sense, as Schilder says, As Schimler says, is an object that does not exist. So it can be identified with the edge of this extra plane. Actually, what you see in the picture that we have seen, let me go back, this picture, these are exactly these lines. And actually what you see in this picture is really a region, a tube around this edge, which somehow has stored elastic. Where there is a stored elastic, high elastic distortion due to this fist fixed. So, this is what you see in the microscope, the amount of elastic distortion, which is then somehow concentrated on a region that we call the dislocation core, the core of the dislocation. The topological nature of this object can be clarified in this way. So, you see that there is a local order, as I was saying. So, local. Saying. So locally, as Tom was somehow stressing, locally you can map this material configuration to a reference configuration. So locally you can identify each cell with a cell in somehow in an order, in a crystal structure. And then if you do that, you realize that whenever you have a defect, then you draw a circuit around this defect. draw a circuit around this defect and you do the same thing with the multiplication that you were performing in the reference configuration you get a non-closed circuit. So you get some extra vector which naturally belongs to the possible vectors of the lattice which is the multi-blood we have in this configurations. So there is another point of view which So there is another point of view which is very old, which in fact goes back to the beginning of last century, which is due to Volterpa. So these in the mechanical community are known as these locations Ada Volterpa. And so what Volterra, so actually what Volterra was doing was was computing the lasting distortion in some pre stress domain which are made of uh silhouettes where you cut them on on one ray. Up on one ray, and either you slide vertically or horizontally. And somehow the idea behind this construction is that these locations, if you look at the plane, which is a zip plane, these locations are a sort of boundary between regions that underground different strips on a slip plane. So this is the procedure, idealized procedure of Abu Terra. So you cut on a plane, you cut You cut a portion of this plane and you slide this portion, then this produces some sort of accumulation of atoms in correspondence to this line, and this is the dislocation line. Okay, so I'm keeping this two pictures because I want to show you two possible ways of using continuous variables described in this model. And so, one way is to start from this idea. is to start from this idea. The idea that locally you have an identification, you have a map which somehow so it could be in a sense at the discrete level is a piecewise affine map, otherwise it's a map when Uskradian describes this identification, a map from the material body, so the defect body to the reference configuration. So this map will be then a map from omega, which is our defer the form domain. The form domain to three by three matrices. And these somehow worker singlets that I was stressing at the beginning are just described as a constraint on this beta. So beta is such that whenever you take a closed circuit in the domain and you integrate, so here there is a misfring, this is the tangent to the circuit. So I was correcting on the On my slides there, but I forgot that I already took them precisely. So, whenever you take a circuit around the line, but even not in the line, so whenever you take a closed circuit in your body, you integrate beta on the circuit, you get a a vector which belongs to the multiple of uh synthetic. So, this epsilon somehow stays for reminds the status phase on your This lattice phase of your underlying lattice. So, another way to say that is that the curl of eta is concentrated on lines. So, I mean, this is not said and this is not clear here. So, this might be any region. The constraint that we put on the domain is that this curve is concentrated on one dimensional curve with this type of multiplicity. Another possibility, which will be somehow described very quickly in some of the models that I will show you, is this one. So Adabal Tepper. So instead of taking this matrix, so you consider a case in which you have some kinematic constraints and the kinematic constraints is that you only have lips along one plane. So you can only create these type of singularities on that plane. Of singularities on that plane. And this, as I was saying before, these lines are due to some discontinuity of the jump of the slip. So then you use a variable which is the slip along this plane and then somehow you consider the deformation which has this taste, given taste, so you assume that you have to deform your body, the freaking body. Body and the only constraint that you have is that your deformation can have discontinuities along this plane, which are the zip. So this is the zip along sigma, and u is the formation of the full body. You take u being SPV in this three-dimensional body with a constraint that the The constraint that the gradient of U is either absolutely continuous with respect to the effects outside sigma, and if it jumps, jumps only on sigmas. Can I interrupt? So if I'm understanding right, those two things live in different domains. The first one lives in the default domain, the second one is the reference domain. What reference code includes. So one other rather the reference, this I would say, oh sorry, this I would say is like a way of this it's not really the reference, it's like a way of describing the deformation that produces the in fact this is very much related with the linear theory. So I have mentioned this because some of the results that I will talk about are in this context, but I have Are in this context, but they have some constraints that when you confine the resolution to a plane and you use this linear theory, you don't need these constraints. So you have very general results in this concept, with some limitations in the possible journals. So let me stick on this Volterra point of view. So Volterra takes the body, which is a cylinder, and computes the elastic energy of this quantity. Actually, what it does is compute the elastic energy of Energy of line symbolized in the whole of R3 with a very classical computation. And so the idea with that point of view is to take this field that jumps along this half plane here. Then you take the equilibrium equation in linear elasticity, as you were saying, for this feed U. Same for this feed u. And we assume that on this plane you jump by a constant vector v exactly in the so I mean I'm writing in some modern notation this configuration over here. And so what you see is that the gradient of this field behaves like one over the distance from the line and so the elastic energy in this tube has has a behavior which has so which has diverges when the inner radius goes through zero like the logarithm of this inner radius is proportional to the length of course of the of the line so to the height of the cylinder and then as a pre-factor which is the one that we call the line tension energy so somehow the line tension energy is the Tension energy is the leading order term of the elastic energy induced by this effect. Okay, so this pre-factor that here is just it looks like an approximation can be actually calculated exactly with a minimum curve. So, assuming that beta with the variables that I was describing, before assuming that beta. Describing before assuming that beta is constrained to have a curl concentrated on this time, you take the elastic energy of this energy and well, I mean this notation is just because this cylinder is the vertical cylinder, instead we want the cylinder oriented in the t direction. And then you divide by h log uh r over small r you say the limiters small r to go to zero. That a small after zero, and you get five. Right? Okay. So there is one first problem, which we at some point we realize, that this quantity that is the usual quantity that is considered the length tension energy starting from linear elasticity, so starting from the elastic tensor, if you plug it in this integral, so you could. Integral, so you consider somehow a class of functionals that are defined of one-dimensional rectifiable measures or with this structure with this energy density. In general, this might be not low-sevicontinuous. So it requires relaxation. And we have explicit examples of that. So we have explicit examples, even on the isotropic elasticity, with parameters that give you With parameters that give you non-loveled continuity of with energy. So, I mean, this is a cartoon to say what type of situation you have. So, you have that, which is always the case when you have relaxation, that a straight line with this energy can be approximated with the zigzag energy, with some oscillating configuration, which decreases the energy. Which decreases the energy. So you need some relaxation. Okay, so you do it. So you can start from this quantity that you defined with the self-problem form, this asymptotic analysis, and you relax it, including microstructures. So I don't really want to enter too much on how do you define this relaxation, but it's the typical way of defining relaxation. So you take a box with boundary condition, you mean my. With boundary conditions, you minimize the among all possible ways of going from one way to the other, which includes the possibility of accounting for possible oscillations. Okay, so the idea is that we would like to see if this type of energy density, that line tension energy, can be really derived from the original intuition, so from the idea that you have a body with lines in the right. Body declines in varieties which induce some elastic distortion and starting to and that really this leading order energy can be obtained in terms of gamma convergence rather than some sort of approximation. And I mean this has been done in several locations, in several models, several others. I'll have a slide on that. So here they found that So, here the content of this talk is to go on three-dimensional model and non-linear elasticity, just because we wanted to account for some of the pictures that we were seeing at the beginning. So, I mean, these networks of lines somehow they really have a geometry, so it's not really points in a two-dimensional body. And also, when you do an analysis for grain boundaries or things like that, you want to. Boundaries or things like that, you want to account for large deformation or large rotation in different regions of the domain. So, you really want to account for non-linear theories. So, these are the main assumptions that we consider for our energy. So, we start with an elastic energy that will be computed on these fields that I was describing at the beginning: these fields that go from the material body to three-meter-matrices. And the energy density on this matrix should satisfy an imbalance condition. That since now we are going from the form to the ref, it should be the opposite of what we are used to do. So this invariance should be invariant under change of variables. So for gradient is p. If you change a variable on a function, then you can put the gradient so you have the right multiplication with the. The right multiplication with the matrix. So, this is exactly the invariance that you want. In particular, this multiplication, the right multiplication doesn't change the kernel. So, you want the energy being variant on this right multiplication with the rotations. And then we require the growth condition, which is from above and below of this type, so a mixed growth condition. This type, so a mixed gross condition. It could be mixed, could be not, so p could also be two. So either you behave like the square of the distance from, so this is a three-wheel poster, from the three by three rotations, or when you have high uh um uh values of uh of P, uh you either you you you take the P grows that might be less than uh And so, since we require some regularity on C, so that C2, somehow we have a natural way to be linearized around the identity and then next to each other rotation up to a change of variable. Okay, so let me first observe that. Let me first observe that the computation that was done in the linear context a la Voltaira for understanding the behavior of the animals, and the main tool for that is the rigidity estimate of the physical James and so rigidity estimates allows you to estimate that this Allows you to estimate the distance from a constant rotation with the distance of your field from the full set rotation. The rigidity estimate of Free Syria James and Mueller is in terms of gradients. Here I'm stating the rigidity in terms of a field which is curl free in this uh cylinder. So might have might have some uh uh curl uh in the line, but it's curve free in the domain. Line, but it's curvedly in the domain. So, to tapping the domain and applying the GD estimate to the different pieces of this domain, where so I mean, so I don't know why the GF any function. The firm. So, why is there a German? What do you mean? What should it be? I mean, I'm not sure. Why should we have energy which looks like it's an estimate from below the bottom? It's just that you want some. That's where it's confusing because it's elastic energy. Yeah? Assuming exactly the same kind of thing that you assume for the same thing. I mean when you are so I don't really want to too much, but I mean I mean so when you are in a region in which A is a gradient and actually is in general this is the case, we are always working in some dilute region. So this will not work if you have too many dislocations. When you are in a region in which A is a gradient, your map will be vertical and so you can really rewrite your energy in terms of the o the Your energy in terms of the inverse of this map. And you will have those properties. So it's up to a up to a rotation. So it's just this property, just rewrite this property in terms of the inverse of the map. So I mean, I'm not really insisting too much, but it's really natural. I mean, it's really the main difference is that the main point in working the material body is really that you don't want Body is really that you don't want reference configuration because the presence of the defects does not allow to really label in the point as in perfect practice, which is the paradigm behind the continuum mechanics, the analysis approach. The idea that you write the energy in terms of the gradient, because in mind you have that you are labeling all points in terms of some underlying structure, which is not the case here. So you can do it. The case here, so you can do it just locally in a region in which you don't have the effects. That's the only way you want to. But I mean, when you are aside the defect, it is to approach R Sam. When you write growth conditions, I mean, this is for the A as it goes, as it grows, goes away towards the final. I didn't understand one word of what you said. So, when you say growth conditions, that's for when A goes towards the final. Yeah, I mean it's just that I mean it's really not. It's just that, I mean, it it's really not a growth condition. So it's a growth condition at infinity, but also at zero. So it's from what's going on. From my question, like, why is it close to rotations? It's because it's also means for A close A, so one well, in other words. Well, one way of saying it is because this must be true. That could be true for more than one well. Okay, this is an assumption. I mean, I'm not saying. Okay, this is an assumption. I mean I'm not saying that this is the most general model you can imagine. Ma I I should think about that that this is really what you need, but uh what you want to say is that uh so as there is all the stories of why you should have other so outside the defects you have a perfect elastic crystal which in general will undergo very small deformation actually. James Mueller estimate in terms of this beta, which is curved from this cylinder. With some fair you can also show that the constant depends on the H and R. agents are in the right in a good way. And using this uh estimate uh uh once uh uh you so you remember so if you remember we insert we introduce some small epsilon here which is somehow at the sides of the Burkina spectrum. So once you take a field which has a singularity on this line and you take the energy and this field you can prove I mean this is the standard I mean, this is the standard computation that I'm not repeating here, but somehow using this simulation condition and using Jensen inequality, you can prove that whatever you take as an energy, you always have this bum from below with this logarithm, the ratio, taking the inner radius being a sine out. So, this is just to say that the computation that you do in inner elasticity, once you have this. Elasticity, once you have the GDT estimate, can be done also with the general energy and gives you again a behavior of the energy, which is epsilon squared, which comes from the Purge vector times the logarithm of one website. So the energy diverges, even if you have some sort of organization, and even if you have a mixed growth. You have a mixed growth. And this is the reason why, in general, in this model for dissolution, you need some regularization. So I was saying I take this W this energy W, but actually, this is not the real thing. I mean, I think this is energy W outside the core. So this is why I was insisting that it's really outside the core. And outside the core, in general, you have, I mean, outside the core, you have very fast decay of your. The decay of your finger. So it's very close to identity or to a given potential thanks to the HVDS deed. So the idea is that you always have a problem with the core, with this type of energy. So you cannot really take the energy in the whole of the domain. So there are several different approaches, and in this paper, we somehow use the unified way of saying it that proves that somehow all these approaches are equivalent. So one possibility is just to remove a neighborhood, an absolute neighborhood of these lines from the domain of integration. So you just look at elastic energy outside the ball. Another possibility, which is the one proposed by Crucius Cartier and Katerina Zechieri in a paper in a two-dimensional contest, is to use a mixed growth. So really taking So really taking the energy that behaves as P power with P strictly less than 2 when you have high values of beta, which will be next to the core. And I mean, because the singularity due to the line is really the singularity that has a problem. So that's the reason for the logarithm. So it's really the sharp. The sharp threshold. For equal two, you don't have integrability, less than two, you have integrability. So, in this case, the core has a finite energy, so you really can use the full energy in the domain omega. Or a third possibility is to take your measure 2, which is consistent on one line, and modify the scale epsilon. So, again, in a sense, you'll have elastic, so you will not see big difference outside. Difference outside, so outside you have the beta, and inside we have something which has finite energy because it's spread the single electron reached the magnitude of the side and side. So, in a sense, the way I understand these two possibilities, which are kind of interesting, is that if you combine structurally, so yeah, if you combine, so I don't know why I put one and two, so I think it's two and three. So, if you combine, if you look at close. If you look closely to these two possibilities, in a sense they are made when you take the full energy, you essentially take the energy outside the core, plus this term and the corresponding term in this case, which essentially measures the core, measure the total variation of mu. So it's a sort of a model described that gives you total values. This strike that gives you two terms: elastic energy inside the core and something that penalizes the core. In the spirit of what Marcelo Bozzitere was doing in a very old paper into dimension for three dislocation, and in the spirit of this very promising approach of altering house for carrying boundaries. The idea of having two type of effects that are encoded in this image. So So, in fact, in our case, we study the asymptotics of the energy as the lattice basic goes to zero, but we don't know how to do it in a general without some extra assumption. And the extra assumption that is needed here is the well-separation of this line, which in the case of two-dimensional models. Which, in the case of two-dimensional model, will be points that cannot be too close to each other. Here is we assume that these lines are polygonals that have sides or segments, that sides that are not too small, with angles that are not too small. So they still can approach whatever, because these lengths and these angles go to zero, but slow enough in order to be to allow. uh to allow some uh computation. And the computation that uh you want is that if you take a piece of this uh line, you take a cylinder around this line, you have length and angles that allows you to take a cylinder which is fat enough, and you compute the energy in this cylinder and you use that your lower estimate as before, and you see that you estimate your energy with epsilon, log epsilon. Your energy with epsilon, log epsilon, essentially, times the length of this time. So, in a sense, as a consequence, you get that your energy is bound from as a bound from below, which is epsilon square log epsilon, times the total variation of so the well separation that is needed to control the total separation of this uh uh this variation that's from uh This was controlled from above. So this is a list of papers that have been results that have been obtained in this context. So this is a generalization of many things that have been done in different directions. In general, the majority of the results are in two dimensions. So assuming that your domain is cylindrical and the line or straight line, so you have quite simple line in the central dimensional domain. And this can be done. And this can be done either with well-separation or not or without assuming well-separation. The orange dots are the papers without the well-separated weight-separated dislocation in the context of linear L C, non-linear CC and for discrete models. And this is a reference, which is a bit vague, to instead a sort of intermediate situation in which you have lines. In which you have lines, so you have line objects, not points, so you have some more freedom on the geometry. But as I was stressing before, you confine the lines of being on one plane. In this specific case, you can use the sleep as a continuous variable to describe your deformation. And then this produces a model that I don't want to describe because. I don't want to describe because it's already very involved, but the model which is a space-friend model, sort of non-local version of Modigamarto, and then somehow an evolution of what Albertic Pachei were doing. So a sort of H1R norm plus some multiple potential. So this is just to say that when you are in this context, you can do the full analysis. Whatever I will do Can do the full analysis. Whatever I will tell you can be done in this context without any assumption of weight separation and you prove all the result that I will now tell you. Ten minutes. Okay, so this is the theorem. So we are in a three-dimensional situation. We take an energy which is escaped by epsilon square log epsilon because this is the bound that we have That we have starting from this lower bound of the energy. So, here somehow either you remove the core or you modify or you take this growth. These details are not really needed, do not affect really the result. So, the result is made of two pieces: one is the compactness statement, and the other one is the gamma convergence. So, the compactness is It's saying that whenever you have a bounded energy which depends on mu and beta, and the relation between mu and beta is that curl of beta is epsilon. Well, no, this epsilon is not here. Anyway, so curl of beta is mu epsilon. So if you scale mu epsilon by one other epsilon, this converts to a This converts to a U with the same structure. And then there exists a sequence of rotations which converge to a given fixed rotation in the limit, a field in L2 with curve field, such that if you essentially remove from beta epsilon Q epsilon, or you apply Q Epsilon transport to minus 8 and you escape by Q this came by epsilon square root of log epsilon. This converges to the field eta and q with q, which is the minimum between three and half, say say three half, three half d if it's convergent. So you have some convergence of this field near the rotation, the limiting rotation and the gamma limit then depends on this. And the gamma limit then depends on these three variables. The limiting measure, this curve field eta, and the rotation, and this elastic energy in eta plus the line tension term. And the line tension is exactly the line tension that we have seen before. It's the relaxation of this line tension computed allow the so therefore straight influence relations. Just let me remark that in this gamma unit there is a so In this gamma unity, there is this texture term, which is the rotation q, because essentially what you are saying is that in this regime, epsilon squared all epsilon, you force your energy, so finite energy configuration to be close to a given rotation. So, what happens is that you linearize your energy close to that rotation, and so you see somehow And so you see somehow the corresponding line tension energy for the linearized elastic coefficient obtained linearizing a dead rotation. So a couple of uh comments about the proof, which is very volatile, so I don't really want to bother you. I don't really want to bother you with the details, just to say that one key ingredient in this proof is this rigidity for incompatible fields that was first obtained in dimension two by Wilders Garbier-Zeppieri and is actually a non-linear version of what we obtained with Leonium Possibion for the core inequality, which is saying the generalization of what generalization of what uh uh uh physical championship did. So if you have a field uh and you know that on this field that this field belongs to a set to measures, so it's a measure, then you can control this distance of this field from a given A given fixed rotation with the distance from the rotation and the total variation of the curl. And in R3, this is possible only up to the power v over 2, which is n greater than minus 1. So using this bound you Is bound, you can actually remember that the energy controls the total variation of the curve, and remember that the energy controls the L1 distance, rescaled at one distance from rotations, and you get the estimate that allows you to obtain the compactness. So you say that you are close to a given rotation. Okay, well, maybe this is. Well, maybe this is too detailed. I don't know whether I have time to say it, so maybe I'll do it in one shot. So, once you have this, the heuristic behind the lower bound is described in these three steps. So, you first essentially, just because I want to tell you why you have this rotation here. So, rigidity tells you that you are close to a fixed rotation. You are close to a fixed rotation up to an error. Okay, and then you perform the change of variable that we were seeing at the beginning. So you take beta, which is beta in a rotated framework domain by this q epsilon, so multiplied by q epsilon transfer. And then you use the invariance of the energy applying this rotation. Applying this rotation, you change variables, so now you are in the tube that is rotated with respect to the one that you started with. And then you linearize the energy somehow because you know that you are close to this rotation, so now you are close to the identity because it's a rotated field. So you linearize the uh the energy and now you use some other characterization uh of the line tension in terms of uh the energy, the the elastic energy. To the elastic energy in the cylinder. And so you estimate with this energy here. And now it's the rotated cylinder, so you have this rotated act. And then you collect all this computation in the different cylinder and essentially you obtain the lower bounds in the last energy. So I concluded five minutes, I hope. I have three minutes. Okay, but this is just to say that this is one step. So, this is one step. So, we got starting from a three-dimensional model this length tension model. So, the second step would be to, instead of taking length tension models, going to diffuse dissolution density, as also Tom was suggesting, the idea that somehow plastic behavior can be modeled by this dislocation density. And the idea is that dislocation density. And the idea is that dislocation density are somehow superposition of small of many dislocations with small weight. So in a sense, it's the idea of approximating a slip which is continuous, with this wise constant slip with small height. And so in in in in this term you working that we have done is to take the elastic the the line tension energy we obtain in the limit. We obtain in the limit and scale it in order to obtain exactly this equation. So you allow for slips for a distribution which have multiplicity, which is a multiple of sigma of the V, I'm not finishing. And then you rescale the energy in order to have many jumps. So, okay, I mean, I think I'll skip this. So you can homogenize this model, and then you'll think. Model, and then you obtain a model which is defined on divergent spin matrices, in three by three divergent spin matrices, in which here you have a further relaxation. So I skip this slide and I just keep all the slides because this is the end of my talk. So just to say that this is a step in order to go directly from my last plastic. Plastic. So, and then somehow you can diagonalize this argument and obtain direct with a different scaling, you can obtain directly continuum distributional dissolution. And just let me conclude with these two pictures. So, I didn't tell you this, but some other idea is that if you start from the elastic distortion, single dislocation, dilute regime, you first observe some sort of Observe some sort of relaxation which is going from say discrete effects to blind effects. Line defects relax on the line tension energy which is relaxed and then if you combine many defects you obtain densities and so this was a picture that so this similar example here suggests that if you want to obtain a major which is diversion free because A measure which is direction free because it's a constant matrix times the Lebesgue measure, and this constant matrix into D, for instance, can be this. Instead of approximating that with, say, just vertical and horizontal lines, you'll get a better energy if you do this type of circ structure. So this is saying that somehow you have relaxation at two different uh scales, sorry, two different scales. Two different scales, some more mesoscopic scale and macroscopic scale. And maybe this is going a bit in the direction that you were suggesting, that this essay should remember these microstructures or maybe young nations are more fit. So it's not worth being dated. So in your rigidity result, you said something like the range was up to 3 over 2. Yeah. And you said something was the. Yeah. And you said that it had to be that, that? Did you say it had to be up to three over two? Like that? No. It's actually n over n minus one. Well, what's the reason for that? Well, the reason is kind of easy. So easy in the sense, it's deep but easy. So it's the fact that if you take the the the system divergence of a field equal zero and curl of this field equals uh uh in n one In n1 over nature, the sharp regularity that you get is n over n minus 1. And the way you obtain this estimate is really starting from the principal James and Mueller estimate for gradients and somehow subtracting the field that gives you so. Field that gives you, so you take the solution of this system, divergence field curve given by a curve of beta. So you subtract this field, you get the curve-free field, then you apply the HDD estimate, and then you use the sharp estimate on this field to obtain the estimate for can compare the good fields. So it's just because it's the sharp regularities, j the s the the the sharp personality that you can get uh for fields with curved animation. Fields with curved animation. So, for instance, this is not true in R2. In R2, there is another reason why the sharp unit is R2, but in R2, if you have a measure which is a D-dact mass, you get that the field is N L P for L P less than two. So if the field uh has a curl which is a measure, you have a uh the light of L P might see there. Exactly. Is that the British Burger result on this? It was in the early papers that I read this video by Ember is not that ever quantitative Haush, but in in two dimensions uh there are gonna be no restrictions, but So in two dimension is two. No in two dimension is less than two, no? Because of the derived mass. Because of the derived mass. Okay, I'll take a look at the paper. I'll show you the paper. I remember nothing about restrictions on the intercommunity, but. I mean, this is the example that they teach to the students, then on the exact form the single light one over x, this cannot not be in L2. So this this diluteness, um so then you said as the as a consequence of you then get that the energy control holds the mass in this particular way by epsilon on this at the right masses. Is that the only place you need it? I mean basically as long as this estimate holds you get the get these results or do you need to dilute with something else? So it's actually more. No, so it's actually more than that because so it's it's simply not not true that you control the total mass with the energy. So, no, it's in two dimensions, for instance, we did it. So it's a it's a has been done by us, by Ginstein, so it's an adaptation of the uh cold construction for this pulmonant also. For this Burland diabol. So it's really that you have diaboles. So this somehow have two effects. You don't have really weak convergence, but you have just convergence, flat convergence. And of course this is a kind of strong difficulty of the lower bound because using the lower bound is like that. We can isolate the effect of all that. So in two dimensions it can be done. So if you want to Can be done. So if you want to repeat the argument three dimensions that has been done in the context of USB land over here, it's tough because the slicing argument cannot work. So it's repeatable. But in the case in which everything is confined to a plane, so then a part of the model where you have a phase feed that you have B V and so on, so there you can you don't have any this time in general. This is such diluted scale, but energy scaling is not really. This is given by the energy scaling, you just have to get it right. Sorry, we've been the last speaker of the
