Thanks a lot for the invitation to Van and to the opportunity to see the talk. So this is a joint work with Maika and James and it's really funny because as we were preparing to come to Banff, I always thought that Micah is invited to Banff. And I kept saying, because she's visiting Twitter, I kept saying, like, oh, we will also. I kept saying, like, oh, we'll all talk in bath. And then she was like, I'm not invited to bath. And just a week ago, she was like, you knew something. Anyway, so let me say what I'm going to talk about. A graph is called non-lonely colour graph. If there exists an edge coloring such that number one every vertex is adjacent to at most two edges of the same color. And two every cycle contains every cycle does not have a color which appears only once. I'm not saying it's a proper edge coloring, I'm just saying that every vertex can see its two-bounded coloring, you can see the same colour at most twice. But every cycle, if you see a cycle and some color is just used once, this is bad. So three is only here, so we are not happy. The conjecture by Babai from 1978 says that graphs which are no lonely color, they have bounded chromatic number. There exists an absolute C such that if G That if G is lonely color graph than chromatic number of G's that must be color graphs, please. Yes. Yes, thank you. This conjecture is motivated by another conjecture he made at the same time. And it says that for every C, there exists a household C such that all minimal Cayley graphs have Have chromatic number at most C. I haven't told you what minimal Cayley graph is, but I'll tell you in a second. So the point is that these non-only color graphs are in particular minimal Cayley graphs. So if you prove this conjecture, then it implies this. This is open. This, this is open, but we have disproved this. Unfortunately, this does not disprove this because our construction is not the Cayley graph. But let me tell you what the minimal Cayley graph is. So if you have a gamma group, S generator said, S is called minimal if S generates Gamma, but no proper subset of S does. And just a reminder, what the Cayley graph is. Cayley graph gamma S is a graph. I'm going to consider the undirected version. So it's an undirected graph on vertex set. At gamma where AB is an edge if either AB minus 1 or DA minus 1 is the degenerator set. If S is a minimal generating set, then the Cayley graph is called minimal checking. The Cayley graph is called minimal Cayley graph. It's the rule. So if S is minimal general heating set, then chi comma s is called I don't know. As for clarification so, As for clar clarification, so co condition one, it says you there could be more edges with the same colour, but each with different same colours, right? You can have more, lots of pairs of edges with the same colour. Yeah, I'm saying that the colouring doesn't, number one, he's saying the colouring doesn't have to be proper. So the vertex can be adjacent to two edges of colour. Well, if you say most two edges of the same colour, so you could have two edges of color. So you could have two edges of colour A and two edges of colour B. Yes, yes, yes. It's a two-bounded coloring. Yes. Because then Kaylee graphs would be of this kind. Okay, yeah, that's just. So it's not, it's easy to see that minimal, sorry, what am I saying? Minimal Kayleigh graphs Are normally color graphs. Well, the way to see is that you take a cycle and you, well, the coloring is basically whatever, the natural one you get from the generators. And if you see a cycle where an edge uh a color appears just once, that means that that generator you can throw away. It wasn't minimal. It wasn't minimal. Okay, good. About what's known about this conjecture, so there's an open question. We don't even know, do there exist minimal Kayleigh graphs of chromatic number at least five. At least five. So recently, Garcia Marco and Closta Mauer, they give an example of a mathematical But no example known for chromatic number. Okay. They also strengthened Babai's conjecture and said, what if you actually ask for the corporate economy? Conjecture. Strongly strongly no lonely graphs have found a chromatic number, and this was why first of all. By Marcia Marco and Costa Collia, sorry, thanks. And by strongly, I mean that edge coloring is proper instead of too bounded. Okay. Okay, so what we have done, we showed that the conjecture is false in this sense. So false. And the theorem we proved is the following. That for every G, for every K, there exists a graph, there exists a normal only No lonely color graph G I will say GG such that actually it's strongly, no longer color graph such that the chromatic number is at least k and the worth of g is at least G is at least three. Unfortunately, it is not the paleograph. It's not the killer graph. So it doesn't prove anything about the linear kilogras. So there was already a control result of otherwise conjectured. Looking online to try to understand what you mentioned. No, I don't think there is a control. Maybe Micah gave a talk. So maybe you saw her talk abstract somewhere. But Baba also had other conjectures. But I noticed it wasn't a counterexample of Ms. Trump. No, there is no counterexample of Baba's conjecture. So this is the first counterexample we know of to both the To both the strong sense and the weak sense. There is another conjecture where there's no cycle. Each edge is a different colour. So there's some stronger thing. Oh, okay. Okay, so I don't know about this other conjecture. By Koya's by right. So Coyer gave. That's kind of how we got back into the problem. Slightly different conjecture. Okay, so as you can see, we are trying to construct a graph G, which has a high chromatic number, and well, we don't really need for the conjecture, the graph is something Gebster will get. We get, we don't really need to construct it. And I also need to give a proper edge coloring, which satisfies this loneliness property. But just to remind everyone, the heart construction for graphs G with say, Say a chromatic number at least K and girth G. So the reason why I'm reminding you this construction is because our construction is motivated by this. We are using the same similar flavor to get our graphs. Okay, so what you do. Okay, so what you do is your G1 is just a single vertex and for let's suppose you have constructed GK and let's suppose N is the size of the vertex set of GK. Now you take a big ground set, T and T will be actually T has to be of size K minus 1 times M plus 1 but and then what But and then what you do, so T is an independent set and then what you do is you pick a set I of size N and you put a copy of GK here and you add a perfect matching in between and you iterate. And this graph is gonna have chromatic number at least k and At least k and first at least 6. So our construction. Did you do that for every subject I? Yeah, for every I. For every I in T outsides N add a copy of GK and put the perfect matching in between. And you can show that the coloring number is K, chromatic number is K. So we are going to do something very similar, except it's not going to be independent set here. The ground set is going to come from some specific auxiliary hypergraph. And the matching is also not going to be an arbitrary perfect matching. Not going to be an arbitrary perfect matching, it's going to be based on some specific labeling. So, to do all of that, I need to define some special hypergraphs. So, let me do that. So, I'll say this is now a truncheal hypergrass. This is a name that don't blame me for. This is James. James, this is James' choice. So, what's a triangle hypergraph? We say an R uniform hypergraph is trying to kill if there exists a family of labels. Of labelings of edges. So I want some family lambda. So this is going to be maps of for every edge, they're going to map it to 1 to r with the following property, such that for every walk, Such that for every walk, sorry, for every closed walk, w so this is like any walk in the hypergraph, f0, s0, v1, dot dot dot, up to v0. I will define something, but the Define something, but an auxiliary multigraph. I'll define what this is in a second. So I'll call it the projection of the walk W with respect to lambda in H is bridgeless. Okay, let me define what this thing is. When you say family labeling edges, do you mean one labeling for each edge or whatever? Yes, I want to label every edge with one, two, r. So a vertex receives different, possibly different labels if it's in one edge. So maybe in one edge it receives one. 1, 2, 3, maybe this is in F1, but in F2 it might be 2, 1. So it has two labels. So what is this graph I'm talking about? So P W lambda is the projection of the walk W loop with respect to line. with respect to lambda in energy. And the vertex set of this graph is just 1 to r and the edges of this graph are so you take your walk and you just keep adding. So the first edge I saw So, the first edge I saw was F0. So, I'm gonna add the edge with the labeling with respect to F0. So, V0, the labels of V0 and V1 inside F0. Then I'm gonna go to the next edge, which is F1, and the first vertex there is V1, and then lambda F1, V2, and so on. So, maybe let me draw. So maybe let me draw a picture. So let's say this is my walk. I'm assuming this is also a hyphograph. So suppose I have this walk. Let's say this is F1, F2, F3. And let's call these guys A, B, C, D, E, F. Okay, so this is a walk. W is A. Is A, F1, C, then I go to F2, E, and then I go to F3, and I finish at A. And now my projection graph is just a graph, it's an R is 3 here, so it's just a graph on three vertices. And now in F1, okay, so I need to give some labeling, let's agree some labeling. Labeling, let's agree some labeling. Let's say I give in F1 1, 2, 3. In F2, maybe I give this guy 2, 3, 1. Okay, 1 was a bad choice. 2, 1, 3. And then maybe in F3, I give this guy 2 and this guy 1. Okay, so now in F one, the start and end have 1, 3, so I add an edge there. 1, 3, so I had an edge there. Okay, this comes from F1. Now in F2, the start and the end in the walk have colors 2 and 3, so I add an edge. And then in F3, the start and the end of this edge have 3, 2. Right? So I will add this guy. So what we want from this hypergraph. This hypergraph is to satisfy the following: that there exists some labeling of the edges such that every closed walk is going to give you a multi-graph which is bridgeless. And we are going to use this hypergraph in the construction when we do the analog of TATS construction, and it's going to give us lonely color graph. But first, I have to tell you. But first I have to tell you that such graphs do exist. So it's unclear at this point why they do exist. The truncal graphs exist, so for every For every G K there exists an R there exists an R uniform hypograph which is triangular and has chromatic number sorry H at least K. At least K. And by chromatic number here, I mean in the sense of the one so Freddie today talked about. So chromatic number meaning that every edge sees at least two colors. In that sense. So the chromatic number is at least K and the Girth of H is at least G. I will not prove this lemma. What does Girth mean? Okay, Girth is for. Okay, Kerth is Burschkert. Two sets intersecting two points. Is that what it's true? So I want it to be like this. So cycle will be of this form. So there are distinct vertices, x1, x2, x3, like this, x, whatever, comes back. I don't care how they intersect here. I want these guys to be distinct. So what if I had two vertices in the in the same two sets? In the same two sets. This guy, okay, what is your next? That's a two-cycle. Yeah, the two-cycle. Yeah. So it's first cycle. There is the other one, blue cycles, where you want this disjoint, but I don't know. Okay, so KERT is a switch. I won't give formal proof of this, but let me say where you get these graphs. So it's actually something Janos today mentioned. So if you take the hypergraph, so Graph. So you take vertex set. So let C D be the D uniform hypergraph on Z D where every edges of this hypergraph are going to be of x plus R E 1. X plus RE1, X plus RE2, X plus RED. And this is happening for every X in R. So for every X in Z D, every R scalar. Is the construction clear? So this is an infinite Python graph, but what it does But what it does, what Galai-Witt theorem tells you, that it has unbounded chromatic number, right? Because in any coloring of set D, fixed coloring, you are always going to find a monochromatic set of this form, which tells you that this graph has unbounded chromatic number. While I read 3m implies Cd as unbounded chromatic number. Okay, but we want a finite graph, finite typograph. Actually, there is a result by their name's Prommel. The name is Prommel and 90. Who it says that there exists a dock graph of Cg such that this is finite still has unbounded chromatic number. And um actually also has large parts. So from C D you can actually extract a finite graph which has unbounded chromatic number and large curves. What I haven't told you is that you can show that C D is tranquil and tranquility is preserved under Is preserved under removing vertices one can show that C D is triangular. So the labelling you actually take is the following. So Behave is the following. So for every f of form x plus r d1, x plus r p d okay I hope it was clear that EI spread the standard basis vectors of safety. But the labeling you take for f is you label every x plus r e i but by i. And I claim that these guys are going to give you truncal uh labelings. Labelings. They're going to witness the tranquility of the hypergraph. So the outcome of all this is that there exists for every G K R, there exists an H G R K such that H is triangular. Is triangular and finite, and it's R uniform, and its chromatic number is at least k and the current is at least Now if you give me three more minutes, I can tell you why task construction how does task construction work. How does TODS construction work? Hopefully. Shall I say one? Okay, shall I say what's true? So, okay, so again, the construction is inductive, you start with a single tongue, and now we take some grounds at t and my ground set t is gonna be just e of h of this hypograph. This hypograph. And what I want is: suppose I have constructed GJK, and now I'm trying to construct the inductive step. So, for every edge F, so I'll take for every So, I'll take for every edge in my pH. You make a copy of G JK and I want to say that here H is going to be the hypergraph with the property of, so it's going to be R uniform curved is going to be G over 3. Curved is going to be G over 3, K and R uniform, and R is going to be the size of the vertex of the previous graph, so GJK. So my edge F has size R, and so does my graph GJK. And now I'm going to put a perfect matching in between again, but how I'm going to put it, so this guy, the vertex set of this guy, is on. Of this guy is on R. And I'm going to join I to a vertex here, which has labeled exactly I in the edge F. So is the construction clear? So for every edge F, I add a copy of GJK and I add a perfect matching, but in such a way that the label, like the vertices which are matched to each other. Like the vertices which are matched to each other have the same label. And now, okay, and then I'm going to also tell you what the coloring is. Colour all the edges between this F and its GJK by nuclear. You do this for all f and then you iterate. So if at some point, I think the proof to see that this has large parts or large chromatic number is very similar to Tut's proof. The only thing I guess that's more new is why is it a lonely, why is it no lonely color graph? Why does it give us no lonely colour? Why does it give us more modeling colour graph? So imagine there exists some cycle. The cycle cannot lie inside GJK fully. So it has to go, like it has to start somewhere, come back, and then go to another edge, come back, and then go to different edge, come back, and so on. And so on. Okay. That's because they're matched to stable sets. Huh? That's because they're matched to stable sets? The ground set is stable sets. Yeah, the ground set is a stable set. This is all independent. Right? So for it, the only way for it, if it goes, it has to come back. Okay, so the cycle looks something like this. And it has, suppose it does have an edge which is lonely, which Have an edge which is lonely, which means its color appears only there. Well, only once. That edge has to be somewhere here. It's because if it's any of these edges, well, these guys have the same color. So it has to be an edge that is completely inside GJK. Well, now you start, you look at the vertex where it first enters, let's say X and Y, and these guys have. And these guys have the same level in this edge. Now, what you know is that, okay, this naturally gives you some walk, and the walk is, I drew almost all of it, something like this. Now, if I look at this walk W, which comes from this cycle, then the projection multigraph, in the projection multigraph, this edge XY cannot xy cannot be a bridge. That means that in the projection multigraph, xy must have another path going. And that path is actually a path in GJK, because it's coming from edges in H, which naturally give you a path in here. So I will call this path pi. I will call this path PI and what do we know now is that because XY was not a bridge in PWC lambda. So there existed some path that was going from X to Y, which naturally every such edge was giving you some Edge was giving you some Fi1, Fi2, Fik in your edge, which now if you go back, these guys give you paths in particular copies of G, G case. And now you can just basically look at the graph where it's on the same vertex set and put together all the paths, and that gives you a closed walk. And that gives you a closed walk. And so P I union all these parts P J I's give a closed walk. So either that walk, like once you add everything, this is a closed walk in GJK. Either you got that this edge, the walk maybe has multiplicity of this form. Multiplicity of this form, like maybe the closed work looks like this. Well, that's not a problem because that tells you that E already has a color which appears, so E already has, its color already appears twice, or if not, there exists a path which is of length at least three in GJK and it's a cycle. And we know that GJK by inductive hypothesis is not. inductive hypothesis is not is a non-only color graph. So E must have a color which also appears here. Is that making sense? So I think what I'm using is that this path, PI1s, are all coming from different copies and I put them like I view them all on top of each other on the vertex set of GGIK. That gives me a multigraph. Me a multi-graph. So if I do have that E appears twice as a double edge, that means that this edge appears somewhere here already with the same color. The C of E already appears here. But if not, that means you get a cycle of length at least three. But that tells you that, okay, well, that cycle appears in GJK. That means the color of E appears already, at least twice. At least twice. Thanks. Further questions? By the way, I looked up that paper that I thought was already critical. Okay, great. It was just something else. Yeah, so there is an open problem here. Instead of doing like Instead of doing like every color appears at least twice, what if you don't allow colors like no color appears on a cycle between one and like a fixed number of times? Or every color has to appear an even number of times. Or yes. Yeah. That is quite nice.
