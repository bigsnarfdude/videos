Thank you. First of all, thanks organizer Frank, Dadi, and Shia for invitation. So for organizing the very nice workshop. So today, so I changed my title. So I think the original is on the The original is on the geometric aspect, so not consistent with the topic of the workshop. So I changed the. But this is a little bit older. So today I would like to talk about neural correspondences between the integral system and the doing system. So this is a joint work with my. With my former PhD students and Professor Petova from Minnesota. So the outline of Man Talk contains the following topic, several points. The more important is that I would like to establish the relationship between the MSH equation and the command. equation and the command means commas home equation and the modified commas equation so also the dp equations and the the and the the novikov equations so also that contains other others are the preparation to to prove the results so the the models the investigated the mantalk contains Contains several pairs, the equations. So the first one is the Kamas Home equations. We say the CH equation and the K D V. The first second pair is a modified Kamas Home equation and the modified K D V K D V equation. So the several pairs. So you need to remember that the The system. And so, one of the main purposes is we would like to establish the generalize the neural transformation features in the Kamas Humi feature and the modified Kamas Hoffing equation. And they are the characters. So the next appears are the novel equations. Equations introduced by Noviko, the Unlapico, and some other Kadar equations. So the method is DP equation and the KK equations. KK equations also contains the others two components and math and this is. This is a several two. This is a two component command system and the HQ system. So this is a computer system also was studied extensively in the last 13 years, particularly by the Professor Yassi. So another is we call the dispersive. We call that the first thing that watch with systems. This is already optimated from the broadcast systems. The last system is another system that also we call the multi-component systems. So this system is different from other. Uh different from other systems, so you see the this system is a is a dual system, the last system is a dual system of five five, but the last system contains the quadratic and the cubic terms. So this is non-linear terms. This system is different, but this system was derived from the Was derived from the geometric flows in the modus geometry. So, this is a new system. Yeah. So, okay, yeah, so the Kamas Fum equations most here even studied the Kamas Hume. So, the Camas Fun equations were studied, type equations were studied extensively in the last 30 years. 30 years there are hundred uh number of people to study the commerce home have equations so the the the novel properties for the commerce equations contains three points one is a non-linearity disposition second is uh describe can describe the wheel breaking is a different from the classical youth system also Encryptive system also processes the non-smoosome solution-like solutions. So, in particularly, for the MOCH equation, modified commuting equations, so it has a physical background, also has a natural geometric derivation, and cubic non-linearity. Also, we will break it differently from the standard Cameras home equations because not the first. Because not the first derivative block and then the curvature blob. So there are many results on the modified commands. I just leave several, some of the reference here, including the interoperability, also the wheel breaking and the suitability was. was solitance and it was getting method and in my head approach to all the modified command schools. So there are many people to study. So also the modified command school can be obtained very simply from the curve flow in Eukan geometries. So yeah, I don't spend time here. so yeah i i don't spend time here so if you look at the a pinocurrent flow so it's easy to get the similar almost the similar to get the modified uh modified uh kdb different c yeah to get to uh yeah  Slap. So those Hamas home type equations can be obtained from so-called trihometric duality approach. So the approach was introduced by Peter Ober and Folk Stana. So the key point for the method is most by Hamiltonian integral solid equations actually support a Actually, support a compatible trail of a Hamilton structure through a picture scaling argument. So, with the method, through the several Camas Hom type type equations, including the Kamas-Hum equations, modified Kamas, two components, and the forecast length equations can be obtained, can be obtained. So, uh So, from that derivation, it is anticipated that the original solid equations should be related to their dual count paths in a certain manner. In addition, so from the following result, so we also can get the relation the relation of some of the systems. Of the some of the systems, some of the user systems. For example, the forecast land forecast for extended and they obtain the commasum equations from the first and negative flow of the KDV hierarchy. Also, they get the two components, commas from the first and negative flow of the AKS, and the DT and the noise population can be obtained from the negative flow of the KK and the SAWAD card. The KK and the Sawad Kadari hierarchies. So here the questions. So is it possible to establish correspondence between the respective hierarchies? Also, establish the conservation laws between those hierarchies. It is there that generalize the mineral transformation contact with the Transformation contact with the common formula equation and the modified command. Also, relating the DP and the Nova Covocation and their hierarchy. Also, another question is how about the multi-component case? So about the common figure, the KDB equations and the Louver corresponding. Correspondence. So the McCann and the Linus. So they establish the neural correspondence. So the key ingredients in their approach is the track homogeneous dual structure of the constraint contain operators. The important point is the content operators for the comma equation can be obtained from the cadinium equations by USC. Equations by using the Louvre transformations. But these points are not hold for the other equations such as modified commerce and the Nova curve and the DP equations. So first, let's look at the numeral transform correspondent for the MOCH and MOKINI groups. I'm okay. So this is the I write the MCH curve here. So this is the Laxquare of the MCH equation. Also, this is MOKADIVI equations. This is Laxpa. So the Liberal transformation. So the concept was introduced first by Professor Peter Owen's father in a book. So I use. In a book. So I use the notion. So that means the Liberal transformation map the Lax square to another Laxqua. So we call the Liver Liver transform. So we can introduce the Liver transformation contact, the MSH and the model five cutting equations. So given by this form. So this is a newer transform connect the MCH as M caddy equation. So this is the content structure for MCH equations. So the good point is the G is a linear operator but But the K, capital K is nothing else. So this is the recursion operate. So using the recursion operate, we can get the positive flow flow and the negative flow. So the negative flow was derived by using the kernel of the operator cap. So, this is the hierarchy of M caddini. So, there are the negative flow is determined by the equation 20. So, we can use the group 2 once. There are two cases. So, the first is the constant C, C bar, and not Z. So, here we are interested in the In the case, the non-zero case. So that means the case two. So the consonant, not that. So we can use the Liverpool transformation to solve the relationship of the two hierarchies. That's the following result. Result. So, and the transformation, the Liverpool transformation. So, we can which maps the positive hierarchy for MCH to the negative hierarchy of the MKD. Oh, yeah, yeah, not arbitrary. Oh, yeah, yeah, not arbitrary. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not arbitrary. Sorry. So it's a fixed constant. Depends on N. Yeah. So we can get the D will tell us, so the Liver transformation can map the positive hierarchy of the MOCH to the negative hierarchy of the MOKDV. Also map the negative hierarchy of the The negative hierarchy of the MCG to the positive hierarchy of the M capital. So, so the proof, I don't give the details of the proof, but the main PS is following the lemma served on the operators. So, this lemma establish the Some are the rich operators, some not. So, this is the operator, this is the operating unit temperature that have the independent interest. So, also we can establish the relationship between the Hamilton conservation loss. So, yeah, so the Yeah, so the yeah, I don't give the details. So yeah, which need several lemmas. So I don't give the details. So the result is here. So the if the H bar n is the conserved density of M cading equations, so the M H minus N is the conserved density of the M c. The density of the amosite equations. So they are related by the equations 34.34. So you see the Louvera corresponding for MCH and MKDV, also the CH and the KDV, so we can get the established generalize the mirror transfer formation for MCH and the command. So the motivation is the following. So, the motivation is the following diagram. So, for Kdv, there is a correspondence with the common equations. So, the MKDV is a MOCH. So, KDV and MKDV related by neural transformation. So, use the diagram also we can establish, we can get generalized neural transformation related to CH and MSH. So, the more precisely, so yeah. So, yeah, we know the mural transformation related to the CDV and the MKD equations. So, the mural term also related to the positive hierarchy and the negative hierarchies with a result by FOCAS and Folk Stanley, the 40 years ago paper. So, the the neurotransformer can relate to the negative. Related to the negative. So, then we can establish that we can get a generalized neural transformation, relating the MCH equations. So, we can get the polling result. So, if I'm in the solution of the MOCH equations, if we know the solution of the MOCH equations. A solution of the MSH equation, we can get the corresponding solution for the common equations. So look, so you from if we know the M, so we can solve the Q and Y from the equation 37. So then using the mural transfer formation, we can get a P. Use the P, we can solve the rule, the solution of the mass of equations. The welcome assumptions. So the so the next way established the Liver transformation between the North Cove and the Savad Kafar equations. So the Nordicopa equations is here. So the polygon scale. So, if we can write the Lux pair by a third-order equations for T. So, using receptor transformations, we can transform the Lux pair to the efficient we can transform the forty to the forty-one. 41 also get the time part. So the compatibility equation between the 41 and the 42, so we get another equation. So actually this equation is the first and night flow of the starboard quadratic, which was given by Gaudia and Pico long time ago. Ago. So, so we can establish the neural correspondence between the Novicov equation and the negative and the equation 44. So, this is the first negative equation in the S category. So, yeah, so the so the Liver transformation. Liberal transformation is given by the equation 4048. So, using the Liberal transformation, so we can establish the corresponding. Yeah, so we can establish a lower correspondence between the hierarchy, not the cover hierarchy, and the hierarchical SK equations. So it's given by the serum. So the proof will depend on the following lemma of the operator at the I don't give the details. But the good point was the bad point not. So the better point, not good point, for the modifiers, the two operators, K and J are not non-linear. So this is different from the modified commas at the DP equations. So a question is how to the How to transform the one of the G and K to a linear operator. So, this is so this is important to establish the K-M theory for the novel equations. But I don't know how to do that. So, also, we can establish the relationship between the homology. Relationship between the Hamiltonian conservation loss. So this is similar to for the MOCH and the M cadeni. Yeah, we need several lemmas so we can establish the relationship of the cultivation loss of the noveltop equation and the Of the knowledge of equation under the under the SKA equations given by the equations 65. So to establish the neural transformation relating the DP and the node, so we need the established neural correspondence for the DP equations. So this is the DP. The DP, this is the DP equations. So, this is a Lux pair. So, which is related to the first negative equation of the KK hierarchies. So, this is the KK equations. So the so that this is So, this is a Louvre transform of the for the for the KK and the TP equations. So the both the homogeneous operator for the DP is L and the D. So the good D is a linear operator. So this is different from the novices equations. From the novel equations. So, so with the sense of the T, the linear operator, so that so they the so they can several the Italian mass materials so they can establish the chemical. So, this is similar to the atmosphere check equation and the commutational, but different for no novel equations. So, yeah, this is a result for the corresponding for the lower correspondence for the DP and for the KK rockets. So that means we can accept using the Liver transform form. So we have the correspondence of Correspondence of the Liki hierarchy and the Keke Hierarchy. Also, we have the Lura correspondence for the Hamiltonian calculation loss. So, yeah, this is your in the your correspondence for the convergence loss using the uh using the correspondence for the dp and the novikov so we can establish a generalized neural transformation relating the the dp and the novikov equations so this is the uh the motivation is the following diagrammers so 40 advantages give a neural transform relating the skin Transform relating the SK and the KK equations in a one-page paper. So here we have the Liver correspondence between the SK and the Nordic, also a KK and the DQ. So then we can establish a generalized mirror transform for novico and a DQ. So yeah, more process delay. So here, this is the mural transform B1. From B1 and B2, and the leading KK and SK is increasing for W. So the mural transform also relates to the negative hierarchy of the SK and the KK. So yeah, this is SK1. So you see this is similar, is about the same for the Is about the same for the CH and MCH. So we can get the analyzed neural to information relating to the molecular PP. So this is you see that it's easy to see from the diagram. So this is a result to relative novel equal equation under the under the Equation under the under the dp equations. So if m is a solution of the logical equations, so we can get a solution for dp equation n. So so the for is a nature, so we can We can also establish the neural question between the two components common home equations. And another AKS should be the two company associated with Kamal's home equations. So this is a backhammer structure of the true company. True component commas. So, this is structure. So, this is associated two components of commas to machines. So, yeah, we can establish the Lewa correspondence between the two systems, the Liver control given by the equation. were controlled given by the equation 1999 so which is the convert to the lack of care for two components commuter to the to the two components associated with the commas and this so so that this is a result of the angle The true command screen efficient under the associated true command screen systems. So, we can also get to the newer classmate detail accountation cost for the two systems. So, finally, so we can establish the high-dimensional case. The high-dimensional case. So for the one pass can be a system and one pass come out from the hierarchies. So these systems come from the geometrical flows, as I mentioned before, in the movie's geometries. So I recall. Uh So, yeah, there is a faith from me. So So, so yeah. Oh, sorry, this is uh this is a quadratic path. So this is you you you product UX is you you what product you we you product what product. U product when product UX. So this is a product term. So this is a cubic term. So the last term. So the other for the for the For the I think they mentioned the case computer quite complicated. So yes, yes. Yeah. So, that's a new one, new system. So, yes, so this is the this is uh the This is the backhand structure for the one plus anti the component CH systems. So this is a Hamilton function. So this is for Cadive system. So the back end function. So, yeah, so we can, but the computation for n equals two. So, the computation is quite complicated. So, this is the result. So, finally, we have several questions. So, the first one is how to use the new world transformation to expect to prove. To prove the obvious stability of those objects, but it's one of that recently neural transform and the background transformation was used to prove the orbit of sustainability of the solar. So the second question is: what's the lower question for the discrete systems? For example, for the Cadibi and the Kamaski? Yeah. Another question is geometrical formulation. Recently, we have a joint work with Professor Zhu Wei Wu. So for most of the neural transformation, we have the geometric formulations. So other geometric formulations for neural transformations. Yeah. Yeah. It is discovered here. So, yeah, that's my talk. So, I think I should stop here. Thank you.
