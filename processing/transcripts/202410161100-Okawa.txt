So, actually, I was surprised by the previous talk by Alexei because there's a significant overlap indeed. And it was even like a spoiler. So the pets of surfaces are two-dimensional fanomanifolds. So it's some specialization of what Alexei was talking about in the previous talk. So let me start with some background. But actually, it's everything, everything was explained by Alex already. So I'll be quick. So let X be a smooth projective variety over a field K. And by non-commutative deformation of X, I mean flat deformations of the category of coherent shapes on X. Is it am I loud enough? Okay. Okay, I'll speak up. Okay, so by a non-competitive deformation of X, I mean flat deformations of the Arbidine category of coherent shifts on X, or maybe deformations of the direct category. And as Alexei already mentioned, there's a notion of flat deformation of arbitring. Flood deformation of Abidian categories due to Wendy Lohmann and Michel Vandenberg. And yeah, the deformation theory of the category is described by the Hopshot DGLA, which we already saw in the previous talk, where I mean, this is diagonal, the structure sheet of the diagonal. And then there is this HKR isomorphism, which decomposes the cohomology of this complex. The cohomology of this complex into shift homology groups, like this. I mean, this is already explained by Alexei. So, we have three components. So, H1 and the tangent correspond to the commutative deformations. And we have two more directions, Gerby and Poisson direction. So, we should think of the deformations of the category in this direction as a sort of categorical deformation. Sort of categorical deformation quantization of the Poisson structure. And we also have the obstruction space given by HH3, which has four components like this. And now, so if x is a curve, then, I mean, by the dimension reason, the first and the third components are zero, so we are left with the commutative. With the commutative direction, which means that there is no non-commutative deformation in dimension one. So the first non-trivial dimension, if we care about non-commutative deformations, is dimension two. And in this case, which the tangent which appears here is nothing but the anti-canonical bundle of the surface. And today I am interested in the I am interested in diapuzzle surfaces. So, X is a weak dalpato surface if it's a surface such that the anti-cononical bundle is neph and weak. And if we say it's dalpetzo, if it's ample. So, I mean, weak tolpezzo surfaces are degenerations of dalpetzo surfaces, but it's really important to care about weak tolpatzo surfaces, even though we are only interested in dalpetzo surfaces. Are only interested in Delpezzo surfaces. And an easy lemma is that if X is a weak Delpezzo surface, then we have only two components in the decomposition of HH2. I mean, the Poisson direction and the commutative direction, because X is rational. And what's nice here is that the obstruction space is zero for weak Delfasso surfaces. So in this case, So, in this case, non-commutative deformations of X are unobstructed. But let me emphasize that non-commutative deformations of the projective space, where n is at least 3, or the non-commutative deformations of the Hillsburg surface, where D is at least 4. So, these are obstructed. So, this is something very special. I mean, we don't expect such a nice. Expect such a nice property in general. Oh, that's the Hilton surface of degree D. So that's the P1 bundle over P1, the projectivization of this rank two bundle. And it's not obstructive if D is at most three, but starting with degree four. You're right. Yeah, I mean, on surfaces, bivectors are automatically. Vectors are automatically Poisson, but I mean, I consider non-commutative deformations. So, commutative deformation and Poisson deformations are somehow mixed. And in general, they are obstructed. Yeah. Well, this was observed by Yoshi Goto. I mean, he's working on generalized complex geometry, and he has some nice description of the deformation theory. Deformation theory using log log format, I guess, and he observes that it is obstructed. Okay, so in this talk, I will introduce AS regular, some classes of AS regular Z algebras A, such that if we take the associated categories, then they exhaust non-commutative deformations of the alpetal surface. Deformations of the pets of surfaces. And this Q mod is the generalization. So, I mean, Z algebras are generalizations of graded algebras as we saw in the previous talk. And Q mod is the generalization of the category and the quotient category Alexei mentioned. And I will then explain contextures on these Z algebras. Well, I mean, it's a still work in progress. It's a project in progress with mainly with Katoshi Wen. Progress was mainly with Katushiweda and Tariq Abdel Gadil. So I will report on partial results and possible approaches towards the conjectures. So let me briefly remind you of the petal surfaces and its, I mean, the relationship to root systems. So this is a very classical subject. I mean, if you look in the book Classical Algebraic Geometry by Dogachev, Argebo geometry by Dogachev, a large portion of the book is dedicated to the puzzle surfaces. So there are 10 deformation types, as in this table here. So it's either P2 or P1 times P1 or the blow-up of P2 in at most eight points in a general position. And here D is the degree of the Diopetal Service. Is the degree of the Del Petzo surface, which is the square of the canonical divisor. So, for example, if the degree is three, that's a six-point blow-up, and these are qubit surfaces in the projective, three-dimensional projective space. And the car group equipped with the group structure, which is isometric to the second beta cohomology with Z coefficient with cop product. With cup product. And then we let R be the orthogonal complement of the canonical class in the Picard lattice. And then it's known that, I mean, there are two exceptions here, but otherwise this is known to be a root lattice. And I specified the types of the root lattice here. So for example, for P2, it's empty, but starting with But starting with, so for example, if we consider the three-point blow-up, the root lattice is the direct sum of A1 and A2, corresponding to this, this, and this. And if the number of points increase, we obtain more and more vertices of this Dinking diagram. And in the most general case, we have the Dinkin diagram of type E8. And I mean, we have minus two vectors corresponding to the vertices like this. And now let's fix one of the 10 deformation types of X. Then let lambda D be the lattice. I mean, this is the free group of rank 10 minus D equipped with this pairing here. And let me. And let omega be this vector in the lattice. And then a marking of the button surface is an isometry between this other struct lattice and the Picau lattice of X, which sends the distinguished class to the canonical class. Then a very classical and beautiful result is that if we take the set of markings of a fixed Set of markings of a fixed diapetal surface, the wire group of the corresponding root lattice acts on this set and it's free and transitive. I mean, this is the group generated by the root reflections. And actually, a choice of a marking like this is equivalent to a choice of a sequence of minus one curves and disjoint minus one curves on the surface. So this is. So, this is what people call marking in the competitive setting. And actually, we will have a non-competitive version of this, which is given by a choice of helix. Now, here's a brief history of Arten Shelter regular algebra. So, in, I guess all of you already know this, but let me quickly. So, there's a paper by Artin. So there's a paper by Arten Schelter from 1987, which initiated the classification of three-dimensional S-regraph-graded algebras generated in degree one. And they found that there are two classes of algebras, which they called quadratic and cubic. And the quadratic algebras corresponding to non-commutative projective plane, and the cubic algebras correspond to part of the non-commutative deformations of the quadric. Of the quadrick. I mean, here we get a two-dimensional family of algebras, but actually, there are three-dimensional deformations of this non-commutative deformations of this surface. So, actually, graded algebras are not sufficient to describe all non-commutative deformations. I mean, this point was made by Alexei in the previous talk. And then, in the famous paper by Artin Tate Vandenberg, they established. They established a quantum correspondence between these algebras and certain geometric data, which are given by what they called point schemes of the algebra. And then three years later, Alexei and Sasha Polishchuk sort of revisited this case, but from the triangulated categorical point of view. Categorical point of view. And what's important is that they considered Z algebras instead of graded algebras. And for non-committed P2, well, essentially, they obtained the same classification, more or less. But then Michel took it for the case of cubic surfaces, and he considered the Z algebra version of cubic algebras. So, I mean, he did the cubic Z algebra version of. The cubic Z algebra version of Pondo-Porschuk. And these cubic Z algebras correspond to all non-commutative deformations of the quadric surface. So here we get three-dimensional moduli, and three is the expected dimension. I mean, this is the dimension of HH2 minus the dimension of HH1. So that's the expected dimension. So this is a very brief history. But here's a key observation. So we have S regular three-dimensional quadratic and cubic Z algebras, but actually these two Z algebras are generalizations of certain generators of the derived category of P2 and the derived category of the quadratic surface, respectively. Actually, this is the helix. I mean, it was introduced in the previous talk. In the previous talk. And since we know that these algebras come from helices of the categories, we can do the same for the other Del Petzo surfaces. By this, I mean, starting with, I mean, by this time helicopter of the German category of other Del Petzo surfaces, we obtain definitions of classes of A S regular three-dimensional zeros. A S regular three-dimensional Z-R chromos by which we can exhaust non-qualitative documentations of X. So, yeah, in principle, we'd like to generalize these two cases to more general cases so that we can describe non-commutative dolphetosurfaces equally well. But before moving on, let me quickly show you the prototypical example of this kind of story. This kind of story. So, this is what's called three-dimensional Scolani algebras, and they are generic is regular three-dimensional quadratic algebras. I mean, it's a they're two-dimensional moduli, and Scholanyi algebras form an open-dense subset of it. So, let SABC be the quotient of the non-commutative polynomial ring. polynomial ring in three variables of degree one by these three quadratic relations and abc should be taken to be a point of a projective space well actually abc must be generic for this to be a scholar algebra but let me skip that now let qgr s be i mean this we already saw in the previous talk so Saw in the previous talk. So, QQS is the quotient of the category of right-graded S modules, module torsion modules. And if we take ABC to be, say, 1 minus 1, 0, then this becomes, so if this is 1 and this is minus 1, and this is 0, we get to three commutators. So this becomes the commutative polynomial ring. So that degree of it is equivalent to the category. Is equivalent to the category of coherent shifts on the commutative P2. But if we change ABC from here to general ABC, we get lot of deformations of this category. And so these are non-commutative P2s. Yep. Okay, by this I mean if we take Q mod of these algebras, we get all infinitesimal. Get all infinitesimal, non-commutative deformations of x. Yeah. Yeah, if you go far away, maybe we get something more, but if you consider infinitesimal, yeah. Now, let me continue. So actually, this non-commutative algebra is the deformation concentration of the Poisson structure on P2, which corresponds to Corresponds to this cubic equation depending on ABC. I mean, so this I mean the anti-canonical shift for P2 is isomorphic to O3. So there's a section beta corresponding to this cubic equation. And actually, this SABC is the deformation concentration of this fossil structure. And if we take the zero locus of the fossil structure, Fossil structure, which I denote by EABC. So this is a genus 1 curve. So it's embedded in P2. But actually, this vanishing locus, maybe Alexei already mentioned this. So this stays in the non-commutative deformation. So, I mean, there is no space like this, but I mean, we can imagine that there is a non-commutative projective variety associated to. Projective variety associated to SABC, which I denote by this symbol, so that fugur of SABC is like the space of coherent sheaves on the non-commutative space. But this is virtual, but this category does exist. And yeah, I said that this body shift locus stays in the non-commutative deformation, meaning that there is a virtual embedding like this. Embedding like this. And in reality, we have a pair of adjoint functors between the group of this algebra and the category of coherent shifts on the curve. So, I mean, this is something virtual, but we do have a pair of functors like this, and we should think of this as the pullback and push-forward functor along the virtual embedding. So, I mean, so I introduced this curve as the vanishing locus of the Poisson structure. Vanishing locus of the Poisson structure. But from the non-commutative point of view, this curve is obtained as the point scheme of the algebra, which is like the moduli of points or skyscraper shapes on the non-commutative space here. So this is the prototypical example we should keep in our mind. Now let me tell you some generalities. Tell you some generalities. So let's fix a base field and let I be a partially ordered set. And then we say that, okay, then an I-algebra over the field K is nothing but a K-linear category A. I mean, K-linear category is also called K-algebraid because, I mean, K-linear category with one object is nothing but a K-algebra. So I algebra. So I-algebra is a k-algebroid A equipped with a bijection between the set I and the set of objects of A. And this bijection should be regarded as a choice of a marking or a choice of a polarization of the category. I'll come to this later. Then we denote by Aij the vector space of morphisms from the object corresponding to j. The object corresponding to J to the object corresponding to I. So I will identify objects of A with elements of I. So for example, by EI, I denote the identity of the object I. So it's in AII. So these are local units of the algebra. Now, so I mean, we have, okay, this is UNEDA, by the way. So we have UNEDA embedding. Have Yomeda embedding from the category A to the category, the K-linear category of pressure on A. And this functor category is the category of right modules of the I algebra A. Now, for each object I, we have the object, the module represented by I, and we call it the I's projective module of the algebra A. Now, so as in the case of graded algebras, we say that A is connected if i is spanned by the local unit, and we say that it's positively graded if Aij is non-zero only if i is at least j. And then in this case, we have a one-dimensional portion of the projective module, and this will be called the i-th simple. This will be called the ith sample module. And then, as in the case of graded algebras, we can define the category of the category q mod A, which is a portion of the category of, well, actually, yeah, I mean, we can define small category like, I mean, this is like the category of finite regenerated modules, but let me skip this. So, we take the portion of it by the subcategory of torsion modules. So, we have. So we have the exact portion functor from the category of modules to the portion category. And we denote by OI the image of the ice projective module by the quotient factor. Now let me explain how this generalizes the notion of graded algebras. So if we take i to be z, then actually z algebras are generalization. algebras are generalizations of z-graded algebras in the following sense. So if R is a graded Z-graded algebra, then there is an associated Z algebra, which is defined by this formula. So we let the Ij component of the associated Z algebra to be the degree I minus J part of the graded algebra R. Then there is a canonical isomorphism. canonical isomorphism of categories between I mean between the category of graded right modules over R and the category of right modules over the associated C algebra. Yeah there is a standard equivalence under which R shifted by N corresponds to Pn, the projective module, and K shifted by N corresponds to twisted by N corresponds to Corresponds to twisted by n corresponds to the nth simple module. And a proposition is that a z algebra is associated to a graded algebra if and only if it is one periodic in the sense that a twisted by one is isomorphic to a as the algebras. And here, the twist over the algebra is defined by this formula now. Now we have a generalization of the notion of A as Gorenstein condition for Z algebra, or for I algebras in general. So let A be a connected and positively graded I algebra, and then we say that it is Artenschelter-Gorenstein. So this is a bit complicated, but this is a generalization of the notion of Gorenstein algebras in the committee world. So we assume that for any index i, That for any index i, there's only one pair of indices from i and z, such that if we compute the x group from samples to projectives, then it's almost always zero, but it's k only if this pair is the given one. So this is the Granstein condition for this general setting. This general setting. Now, so in order to introduce the notion of A's regularity, I have to explain helices. So let D be a triangulated K-linear category. Then, I mean, this already appeared in previous talk. So, a helix is a sequence of objects of the category such that if we take That if we take a segment of the collection, then it is a nice generator of the category, which is called fully exceptional collection. So I don't explain this, but well, so if we have a generator of the category like this, then the Grotandic group of the category will be a free ambient group of rank R. I mean, R must be the length of this collection. This collection and a helix of a collection of objects such that if you take any segment of length r of it, it must be a nice generator of the category. And the remark is that, so the serfactor of the category is acting on this sequence. And the full exception collection is like a fundamental domain of the action of this serfactor. Ser functor. So, I mean, helix is like a spiral, and it's a spiral by the action of the serf functor. I mean, serfunctor acts as the Dick transform of the spiral. Now, here's one important notion. So, we say that a helix EI is pure if we take X group from smaller to bigger, then it must be zero. Then it must be zero as soon as L is not zero. And I mean, this notion appears in many literature, and this notion is called by different names. So in a paper by Britland and Stern, they call it geometric. And this is slightly weaker than the geometricity by Bondo and Polishuk. And we used to call it a cyclic, but we decided. Call it a cyclic, but we decided to call it here. And yeah, Michelle taught me that he calls it very strong. I mean, so there are many names, so this is an important notion, I guess. There is a subtlety about shifts in the triangulated category. And yeah, your notion is somehow too strong. Yeah, we can discuss this later. It's very subtle. Now, Now, let me relate this to AS regular RGBS. So let's take the total space of the canonical bundle. I mean, scheme theoretically, this is the spectrum of the relative spectrum of the symmetric algebra of the anti-canonical shift. Well, this is a geometric line bundle over X. Now, the helix, well, okay, let's take a helix consisting of coherent sheaves. Consisting of coherent shifts, then it is pure if and only if we take a full exceptional collection and it's pullback to the canonical bundle, then it's tilting in the sense that if we take the derived endomorphism of this object, it's concentrated in degree zero. So this purity condition is equivalent to saying that this DG algebra is concentrated in degree zero. Concentrated in degree zero. Now, okay, so here we have the endomorphism algebra of the tilting object. But by the projection formula, we can compute this endomorphism like this. I mean, we move this pullback to the push forward on the right-hand side, and then we use the projection formula. So we get this formula. So we get this formula somehow. But what's important here is: so we have a direct sum here. So this thing is a z-graded algebra where the degree is given by this tensor power d. So this is a graded algebra. And our proposition is that the derived category of x is equivalent to the derived category of q of this graded algebra. And moreover, if we take the associated Z algebra of this gamma, it actually coincides with the helix regarded as Z algebra. I mean, this collection is naturally indexed by Z, so we can think of this as a Z algebra, and this is isomorphic to the Z algebra associated to the graded algebra gamma. So, I mean, so in the previous talk, the projective space was described as the quotient of a vector of the affine space, but that's a bit misleading. I mean, in general, we should think of x as the quotient of the canonical bundle. So, this is an important point. I mean, so if we have a line bundle, then if we remove the zero section and take the quotient by the dilation. Take the quotient by the dilation action, we get x, and that's why that more or less explains why we get this equivalence here. And now let's specialize to the case where x is a surface. Then, gamma is a graded Calabri L3 algebra. So, by the famous preprint by Ginsburg, gamma is isomorphic to the Jacobi algebra. Is isomorphic to the Jacobi algebra of certain lever with superpotential. And this fact implies that, as a query, there is a very explicit projective resolutions of simple modules of gamma. But now this category is equivalent to the modular category of the helix regarded as a Z algebra. So this way we get nice. This way, we get nice projective resolutions of simple modules of this Z algebra. And there are some details, but this is the explicit shape of the projective resolution of the samples. So here, oh, sorry, I forgot to write it down, but MAI is the number of arrows in the quiver, so sorry. And i is the number of arrows from i to a in q in the quiver. And so that I mean, quiver is a discrete data, but the superpotential deforms continuously. And so this So this derivation here somehow depends on w. And this is like the non-commutative Hessian of the superpotential. So in any case, so we know that we have nice projected resolution of this form for each samples. So we take this to introduce classes of AS regular algebra. So that's the upshot of the first half of my talk. First half of my talk. So, we define AS regular algebras of type QCheck, and QCheck is this paper here as an AS-Gorenstein I-algebra where the index set is somehow determined by the paper. I will say this later, such that simple modules admit projective resolutions of the shape determined by. Sorry, I forgot to. Sorry, I forgot to. Sorry, this is what I mean by this star i. Sorry. So we specify the shape of projective resolutions like this. And this depends only, I mean, this shape depends only on the choice of the quiver to check. So, sit again? Yes, yes. I assume that SI's have projected resolution of this shape. Then. Then, yeah, now let me show you four examples. So, the prototypical example is the projective space and the collection of line bundles. So, this is an example of a pure helix. In this case, so the quiver cue check is like this. So, I mean, so if we remove the arrows from two to zero, we get the quiver we saw in the previous. Quiver we saw in the previous talk by Alexei. So, this quiver is somehow obtained by rolling up the quiver we saw in the previous talk. And in this case, so superpotential, there's an explicit description of the superpotential. I mean, this isn't important here. So, in any case, if we take the Jacobi algebra, okay, so this is the path algebra of Q-check divided by Divided by derivatives of the superpotential by the arrows. So that will be isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of the tilting object obtained by pulling back a flex of shock collection to the total space. And in this case, if we go through the procedure in the previous slide, we get projected resolutions of this form. Sorry, this is the resolution. This is a resolution in the green box in this particular case. So, yep. Oh, okay. So, this is these are modules over this thing here. We are the Z algebra. I mean, so if you think of the subcategory. The subcategory of line bundles. If you consider the category of line bundles, it's a Z algebra. I mean, it's a K linear category where the objects are indexed by Z in the obvious way. So we can talk about modules over the Z algebra. And this is a projected resolution. And I mean, this collection regarded as a Z algebra is nothing but the Z algebra associated to the polynomial. Associated to the polynomial ring in three variables. So this way we get a class of AS regular Z algebras corresponding to this equiver here. But as you know, this is nothing but three-dimensional quadratic AS regular Z algebras. So quadratic Z algebras are Z algebras associated to this particular perihelics on P2. So, we can do the same for P1 times P1. So, this is the picture of the PR group. And let's take the collection of line bundles corresponding to the edges of this zigzag. Then that's a pure helix on this surface. So, we can do the same procedure. And the result we get is: so, this is a quiver. So, this is a quiver, and we have some superpotential. And the resolution in the green box in this case, so I mean, these are modules over the Z algebra given by the category of line bundles of edges of this zigzag, sorry, vertices of this zigzag. So, and then this resolution is nothing but the resolution we find in the Solution we find in the definition of cubic Z algebra. So these two are the classical cases. But okay, then the third example is the case of cubic surfaces. So on cubic surfaces or six-point blocks, so we have pure helices consisting of these nine line bundles, and this is what's called three-block helix. three block helix meaning that i mean objects in each column are completely orthogonal to each other and in this case if we compute the corresponding quiver so we get this quiver here by this i mean so i mean i couldn't draw it so so so this for example the vertex 00 so we have two of them and they should be actually identified so we have to fold actually identified. So we have to fold this picture. One zero should be identified with this I one zero and this vertex should be identified with this. So we get some very complicated circular waver and that's the waiver corresponding to this pure helix. So sorry, this is the fundamental domain of the action of the surfunctive. So we extend this by the powers of the anti-canonical sheaf. Sheaf. And in this case, so from this lever, we can read off the shape of the projective resolution we should assume. And the result is like this. So this is similar to the projective resolutions we get from P2, but somehow how to say it's a kind of cover of the project resolution. So much. And the fourth, And the fourth example is: so let's consider the three-point blow-up of P2. So, this is the toric surface, the effects of the V6. And in this case, so we have a helix whose fundamental domain is generated by, consists of six line bundles, like this. I mean, so this is the blow-up in three points. So, we have the pullback of O1 and The pullback of ON and the exceptional curves, so they define line bundles like this. And again, we extend this by the powers of the anti-canonical sheaf. And in this case, the quiver looks like this. And in this case, so we have three columns, but each column consists of different numbers of objects. So depending on, I mean, so we have three. I mean, so we have three cases for the shapes of the projected resolution depending on the three columns. So in this case, so the posset of the, so here we consider I algebra where I is like, so this, I mean, this bit corresponds to the vertices of the quiver, and we take z equal to. And we take Z copies of it. And yeah, so this is how we get this fosset I. And depending on whether, I mean, depending on module three, we have three different shapes of projective resolutions. But in any case, we can define a class of A S regular Z algebras such that if we take Q mod of the algebras, we get non-commutative deformation. We get non-commutative deformations of this surface here. Now, so outlook is that, so let's take any delta surface, then we always have a pure helix on it. So, if we fix a pure helix, then we get a definition of AS3 IR universe such that the associated categories exhaust infinitesimal definitions of the category. Infinitesimal definitions of the category. And actually, so there are two cases: one-point blow-up and two-point blocks, but otherwise, any delta surface admits what's called three-block helix. These are particularly nice classes of pure helices. But actually, each Del Petzo surface admits infinitely many pure helices. For example, if we For example, if we consider P2, Pellices on P2 are in one-to-one correspondence to the solutions of this Markov equation, which means that there are infinitely many beavers. So corresponding to the infinitely many beavers, we get infinitely many classes of AS regular algebras already for P2 and for other cases as well. As well. So, the first question, which we still don't know the answer, is: so, we have infinitely many pivots depending on infinitely many choices of pure helices on the same deformation type. So, we have to specify how we have to understand how these two different classes are related. I mean, they should be related by some kind of mutations, but they should be understood. Understood. And the question I'd like to discuss in the remaining time is: so we want to classify these algebras in terms of geometric data, as in the case of quadratic and cubic algebras. But before going in details of this, let me show you the third question. So we expect that there is an action. There is an action of the affine weir group corresponding to the root lattice. So, this is the semi-direct product of the while group and the lattice. And we expect that. So, we expect that this affine while group acts on the set of isomorphism classes of the corresponding Z-R segress. Oh, okay. A solos query isn't. A source is an inversion. So, okay. There's a work by the Dekan and Loewen. So they, I guess they discussed formal results, but I mean, they proved that if there is a nice generator of the category, they somehow propagate to infinitesimal deformations. So you're right. I mean, I haven't thought about. I haven't thought about convergence problem, though we expect though the moduli of these algebras have genuine moduli because everything is algebraic. Okay. Okay, I was saying, so we expect that there is the action of an action of the alpha and viral group on the set of isomorphism classes of the z-algebras such that we Such that the corresponding categories are equivalent if and only if they belong to the same orbit of the wire group option. So this is like, so I mean, these two are the same categories, but we have two different algebras, and they should be regarded as different choices of polarizations. And the difference should be covered by the affine vari group action. So that's the conjecture. The delta conjecture. So, yeah, okay, this is what I already said. So, A should be regarded as the pair of non-commutative delta surface together with a marking or a non-commutative polarization of the category. And this is known to be the case for Wadrick Z algebras, in which case the group is trivial. So, Stockford and Vandenberg proved that this happens if and only if these two Z algebras are. If these two Z algebras are isomorphic in the case of quadratic Z algebras. And actually, with my former student, we settled the case of cubic Z algebras. And in this case, the affine wire group is type L1. So that's the infinite dihedral group, which we saw in Dan's talk. And yeah. This is non-commutative P2, and this is non-commutative quadrature. And this is non-commutative quadrics. I mean, the names are quite confusing. Yeah, this is P2, and this is P1 times P1. And we expect the same for the other classes as well. This is another open question. Now, in the remaining 10-ish minutes, let me say a few words about... So this is, I have to wave my hands here. I have to wave my hands here a bit. Let me say what we are thinking about towards classification of algebras by geometric data. So this problem is settled or known in the two cases, I mean, P2 and P1 times P1. So the case of P2 is the famous book by Artin-Dave von Denberg, and then later by Alexei and Sasha. So in this case, isomorphism passes of quadratic. Morphism pluses of quadratic algebras are in one-to-one correspondence with data like this, where y is p2 or an anti-canonical curve of p2. And these two line bundles are very ample line bundles of degree three. And we have the extra condition that the difference should be in the identity component of the Picard group. And Michel did it for the case of cubic surfaces, cubic. Of cubic surfaces, cubic algebra, sorry. And in this case, A corresponds to a quadruple where Y is either the quadratic surface or an anti-canonical curve on it. And these line bundles are, in this case, degree two. And he assumes that the tensor products of L0R1 and L1L2 are very ample on the curve. And finally, The curve and finally, as a way, and then the difference between L0 and L2 must be in the identity component, and these two should be different. Yeah, that's a very good question. Yeah, so that's the gradient version. So, I mean, if you go in the case of quadratic algebras, if you Quadratic algebras, if you go from graded to zero algebras, that's generically nine to one. And the three-tosiant problem is killed by this hash. And so the goal is to generalize these one-to-one correspondences to all these regular algebras of type Q-Check, which I just introduced. And for this, I believe we have to find more conceptual proofs of More conceptual proofs of bundle-point ship theorems and vandal theorems. Because if we look in these papers, there are some computational steps which are not entirely conceptual. And I think we have to make it conceptual. Otherwise, it seems impossible to generalize these two cases. So there are two directions. So, okay, because of Um, okay, because of the time reasons, so maybe I skip uh this direction. So, from geometric data to algebra, there is a way from going geometric data to algebras. So, it's in a preprint by myself and Kazushi. So, sorry, let me just skip this because I think the other direction is more somehow interesting. So, let me explain how. So, this is. Me explain how. So, this is still a work in progress, but we believe that in this way we can go from algebras to geometric data in general. So, here's the idea. So, let's take the T algebra and let's take a full exceptional collection, I mean, a segment of the collection, and think of this as an algebra, and I denote it by B. Then, yeah, there's a famous. Yeah, there's a famous result, maybe due to Alexei and also Ricard, I think, which says that the derived category of Qmod is equivalent to the derived category of the module category over this algebra. And the equivalence is given by the derived form from the sum of these objects. Now, so the idea, I mean, in the classical setting already, Setting already. The idea here was to consider the moduli space of points on the non-commutative space. But since we have this equivalence here, we can define the moduli space of skyscraper sheets on the non-commutative space as the moduli space of stable representations of this finite dimensional algebra. I mean, GIT stable in the sense of R-slooking of specific. Of specific dimension vector. I mean, there's a reason why we should take this dimension vector and we have to choose a stability condition. But the main issue here is we have to understand which stability condition to be taken. And another thing is, so we need a conjecture about what kind of curves we obtain out of this construction. And if we consider If we consider the semi-classical setting, it's reasonable to expect that the curves we obtain at the moduli space like this should be an anti-canonical divisor of the commutative developer surface. And a solution, we believe, is, I mean, to approach these issues, I think a plausible approach is to take, to consider the Hilbert scheme of Consider the Hilbert scheme of one point as the modularized space of representations of the chip collection. Meaning, okay, sorry, I forgot to say that we assume that the last object of the exception collection is the structure shift. And by chipped collection, we mean the sub-collection of this where we removed the last one. So that's why we call this chipped. I call this chipped, and let's denote this by B prime. So actually, this idea already appeared in the talk by Alexei. So here we are trying to construct the moduli space of skyscraper shifts, but here we instead consider the moduli space of ideals. And as Alexei already mentioned, in the competitive setting, skyscraper shifts and ideal shifts are in one-to-one correspondence, but in the non-commutative setting, we have more ideal shifts. Have more ideal sheets than skyscraper sheets. Yep, exactly. Yeah, I'll explain a bit more. So here's the observation. So suppose that we take a point from the non-competitive space. Imagine that we take a point from the non-competitive space. Then we have this short exact sequence consisting of the skyscraper shift at the point and the ideal shift. I mean, everything here is virtual. Shift. I mean, everything here is virtual. But then, so this is a distinct triangle. So we can rotate this triangle. I mean, we can move this to the right. So we get this distinct triangle. So the ideal shift shifted by one is the corner of this map here. But this tells us that this shifted ideal shift is in the right orthogonal. Is in the right orthogonal to the structure sheaf. And also, we can, by the equivalence, by the explicit form of the equivalence, we can show that this is in the heart of the modular category. So actually, this object here can be regarded as a module over the chip algebra. So here's the equivalence. So the right orthogonal to the structure shift is equivalent to the draft category of the chipped algebra. of the shift algebra. So let m prime be the module over the shift algebra corresponding to the shifted ideal. Now let x be a commodity delta surface. Then so we have an open embedding from the surface to the moduli stack of B prime modules where the dimension vector is an appropriate one, which sends the point of the surface to the module of To the module of B prime corresponding to the shifted ideal shift. Then the main observation here is that this natural map is an open immersion which induces an isomorphism of the Picard groups of the marshallized stack and the surface if X is a commutative Dio Paso surface. And now on the commutative Dio Petro surface, we have the distinguished line bundle, which is ample line bundle, which is Which is the ample line bundle, which is the anti-economical bundle. So, under this isomorphism, there is the corresponding line bundle on the quotient step on the step of modules. And it turns out that this theta prime is independent of the choice of the commutative delta, so I mean, choice of this commutative surface in the deformation type. So, this way we obtain a canonical choice of the stability condition for this. The stability condition for B prime. And now we define the Hilbert scheme of one point associated to the non-commutated surface to be the moduli of theta prime stable B prime modulus of the rect dimension vector. Then we can show that even though A is A may be coming from non-commutative space, the Hilbert scheme is a commutative vector of Hatsu service. So this is what Alexei mentioned in the very end of his. Alexei mentioned in the very end of his talk. Now, the main conjecture is that there is an appropriate stability condition theta of the original algebra, which is independent of the choice of the algebra A, such that if we take the natural rational map going from the moduli space of theta stable modules, so this should be regarded as the moduli space of points. Regarded as the modularized space of points, sky-squared first, and this is the Qbert scheme. So we should have a rational map which sends a sky-squared shift to the associated ideal shift. And the conjecture is this is the geometric meaning of this map. And the conjecture is that there should be an appropriate stability condition for the non-chipped algebra, such that this natural map is a pulse immersion. And if that's the case, then we can. Then we can define this, we can think of this as the martialized space of points, skyscrapers on the algebra, on the non-committed space. And then we expect that algebras are in one-to-one correspondence to this moduli space equipped with the universal object on it. And the final remark is that this story is known to be the case in the classical cases. case in the classical cases of quadratic surfaces and cubic quadratic algebras and cubic algebras in which case we take these specific stability conditions for B and yeah we want to generalize this to arbitrary AS regular algebra so I stop here thank you
