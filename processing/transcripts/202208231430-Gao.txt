Okay, this is like the second talk in this workshop that does not have surrogate marker on the title. Okay, so today I'm going to talk about like something. I'm not quite sure how related it is to surrogate marker, but I feel like it'll be great to talk to this audience and maybe to get some help from you and how this related and how better to approach this. So today I'm going to talk about estimating counterfactual possible H. As making counterfactual placebo HIV instance in HIV prevention trials without placebo arms based on Microsoft extravagant exposure. There's a lot to unpack in this title, and I will unpack it in my talk. But first, I want to know like this is joint work with Dr. Yifan Zhu, who is a senior scientist, who is a staff scientist here at FairTouch, and Dave Goinden, who is a professor at UCSF, and Deborah Dennell and Holly James, who's also working at FairTouch. Okay, I will start with this. Okay, I will start with this introduction of the current setting of HIV prevention trials. So, in this last decade, we have seen really a lot of success in the field of HIV prevention with this antroid virus have been proven highly effective for HIV prevention when used as per exposure, prophylaxis, or we call it PrEP. So, this is a type of medication that has been used, that can be used by healthy HIV on infected persons to prevent their infection. Their infection of HIV. So, specifically, here, there have been multiple randomized placebo-controlled trials that establish that daily hour of TDF-FTC is one type of drug, one you take daily. It has been demonstrated to have high efficacy for preventing HIV when taken as directive. And also, just recently, we have so in two HIV prevention trial network trials, we have shown that this CABL-A. Shown that this Cabel A, which is a lung-acting injectable PrEP, has been shown highly effective in men who have sex with men or recovered MSM and transgender women and the women. So we have seen a lot of success in HIV prevention. That is, we have this multiple product that has been shown to be efficacious in preventing HIV. However, HIV still remains a major threat to global health, and there's remain considerable barriers to Remain considerable barriers to actually implementing such successful interventions, such interventions that have been demonstrated successful in the trial to the general public. Those would possibly include like social behavior, cultural, or basically there are limited resources to implement all these different prevention measures to different populations. So, just one example: in the United States, only like 35% of high-risk SMSM are using this ROPRA. SMSM are using this ROPREP, which is available here at USA. And also among Black SM who contribute 70% of all new cases of HIV. Among those taking PrEP, only 7% persist after six months. So that's kind of motivates us in addition to those already established prevention tools. We would like to have a wide variety of different HIV prevention tools. Different HIV prevention tools that's eventually needed. So, this can be with safety purpose. So, for example, we want to have a prevention tool that can be safe for some population, for example, pregnant women, or it's more about choice. People can choose based on their lifestyle on whichever type of HIV prevention tool they would like to use. And also, we wanted to work in different settings. So, for example, in the US versus in Africa, this will be like different settings. People will be, there are different will be, there are different like a level of level of affordable for those different types of person. So therefore, we would like to really look at additional variety of HIV prevention trial and it's definitely needed to bring a halt to the HIV epidemic. So that comes to a question. So currently we have this a lot of different prevention tools that has been demonstrated to be useful. Therefore, when we're trying to evaluate Therefore, when we're trying to evaluate these new tools, we can no longer base on this placebo-controlled trial, which is the standard of establishing the efficacy of any new intervention. So in current HIV prevention world, what people usually do is through this active control trial design, which is illustrated here. So basically, instead of a placebo control trial, where we randomize subjects to receive either this new intervention versus placebo, in this Versus placebo. In this active control trial, we will randomize those subjects to receive either active control, which is some type of drug that has been demonstrated to be efficacious, and also an experimental drug, which is the one that under investigation. And we will follow up those subjects to observe their HIV outcome in this HIV control trial. And the final outcome of this HIV control trial is try to compare the HIV outcome between these two group of people. To a group of people. And the final measure here will be like kind of a relative efficacy comparing this experimental drug versus active control. So for example, in this recently complicated trial of looking at CABL-A, this long-injecting drug, we are comparing that to, so the drug is implemented, the trial is implemented to randomize projects to receive this long-injecting CAPL-A versus this ROP that is taken daily. Versus this ROP that is taken daily. However, there is some fundamental challenge for this active control trial. One of them will be here, this final product will be a relative efficacy between these two different drugists instead of what we need, for example, with the absolute value of prevention efficacy, which is defined as the reduction of HIV instance relative to placebo. So, specifically, one way to define this. So, specifically, one way to define this prevention efficacy is occurring here. PE has prevention efficacy is 1 minus the ratio of lambda 1 versus lambda 0, where lambda 1 is the instance in the arm you have of interest, for example, in the experimental arm, and lambda 0 will be a placebo H instance, which you can no longer observe in any of this active control track. So, another relative another issue with this active control. Issue with the active control trial is more in terms of its power and sample size. So, for example, as we can see, like for this type of trial, usually the power is driven by the number of HIV cases we see in this trial. So, as we expect those HIV prevention to be more and more effective, we'll expect to see less and less event in any of this type of trial. So, in this current trial of comparing Kebel A versus Comparing CAPEL A versus TDFFTC, we see like four, if I remember correctly, in the MSM trial, we see only four events in this CAPL-A arm and I think like up to 20 events in this TF-FTC trial. And if we imagine for future HIV prevention trial with even CAP-LA as active control, then there may be like no events in there, which means like the sample size calculation will be crazy. We'll need like lots, a lot of subjects. need like lots of subjects which may not may not be doable because we cannot find that many subjects with high hiv risk so with all these different challenges one concept so it's not even like a concrete idea it's just one concept people have been considering is trying to come up with some counterfactual possible instance we call it counterfactual because it's not something we can really observe in the trial and one specific idea is to leverage Specific idea is to leverage an instance of marker of HIV exposure to infer countervector placement instance. So the concept is relatively straightforward. So basically, if we have something that can demonstrate what's going on with the subjects, if they ever receive placebo, then maybe we can use that to infer the placebo instance. For example, here, one proposal will be we will try to modify this active control trial by not only making use By not only making use of their HIV outcome after follow-up, but also we'll collect an HIV exposure marker after doing follow-up. And this marker will help us to identify the HIV risk of the subjects during the entire follow-up period. So if that can be validated, then this may be serve as a good approach to infer this possible instance so as to compare it to any of this active Of this active arm HIV instance observed in the trial, so as to provide us with a measure of prevention efficacy. So, one specific proposal of such marker of exposure has been considered, that is this rectal gonorrhea or RGC. So, specifically, it has been proposed in the 2019 paper, which highlighted a correlation between RGC and HIV instance they found in previous literature. In previous literatures. So, specifically, for the authors, what they did is they did a literature search on studies with the following inclusion criteria. Like, some, we don't want the study to be too old and also like it's in English. And also, we want a cohort of HIV only infected men have sex with men have sex with men. And then we have this above prospective follow-up data on both RGC and HIV. RGC and HIV. And also, they further restrict the inclusion criterion to include those studies who were not taking RO PREP. So basically, we're trying to have kind of a clean type of cohort where subjects were not receiving any of the treatment at all. And we see whether there's a relationship between their RGC instance and placebo incident that can be constructed based on this type of clinical heart. And specifically, it can be a non-prop. It can be a non-PrEP control arm. So basically, it's a placebo control arm, and then we're only using the placebo arm information in there. Or it can be a deferred PrEP intervention group. So basically, if one group is first not taking any prevention tools, and then later on they take that tools, then we use that period of time. That is like no intervention is implemented. And this is the figure one of their paper. So basically, in the So basically, in the, I know it's a little bit tiny to see. So in the x-axis, so for each dot in here corresponds to one study. And actually in their paper, they find eight different studies that fill that criteria. So in the x-axis is the rectangle norrrhea incidence reported in the study. And in the y-axis will be, they call it predicted, but like in the dot, it's actually the observed HIV incidence in the study. So we have this. That study. So we have this A dot here. And what we want to do, we see like there seems to be some correlation in there. And this correlation is in terms of this study level incidences of HIV and RTC. And a simple approach here to do is just let's do a linear regression. And by doing a linear regression, we find that lambda of so basically HIV risk is risk is can be linearly associated with RGC rates with R square. So this is different from the R square we talk about a lot today. So the R square is just linear regression, R square is 0.87. So we found a really strong correlation between these two instances. And in their paper is kind of proposing this concept that based on this type of prediction model of HIV instance based on RGC instance, it may allow It may allow prediction of the expected HIV instance in a group of MSM if the RT synthesis is available for this group. So basically, if we have RGC using this, if we, for example, have the RG synthesis in the population and we just plug this in, then we can see, oh, this may be the HIV instance there. All right, so that's what has been going on here. I know it sounds a little crazy. So one thing I want to do here. One thing I want to do here, like in this project and also in this talk, is trying to figure out what's the methodology gap in here and what I can do to try to fill this methodology gap. So one thing, the first question come to my mind is whether such prediction model makes sense. So for example, one thing they did is basically, as you see in the previous slide, it's just plotting the dot and collecting dot, right? So basically, point ask me. So basically, point estimate of incidences from different studies they were directly used, and the variability around that estimated instance. So it's not only the point estimate, but rather there's a variability associated with that. That's like totally ignored from their approach. Secondly, like when applying this prediction model, usually variability from estimating the coefficient I ignore. So what I mean by that is basically what people did is just like plug in all those numbers. Like plugging in all those numbers, and as we know, like from statistics, it's not really numbers, it's just as major associated with variability. And finally, we see like there's linear regression model applied to instances. I think the main rationale of doing that is basically by plotting that with CO, it has really a clean linear line in there. But actually, this really making sense. Do we need some sort of transformation in there? So, this is like some of the questions that come up. So, this is like some of the questions that come up with this prediction model. Then, next step, a larger problem than this prediction model will be, what is the assumption under which this prediction from this model will actually serve as an estimate of placebo instance? So basically, this is just a plot, like what's going on when there's no placebo. But this does not guarantee us that making use of this prediction model, we'll be able to carry that forward to a different population. So, especially like for this RGC. Especially like for this RGC instances is basically based on different people, and we're estimating for different people. So, this is like a larger problem with the assumption under which this will serve as a good estimate of placeable instance. And finally, one of the reasons we want to use this placeable instance estimate is because we want to kind of alleviate the semal size issue with IC control trial a little bit. Issue with eye-contain control trial a little bit. So, then one particular problem we were interested in is whether this estimate is useful in terms of their position. Since, for example, in this other point we make in the first problem, it's actually about not accounting for any variability associated with the study that used there. So, we another question will be after we counted for all these different variability, will still this possible instance to be useful? Or is just like a really Or it's just like a really wide competition that is not useful at all. We cannot really infer meaningful prevention efficacy from there. Okay. So in this talk, I'm now trying to tackle all this problem, especially the second one. So this is the one that is, as I've acknowledged, is the most important one to make use of this approach. But this is the assumption that really needs a lot of unpacking. So in this talk, I will try to address those gaps. Try to address those gaps as much as I can. And I think it would be great to engage some of you to really get into this discussion. Okay. So first, I will introduce our data annotation here. So basically, we have two types of data. One part is from active control trial. So basically, this is a population we have of interest. So we add lambda KY to be the HIV instance for subjects receiving intervention K. And in the active control trial, we have And in the active control trial, we have KX1 to be rental intervention and COX2 to be active control. And also, since we want to relate it to this marker of exposure, for example, RGC as for MSM population, we let lambda KZ. So Z is denoting this exposure marker and Y is denoting HIV. So another two notation I want to include in here is lambda 0Y and lambda0Z. So those are the incidences for subjects receiving placebo. Incidences for subjects receiving placebo. So, as we know, it exists, is the just like hypothetical, it exists, but we cannot really gain any information based solely on the data from active control chunk. So another part of data we have is on external co-chord without PrEP intervention. So, this will be like the, for example, the A dot we saw on this previous slides, and what lambda M0 and Lambda MZ to be the incidences of HIV and export. Incidences of HIV and poster mater in the external cohorts. And for one specific key here is like really require this external cohort to be absent of intervention. And the main goal here is trying to infer prevention efficacy. As I mentioned, like Lambda one, it may be inferred from here, but Lambda 0y is now something we can infer. Right, so I will not go into much details in like this framework since I do not have much time. Framework since I do not have much time, but I want to basically spell out all the key ingredients to basically gap the things and gap this approach. So the first one we need will be a linkage model. So that one we need to assume that something that's hold in both the external cohorts we have data on and also this active functional population. Specifically, we assume that this model of HIV instance and instance of the market exposure that holds for both external cohorts. That holds for both external cohorts and active module. So, stability is valid here. So, first of all, we kind of allow a transformation model G and H, which are known link functions. And this F function will be an unknown regression function that we will model. So, for example, in the previous approach, we'll use an analytical link function and we'll use linear regression model. So, one key thing in here is since we are trying to link this to population, we'll definitely need this association or this model to be hold for both extensions. Model to be hold for both the external cohort and in the active control trial. So, based on the first one, it kind of gives us some hint on how to control RGC with HIV, but all are based on flexible R. So, the next assumption we will need will be how can we make use of the marker of exposure based on this active control population? So, one thing we'll need will be lambda 0z equals to lambda 1z. So, based on this two key assumptions, So, based on these two key assumptions, we can then predict a counterfactual possible instance by this one. So, basically, well, since lambda 0z is lambda 1z, then basically lambda 1 will serve a good estimate of this, and we just make use of this to estimate it. So, this seems really simple, but one key thing in here will be how we can estimate f. And for estimating f, we actually look at two different approaches. So, basically, one specific challenge here is that f is one. Here is that F is one thing that describes the incidences, the true instance relationship. But in the data, actually, we have is the estimated summary, this estimated observed instances. So if we apply this meter regression approach that we consider just a working regression model, applying this regression to lambda m y hat versus lambda m0 hat z, then basically it may be may not be unbiased because we are not inputting. Bias because we are not inputting the good input in there, but rather error measure thing here. We can also do a likelihood-based approach, where, for example, if we can assume some sort of parametric model for g lambda m 0y and g and h lambda 0z, then we can based on asymptotic normality of the observed instances to build a parametric model for this due, and then so as to solve all those parameters we are interested. But the main caveat about likelihood. About a likelihood base model is here. We need to have first parametric assumption, and second, there are several parameters associated with this. But what we can only have is just that there's eight different cohorts, and those are the only eight data points we have. Therefore, in our simulation study, we actually see there are a lot of challenges in making use of a likelihood-based approach. And we're trying to compare just two different approaches: one is like a working model, the other is like a likelihood-based approach with using the This approach with using the. So let me summarize this a little bit. So, for the working regression model, we know it's not true. But since we only have a data point to be used, so maybe this should be the approach to use. But for the likelihood-based approach, it does not have model mystification issue. However, we may be able to, it may have some convergence issue with small sample. All right, so I will not have much time. So I will skip some of the settings I have and just Give some of the settings I have and just run into simulations results we have. So basically, we're trying to generate data from realistic models where it's kind of matches the external cohort we have. And we're trying to generalize, generate active control trial, and trying to see how we can, whether we can estimate the placebo arm instance well and whether we can estimate prevention efficacy well. And some of the messages are here. So basically, one thing I've touched a little bit will be like you. Touched a little bit will be likely to grow based approach. Uh, so it does not make special model, however, it has not good performance when M is small because it has a convergence issue. But with large M, it's really working nice and expected because we expand the model really well. And the second thing is in terms of the working model, so it's worked well with small m. And actually, if you can see from here, so basically. So basically, even uh this slide better, yeah. So, when we have an M number of histonal cohort, this working model approach is giving us a coverage probability is really close to 95%. So, even if it's misspelled, it seems to be quite useful. However, just one additional caveat is like this prevention FPC estimated was slightly lower coverage when row is 0.5. This row is trying to quantify how this marker of exposure and HIV correlates with each other. And HIV correlates with each other. So, what we are looking at is really medium range of correlation. Seems like the working model is working not that well in the sense that we may see like 93% coverage for those. Okay, so the final thing will be how, so we know, like, even based on this working model, it seems to be work well in identifying this quality. And finally, the point will be how well it works, how in practice, whether we can. In practice, whether we can obtain an asthma with great precision. And the good news is we did. So, this is a plot based on an axis 1000. So, basically, in the active control trial, we only have 1,000 subjects in chart. And for example, in the let me see, like in the lab panel, we're looking at rho x.5, so it's median level of correlation. And we're plotting x-axis to be number of histonal cohorts and y-axis to be power. And we're looking at this. Power. And we're looking at different ranges of HIV. That seems to be the setting where we're going to implement HIV prevention trial. And it seems like, even with 10 external cohorts and with an access to 1,000, as with a medium range of correlation, we are able to obtain more than 80% power with 1,000 subjects. So this is really promising, indicating that we are, even by accounting all this different type of variability resource from external cohort and active control trial. External cohort and active control trial, we're able to, this asthmat can be useful. Although we really need to make sure that the assumption under which this asthmator works need to be taken care of. All right, so finally, I want to summarize the talk by revisiting this methodology gap I just mentioned. So, one ballpark is about this prediction model. So, and it is one that we really want to work. We really want to work on to relax all this type of assumption and to try to make this methodology to be useful. So, the first one, I'm pointing SML instance. So, actually, the likelihood-based approach tried to account for that, but we know it's not working well with small number of histonical core. So, we still need to go back to working model, which fails to address that sadly. However, it seems in terms of coverage, this neglecting a point asthma and neglecting a variability around this point asthma instance not really giving. Smell instance not really giving us a lot of trouble. And also, we try to address the variability from S-minute and codevision and linear regression directly applied to instances. Yes. The second question is an assumption. So we try to spell out a little bit. So one thing we need will be like the same model host for external cohorts and like control trial. The other will be micro exposure, not affected by intervention. So specifically here, I highlight this first assumption. So I highlight it for two reasons. So, I highlight it for two reasons. One reason is that this is just something about the incidences, about this relationship of two incidents, but it's done not really have a causal interpretation. So, we really want to unpack that a little bit so that it will go back to something maybe related to surrogate marker type of assumption. So, in that case, we can really test it down. The other assumption is about marker of exposure not affected by intervention. So, this is something that maybe in some other studies where That maybe in some other studies we're able to test. So, for example, if in this study, policebook control trial of this intervention, we can see like the micro exposure is not really effective. So, this is something that we can test this out. But for the first one, it's definitely unpacking. And also, since it involves this active control trial, we need to be really careful about this assumption. And finally, answer this question, whether this estimate is useful. Yes, we did. So we found like this power will depend on row to server correlation. Row several correlation, but among this range, we thought that may be useful, like range row from 0.5 to 0.9. It seems like this approach can be quite useful. Okay, so to summarize, we have proposed this statistical framework and we're trying to evaluate performance of the proposed estimator under some ideal settings. So by ideal setting, we mean like this, for example, the parametric assumption for the maximum likelihood approach really works. But like we have a lot of findings regarding about We have a lot of findings regarding about more about this working model, seems to be working really well. And finally, for the next step, definitely for this approach to hold, we need the strong assumptions and conditions. But also, like, this assumption needs to be unpacked to see like what we really need and how can we test it using existing data. So, this paper is currently uploaded at Smart Archive. And you can, I know it's quite long, but hopefully later on, if we share. But hopefully, later on, if we share the slides, you can take a look at this. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ray, for this very interesting and dense talk. Are there any questions from the audience? Yes. Yeah, thanks. It was a very interesting talk. Yeah, thanks. It was a very interesting talk and a hard problem and you know very topical. I had a question. You had a slide that showed power and you know it depended on the number of external cohorts you had. I was wondering what the was power, what is it power for? All right, so sorry, I forgot to view the title. So basically we're comparing, so the null hypothesis will be the null hypothesis will be the prevention the new intervention is 30 percent efficacious versus 70 percent 75 percent yes so this is for the um the new intervention is at least 30 percent kind of like a vaccine efficacy lower bound kind of thing um so how does the um control intervention enter into this so you have the active intervention rate you impute a placebo rate you take the ratio of those two Take the ratio of those to see if it's above 30% reliably. None of this involves the active control, it seems. That's a really good question. And actually, I've been working with this like asthma not placeable incidence a lot. And that's a question that we really want to address. So for this specific problem, where this is based on microexposure, which may be collected by both active controlled arm and experimental arm. So that's where it's come into play. But in terms of Come into play. But in terms of as mentioned of prevention efficacy, using a counterfactual placebo that may not be related to active control arms. So that's that's where it's kind of neglected, like sideways a little bit. So yeah, actually, yeah, indeed, it's a direction I'm currently working on. So basically, how to incorporate this information, making use of active arm information, especially active arm HIV instance, in addressing this prevention advocacy issue. Addressing this prevention advocacy issue because we know, like, in designing our active control trial, this margin we use. Like, so, for example, when we look at this active control trial design, when we compare this to our arm, it's not only simply like comparing whether is this the same, but actually we're using a margin. And this margin is actually related to how this active control instance worked in the placeable arm previously, a previous control trial previously. So, we are trying to leverage that into like all combining together. That into like all combining together to ask maybe prevention advocacy, making use of all information we have. Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Thank you. All right, so since we are slightly over time, I suggest that if there's a question from the people connected online, feel free to unmute and ask that. And for the people who are here, we can ask Faye later on. All right, if there's no more questions from people connecting online, we can move on to the next.
