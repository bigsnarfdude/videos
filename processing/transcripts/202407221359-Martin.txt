It's so great to be in such a lovely place. The color coordination of the slide is maybe a little off compared to usual, partially because of the beautiful background. To snap this morning on a lovely packet tunnel mountain, encourage it any chance. Okay, so I want to start at the beginning. As a geneticist thinking through a human and evolutionary lens, that means we need to start in Africa, where our species originated on the order hundreds of thousands of years ago and migrated into the Middle East and into Eurasia and subsequently into the Americas. The anti-Americas. So, as a consequence of our human history, this has a huge impact on our genetic variation. So, this means we need to take our human history as a species into account when we're designing our genetic studies. But our genetic studies have, by and large, been sampled for convenience and in scenarios where we have large-scale biobanks set up, which has not necessarily been reflected of our industry. So, we've written papers showing that our genetic diversity. That our genetic diversity is not reflecting global, our biobanks are not reflecting global diversity, our genetic studies are not reflecting global diversity. They're also not reflecting US diversity. The NIH is one of the largest biomedical funders of research in the world. Instead, they're kind of reflecting NIH-funded investigator diversity, so we might look to the future to think about where we might diversify our genetic studies. So, one question this raises is if our One question this raises is: if our genetic studies are not necessarily reflective of the diversity of participants who we hope can benefit from genetic medicine, is this really an issue? So we're fundamentally identifying a biased set of genetic variation in our genetic studies. How much of this is a problem, given that we know that causal variants are fundamentally typically shared between populations? So, one of the main questions that our group is really interested in trying to understand is how can Trying to understand is how do ancestry study biases and genetics impact the generalizability of our college? So, to get the answer to this question, we need to, I think, keep in mind a few very important considerations. The first is that causal variant effects, as best as we can measure them, tend to be largely shared across populations. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but this tends to be the rule. But things like allele frequencies, linkage disequilibrium, and other more complex factors like natural selection and environmental. Factors like natural selection and environmental exposures sort of muddy the waters we're trying to think about genetics that affect generalizability. So, some relevant projects that I don't have time to talk about today are the Global Biobank Meta-Analysis Initiative, so it's called Biobanks meeting, I figured I would mention it, the All by All of Us project, which is designed to do do us all the things in all of us, and the Pan UK Biobank project, among others that we and others have worked on. So, just sort of reflecting on where. Reflecting on where genetic studies are, we try to use Polygenic Spores as a tool to get at this generalizability question. In our mind, this is always sort of a research tool as opposed to an implementation tool, but within the last few years, this has really turned into something that people are thinking about in clinical medicine more and more and more. So, for example, recently published earlier this year, within the eMERGE network, it's clear that polygenic scores are sort of on the horizon, being delivered clinically to over 25,000 patients. To over 25,000 patients for 10 common diseases. So, whether we think this is a good idea for some areas of medicine versus others, it's kind of besides the point now, the pot ups. One of the main challenges with polygenic scores has traditionally been this generalizability issue, where our ancestry discovery biases impact the generalizability. That is to say, if we're overwhelmingly studying European ancestry populations, we're better able to predict trait. We're better able to predict traits, diseases, and European esoteric populations than elsewhere. There have been many different types of studies to try to address these kinds of problems. So there are new statistical methods that are trying to make a dent in this work by modeling linkage disequilibrium, low frequency differences, and the like. You've heard about some of those methods developments earlier today, even. There have been empirical and benchmarking studies looking at different polygenic scores, different ways you can construct them, trying to see optimal ways of putting them together. Ways of putting them together. There have also been theoretical work to try to understand how polygenic scores generalize and what this accuracy looks like. The key takeaway that seems to undergo all of these types of studies is that we need larger and more diverse human genetic studies. Another way you might think about this is that genetic data composition needs to pass the torch for all genetic data. This is certainly true for some areas of genetic studies, including for polygenics, for generalizability. Including for polygenic score generalizability, for common complex disease, for fine mapping studies, and other types of efforts, including loss of function variant analysis. We're having more loss of function variants is really important. Studying European ancestry populations actually is the place you can discover the fewest loss of function variants, interestingly, according to the LOMAD project. Other areas of genetics, though, to be clear, less so. So, if we're wanting to identify regions of the genome that are enriched for GWAS variation, ancestral diversity doesn't necessarily Ancestral diversity doesn't necessarily matter quite as much for some of those types of problems. But to try to address this, of course, the All of Us Research Program is one of the largest biobank studies out there and it's among the most diverse, significantly more diverse than many other biobank scale studies. So to this end, all of us have about a quarter of a million participants with whole genome sequencing data as well as electronic health record data, and nearly 80% of participants. Nearly 80% of participants in all of us are underrepresented by some measure of their sort of background in biomedical research. So, this includes race, but as well as income, rural versus urban, socioeconomic, sex, gender, age, all of those sorts of things. So that's great. That means we can turn to all of us to hopefully solve all of our problems on the generalizability problem, right? We tried to ask the question, can all of us improve PRS accuracy and generalizability? PRS accuracy and generalizability across different ancestries. And to that end, does adding all of us to other massive research endeavors like the UK Biobank, for example, really help us improve prediction? And are these patterns generalizable, if so? So looking across different phenotypes with different genetic architectures, are we identifying consistent trends? So here is sort of an outline of overview of the results that I'll show you. So first we'll talk about the study design, then we'll talk about if you have ancestry-matched GWAPs, how does this impact? Have ancestry match GWAPs. How does this improve polyogenic performance for these underrepresented groups? Then we'll talk about integrating multi-ancestry data across discovery GWAFs. Then what happens if we just throw everything together and try to understand just what is the optimal PRS for a variety of different traits? And then lastly, if we throw out the concept of population, as has been mentioned, is kind of a bad word, I guess, what happens with individual level accuracies when we're looking at different traits and different trait genetic architectures. This is an effort led by. This is an effort led by a PhD student, Kristen Suo, as well as a postdoc, Ling Wang, in my groups, and they've really done all of this work. So I'm just their spokesperson. This is all their first time I'm talking about this. So please let me know if you have thoughts or comments. Okay, so this is our study design. We looked at all of us as well as UK biobank data and developed multi-ancestry polygenic scores from GWAS that we conducted across 32 different phenotypes, evaluated in diverse ancestry groups from. Diverse ancestry groups from all of us. I think there was a comment earlier that it's inappropriate to smoosh UK and American data together. So this is a scenario where we're doing exactly that to try to see how polygenics for generalizability looks. So to start with, we were interested in sort of like what design considerations do we need to think about for optimizing PRFs, including looking at ancestry composition, trait genetic architecture, and sample size. And sample size across all of us in UK, Wired Link. We looked at 32 different quantitative and binary traits together. These are the quantitative and binary traits. There's some visual suspects, some anthropometric and blood panel traits, as well as some common complex diseases. Before we get into the results, I think I need to mention that heritability is not sort of a static entity. It's very much determined by things like phenotype precision and where you're measuring this and some of the contexts around what traits you're looking at. Around what traits you're looking at. And so I think it's probably important to note that all of us have systematically lower heritability compared to the UK Biobank when we look at the European ancestry groups within each of those biobanks defined in a consistent way with heritability measured in a consistent way. This is important to measure, I suppose, because, as you know, heritability sort of bounds what we can expect for the high end of polygenic score accuracy. The second thing that we did was conducted GWAS within ancestry groups within each of these biobanks, including in UK Biobank through the Pan UK Biobank project, as well as in all of us in a consistent manner in the same SAGE and linear mix models. And then we also conducted multi-ancestry meta-analysis within each of these biobanks and then combined the cross-biobanks as well. For the polygenic score models, we looked at a couple of different methods, including PRSCS and PRSC. Including PRSCS and PRS-CSX, didn't really make much of a difference, but I'm just going to show you PRSCS results. And then, in terms of target cohorts, we used holdout sets of 5,000 individuals from all of us, and then some individuals who did not have discovery ancestry matched data, including the Central and South Asian groups, as well as East Asian ancestry groups, which are just too small in all of us and Kapeiobank to have that at this stage. And then we looked at individualized polygenics for accuracy using some recent methods from Bogdan. Using some recent methods from Bogdan Koscovich's lab. Okay, so getting into the results, I first want to show you what the target ancestry matched GWAS looks like and ask the question of like, does this actually improve things in underrepresented ancestry groups? So to this end, I'm just looking at discovery GWAS from all of us. The target groups are shown sort of on the bottom parts of each of these plots. The sort of boulder line boxes are showing you where we have target ancestors. You where we have target ancestry match data. So the accuracies are shown on the y-axis. And so on the left in the quantitative traits, you can see that when you're predicting in European ancestry groups, you're doing best. You have European ancestry data, that's price there. Similar for the African ancestry groups, you do pretty abysmally overall, but you do a little bit better with ancestry match data than without. And then the same is true for the admixed parrotine groups as assigned by previous reference panels like the Mauser Genomes and Like the Mauser Genomes and Human Genome Diversity Project. Similar trends are true for binary traits, except that again, we have to change our accuracy metric here to AUC, and the accuracies overall for these traits are still pretty low with these sample sizes and with the preferences of these traits. Okay, so next, what happens if we combine multi-ancestry data across different discovery GWAS? So in this case, we've conducted multi-ancourse. In this case, we've conducted multi-ancestry meta-analysis within UK Biobank, within all of us, and then combined across all of us in UK Biobank. And here we're looking at the cross-biobank meta-analysis versus each of the ancestry meta-analyses within biobanks. And so here's where the results don't start to become quite as expected. So for example, on the left in the European target population, you're seeing that you do a far better job with UK Biobank than if you include all of us in the meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, that's not necessarily the case for the African ancestry, though. You're starting to see some sort of mixed results where it's not just that adding in the most data is actually improving things the most. So in general, we tend to see that quantitative traits in African ancestry populations improve when we have all of us data, but that's not the case in other populations. Okay, so now we tried to just optimize polygenics for accuracy. Just optimize polygenics for accuracy. If we look across different genetic architectures and different target ancestries, what do we see? So, on the sort of y-axis here, you're seeing where the discovery GWAS was conducted. The x-axis is showing you a trait. And then the boxes are around where the polygenic score accuracy is highest. So, you're seeing, for example, on the top, we've conducted GWAS in all of West African ancestry groups. And on the left, in the blue, you're seeing. And on the left in the blue, you're seeing that the target population is European, in the middle, the target population is African, and on the right, the target population is the Afghanistan-American populations. So, on the left, if you're predicting a bunch of different traits, including, in this case, all quantitative traits, including anthropometric, which are very polygenic, as well as blood panel traits, which tend to be on the less polygenic end of the spectrum, what you're seeing is that if you're predicting in these European ancestry groups within all of us, you're better off kind of just using data from UK MyOK and ignoring the data from all of us. My opening and ignoring the data from all of us, which might not have necessarily been what we expected when we set off on this study. In the middle panel, what you're seeing is in the African ancestry groups, that's not the same takeaway. So here, we tend to be performing best if we use all of us data alone or a combination of all of us and take biodank data. Then on the right, if we're looking in the ad-mixed American groups, we tend to be performing the best in the combined multi-biodank meta-analysis of all of the ancestry groups. So this suggests. So, this suggests that there's a lot of context specificity to where we're performing best and how we optimize polygenic scores. It's not necessarily a numbers game of just throwing everything at the table or at the wall, partially because of very context-specific heritabilities that are likely bounding our polygenic score accuracy. We think that we're doing best in Europeans with UK Biobank data alone because the heritability is higher in UK Biobank. But we have so little data from the ancestry map. So little data from the ancestry match discovery groups and African ancestry populations that they're having more African ancestry groups probably winning out in this game. We focused on four specific traits where this was particularly pronounced, including... Can I ask you to remind us who was in your validation in the European groups? This isn't all of us. Sorry, there's a lot of moving parts here. Parts here. So, for the next results, which I'm getting pretty close to wrapping up, I'm looking at hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin volume, white blood cell count, and neutriphal count, all of which we performed especially well when predicting in African ancestry groups with the all of us data. So, the all of us data really help us out in this scenario. Okay, so next we're interested in the individual-level accuracies across a variety of different traits. Of different traits. And in this scenario, we were really inspired by some work from Cogdan Kasanovich's lab, where they want to move beyond these population-level descriptors for developing polyagenic score accuracy metrics, partially to the goal of individualizing accuracy. So if you're trying to roll this out in a clinical setting, like within the eMERGE network across 25,000 people, there's a good chance that you're not going to be able to bucket everybody into these nice bins, as we know that ancestry is a continuum rather than a discretized scenario. Scenario. And so they developed some methods to identify these individual-level accuracy metrics, but these were based only on the idea that your study population had been done in a relatively similar and homogeneous ancestry group. So we worked together to extend this out a little bit to incorporate a multi-ancestry discovery cohort and also compared to a European ancestry discovery cohort alone where we have the bulk of the data. Alone, where we have the bulk of the data. So, to this end, on the top, I'm showing you what the European ancestry polygenic score accuracy looks like, this individualized accuracy looks like in the solid line versus the dashed line in the multi-ancestry group. For the top, for BMI, it doesn't really matter. In general, you're doing about the same, whether you're using the multi-ancestry data or whether you're using the European ancestry data. But things start to really differ when we look at something, a trait like neutral count, which has a much sparse. Eutriple count, which has a much sparser architecture than BMI, and also has a really important ancestry-enriched variant, the Duffy Null allele, which leads to benign mutopenia. So if we have something that's so ancestry-enriched in African ancestry groups, then conducting the multi-ancestry discovery GWAS is really, really important. And so in that scenario, we do a much, much better job at predicting sort of across the ancestry spectrum when we're looking at neutral count with this sort of multi-ancourse. With this sort of multi-ancestry meta-analysis, compared to if we're conducting the discovery GWAS and the European analysis alone, which on the solid line on the bottom part. So that just shows you that if you're looking at traits with these large ancestry-enriched effects, maybe a flight gene score actually is a good way to go, but if it is, then you really want to ensure that you're conducting a large and diverse GWAS. Maybe the best thing to do is actually to model that effect that you can more precisely measure separate with a polygenic score. Okay, so some key takeaways. Okay, so some key takeaways here are that the all of us discovery data improves polygenics for performance, especially in the African ancestry target group, but this is really sort of context specific. Using the largest sample size that's available in some of these biobanks is not always the best way to go, and you really need to consider study design. All of us is a much, more, much more heterogeneous study setup than the UK Biobank, for example. And so it's not necessarily going to improve things across the board in a consistent manner. Improve things across the board in a consistent manner in the same way. Some future approaches that we're looking at are phenotype matching across biobanks. So we've looked preliminarily and screened these phenotypes to conduct polygenoscore analysis because we saw that the phenotype distributions were all lining up nicely. We've done harmonization and can see on the phenotypes prior to conducting GWOS. But we do see prevalence differences. We do see shifts in some distributions, like LDL, for example. LDL, for example, when looking across all of us compared to UK Biobank. And so there's clearly a lot of cautious interpretation that's needed with genetic analysis when comparing across these biobanks. Trends in individualized accuracy versus genetic distance may also vary across traits with different genetic architectures. Okay, to that end, I want to thank folks in my lab, especially Kristen and Needing, who led this work. This was a collaboration with Bogdan, especially as Infant Maternity Leave, and folks in his group really were wonderful at helping. And his group really were wonderful in helping us wrap this up. And I have to take questions. Go ahead. Very nice and very informative talk. So I have a question about comparing meta-analysis of GWAS versus meta-ascores. So a number of studies have shown that if you have scores built for different traits in a single ancestry, you can Single ancestry, and you can better analyze the scores to create a meta-score. So, how would that compare to aggregating all these large resources which can have a heavier logistical program? Yeah, there's a bunch of methods that have come out in this space, like Bridge PRS and PRS Mix, which are like basically Elastic Med or other machine learning methods that bring together a bunch of scores. I don't think you're gonna be able to get around this problem of. Able to get around this problem of what's the study design and what's different about one biomedic compared to another. And those scenarios, I think, probably just end up downweighting something like all of us by and large, but you really need to be cautious about where you're ideally trying to predict. The weights that you develop in one population are clearly not necessarily going to transfer to another population in the scenario. First of all, comment, I didn't mean to suggest never appropriate dish for a UK. Never appropriate just for a UK and USA. And apart from it, I'm just wondering: like, there must be places that's not appropriate, and how do we identify them? And we're starting to get it back. The question is, it's fascinating stuff about the heritability differences between the UK and the US, for example. And I'm wondering if you see future directions to help unpick that more. Like, for example, if you subset the ball of us to be the healthier and wealthier types that we know in the UK buy about, would you start to see patterns? And then could you leverage those? Passions that could leverage the reason. Yeah, so to be clear, I would strongly urge caution in interpreting this as a gay American comparison. If you were to look at this, if you were to compare like Vanderbilt Biobank or the Kaiser Biobank, I think you would find differences in heritability depending on what the study design is. Is it a healthier, wealthier, than higher educated study design? In general, we've seen that that tends to increase the heritability of. Increase the heritability of quantitative normal variation traits, but it downweights the heritability when we compare it to BioPink Japan, for example, of disease traits. So there's complications when interpreting heritability differences. So I'm going to propose something. I'm not going to tell me if it's a reasonable conclusion. So my conclusion from what you showed is that the data quality in all of us is significantly worse than the data quality in BioBay. And you can buy a better. That's my conclusion for the comparison of the same European groups between those two. The reason for the improvement for African Americans is because of the sample size issue. The number of African descent individuals UK biomedic is vastly, vastly smaller. So it's like you're comparing really apples and oranges there. And the same thing is actually true of the Latinx population, vastly more than all of us by way. And buy away. So you've got a trade-off of it. I mentioned this before about the blood regiment, adding people's single measures. You can get increased power. It was interesting you got really no increased power at all from adding all of us to UK biobank to some of those traits. That looked really kind of bad to me. I would have, like you said, you would have expected it just on a sample size increase. But that, to me, speaks volumes about the actual differences of the quality of the field type information. And I know from other Feel type information. And I know from other studies we've done that there are differences in the quality of information in these biovegs. The reason it doesn't happen the other way is just sanctifys. Is that your conclusion? I think that's part of it. I think another part of this is likely related to how homogeneous are the groups that we're looking at. If there's something influencing the trait that is far more heterogeneous, let's say you had like some confound, some environmental effect that was just not present in the UK. Effect that was just like not present in the UK Biobank. We suddenly threw that in, and half of the people were experiencing that in the US. I think that that would also diminish the heritability because there's a big. Again, I question that across the board for a lot of different types of things. Agreed, so height is systematically lower. Why should height be lower? Yeah, I just my initial suspicion is just, you know, I've talked about inner quality systematic, but yeah, I think because the anti-sniping. And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know all of this very well, but I know it's called together for a lot, a lot of information. Together from a lot, a lot of different places, you can then buy a rank that's much more prevalent than gene message, the way they collect the treaties. Yeah, yeah, I think both of those are true. I think, in the interest of time, we'll switch the rest of the discussion to later in that. Thank you very much for each of us.
