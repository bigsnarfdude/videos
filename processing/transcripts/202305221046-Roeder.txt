Built connection with many people, and the talks so far have been really interesting. So, I'll talk about something a little bit different that in my guess has a connection with the spectra of the self-similar group actions, at least morally. However, it comes from the Ising model of statistical physics. So this is all a joint work with Javel Bleher and Misha Lubich. And it's also an advertisement. You can see, you can click on those if you get access to our slides or just ask me. It's an advertisement for our paper. So here's the plan. So here's the plan. I'll tell you or remind you what the Ising model is. It's a model of magnets. It's kind of the model of magnets. I will tell you the partition function, which is kind of the granddaddy of all quantities in the Ising model. I will tell you the Li-Yang zeros. These are zeros of this partition function. In suitable coordinates, the partition function is a polynomial. These are zeros of polynomials. We're going to want to study them as the degree of the polynomials goes to infinity. Finally, I'll talk about the thermodynamic limit, which is as Finally, I'll talk about the thermodynamic limit, which is as this degree goes to infinity. There's a natural sort of framework for studying this, and that's what we care about for studying phase transitions. Okay, I'll tell you what's expected for the square lattice or also for the cubical lattice. You might describe your magnet with points in a square grid or in a cubical grid. That's very difficult, so we won't actually answer those questions, but we'll say what's expected. And then we'll tell you about hierarchical lattices, which are much closer to the cell. Lattices, which are much closer to the self-similar groups. These are kind of recursively built sequences of graphs that are a little bit artificial from the sense of magnets, but you can actually rigorously prove theorems. So for me, a lattice is actually just a sequence of graphs, where the nth graph is supposed to be some sort of a refinement of the previous one. So it's not a literal lattice. Yeah, it's a. Yeah, it's a hierarchical lattice. So adjectives are powerful things. They allow you to change your meaning. So you'd want to study this for the Z2 lattice and take n by n squares and take n to infinity, or n by n by n cubes and take n to infinity, but that's very, very hard. So we're going to do something that's kind of an artificial version. And I love questions, so please, please ask me questions. So I'll state our results. We have dynamical results. We have dynamical results. There's a renormalization mapping that helps you study these Liex zeros. That's really the hard part of the paper is studying the dynamics of this mapping. And then we have physical results, which are corollaries to the dynamical results. I will try to give you a sketch, maybe just a taste of the proofs if there's time, but I'd rather communicate clearly up to that point if I have to, instead of getting into the proofs. So the Ising model is a model of magnetic materials. You take a finite graph. Materials. You take a finite graph, gamma, or maybe a sequence of finite graphs, gamma n, where n is a natural number, and they're like the n by n squares. The vertex set will be called Vn, the edge set will be called En. You have electrons at the vertices. Energetic interactions between electrons along the edges. So electrons at the endpoints of a given edge, they energetically prefer to have the same spin. We'll get there. You should imagine the n by n square. Should imagine the n by n of square. And so here are, you have a configuration, sigma, of spins. Here are two quantities. I n is the so-called interaction. That tells you how well aligned the spins are. So if the spins at the endpoints of the same edge have the same sign, then this product is positive. So an interaction that's positive is a very energetically favorable interaction, and the negative interaction is unfavorable. Meanwhile, we have a magnetic moment. This is just the total accumulated magnetic moment of all of our. Total accumulated magnetic moment of all of our spins. Now I'm going to cheat a little bit. In order to work with the hierarchical lattices, I'm going to change the magnetic moment expression slightly. I'm going to change it to that. For the square lattices, maybe up through a constant, that doesn't change anything. But for the hierarchical lattices, it changes a lot and makes things work. There's a kind of physical justification called the Migdal approximation, which is a good justification for doing that, but I want to get into the part of it. But I want to get into the heart of things. So the energy of your state sigma, if it's exposed to an external magnetic field pulling on it, you have an electromagnet in the corner of the room pulling on all of your spins. The energy is Hn of sigma is minus J times the interaction. J is a positive constant. So if the interaction is positive, your energy is lower. If it's negative, your energy is higher. Minus H times the magnetic moment. This is the pull between the spins of the electrons and the external. The spins of the electrons and the external magnetic field. You have this for each sigma at fixed n, and then eventually we'll do this for each n as the size of the lattices goes to zero. For now, think of n as fixed for the next five slides. Yeah. Okay. Good. The magnet is constant here, right? Say again? The magnetic field of H is constant. Well, it's a parameter. It's a parameter, right? So we're going to vary it, but for now it's constant. And J is a parameter, huh? And J is a parameter, huh? Could you show again what you could change? You were so slick. Sleight of hand. What happens? So that's what you would, that would be the magnetic moment. That's a natural thing, sum up the space. But it's kind of nice to have everything based on summing over edges. Not to have some things based on edges, some on vertices. So we do this sleight of hand. I guess in the original case, other than the boundary, it just graph is greater because it doesn't graph. The graph is regular. There's a boundary graph. Exactly. I guess will all your graphs be regular graphs? No. They'll be hence. Highly irregular, hence. Hence why we want that. They are really artificial. On the other hand, they're perhaps the first non-trivial lattice for which the limiting measure of the Yang zeros was characterized. This is a math conference. Frankly. They're recording me, so I should be careful. But I love it. Okay, so here's the energy of your configurations. So here's the energy of your configuration sigma. And well, the problem is you can't keep track of your configuration sigma because there are lots of them. If you have the 10 by 10 grid, you have 2 to the 100 configurations. That's a lot. And you want to do the 100 by 100, 1,000 by 1,000, et cetera, larger and larger grids. So you have a probability distribution. The weight of sigma, you weight the sigmas. The weight of sigma is given by e to the minus the energy of sigma over the temperature. This is the first time the temperature. This is the first time the temperature shows up. So the idea is that if the temperature is very, very low, the lowest energy states occur with very high probability. And the higher energy states are really negligible. But as the temperature goes larger and larger, eventually it kind of saturates against all variations. And all of the states have the same weight. That's the idea. Now these weights probably don't sum to one, so you need to write the normalizing factor, the sum of the weights. Factor, the sum of the weights. This is the partition function. This is a kind of, if you learn one thing in this talk, that's what you should learn is about the partition function. That's the partition function. It governs kind of almost all physical quantities of the model. I'm lying. I didn't write all. But it governs almost all of them. You can write the expected value of the magnetic moment as a very simple expression in terms of it. You can write the free energy, etc. So there's a very high data. So there's a very high danger, though. If this is zero, you can't normalize. But it is a math consequence. Can it be zero? So the weights are positive. So it can't be zero. However, morally it could be zero. Morally, I mean, we're interested in real parameters, t, h, and j. I'll ignore j pretty soon, it'll just be fixed. We're interested in real. J pretty soon, it'll just be fixed. We're interested in real parameters. But if you extend your view and look at complex parameters, you can have zeros. These complex zeros for finite n, they don't bother you. But as n goes to infinity, they can accumulate with some positive density on the real slice. That's what gives you phase transitions. So even though it's kind of a joke about zeros of the partition function, it's actually no joke. I guess you may not care about the complex numbers, but you can't do that. I love complex numbers. Go on. Yeah. Someone may not care about. Go on? Yeah. Someone may not care about the complex numbers, but they care about you. I love it. It's good to be cared for. I thought I might learn some mathematics here, but I'm learning important aphorisms as well. So this is fantastic. So let's do a change of variables. The partition function, you see, in terms of these exponentials, it's a highly transcendental function. It's unpleasant, kind of. But if you write little t is e to the minus j over t, this is kind of like a rescaled, nonlinearly rescaled temperature. Degree scale to temperature. So if you're, just think of J as fixed and positive, if your temperature capital T goes to plus infinity, your exponent is going to zero, e to the zero is one. If your temperature is going to zero, you're getting an e to the minus a large number and large absolute value, so it's going to zero. So these rescale temperatures are from zero to one, with zero being zero temperature and one being infinite honest temperature. We call that temperature-like, we call little z field-like, even though it has. Z field-like, even though it has magnetic field and temperature combined, some people call it the fugacity. Physical values of h and t correspond to little z being positive on the positive real array, and that'll be important in a moment. So the Gibbs weights become monomials in t and z with concrete exponents that are explicit. And our partition function becomes a, well, a Laurent polynomial. You allow negative powers, we can clear them. Negative powers, we can clear them. So we switch from the world of transcendental functions to polynomials. We want to study zeros of polynomials. We want to study zeros of this polynomial. Because we're studying Li-Yang zeros, we have a preference of fixing temperature and varying h or varying z. So we're going to focus on this as a polynomial of z whose coefficients vary with t. And there's this symmetry of the Ising model. If you flip all of the spins, Model. If you flip all of the spins, the interaction is exactly the same. Spins are aligned if and only if their negatives are aligned, but the magnetic moment changes at sign, of course. This corresponds to a symmetry of the partition function, and we call it the fundamental symmetry of the Ising model. Other people call it that too, I assume, but we'll call it that. That'll play a role on the last slide, if I get that far. So if you fix any non-zero t, If you fix any non-zero t, there are twice the number of edges in your graph, zeros in z. Remember, we're biasing things, we're thinking about zeros in z for fixed t. These are called the Li-Yang zeros. We'll get there further in a moment. The free energy by definition is minus t log of the partition function. That is this beautiful sum of logarithmic potentials at the Li-Yang zeros with a minus t in front. There's something yellow there. It's not a rookie mistake. It's not a rookie mistake. I am a rookie. But it's meant to be invisible because it's a junk term. It's there for correctness, but not for viewing. Similarly, the expected value of the magnetic moment is this kind of Cauchy-type potential at each of the zeros with a juncture. So what I'm going to do in two or three slides, I'll take a limit as n goes to infinity of these, and we'll get a logarithmic potential of a Li-Yang measure, a Cauchy transform of a Li-Yang measure. All of the potential theory. Li Yang measure. All of the potential theory just perfectly fits. So anyway, here's the Li-Yang theorem, which is an amazing, amazing theorem. Remember, physical values of t, temperature, correspond to little t between 0 and 1, real. Physical values of h correspond to z being on the positive ray. The theorem from 1952 is that if you fix t to be real, between 0 and 1, the physical temperatures, the zeros in z of the partition function lie on the unit surface. Of the partition function lie on the unit circle. So I did a cartoon. This circle is the unit circle. Notice the only place it can intersect the physical values of z is at z equals 1. This is an algebraic theorem. It's like a 10-minute proof. The polynomial is paleodromic, I think. That's part of it. That's part of it. This algebraic theorem has an amazing consequence. If you vary external magnetic field H, the only possibility of the value of the variable H, the only possibility for when you could have a phase transition, a non-analyticity in your observables, is at h equals zero or z equals one. So you couldn't have a piece of iron and expose it to a magnetic field and be ramping it up and ramping it up and suddenly hit magnetic field 10 or something and have a jump. The Li-Yang theorem tells you that that jump could only happen at h equals zero. Algebraic theorem. It's also a very interesting theorem. Ruel wrote a characteristic. Theorem. Ruel wrote a characterization of polynomials with this property, which ones actually are partition functions. And it's a very beautiful and pretty elementary paper, even though it's published highly. There's also these papers of Gorcia and Brandon. I'm giving the first one, but there's a sequence of them, characterizing linear operators preserving this property about the zeros. So there's all of this interest in Lie-Yang zeros for finite n. But there's also an interest in taking n to an But there's also an interest in taking n to infinity. That's how the actual magnets behave. And so we're going to take the limit as n goes to infinity. By definition, the thermodynamic limit of your sequence of graphs exists if you normalize the three energies for finite n, and if the normalized free energies for finite n converge pointwise for the physical values of z and t. Natural thing to hope for. If that happens, you can use, you need to work. You can use, you need to work a little bit. You use potential theory. You also use Montel's theorem. You use that the Liang zeros lie on the unit circle to control them. You get that there's a limiting measure, a probability measure on the unit circle for every t. They vary with t, describing the limiting distribution of Li Yang zeros. Limiting in the weak sense. Okay? So the name of the game will So, the name of the game will be to understand these measures, mu t, as t varies from 0 to 1. They all have the same properties, staying on the circle. They all stay on the circle. They're pretty badass. It's amazing. I have a question here. Yes, please. So, what is the physical meaning of Erillian theory? Lian's theory just quoted. You're talking about magnetic field and electrons. What is the physical meaning of that theory? So, if I go back here, one consequence is that the only time if you fix temperature and vary the external magnetic field, the only time that you could have any non-analyticity in your observables is when the external field is exactly zero. Because the only place you could have a non-analyticity is where the zeros for finite n accumulate with positive density on the real slice. So, that has been tested in experiments? So, this is a good question, and I'll admit, I'm no physicist. Question, and I'll admit I'm no physicist. But I had a slide, I've given many talks on this. I had a slide. There are people that believe they've experimentally observed the Lie-Yang zeros. And you can certainly observe them at z equals one. But they have ways of sort of artificially seeing phase transitions of a complex H and T. I don't know if it's true. I'm not a physicist. But seems like it could be true. Can we still get the young property? Get the the Yang property of zero staying on the circle in the gaps of magnetic field if H is zero. So if H is zero, your parameters are just right there at Z equals one. And then you have a vertical temperature. Yeah. And then you look at the zeros instead of the complex temperature plane. And those are the so-called Fischer zeros. And those for the Z2 lattice lie on a union of two circles. But for other lattices, it's different. Questions? Other questions? Okay. So continue a little bit. Here's the honest potential theory version of the limiting free energy is the logarithmic potential of the Li-Yang measure with little adjustments. The magnetic moment in the limit is this Cauchy transform of the measure. And the singularities of the Cauchy transform are pretty well studied as you cross. Pretty well studied as you cross the support of the measure. There's the Slahotsky-Flamelsch formula, for example. And there are strengthenings of that kind of thing. If you approach, if Z approaches one, corresponding to magnetic field zero from above, say, the limit is the density. If the Li-Yang measure was absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue, the limit is the density of that measure at angle 0, or at z equals 1. So the limiting density of Li-Yang 0. So, the limiting density of Lie ANG zeros, if it exists at angle zero, is exactly how magnetic your block of iron is if you expose it to the external magnetic field and turn it back off. So you can kind of measure that. So the idea is a phase transition, basically by definition, occurs anywhere that the limiting free energy varies non-analytically. And studying the Lie and zeros is about phase transitions as Z varies, but T is fixed. So, for example, this jump when you cross z equals one at low temperature is a phase transition. So, here's what's believed to be true. I learned this from my colleague Pavel Bleher. It wasn't really written anywhere before our paper. But anybody you talk to who studies Liang zeros will tell you that this is what they believe to be true. There's also a more recent physics paper where they claim that this is actually true, but it's not proved. True, but it's not proved. So if the temperature is zero, it's easy to check that the Lieang zeros at finite n are just the suitable roots of minus one, the suitable power roots of minus one, so they're distributed according to Lebesgue measure, right? If you go up just a little bit, it's been proved for the square lattice, maybe for the cubical lattice, that you have a positive C2 density everywhere. So the absolutely continuous limiting measure with positive C2 density. That was a breakthrough around 2005. I can give you a reference. 2005. I can give you references later if you like. If you go up to some critical temperature, let me go back a moment. Here, I don't know if the laser works. Here, you have a positive density at angle of zero. That corresponds to a jump, to a spontaneous magnetization. If you go further, you no longer have a jump. This density has gone to zero, but the support is the whole circle still. So, this is the so-called critical temperature, and it can be related to the critical temperature in the just temperature-varying slice of the Fisher zero. Varying spice of the Fischer zeros. You can actually, if you subscribe to the Wilson-Fisher renormalization theory, you can compute the exponent at the edge of this density. It's, I think, 1 15th is one of these funny critical exponents. If you go above, suddenly you have a, you're conjectured to have a definite gap where you have no density of Lieang zero, no measure of Lieang zeros at all. It's disjoint from the support. It's been proved for a high enough temperature that you have no Lieang zeros at all. At all in such an interval. But the positive density on two intervals, absolutely continuous, and there's a conformal field theory calculation by Cardi and others of the exponent at the endpoints, and it actually blows up instead of decay. But these are kind of not rigorously studied. And finally, you get to temperature one, and you just have two Dirac masses at angle plus or minus pi or two. That's easy to check. Plus or minus pi or two. That's easy to check. I mean, the limits of infinite and zero temperature are easy, and the part between is hard. So, this is, yeah, huh? Go back one slide. Sure. Is it believed that in the green area there are no zeros at all? So, for high enough temperature, it's proved by Ruel and Galavate, Merrick-Sole. And I'm missing the last one. But it's proved that there are no zeros in an interval around angle zero. Around angle zero. For finite angle. Yeah, but what is believed for T slightly above T0? It's believed for T slightly above T0 that the limiting measure doesn't charge that. But there's still zeros accumulating. I let you study that. That's your job. Okay, so here's the picture, and I want to tell you something really amazing. About six months ago, I found out about a very nice paper by Zachar Kabluchko about the Kablukko, about the Lie egg zeros for the Curie-Weiss model. This is essentially if you did not the Z2 lattice or the ZD lattice, but if you did the complete graph on n vertices and let n go to infinity. Well, you shouldn't quite do that because the interactions will get too strong. So you normalize the interactions down to make it more even. And he has proved using methods from probability theory essentially that for the Curie-Weiss model, the Li-Yang zeros match exactly the conjectural picture for the square lattice. That's a very exciting thing to me. That's a very exciting thing to make. So, I would like to spend some time learning his paper. So, let me move on to what I'm able to do with collaborators, Lubich and Blaher. We're able to study the Diamond Harp lattice. This isn't a completely artificial thing. Megdahl and Kadanoff invented this as a kind of low-temperature approximation to the square lattice. So, what you do is you take gamma 0 as an edge, gamma 1 is a diamond, gamma 2 is a conglomeration of four diamonds glued together. Conglomeration of four diamonds glued together along a pattern of a diamond, etc. So you could think about it as two different ways. One is that every time you go from n to n plus one, you replace every edge with a diamond. But it's better also, to think another way is going from n to n plus one, you take four copies of gamma n and glue them together along a kind of pattern of a diamond, using these marked vertices A and B as endpoints. That's better for the kind of renormalization theory. They're equivalent, but it's differently. Equivalent, but it's different ways of thinking. So, this is our artificial lattice, but non-trivial. And we studied the Lieang zeros for this lattice very extensively. So, I want to tell you what we've done. First of all, there's this Migdal-Kadenoff renormalization, which was known much before us. You can cut the partition function into a sum of four terms. You can take the terms where the spin at the marked vertices is plus one. It's a conditional sum. You can take the term where spin at A is You could take the term where spin at A is plus 1 and spin at B is minus 1, but it's symmetric. It's the same as with minus and plus. And then you could take minus minus. And your partition function will be a sum of these four terms. So if you can compute un, vn, and wn, you've computed zn. Cut it up into good terms. And with these good terms, there is a beautiful homogeneous polynomial recursion. So this is like what people in my official What people in my official area, several complex variables dynamics, like to study is this gives you a rational map on the projective space. This is what we like to study, but amazingly, this is a pretty tricky one to handle. So let me go forward. The derivation of these is easy, but it would take about two minutes, and since time is precious, I want to get to the heart of the matter. You can actually do a funny thing using some symmetries of the diamond. You can change variables. This renormalization here was in these conditions. This renormalization here was in these conditional partition functions. We like z and t better. That's the variables we like. So if you switch, you can do a kind of change of variables. It's actually a quadratic mapping, a two-to-one mapping. You get a renormalization in z and t. Now it's not clear what this means, what this does, but I'll tell you on the next slide what it does. So here's the point. The Li-Yang zeros live on the cylinder, t is between 0 and 1, z is on the unit circle. Z is on the unit circle. Honest, perfect cylinder. And you can check that this nice mapping maps the cylinder to itself. So far, so good. It maps C2 to C2, or CP2 complex projective space, to itself, but it preserves the real slice of this cylinder. And the Lie-Yang zeros for the interval are something you just explicitly compute. They're this quadratic curve, algebraic curve intersected with the cylinder. I'll show you a cartoon of it in a moment. I'll show you a cartoon of it in a moment. But the beauty of the renormalization is for every n, greater than or equal to 1, the n plus first Liang zeros are just the pullback with the mapping R of the nth Li Yang zeros. So we just iteratively pull back these Li Yang zeros. And I have a cartoon picture of it in a moment, but this is where the dynamical systems come in. This is what renormalization theory is for. So that's why we do dynamics. So here's the, this is a kind of accurate cartoon. This is a kind of accurate cartoon. This is what they actually look like. These are the zeros for the single interval Lie X zeros. For any fixed temperature, you've got two of them. And where they are varies with temperature. That's why you have an interesting thing as temperature changes. You go up one, you pull back these curves under R, you get a union of eight curves. And if you do the counting problem, you know that polynomial has degree eight, so you're supposed to have eight. Notice that they're bunched up at these two points. That's kind of an interesting. Bunched up at these two points. That's kind of an interesting thing. You pull back again, you have 32 curves. And you should do this in the limit. You should somehow study the limit of this sequence of laminations on the cylinder and try to characterize the limit. And we'll characterize it as a measured foliation, a transverse invariant measure on a foliation. That'll describe our the I see. So this is going from the uniform at t equals zero to something on atomic. It's gonna tend to be uniform, uniform. It's going to tend to be uniform. They're equally spaced. So, but they're counted differently at the top. They're counted differently. They're definitely different at the top, so it's small. So at the bottom, we're going to get the Levake measure. At the top, we're going to get a countable sum of direct masses that are evenly spaced, but the weights are different. Great. So here's some comments about the mapping. I should stop in 15 minutes, is that right? 11, sir. Okay, great. Okay, great. So here are some comments about the mapping. The hardest thing about this mapping, and one of the hardest things about rational mappings in two or more variables, is that they're not holomorphic at some points. So this mapping has these points at the top of the cylinder where it's not holomorphic. If you go back to the formula, if you were to plug in z equals plus or minus i and t equals 1, you're going to get a 0 over 0. That's very bad. That tells you that, in fact, That tells you that, in fact, the value of the mapping will have different limits as you approach those points with different directions, which makes it rational function. And those are hard. Understandably, they are CP too. I find them hard. Okay, so in particular, if you go to here, if you approach one of those points like alpha minus, One of those points like alpha minus at angle omega, the value of your limit depends upon what omega was, and you'll map out to some point on this curve, g. So in some sense, alpha minus is a point that maps to a whole curve on the cylinder. Tricky. And similarly for alpha plus. For experts, something that's helpful for us is that the image is disjoint from those, and that helps us a lot. For other hierarchical lattices, you don't always have that. Don't always have that. They're actually the same. But the point is that near the top, they map near the top here, which is far from there, and it takes arbitrarily long to get back to them. So you can recover. If you have a bad experience, you have a long time of good experiences. So this thing is encoded at the very top. You're saying if I get a point at the very top, spaced out from this alpha nice alpha plus, what you're talking about is at the very top level. It's a great top level. Yeah, I see. It sort of like reminds me of some kind of a frowning motion type thing. It's a blow up followed by a projection. It's a blow-up followed by a projection. So you don't need to worry too much about where you hit exactly at the top, but you should worry about where you hit. Maybe the battery just died. Did I turn this off? Crazy. Anyway, you should worry about where you hit very close to the top, because then you can drift over and get close to those points and get recycled down through the bottom and lower part of the cylinder and come back up. Part of the cylinder comes back off, and you have a very unpleasant trip. Okay. Oh, that's very sad. Also, I can use your finger. Yeah, I can use my finger. Okay. So that's one aspect of the mapping. Another aspect which I removed a slide of is not proper. So the pre-image of a compact set in the cylinder. Compact set in the cylinder, in the open cylinder, will often reach alpha plus and alpha minus because their images hit this curve. And so it's not proper. So there are a lot of things that are extremely bad about this mapping. Nevertheless, there are some good things. The circle at the bottom is invariant at t equals zero. In fact, restricted to it, you have angle quadrupling. It's a standard, simplest dynamical system. And it's transversely super attractive. The value of t in the image, if you're close enough, is like the square of the value of t. Close enough is like the square of the value of t you had before. So it's nicely super attracting. It has a nice basin of attraction, an open basin of attraction of points whose orbits under the mapping converge to the circle. I'll show you a computer picture of it in a moment. There are also these actually collapsing intervals. If you put in angle plus or minus pi over 2, those intervals collapse, even all the way up to the indeterminate points. They collapse down to the bottom. So you have indeterminacy and collapsing behavior, which is tricky. Was tricky. You look at the circle at the top, that's also invariant. You have angle doubling. This is this failure of properness. You have a change of degree as you change from the bottom to the top. And it's non-uniformly transversely superattracting. So if you approach near the indeterminate points, you get sent away if you approach in the wrong direction. But on average, if you choose like a Birkhoff generic point in the circle at the top, then you will be attracted to it. You have a positive measure. You have a positive measure, kind of a Pessin theory positive measure basin of attraction, but not an open basin of attraction. So, this is best illustrated with a picture. So, points in blue have orbits converging to the bottom. Open reaches the top at angles plus or minus pi over 2. It actually reaches the top at several other points at the iterated pre-images of those points. You have a basin of attraction of the top in orange, a positive. In orange, the positive measure. And something you don't see is you don't see a big black glob or a positive measure, the big measure black set of points whose orbits don't go to the bottom or the top. That's one of our theorems, is that the union is a full measure. So here's our dynamical result. So the main kind of motor of everything we do is this fact that the mapping is so-called partially hyperbolic. And I'll unpack that. So what that means, So, what that means, we have control on the tangent spaces. There is a horizontal tangent cone field that tells you kind of what vectors should be considered horizontal. I'll have a picture. And a vertical line field in the complementary direction. And they're invariant under DR. So a horizontal vector is sent to another horizontal vector, a vertical vector to another vertical vector. It's some sort of version for endomorphisms analogous to dominated splitting for a diffeo. So here's the picture for the cone fields. So the cone at x. For the cone fields. So the cone at x, the cone at x is mapped into this green cone, which is within the cone at R of X. And the vertical line at L of X maps exactly to the vertical line at R of X. So that's just the dominated splitting. And then moreover, the tangent vectors in the horizontal cone get expanded geometrically under iterating the mapping. At a rate that geometrically dominates any expansion that could happen in the. Any expansion that could happen in the vertical directions. You could be expanding in both directions, but the horizontal always wins. This is the partial hyperbolicity, and this is the kind of hard part of the paper, one of the hard parts. Let me mention the idea, they can correct me, two of them are here, Dang and Gertrude. The idea of our proof for the invariant conefield, I believe, plays a role in their work with the Basilica group. I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about the expansion proof, not the cone field, but the cone field plays a role in their work. It's an idea that might be useful in other places. Any questions? Okay. Did you actually attempt to compute the Julia set on the map? So this is a good question. The mapping is on the cylinder, it's not a conformal mapping, it's this kind of partially hyperbolic mapping. It's this kind of partially hyperbolic mapping. You could think of the Julia set as the boundary between the blue and the orange. Or you could think of the mapping on CP2. Then you could try to compute the Julia set, but that's in CP2 as some sort of thing you can't visualize very well. You could also study on there's an invariant line at Z equals one, an invariant complex line. You can compute that Julia set. But that's 20 years before us, so we didn't bother. So, some more dynamical theorems. Partially hyperbolic mappings don't always have a unique invariant central foliation. What do I mean by central? You take the vertical line field and you just integrate it. You get a foliation. The Cauchy existence theorem tells you that integral curves exist. The line field isn't Lipschitz, and therefore you don't have uniqueness a priori, but you can do some dynamical tricks to get uniqueness. The reason I The reason I care about that will be coming up soon. This central foliation in the blue part, it is C infinity regular as a foliation. You can C infinity straighten it out to an honest foliation. And we had a long discussion and attempted proofs with Lager and Lubich to prove it was real analytic, but my former PhD student was Scott Keschner and I proved it's not real analytic anywhere. And that was a very challenging proof that was presented in this very. Proof that was presented in this very room 10 years ago. Here's almost any point on the cylinders in the basin of the bottom or the top. This is kind of an instance. Let me mention the basin of the top has positive measure and the basin of the bottom is open and dense. So they're kind of intermingled, not symmetrically, but kind of asymmetrically intermingled. It's this famous intermingled type of business from Con York, Bonifaci Mill. Khan York, Bonifaud Milner, Ily Shenko-Klepson, Saltykov, etc. It's a popular topic in real dynamics. That was tricky. We had to do some very serious, in my mind, kind of distortion control. Okay, physical results, question. Okay. Physical results. So if you have such a foliation, it's vertical with respect to the cone field, so it always goes up. You can take the holonomy where you go from the bottom and you just slide. The bottom, and you just slide along the leaves of your foliation to height t. That's a homeomorphism of the circle. Turns out that it's not a very nice homeomorphism of the circle, it's not absolutely continuous. We have some really tricky things, but that's a homeomorphism. Our physical theorem is that if you take the Lebesgue measure at the bottom and holonome it to height t, that is exactly the Li-Yang measure at height t. So you're going to transport the Li-Yang measure along holonome. The Li Yang measure along holomes. Right. Right. To any height, to any height. At any height. At any height. And you get the living all the way up to the top. So the limiting measure is actually just holonomy or you just want to transport the. Well, no, no, the limiting measure is that you take n to infinity at a given height. So we want to study the Lieg measure depending upon one parameter, t. For any t, we want to study it. Okay. And we know how to study it at t equals zero, it's the Bay measure. And we want to study it at t equals a half. At t equals a half. So we holonome to a half, and studying properties of this foliation tells us what the Li Yang measure is at a given height, say a half. So the Li Yang measures, they're a family, a one-parameter family of measures, and they're organized as a transverse invariant measure on those foliation. That's canonical. There's only one of these transverse invariant measures? So it depends. Basically, if you set up a measure on a given transversal, then it's unique. But you could choose other ones. You could choose other ones. For example, For example, if I took Lebesgue measure above the critical temperature and holined it around, I would get something different. Now, how much could it vary? Question. It's not absolutely continuous, so. It's horrible. It's no nice. I leave that to you. But in the basin of the bottom, the holonomies are C infinity. So it's a mixture of behaviors. But you get these really interesting. But you get these really interesting phase transitions. You can compute critical exponents and so on. So here is supposed to be an analogous picture to what I did for the Z2 lattice to give you a cartoon of what we had. So at temperature zero, you have the Levesque measure. At positive but below critical, you can compute the critical temperature as some solution to a quartic polynomial. Below critical temperature, you again have not just C2, but in fact C infinity density, it's just the holinomy image. It's just the whole anomal image. You get up to critical temperature and you can compute everything explicitly of exactly what's conjectured for the Z2 lattice, but rigorously proved here. And you can compute this exponent in terms of some multipliers of a fixed point, of a degree normalization, mapping R, et cetera. And then you go above critical temperature and everything kind of explodes. This is more of a cartoon now. So your measure is still supported on the whole interval, but it has positive density and the complement of a counterset of positive wave measure. Of Levik measure. So it's kind of pushed against this counterset and squeezed against this counterset. And one of the things we wanted to study is to study the end points. But the endpoints are very tricky because it looks like the topology of the yellow is that you cannot, the yellow is a union of kind of curves, of pairs, but you cannot hit the interior of a curve without hitting the endpoint of another curve, is what it looks like. It looks like their interiors are varied. So studying the endpoints is very tricky for this. So, anyway, you keep going, you get squeezed, you get squeezed, and then you get a countable sum of the direct masses. So, in five minutes, I can tell you the tiniest bit about the idea of the proof. The idea is this, is you should take your height t0, where you want to prove horizontal expansion, and it's sufficient, it turns out, to study for perfectly horizontal vectors. You take your circle at height t0, and you complexify it into a complex plane. And you complexify it into a complex plane, pt0. You look at p0, you're going to relate everything to the zero height. And then you just apply r-iterated n times to your complex line or complex plane at height t0. It becomes some horrible or beautiful, in your view, algebraic curve of very high degree that wraps around the cylinder like this. And you're trying to show that it expands in how it's wrapping around the cylinder using complex methods in the C2. That's the game. That's the game. Then you project it down to the circle at the bottom as your kind of reference. That's your gauge for if you expand it. So you're interested in studying this composition, pi composed with r to the n, it's a mapping from a circle to a circle, and you want to show that that thing is expanding. Derivatives are exponentially large in n. There's a tremendous problem, is that the degrees of the algebraic curves are to the n. Curves, r to the n of this complex line, are larger than 4 to the n, but the degree on the cylinder is 4 to the n. So there's a mismatch of degrees. So basically you'd be dead. You couldn't do it. This is called algebraic instability. It's a popular topic in holomorphic dynamics and several variables. What comes to save us, you go back to the origins. The mapping in Z and T was artificial, and in fact, if you look at the derivation. Artificial, and in fact, if you look at the derivation of it, it's completely cobbled up. You've got something squared, and then you take a square root and say, oh, yeah, okay, that's just the original thing. It's really artificial. It works, but it's highly unnatural. So if you work instead, if you work downstairs with this mapping, the Lie-Yang cylinder is no longer as visible as a real slice in C2. But if you work with that mapping, the algebraic stability works and everything works perfectly. So rather than go through the kind of notation, So, rather than go through the kind of notation, and I should mention that this mapping is algebraically stable, it's degree 4, it's iterate, nth iterate, it's degree 4 to the n, everything's cool. Li-Yang cylinder becomes a boobious band. I mean, things get a little bit kind of murky, but it works out. Let me skip through a little bit of notation. So, I'm just explaining here what everything converts to, but just remember, we want to do r to the n composed with a projection. Okay, so if you keep Okay, so if you keep going, this is what you want to study in the new coordinates. Psi is a parameterization now of a conic that replaces your complex line at heights t0. You apply r to the n, and then you project onto the line at infinity now. You look at this composition, and you know you're onto something because you find the formula for this composition, and it's exactly the quotient of the two conditional partition functions. We had three of them, but you ignore the one with mixed terms. That's a good sign that you're onto something. That's a good sign that you're onto something. Moreover, you can prove that this mapping is an expanding Blaschke product. We have two different proofs: one's a holomorphic dynamics and one's a math physics proof. The math physics proof is if you fiddle with the formula and use the fundamental symmetry, which mixes up the coefficients of the Laurent polynomial for the plus plus with the minus minus, it converts them because you flip spins. You get a beautiful symmetry. And moreover, since the And moreover, since the marked vertices at A and B for the nth graph have valence 2 to the n, you can just check that these coefficients vanish in some range for one of them. They'll give you a factor of z to the n in your Blaschke product. I'm going warp speed now. And so you finally get, down to here, you get a beautiful Blaschke product here with a z to the 2 to the n minus 1 coefficient in front. z to the 2 to the n minus 1 is a perfectly honestly 2 to the n minus 1 is a perfectly honestly expanding map, and you just want to make sure that this other Blashy product isn't fighting you. What does it mean that it's not fighting you? It means that you need that the zeros, the di's, are in the unit disk. Then the real derivative along the circle would be adding on to the real derivative here. Why are they in the unit disk? If so, we're done. Well, Well, you think about physics. There is an awesome Li-Yang theorem with boundary conditions, which is just a corollary, a direct corollary of the classical Li-Yang theorem. I think it might have been known before, it's murky. If you take your graph, finite connected graph, take a finite subset of the vertices S, here was A and B, for example. I know I'm out of time, but let me continue for 30 seconds. Oh, okay. Anyway, if you put on your marked vertex set, you condition that you have spins minus. Vertex set, you condition that you have spins minus one, but every other vertex has spin plus or minus one. Then you look at the conditional partition function. Then all of the zeros of this conditional partition function in Z, if you didn't have the condition, they'd be on the unit circle. They are biased inward to the unit disk as we want it. So that's the end of the story. We wrote some kind of long papers about this. If you'd like to read them, if you like Joint Spectra, there's a second paper about limiting. There's a second paper about limiting distributions of algebraic curves in both Z and T simultaneously. So that may or may not be interesting. Thank you very much. Thank you. Any questions? What can you say about the dynamics on on all of B two of of this straight R? Straight R. So it's what one thing I can say is if you take any algebraic curve, or more generally closed positive 1,1 current, the normalized iterated pullbacks converge to the green current. That's one thing we can say. We can say something about the Fatu set. We have some real three-dimensional solid cylinders. We take the Liang cylinder and fill it in with real slices. Those are in the Fatu set. Things like that. Like that. You don't know anything about other components of the FIDU set? We don't know any other components. We have a question or a conjecture that is just those. We put a lot of questions in our paper, hoping that people would answer them. We needed help. Other questions? For the regularity below the critical temperature. So you you said you have C infinity and so And so why is it so? Because super attraction was too important. The super attraction is incredibly important. And basically you're converging so fast to the bottom you can just directly estimate using some terrible multi-dimensional analog of the Fey de Bruto formula that you can estimate this. And it works. There are no questions. Let's thank the speaker Montaigne. So we should gather here at one o'clock for the
