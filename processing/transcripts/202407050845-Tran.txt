The title of Loyal Crystals in this intro slide. I have two videos playing. One is an emulsion system of 5CB mixed with a chiral dopant and seeing how anchoring is very important for controlling the assembly of the molecules there to control the patterns that are formed. And then later on in the talk, I'm going to move forward. On in the talk, I'm going to move towards a larger length scale system where the messogen is now, for instance, cellulose nanocrystals or colloidal particles, and trying to see what strategies we can employ to control the assemblies of these larger liquid crystals. So, okay. Probably I don't need to show this slide for this audience, especially given that I'm presenting on the last day of this conference. Conference. But just to kind of situate you in the data, the workhorse for a lot of liquid crystals experiments is polarized optical microscopy. And so if you have the rods of the liquid crystal disordered, they form the isotropic phase and that will appear black because the birefringence of the molecule will be sort of smeared out by the random orientation of the molecules in the sample. But then if you But then, if you start to have orientational ording, and here is a picture from Oleg Laventovich's lab of a Schlieren texture of a pneumatic liquid crystal. So since the rods start to point in the same direction as their neighbors, you can start to have the material influencing the polarization of light, and then you'll start to get light intensity appearing through cross-polarizers. And so the main thing. And so, the main phase that I'm going to spend a lot of time talking about is the cholesteric phase. And I think we've heard a bit about that in some of the other talks earlier this week. But the cholesteric phase is basically the rod-like molecules are not only pointing in the same direction as their neighbors, but now they're also stacking in a helical fashion. And then, this helical twisting of the material often results in you seeing a bunch of stripes when you look at them through the polarized. Look at them through the polarized optical microscope. And so these stripes are a result of the twisting of the messages. And so, say, these black regions are where the molecules are pointing out of the plane. The brighter regions are where they're pointing in plane, and so on. And I think Randy also already described this in his talk as well. And so, the motivation for studying cholesterol liquid crystals initially, I'm going to show work that I did in collaboration with. That I did in collaboration with Teresa Lopez-Leon and also Randy, where we were trying to see if we can control defects that are formed within cholesteric liquid crystals. And so this is an image that Randy also showed from Dan Beller, where if you wanted to describe structures that are formed in a cholesteric liquid crystal, you have to worry about not just the direction that the molecules are pointing, but also the direction that they're twisting. That they're twisting the pitch vector or pitch line. And so these two are always perpendicular to each other. So you automatically also get this cross product. And so unlike the pneumatic, when you have defects in the nematic, you only have to worry about this one kind of quantity. But now for a cholesteric, if you wanted to describe structures in the cholesteric, you have to worry about the sort of like triad of line vectors in space. And so the Space. And so the defects that you get from cholisterics can be a little more complicated. Okay. And so I'm going to start first by showing you experiments using a molecular liquid crystal using the sometimes called the Drosophila fly of liquid crystals, 5CB. Many people have already shown a bunch of systems using 5CB. And it's chiral dopant, which is sort of a chemically similar molecule that has. Sort of a chemically similar molecule that has this extra kink in the tail. We use this at 2.8 weight percent, so we get a pitch of around five microns. Okay, so here is a video of a microfluidic device because we want to confine the choosteric liquid crystal in order to frustrate it geometrically and excite certain defects through this geometrical confinement. This geometrical confinement. And so, what you see here is water on the inner phase, on the inner capillary, surrounded by liquid crystal that's flowing on the outside. And then as we reach towards the taper of the microfluidic device, this is also a video from Guillaume De Ray in Teresa Lopez-Leon's group. The taper in the needle will cause a pressure drop in the Will cause a pressure drop in the flow and it will shear this co-flowing jet of water surrounded by a shell of liquid crystal. And then this will lead to a jetting instability that then causes, that then breaks up into a bunch of droplets. And so you can produce many of these double emulsions where you have these shells of liquid crystal, in this case, cholesteric liquid crystal confined within a shell. Confined within a shell. And okay, and so we want the shell geometry because the shell geometry allows for there to be these two surfaces. And the two surfaces will, or the things that we have control over, we can dictate how the molecules are pointing at each of these surfaces. And that will help us to tune the bulk structure. And so then we can think about ways in which we can tune the anchoring of the molecules at these surfaces. At these surfaces and see what types of structures we should expect. And so, for planar anchoring, how do you fit a helix within a shell that has planar anchoring on the inner and outer shell? You can fit it simply like this. And then it's just a schematic where the helical pitch axis is radial everywhere in the shell. And you'll get somewhere in the shell some localized regions of disorder. Localized regions of disorder that will span the width of the shell. And this has been studied a lot by Teresa and also in the group of Slobodan Schumer. But okay, and so now let's think about this other extreme where you have strong perpendicular anchoring. If it's too strong, you will compete with the twisting of the cholesteric. And so if you have a, say, a shell that's not very thick and you have very strong perpendicular anchoring, then you can undo the twisting and end up with. Undo the twisting and end up with something that's sort of like a pseudo-2D pneumatic because of the strong perpendicular anchoring that's imposed by the surfaces. But okay, when you have weak anchoring, that's where maybe you can start to think about defects that are unique to the cholesteric, because now you'll have the pitch axis lying tangent to the surface of the shell. And so that means that you'll have frustration from the spherical geometry along. Spherical geometry along the pitch axis. And so you'll get: if you have weak perpendicular anchoring due to the twisting, you'll see that some regions will be parallel to the surface, but then some will be perpendicular. And so it's twisting along the surface. And the question is, what sorts of structures do we see if we do this? And so here I'm going to show you a simulation that was done by Max, Max Lorentovich in the audience, where it's a Lano-Dejan energy, minimum. It's a Lano-Dejen energy minimization. I think you've seen many examples of this throughout the week as well. But basically, what we're seeing here is a cross-section of the shell, and then the inner surface of the shell is highlighted. And this is the top view of the outer shell. And the coloring is showing here the director dotted into the radial direction. And so the red regions here are perpendicular to the surface. And then because of the twisting, it goes blue. It goes blue and then it goes red again and so on. And so you see these stripes appearing like what I had described earlier, as what you would expect when you look through cross-polarizers. But in terms of defects, you can see that there's a region here where this sort of blue region has this intersection. And so this is a region where the twisting direction, the pitch axis, is not well defined. And so you have a pitch defect here. And if you look from the top, you can see. And if you look from the top, you can see that these pitch defects are characterized by these sort of double spiral domains, focal conic domains. And so these cholesterol focal conic domains are really characteristic of cholesteric phase. And so, okay, now let's go to some experiments. How do you control the anchoring of a molecular liquid crystal? Often this can be done using a surfactant that has a long carbon tail. Has a long carbon tail. And so the tails will want to interdigitate with the liquid crystal. And so if the long rod-like molecules want to be parallel to the tails, then they'll be perpendicular to the surface. And so you can use a fluorescently labeled lipid. Here's the data that I show where the surfactant is labeled by Texas Red. And then you can see that by varying the concentration, you can induce different patterns because you're frustrating. Different patterns because you're frustrating the twisting in different amounts. And so at these lower concentrations, you can have nice twisting at the surface, and you see many of these double spiral patterns, these focal conic domains. But then when you increase it further, the twisting is more frustrated and you get more of a disordered type pattern. And then if you put too much lipid, then the surface is saturated and there's no more twisting happening at the surface. But what's also interesting is that here, not only does the surface Here, not only does the surfactant alter the anchoring of the liquid crystal, but the liquid crystal is also patterning and affecting where the surfactant is locating at the surface. So you can also use this to create a chemically heterogeneous surface and pattern it in a specific way. Okay, and so now to the shell geometry. Now that we know how the surfactant and the liquid crystal interface with one another, let's look at the shell. And so in this case, this is just using. And so, in this case, this is just using a simple, more simple surfactant, single tail, not fluorescently labeled, sodium dolosyl sulfate. And at a very high concentration with a thick shell, you'll see something that looks like this, where these are disclination lines that are in the bulk of the cholesteric. And they're sort of where the liquid crystal tries to twist away from the surface. And so you can imagine this is a result of there. You can imagine this is a result of there being a high concentration, very strong anchoring at the surface, preventing twisting at the surface. And so, this is a video. As the video plays, the solution of the SDS is being diluted over time. And so that weakens the anchoring. And then you can see how that changes some of the patterns that we see in the shell. So we see these focal conic domains. There's some instability that occurs until all of the stripes are. Until all of the stripes are removed, when you have planar anchoring. And just as a reminder, we're moving from this very strong perpendicular anchoring regime to this weaker one to planar anchoring. And also one thing to note is that the number of focal conic domains is also many. It's not just the equilibrium configuration that's shown in Max's simulations, where there were just two at the poles. And so this is all related to some. So, this is all related to some instability, and that's an instability that I want to talk about in a few slides. And so, just an overview. By varying the anchoring, these are sort of the types of patterns that you can expect to see. And then, one thing I also want to note is that I call this an instability because no matter what surfactant concentration I selected, I couldn't get this type of pattern to be stabilized for a long time. The pattern to be stabilized for a long period of time. It would either, after a couple of hours, collapse to having this planar configuration or collapse to being this focal conic domain state. And so this we really think is a metastable or a transitory state in the system. Okay. And so before moving to additional details, I also want to just show that you don't need to just use surfactants, you can also use nanobins. Just use surfactants, you can also use nanoparticles and so leverage the elasticity of the liquid crystal to pattern the nanoparticles. Here they're being functionalized by an oppositely charged surfactant, and you can use them to make the particle surface active. And then by changing the shell geometry, you can also change how the particles will end up being patterned at the surface. And so, if you swell them, that also changes the energy landscape, changes the patterns and defects that you get in the system, and that will change how. Get in the system, and that will change how also the particles order at the surface. But okay, so now back to this instability that I was highlighting before. In the first video that I showed you of the shell changing in a solution with changing surfactant concentration, that was where homeotropic anchoring was being reduced. In this case, it's being introduced. And so you'll see the similar. And so you'll see the similar instability pattern appearing no matter if you go from planar to homeotropic anchoring or homeotropic to planar anchoring. And so Max and I spent some time thinking about why this must be, why is this pattern appearing? The pattern also has this additional periodicity that's about twice the natural periodicity of the system, so about twice the pitch. And so we found that a bit curious. And so Max turned to some. And so, Max turned to some simulations. So, here there is a shell that has planar anchoring on the inside and outside. Here's this local region of disorder that spans the shell that I had mentioned at the beginning. And then you can see that this is sort of one half pitch. Here's another half pitch and another half pitch. They're sort of layering like an onion. And then, if you take this as an initial condition and then you relax the system. And then you relax the system by imposing perpendicular anchoring at these surfaces. At the end, you'll end up with something that looks like this, where there are stripes, and the thickness of the stripes is about half a pitch, which is what you would normally expect. But then if you look halfway during this relaxation process at cross sections that include the defect, you'll see these first, there are these stripe patterns, and these are. First, there are these stripe patterns, and these are similar, being about twice the size of the pitch. So, we think it matches what we see in our experiments. But looking at the cross-sections that include the defect, you can see that these onion-like layers start to, it doesn't look very different from the initial condition, the initial configuration. It's just sort of wavy. So, this additional waviness of this onion-like packing, we believe are sort of Uh, we believe are sort of undulations from perhaps this change in the anchoring condition. Um, okay, and what was curious to us also is that these undulations didn't happen away from the defect. So if you looked away from the defect, you had sort of the perfect onion-like structuring that you would expect from just having planar anchoring. And so the presence of the defect also kind of helps with these undulations taking place. Okay, and so I say undulations because it also made us think about some classic liquid crystal theories. For instance, if you take a cholesterol liquid crystal and come and smush it between two glass plates, and the two glass plates also have planar anchoring, so that you get this helical twisting perfectly perpendicular to the glass. You now take this and you apply a magnetic field. Often this is. A magnetic field, often the system will respond by undulating in either one dimension or two dimensions. And this response of the system was studied by Helfert and Hero in the 70s, and it's called the Helfert-Herot instability. And so this inspired us. Max spent some time looking into their models and their theory and thinking about perhaps this is the same mechanism as what's happening within our own system. And so he took that. So, he took that model, and instead of having a bulk field, now treating the anchoring as some surface field that has a penetration depth within the system. And so, if you go from having planar or perpendicular anchoring and then just having a change in this anchoring, you're going to frustrate the layer spacing. The layer spacing doesn't want to be stretched when it's being changed. And so, often you'll have this undulating response in the system. Response in the system to adapt to this change in the, to either say an applied field, in this case, the surface field, and then maintaining the preferred elasticity of the system, which is keeping the layer spacing the same. And so using this theory, modifying the theory, Max was able to find a critical anchoring strength that's kind of typical of what you would expect for using surfactants for changing the anchoring. The anchoring, but also the critical wavelength, the minimum critical wavelength of the undulations are about twice the pitch as well. And so that's great. And so thinking also now with Randy and with Teresa and Christophe Blanc, we started to think that this instability is actually quite generic, not something that's just restricted to liquid crystal systems. And that indeed anything that has Lameller ordering should exhibit this type of instability. This type of instability, if there's some frustration in the layer spacing. And so we started looking into the Helper-Tureau instability and different ways that it can be induced. And indeed, we think it's generic. And so we refer you to this review paper that we wrote together during the pandemic. And so we also see this type of response in diblock copolymers, in lamellar surfactants, also in larger scale systems like cellulose nanocrystals. Larger scale systems like cellulous nanocrystals, and even in traditionally hard matter systems like ferromagnetic domains that have lamellar ordering. They all exhibit this sort of undulating response due to there being frustration within the system. Okay. And then one thing I want to highlight also is that this instability, there were a lot of talks, I think, in active liquid crystals. And so you can also think about activity within. Think about activity within lamellar liquid crystal phases. And so here is a theory work from, I think, David Amiranduzo, Gareth Alexander, and Sri Ram Ramaswamy, where they were thinking about active flow within a cholesteric. And they also saw this sort of undulating response. And they attributed this also to the Helper-Terow instability, but now induced by activity. But when I was trying to see if there were examples. When I was trying to see if there were examples of an active liquid crystal that shows this type of response, I couldn't see one sort of experimental system. But when I dug into the literature more, because cholesteric liquid crystal ordering is really prevalent in living systems, I found this one paper where they have looked at the growth of mung bean seedlings. And so the mung bean seedling has cellulose that is. That is, you know, giving it structural integrity. And you can sort of see these booligon arches, which is if you take a cross-section of the cholesterol, very often you'll see this pattern. And so one arch is about the size of half a pitch and so on. And so you see here the pitch layers. And in the elongation region of this mung bean seedling, you do see the sort of wavy undulating response. Okay. And so. And so that's also something that we think is a mechanism that a lot of living systems also exploit. So, okay, that was sort of more past work. Since November 2020, I moved to Utrecht University. And so that's when I started my own research group. And we have different research directions. I showed you a little bit about particle assembly at molecular liquid crystal interfaces. My group is still studying that to see the effect of geometry. Geometry. But then we're also now working more with colloidal liquid crystals. And that's what I'm going to spend the rest of my time with this talk telling you about. And the nice thing about working with specifically cellulose nanocrystals is that you can get often structural color. And I'll explain that in a little bit. But then we also do creating our own model liquid crystal systems. So here are So, here are rods that we produced. They're made out of silica in the lab, and then you can concentrate them by sedimenting them and create different confinements and see if you can induce different types of defects. And the cool thing about this is that we can fluorescently label each rod and do single particle tracking. And an additional thing that's also really nice about colloids is that there are different ways of functionalizing the colloids as well. And so, in this video here, we have one. Have one head of the colloidal rod being functionalized with a hematite group, so that then we can induce activity by shining blue light and having a little bit of hydrogen peroxide in the system. And so that's something that we're hoping to work towards in the coming years. But okay, a little interlude from the science, a little bit about the motivation of some of the colloidal liquid crystal work. There are some very There are some very big paint companies in the Netherlands, and thinking about making paint better is something that the Dutch government cares a lot about. And so let me show you a little bit of examples. This is a Dutch painting from Vermeer, a very important piece of Dutch culture. And the paints that are used in this painting are very bad for your health. So, for instance, Bad for your health. So, for instance, the white and the yellow here is produced with lead. And so, we all know that lead paint is a carcinogen now, not great. But also, the blue pigments that are used in this paint are from ultramarine, which is a very rare mineral that requires mining. So it can be invasive to the environment. And during this time period, I think this painting was done in like the 16th or 17th century. During that time, the most popular pigment for green paint, not Pigment for green paint, not used in this painting, but often used for wallpaper and things like that, is copper arsenite. And so you can probably also tell from the second word arsenite that it's not great for your health related to arsenic and very poisonous. I think there were even some theories that perhaps Napoleon may have gotten stomach cancer because his bathroom walls were covered in green wallpaper, but just a theory. A theory. Okay, so that's in the past. Of course, there has been progress made. Is the situation better today? I'm going to focus specifically on the green paint. So one common green pigment is cobalt green, and we know that cobalt is a mineral that's very in demand for things like batteries. But about 60 or 70 percent of the cobalt mines are located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And so the labor. And so, the labor conditions there were really horrendous. And so, if we can come up with a way of reducing the demand for cobalt, that's a good thing. The most common pigment that's used for green is chrome green. And chrome green itself is not poisonous or a carcinogen in any way. But often, when you produce chrome green, chromium-6 is produced, and that is a carcinogen. And so, there was also a recent new. And so there was also a recent news story in the maybe a couple years ago in the Netherlands where some train workers were repairing train cars in the Netherlands. And so they were heating up the paint. And then from them doing this, they were exposed to chromium-6. And so there are still some problems with pigments nowadays. And so in thinking about alternatives, we can think about trying to address these problems by moving away from pigments and towards. Pigments and towards looking at how nature produces color. For instance, this beetle has this very nice green that seems to be independent of the angle at which you're viewing it, and it has a very high reflectance. And so this is something that I'm interested in recreating in the lab. And this is produced not with pigments, but with structural color. And so structural color is nice because if you're able to preserve the structure, like in this 40 million year old beetle. Like in this 40 million-year-old beetle fossil, then the color is also preserved. And then, looking at the surface of this beetle with a high-resolution microscope, you can see these focal conic domains. And so that's already telling you that there's cholesteric ordering in the chitin that's forming this exoskeleton of the beetle. Okay, and so this beetle and the cholesteric ordering of the beetle was studied before. Was studied before. There was this paper published in Science from Mohan Serena-Vassaral's group in 2009, where they looked to characterize the surface of this beetle. And indeed, they saw all of these focal conic domains. And they also saw that the beetle reflected circularly polarized light. So that's another indication that there's cholesteric ordering of the chitin crystals in the exoskeleton of the beetle. And again, these focal conic domains are characteristic. These focal conic domains are characteristic of cholesterols. Michel Mitov also looked at these beetles. And so he took a beetle, kind of cut it in half, and looked at it under the SEM. And you can see that at the cross sections of these polygons, these focal conic domains, you also see these undulations emerging. And so setting the size of these focal conic domains is related to this Helper Troin stability that I told you about. But indeed, the But indeed, the diffuse reflection of green light from the beetle shell surface is because the layers that are responsible for reflecting green light are the ones that are the most undulated. And then this metallic appearance is due to this sort of pitch gradient that occurs as you go deeper into the beetle shell. And so these features are things that we're interested in mimicking within the lab. And so instead of using chitin, And so instead of using chitin, because you need to actually do some additional process, there are additional chemical steps that you need to do in order to increase the refractive index of chitin. You can use also cellulose, which is another abundant polysaccharide in nature that's often found in plants. And so they give typically structural integrity to the plant cell wall. And inside the plant cell wall, there are these cellulose fibrils similar to what I was. Fibrils, similar to what I was showing you with this mung bean seedling earlier. And inside of these fibrils, there are ordered regions of the cellulose molecule forming crystals, but also some disordered regions. And so you can isolate particles from these fibrils by doing a sulfuric acid hydrolysis, or you can use other acids, but sulfuric acid is the most common one. And then when you do that, you isolate these crystals. These crystals also end up being chiral. They end up being chiral. They retain also the shape that they had when they're native within the plant material. And from this acid hydrolysis process, they also get a negative surface charge. And so that means that you can now suspend them within water. And so here are some cross-polarized images of us forming a cellulose nanocrystal film over time. And so here we have a suspension of the cellulose nanocrystal in water in a petri dish. In water, in a petri dish. And this is just the first time step. And so it's just black because it's very dilute. And it's a lyotropic liquid crystal system, right? So the concentration will affect the phase that you get in the system. And so here, when you concentrate it slowly, so after 20 hours, you reach around 68% of the cellulose nanocrystals, and you start to see these tactoids, so nucleated cholesteric glucose crystal regions, right? There are these stripes, which indicates this. There are these stripes, which indicates this twisting. You concentrate it even more, and then you bring the system to being completely in the cholesteric liquid crystal phase. And then you can keep going, removing all of the solvent. And at the end, you'll end up with this dry film that has color. So shredded up paper particles formed into a nice film that gives color. And so, this is work from my two PhD students, Diogo and Ivo. If you take With Evo. If you take this film and you break it in half, this is a nice EM image from Derek Gray's group where you see now this helical ordering. Also, the color is changing with the tilting of the film, and that's because the cholesteric layers are effectively flat from sort of the flat bottom of the Petri dish. And then you can also look at the particle distribution using atomic force microscopy. And I just want to tell. Using atomic force microscopy. And I just want to tell you that when you process the cellulose from the raw plant material, we make it ourselves from filter paper. You can see that the particles are very polydispersed, but still when they self-assemble, they form this nice coherent single pitch value of material. And so that's a bit of a still an open question. How does chirality transfer relate to the shape of the particles? And that's work. And that's work from one of my collaborators, Marieline Dykstra. And I refer you to sort of some of the density functional theory models that she's done of how the exact shape or how do you think about chiral dopants within a colloidal liquid crystal system. She starts to touch upon this in this paper that she did in 2022. But okay, so the shape of the particle is very important for forming the cholesterol pitch. And what are different ways And what are different ways experimentally of tuning the cholesterol pitch? Well, one thing you can do is you can change the shape of the particle, and you can do this through ultrasonication. So you can sonicate your sample for a good amount of time, which will break up the particles effectively. And so when you dry the film, this is just a schematic. I'll show you data in the next slide, they will pack less efficiently. And so you'll get this kind of Sufficiently, and so you'll get this kind of red shift in the reflected light response. But since they're also charged, you can add salt. And so, when you add salt, you screen the repulsive interactions between the particles, and then they pack more tightly, and you can often blue shift the pitch. So, okay, here's the data. From going left to right, you are here the crystal. Here, the crystals are not broken up. These bundles, the shapes are kind of natively what you get from the synthesis. And then here, they're quite broken up. So moving from left to right, not broken up, very broken up. And then going from the y-axis, no salt, you're adding more salt, et cetera. So more screening. And so what you can kind of see is that there's this sweet spot in between where you can span. Can span. This is under a single circular polarizer. You can see that there's the visible light waves being reflected. So blue, green, red, infrared. There's also infrared light being reflected up here. But down here, there's no liquid crystalline ordering. And that's because the particles are aggregating too early in the film formation process. But beyond looking at the reflected light, you can also look at this through cross-polars. That's the favorite. Through cross polars. That's the favorite thing for liquid crystal scientists to do. And then you see that there's actually a lot of structure. And so these structures were very interesting to us, especially this one. And so I'm going to highlight this kind of sweet spot because you're seeing these Maltese cross textures, but this is a cholesteric. And we know that this is reflecting infrared light. So the pitch is around the size of a micron. You probably would have trouble resolving that under the Trouble resolving that under the optical microscope? Well, you would indeed have trouble resolving that. And so we believe, or yes, these are the focal conic domains that we saw in the molecular systems, but now somehow in this sweet spot in our parameter sweep, we're seeing it appearing in the cholesterol, sorry, in the cellulose nanocrystal film. And so to try to understand this, we looked at this particular film again, but now Again, but now watching it form over time. And so, over time, the water is evaporating, the system is concentrating, and we're going from first being all isotropic to now you're nucleating a bunch of these cholesteric droplets, these tactoids. You saw also these convection rules. So I think this is from Raleigh-Bernard convection because the cholesteric phase is denser than the isotropic phase. They coalesce over time until at some point they stop moving. Until at some point they stop moving. And that's when too much solvent was removed. You have also attractive interactions between these larger scale messages, right? There's VanderWaals attractions. And so then they gelate, they kinetically arrest and freeze in the structure. But the evaporation continues because all of the solvent still hasn't been removed. And then at the end, you see this proliferation of these focal conic domains. Focal conic domains. And so let me show you this video again with all of these films that were formed. These are all end states of the films for each parameter that's shown here. But what we see and what we think is very curious is that in the time series of this film playing, we're actually moving through this parameter space. So it first goes isotropic to sort of these convection roles to these small tactoids that then fuse and become large. Tactoids that then fuse and become larger tactoids as you move through the space until at the end you get these focal conic domains. And so, what we think this shows us is that by tuning the salt, you're tuning when the system is gelating, when you can freeze in a specific state of the system, but also by tuning effectively this colloidal chiral dopant, you can make the cholesterol form more easily. Form more easily. And so it's a bit of a race against time. The dynamics of the system are really important. And you need to have sort of this sweet spot where you have a coherent holesteric structure that can experience evaporative stresses for this focal conic structure to form. And so this is all unpublished and we're still working on it. We're trying to understand if there are better ways to control the focal conic domains. Can we control the size by controlling different flow conditions? Controlling different flow conditions, and then also see the presence of these structures. How does it directly affect the optical properties of the film? Okay. And so, just checking the time. Okay. You can also, these films that I showed you, they were just bare cellulose nanocrystals that we processed in the lab. The cellulose nanocrystals actually have really strong hydrogen bonding with one another. So, these films can be quite brittle if you handle them too roughly. If you handled them too roughly, they could break apart. And so, if we wanted to make them more robust, there are tricks that you can play, like functionalizing the surface of these particles. So, I just wanted to show you a few results related to that, where if you use some surfactant to functionalize the surface of these particles and you concentrate it, because of this polyethylene oxide block on the surface of these surfactants, you can allow for the Can allow for the cholesteric structure to swell with humidity because this is a very hygroscopic molecular structure. But it's also, since it's kind of polymeric, you can introduce flexibility to the system. And so now you have this interestingly malleable cholesteric. Yes. And so here's the data for that. So for the humidity, you see that the peak reflected wavelengths going from relative humidity 13. From relative humidity 13 up to 97, that the peak reflected wavelength of the film shifts. And you can indeed cycle it. So it has kind of a robust response between these two relative humidities. And then here you can apply pressure. So here's a piece of the film that's reflecting infrared light. You squeeze it. What's interesting is that it doesn't have sort of an elastic response. You squeeze it and then the deformation remains and then it looks red. And then it looks red. And so you can squeeze it more, and then it doesn't recover. It looks green, and then you can squeeze it even more and get it to be blue. And so here's also the data for that. Okay. Any questions? I thought I heard something in the room. No, okay, I continue. So now I wanted to show you this sort of last bit that I told you about on making our own. Yes. Our own yes. Oh, I mean, I can wait for it. Okay. I guess we're going to take okay, so then I will continue and then Oleg can ask his question at the end. I think that was Oleg, yes. Okay, sorry. So I continue. Now I'll just take a couple more minutes to show you our recent work on using On using silica colloidal rods to form liquid crystal phases. And so, this is using chemistry developed by Alphans von Bladeren here at Utrecht, and then also with complementary simulations from Marieline Dijkstra and her postdoc, Gerardo Villiobos. And so you can take these colloidal rods, label them with a fluorescent shell, and then cause them to concentrate. So they also form this lyotrophic. Concentrate, so they also form this lyotropic liquid crystal, and they can sediment over time. And so, how we do this is we fill a solution into a little well, and then they'll sediment and concentrate into structures that we form using lithography. And then you can use a confocal to image this and do single particle tracking at the end. And so, what we were interested in asking, since anchoring is so important for controlling structures that are formed in molecular liquid. Structures that are formed in molecular liquid crystals. How do you control anchoring in a colloidal liquid crystal? The colloids typically you think about just hard interactions and entropy. And so we, Ethan and I had the idea of let's just look at a smoothly varying geometry and see if maybe curvature can be used to tune the anchoring conditions of a larger scale liquid crystal. And so we use collateral. Crystal. And so we use colloidal rods with around an aspect ratio of eight and confine them into sort of a family of elliptical shapes. And so for, for instance, for short axis R1 over the length of the rod being around 4.4, we can have these sort of circular, very circular confinements that we make and then have these more elliptical shapes. And you can see that sort of for the more circular ones. Sort of for the more circular ones, we kind of see mostly planar anchoring, and then for the more elliptical ones, the anchoring starts to change a bit. Interestingly, here, some of them also point out of the plane. But okay, so to analyze this, Ethan employed, using single particle tracking, using also the pneumatic order parameter, did a mapping of the order parameter. So, kind of weighing the average orientation of each molecule within these. Orientation of each molecule within these pixels, in order to come up with this order parameter map to see where the disclinations are. So that's regions where the rod orientation is not well defined. But then we also employed a network analysis where since our rods with this aspect ratio of eight, they form this kind of smectic phase that has some metastable tetradic ordering. We wanted to see also the Uh, we wanted to see also the smectic ordering, and in order to do this, um, also Randy I think has explained this uh in other lectures of his as well. Uh, that you kind of have to, you know, if you have two mountains, there needs to be this kind of mountain pass in between them. And so if you wanted to analyze these structures, then you need to keep track of not just the mountain tops, but also the mountain passes. And so you can do maps for this two-dimensional smectic where you draw. Where you draw densities of the draw lines across the maximum in the density, so through the rod centers, and also the minimum in the density through the rod ends and develop this kind of network of your system. And so this was this network analysis was also first published and developed last year in the group of Hartman Loven by Paul Munderkamp and I think Renee Whitman. And so And so, in the network analysis, here's a schematic of a disclination where you have this network analysis and the disclination is located here. And so you have these pairs of plus or minus one half, where if you have a branching of the network, that gives kind of a minus one half charge. If you have an ending of the network, that's a plus one half charge. And the disclination gives an excess of An excess of positive charge in the density maximum network. And then here's another schematic of not a disclination but a dislocation where there's a defect in the layer spacing. And this is in terms of these vertices neutral in charge. But then you can see that they come in pairs. And so by also prescribing this dislocation, sorry, this, yeah. Dislocation, oh, sorry, this, yeah, the dislocation formation, as always, a branching in this maximum network. You can also count the number of negative charges to quantify the number of dislocations that you have in your system. And so, the same system that I showed you before here on the left, now with this network analysis, we can total up all the charges and also assign one network for the boundary. And that gives us a nice total topological charge of one, which is what you would expect. But yes, yeah, and so we use this in order to distinguish and see how different confinements and different anchoring conditions give rise to disclinations or dislocations. Okay, and so first looking at the general ordering of the entire system, so the global pneumatic order parameter by varying the, in this case, this is the size of the system in the y-axis, and then this is sort. system in the y-axis and then this is sort of how elliptical it is where down here you're very elliptical and up here you're quite circular and then the glodal the if it's blue then the system overall doesn't have uh much ordering much pneumatic ordering and then if it's red then it's very well well ordered and aligned and so here are some highlights so for the simulations you can see here in very elliptical you can see that they're all kind of pointing in the same direction Pointing in the same direction. And then, if it's less elliptical, you start to get a bit more disordered. There's kind of a mix of anchoring as well. Here, there's some perpendicular anchoring, and here there's some planar anchoring. You continue, and then you have a very circular alignment. And then here, there's mostly planar anchoring, but sometimes you get these tetradic regions that adsorb at the boundary. But we did see a general trend with the curvature of the confinement, the local curvature of the confinement with the general anchor. Confinement with the general anchoring. And so we analyze this by doing a sweep of the confinements and seeing how the angle of the particle deviates from the surface, the tangent of the confinement surface, and use that to characterize the anchoring. And so the angle deviation is plotted here with a varying local curvature here, normalized by the length of the rod. And you can see that there's kind of this anchoring transition that occurs around. That occurs around a radius of curvature of 2L. And so we see that if you have a very elliptical confinement that's also of the right size so that the local curvature is around two, you can get homeotropic anchoring. And so we plot here this red region is anything below radius of curvature equal to one length of the rod. This is equal to two. Of the rod, this is equal to two, and then this is larger than two. And you can see that there's some trend that matches the global ordering of the system. Looking at the local order parameter, you can look at the location of these disclinations as well for the different confinements going from very circular to very elliptical. The disclinations can be entirely within the bulk, so forming this bridge state, or they can have some region of it being absorbed at the surface. Ethan called them pins. Surface. Ethan called them pin splay or pin bend. But basically, the only thing you need to take away from this is that the defect can be absorbed at the boundary. Or if you have virtual defects, then there's essentially no defect within the bulk and any sort of region of disorder or defect is located or adsorbed at the boundary. So it's a virtual defect. And indeed, here with the same kind of lines that are showing the critical radius of curvature regions, they follow general trends. That they follow general trends, and that by having planar anchoring throughout the entire region, you can force the disclinations away from the surface, and having more perpendicular anchoring, you can have them adsorb at the boundary. So, it makes sense. The logic that you have for these molecular systems also translate to the colloidal systems. But yes? It's about time. You have a few minutes for questions. Oh, I see. Well, then, I will quickly show one more result before my Show one more result before my conclusion slide. With the network analysis, I had explained to you that the vertices of the network relate to either a disclation or a dislocation. And so I wanted to show you that for these two confinements, where if you had a more round confinement, you had all of these disclinations, all of these red dots. And so you can excite disclinations with a more circular geometry. A more circular geometry. And then by having more elliptical confinements, you can excite dislocations. And then looking at the loops for having, if you have a maximum density loop, you have more smectic ordering, minimum density loop, you have a disclination all around, so forming tetradic ordering. And then you can see that the confinement also has an effect here. Okay, and so with that, I'd like to thank my collaborators for all of the work that I've shown in this talk, Christoph, Randy, Max, and Tara. Uh, Christophe, Randy, Max, and Teresa, also from Utrecht, Alphonse, and Mario Lein. And then, in red, are the works from my team that I highlighted. And I also want to thank you for your attention. All of you. So, a very nice presentation, Linda. Thank you. My question is: that the appearance of a focal connect domain in the colostatic cell implies Shell implies different anchoring at the top and at the interior and exterior interfaces. So, the question is: Did you try to control the range of existence of those photoconic domains by changing the surfactant at the interior and outside the shell? Yes, so for the shells, we did try having hybrid anchoring, either having Having hybrid anchoring, either having perpendicular anchoring only on the inside or perpendicular anchoring only on the outside. And then you could see that if it was only on the inside, the sort of the handedness of the spiral would flip. And that would tell you that the focal conic domain is being formed preferably from one interface compared to the other interface. And so there are some tricks that you can play for nucleating a focal conic domain either inside or outside. I have other questions. Are there other questions? Oh, thank you very much.
