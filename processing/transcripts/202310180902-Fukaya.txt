kind of uh complete span of the story. But uh I want to talk about uh and about the example of ideas and my pole, but this today I just want to let's drift to the potangent bundle. So M is a linear dimension micro and we call that potangent bundle and if qi is a coordinate of m, then you have this pi, it's a coordinate of the potangent directions, coordinate of the potangent space, and this is the And this is the coordinate of m. Then, of course, you know that the standard symplectic form is just a Pi PQI. And you have a contact form, not contact form, but it's a primitive, just a Pi, PQI, so detail, it's all here. So in this sense, this cotangent bundle is an exact symplectic manifold, and I want to manifold and I want to consider L with the time I of L from L tilde to this potangent one and I want to say that is an exact must Lagrangian semi-bole in a following way so M is n dimensions the first is that the dimension of L tilde is N, so this is the M dimensional manifold. So this is an N dimensional manifold here. And I L is an E matrum. It means that it's derivative. So you take this derivative with injective at each point. And the third thing is that you pull back this data by this imagination. By this imagination, you have one form, and we assume that it is an exact form. And in particular, if you pull back simplistic form, it's a d of theta, so this is the exact way that they should be zero. So this is called Lagrangian, and this is called exact Lagrangian. So we consider such an exact Lauren summary hole, and something. And something I want to discuss is the Freya theory of such a mass Lagrangian-summanford. And there are many also many works in the case when this is embedded. Embedded means that this I of F is injected. But I want to, of course, also, Iman's case also. And so now I want to show in some cases. So I mean this pair, a triple, this I want to. This I want to write L and this and call it imas that when the summary goes. So we fix these three things. And we say that L is a self-transversal. So if we transcribe this, we have any xy in L tilde, which is different but goes to the same point. Then you take this image of the tadial space of x. Of the tangent space of X V of I. And this is transversal, means that intersection is zero. So this is a self-transversal, it's exactly by this picture. And then my previous theory, we I want to construct two of them. Mainly I'm going to construct one of them in zero section, but still we have we have this L1, L2 exact. Exact mass. Then to say that they are transversal, if you have x in L1 tilde, y in a L2 tilde, and the I L1 X is I L2 Y, then image unit is again transversal. So let's So it's these conditions something like this. So there may be about seven minutes of this kind of thing. And then I want to consider the case when this air is compact usually. So now I want usual free chain complex for this pair, transposer pair, is just a set of all xy in a one tilde. L1 tilde, L2 tilde, I L1 x is I L2 Y of Z of X Y. It's just a free aberrant group. And this is an exact session, so I don't use non-coping, just take Z. And this is a gradient. And the gradient I don't want to explain, but there is a canonical way to graduate. So this is Z gradient. Exactness is rather strong, so also Master of type since vanish, so you have a Z-grading. And also, it is filtered. So, filtration is of that importance. I won't explain filteration. So, you take variation of this xy, which is exactly f2y minus f1x. So, you just, so you fix this function, limitative of the furbook of delta. Limitative of the pullback of data, F1 and F2. This is exactly the difference of the value. And if I just cheat a bit, but this is something a boundary plate. I explained why I say I cheated, but we have this boundary platform. It is just counting the format. So this is xy, this is xy. This is x prime, y prime, x is 1, this is 2. Just count u as a half so that it's homomorphic. So this gives a boundary pressure, I mean this v xy with the number of such and x prime, y prime. And we can use Stokes' formula twice the following things. So if you take this pullback of the symplectic form by u, this is equal to the v x prime y prime minus e x y. I mean, so you can first take this fact that w is detailed. So this difference, so this symplatic integral is just an integration of theta along this loop. And then theta. Along this loop, and then theta is df, so you can just use this formula to show this. And it implies that this is positive. So it means that the boundary operator is non-so this boundary operator preserves filterations. So you have a filtered ch complex, and that is this CFL1L2. So this filter chain complex is something I want to study. And the story I want to explain is the following. Again, is the following sort of triangle type things so that there is something like a table more silly of M with one side and the And uh exact Lagrangian exact last Lagrangian prior mode for potangient bundle in the second member. And here, tells you like a shift shift theory on the M cross power. S s some kind of shift. Uh and I I am not expert on shift theory so much. I'm not expert on shift study so much, but I just want to advance a bit, so I just want to mention a bit. So there is some kind of relations. And this one is the example we taken from this. So this L of F, so L of F is the Mars Lagrangians, and F is called its generating function. So, I mean, it's several more series. So, I mean, stab remote theory. Oh, oh, oh, I don't, I don't say this yet. I'll explain it. Okay. There is something called here, and this is called a theory of genetic functions, which I'll explain. And this relation is somewhat elementary. So, I mean, so there is a relation. And here you have a boss are load. And from here to here, you have something like a singular support. Especially this famous theory of Cashivara Chapina and its application to this symptomic topology is kind of initiated by Camarke here. There are interesting recent work such as those works by Guillermo. And there is another direction here, this should be related to this function. Yeah, this should be related to this family free of mode. People such as Viterbo is studying this relationship and also Guillermo is doing some works. So I want to explain this kind of triangle. And something what I'm doing with this Harikama dynami is this part of the story. And in some cases, this is already done by some people like Michigan. Done by some people like Pedergo Amirkovich Ols, which I want to mention later on. But this slide is something related to this. This one is related to homological mirror symmetry type things. And family phi homology is used in homological mirror symmetry. And in a similar way, one can try to use it here. But in a bit more delicate way, which are because of this kind of intrications. And as I said, I just want to But I just want to explain just one blackboard how this complex Ragranya prayer theory should be related. And I don't know anything so much, so please do not accept it so much that I have anything precise, but there are several stories going on my trip, and I just mentioned that there are something similar here. There are something called a stabilized. I don't know this name is. This name exists, but some real necessary. And here, here, this complex Lagrangians, complex Lagrangian Freya theory of potangent boundaries. And in this case, I want to assume M is a K-launa manifold. So this potangent boundary has a complex. Has a complex impact structures. And the third thing, that I don't know so much, but I think there are some shift theory on m cross complex number and with some asymptotic, so we study something like asymptotics at h is this plane. And there are something like this, and there should be some relations among them. Which I believe is a kind of complex analog of the son I want to explain today. And as I say, that I don't know so much about it, especially I don't have any particular results on this triangle, so I don't talk about it so much. Just I say I suggest that there are some analog in complex. And if you are an expert of this kind of thing, then maybe while I am explaining this part, you may imagine, you may try to think what is a complex analog. You may try to think what is a complex atom. But probably you know better. Some of you at least knows better. But I won't use so this is just s some some possibility, and I won't explain this diagram more in this talk. So now I'm going to explain what it is functions. So let me recall that we have a compact manpower M, so this is a compact manpower, compact Spooze manpole, and then we construct some C like a Z and E and this is a C infinity pi over and with which at the And with which and which is proper, it means that the total space T is compact. And this is the C50 vector value. So because the function, if only sorry, the simulus function. I mean, i i in in this story, stabilized so stabilized most story means that So stabilized Mohs theory means that in place of studying Mohs theory on M, you take this bigger space, something like a fiber value and its total space, and you go start Mohs theory on it. That's called stabilized MOS theory. And I think it is emphasized by the paper by Eyashberry and Gromov that something like the topology of the potential bundle is some kind of a stabilized MOS cell like this. And that that's related to this diagram I had just written. This diagram I have just written. And if you think about this, then probably if it is a complex manifold, then you take this holomorphic fiber bandwidth and you call the holomorphic functions on the total space. And then you have the same sodium genetic functions. So what are the sodium genetic functions? So we call the related F. This is the This is the subspace, subspace of E of this spaces, so that you take the derivative, first derivative of F, and if you restrict it to the tangent space of pi inverse x bar, it is 0. So pi is this composition, and pi x is just x bar. So it's a pi bar. So it's a FIBA of this Sigma Speiber bundle. And you consider Z so that if you restrict the exterior derivative of F to the Fiverr dimensions, it is Z. And in a generic case, if you can place dimension of L tilde F, so this is actually so dimension of E. So this gives an equation of dimensions E minus dimension M. So this is a dimension. So this is a dimension M. So if everything is transposed, I have this dimension. And then you can cook up this map. So this is the classical story of the function, probably going back to the Hamilton, the catastrophe invented geometry several hundred years ago. So let me maybe let Q. I simply say let Q be a coordinate of M and Y be a coordinate of y of pi. So y Q is a coordinate of F. So this L tilde F is just given by the equation that df dy is zero. Then we have this map, I I f from L tilde F to a tangent value of m so that if you have this point x then you take this pi of x and the df dq dq. So this is the quota's map. So this is the map. And but what one can easily see is that you take this I of f, you put it back to theta. You put it back theta, then it is a d of F. So let me recall theta is a dpi dqi. And in this case, pi is a df dqi, just by definitions. So you have this formula easily. So in particular in particular, this uh reactive and the I of F and F, its restrictions, is uh exact. Exact mass summary. So that's that's a way to obtain exact mass domain summary. I mean, immediate is the generic case. That's a way to obtain this exact image summary for in this PR sections. And you this first part erase is that we have everything is homomorphic. Then you can exactly define by the same formula, but you have just complex interferential. Complex interponial blah blah blah, you get the exact mass laminar summary for the holomorphic potential debundable of a K-12. So now we have this exact, so this is a very systematic way to obtain exact Emass over the summer hole. And actually there is a theorem that by some algebraic topological conditions, something like higher analog of muscle of index parishes, then th then this exactra and someone called as a as a generic functions. Gendering functions. So that but that's a kind of purely topological statement. What I want to do more aspect geometry. And so the idea is that, so here this writer summon rule, so this is definitely L F. They want to say that this L of F is free theory of L F is related to most theory of F. So in in a sense actually for a long time people like Vitelbo kind of uh studying this uh Trying to study this simple topology of the potangent bundle using generic functions, not using FLD. In particular, he just used this MOSL F in place of Reaf Moji to understand this element. And it seems that many people expect they are kind of mostly the same, but it's kind of not in complete generality, including in Maus' case. It is not so much absolutely trivial. We claim that there are We claim that they are actually equal. But it means that we have to do some more theory on this function f, on the total space of this vector value. But of course, the total space of vector value is non-compact. We may restrict the compact case, but actually most more interesting case appears in the case of this total space of vector value. So we need to have some control at infinity of the function f so that you have a Function f, so that you have a kind of a meaningful MOS selling. If the function f is too much kind of wild infinity, then you can do that anything with MOS theory. By the way, if you want to make it holomorphic, then that's a kind of trouble. Because as we said, that in a real world, CPT world, you can restrict something gainfinity of the function f. But in holomorphic functions, I don't know, there might be some good way to restrict holomotic functions at an infinity Functions at the infinity, near the infinity of the vector bundle. But I don't know what the good conditions. And the condition I'm going to draw right below is a bit too much restricted in the complex format of R. But let me see. So F it says that the quadratic at infinity at infinity it is a false thing. So it's just so you get so this E is a vector value over Z. The vector value of a Z. So there's a Q, otherwise non-degenerate correlated form so that F is equal to Q outside compact set. So this is this is, I think many people, especially with therapy, use this kind of conditions to We generally use this kind of conditions to have some meaningful MOS theorem of F. And something people do not know is about a natural complex analog of this condition. Assuming something is caloric form outside the complex set is a bit restrictive, right? Because hormonal functions, then it should be caddic equipment for y. So I don't know what's a good condition, but at least in a sympathetic one, we can do it. And there's a similar condition that you assume that not writing. That's a similar condition. You assume that this f is linear at infinity. It means that in place of taking Q as a catalytic functions, you take some non-trivial linear function, fiber wise, of a spectral value, and you assume also compact sets are linear functions, non-zero linear functions. So you assume this, for example, this L of F tilde, you have a cadre function, if it caloric functions, then there's five power zero. Then there's however there's no critical point. So L of F is a F tilde F is always compact. So under these assumptions, F tilde F is always compact. So this is a compact embedding. And also, what we can do is you take this F and you have a kind of a mosomology is well defined. Easy to find what is the quality of post-homology in this case, you take this most complex, you just take P, which is a critical point of the function F and Z and define bunch of red calculating using the Ronnet line joining them. And what's nice? And what's nice is that since this is a generic form outside the compact state, so you can do all the analytic detail of the mosh homology as if this E is just a compact manifold. There is no gradient line escape to infinity because of this condition. So you can apply Mohs homology. And I want to remind you that this Mohs homology is actually filtered. So, what's filter it means the following things. So, B of P is just this value. And you have this kind of boundary P Q is just a number of gamma so that d gamma d t is the number of numbers. d t is a gradient t on t of f. So if this is non-empty, then the value of f decreases. That's just usual line to create the body functions. And so I want to mention one theorem. This is a the sort of this is a I speak several years ago. So this theorem this is a This is a mu of each O and observable the following. So suppose that F is embedded. This is the hedraulic function that infinity. So suppose that L is hedraic at infinity and it's the Lagrangian summary for the embedded. It means that I L from L tilde F to L F is injective. Then Then there is a filter of the geometric difference between this dysfunction of this most complex and this so this zero the zero is a zero section of non-companion bundle and variation. So so this is a this is the f this is a uh uh freez complex, it's a intersection of zero and L of F. Is the intersection of zero and L of F. And so this free homology is actually geomotropy equivalent to the most homology of F. But something stronger is just that this geometric equivalence completely preserves these federations. So it happens somehow. And I mean, most of the upshot is the idea, actually the way how we find it is the following thing. Suppose that P Suppose that P is a critical point, critical point of health. So it means that we have this Q coordinate and the phi by the Y coordinate. So this means that df dq equal df dy is zero. So this means that p is actually containing f d d f. Because d f d y is zero is the definition. F dy zero is the definition of F d by F. Then this what it what this means? So you have the I A of P is actually P bar 0, right? This is the second part of the functions. So it means that the critical point set of F is identified with the intersection of L of F and Z. So this is a generator. So they are both. So this is a generator. So they are both a generator of this module. So generator coincides. But also you can see that perfectation coincides. But you have to see that the boundary operator coincides. And it is not actually so much direct to see that how these two boundary operators are related. Because this is the most graded lines on the big space. And this is the hormonal disk on a potential one. And there is not so easy to find a direct relationship. Direct relationship, but it can, but these people cook up some changhometer equipment. So now, I want to say, I need to so this is a this is an embedded case. So embedded case this most homology and the free homology coincides. And I think I didn't say that, but you have you have in the case where you have two, L F and L G, then you have you have similar statement, but uh it it's a bit a bit a bit motive to c wr write down. So A bit a bit more tanti right now, so I don't mention that. Very similar statement. So now, what happened in a case in Imas' case? And the the fact I need to prove, I need to uh realize the following thing. So let me consider this thing complex of maybe. Or maybe L F and maybe maybe positive geosectional L F and maybe L one L two and L one L two is uh exactly mass someone falling into a tangent problem and then we have this boundary plator but uh as I said that this this this boundary platform square may have May have good. So, I think this is another restrictive cases, right? You have an exotic mass, but still, you have there is a station that this boundary is not defined. And I have to say that this kind of fair theory by Master Lapper is studying by Cochrane Joyce in the paper on General Transgeometry, written about 10 years ago. But this is a sophisticated But this is a so but but still there are cases that is part of beta squared mass level. And I just want yeah, after I start this, so I want to find out what is the simplest way. This is an example, I think it's a very simple example, but it's just very scary. You can start this star. This is L1. And I want to say that L1 is S1 containing this star of S1. And it doesn't make sense. So this is the mass exact form in some hole. And you take second thing. And you take second things. Second is just something like this. This is F2. And this is F2 is also embedded S1 containing contangent 1 to S, S, S1. So I want to consider Flare theory between them. So what was it? And you consider this uh intersection point and I want to take this point at this x. Take this point and this X, and this point is Y and this point is Z. So you take three points, the intersection points. And I remind you that what is the player's boundary of play that I just calculate? And just to count. This kind of strip, in case it's isolated. So what is the boundary of X? It is actually a Y. You see. You see easily this strip. And you don't see any other strip if you just play a bit with this picture. So this is y. So now we calculate boundary y, and you see that again. You see that this very simple strip. So I don't have argued sign, but this tells me that the boundary square of x is a t and square x is t and this is zero. So this is a kind of very simple example that exactly knowing the flavor theory does not work so much obvious in an obvious way. But then as you picture about with all the owner and myself the better case and the mouse case by Pajo Joyce there is a way to kind of to resolve this issue and I think there's a newer way discovered by Cheka Madelaspell in the general report. Requirement area in the general product technology, what's the majority of this patient? Using something called the bandicoot augmentation. Bandicochet, and in our case, I also study positive bandicoot chain. And this is very much related to these augmentations. And this is, I think, basically related by Chaganov. This is, I think, basically later by Cheganovak on the regional contact tomology. And this is the kind of category in our case. So, first is in this case, and I want to take a bit shortcut justify positive cases. So, we consider just six single languages, so CFL, and this is actually some kind of some maybe quality. Maybe the quality of I will give you the x I will give you the suppose that I L I will give you the X is a mass exact number even if X is just what I just wanted. And I mean the problem is F is not transversal to itself, right? It it's it's a kind of a green transaction, but it's not transversal. Green intersection, but it's not transversal. So you just consider this kind of things: F tilde, X, F tilde. Then the transversal case, this is a kind of SW and L tilde. So what is S W? S w the set of X Y in L tilde plus L tilde, so that I L X and I L Y and but X is not equal to Y. So in this way, So, in this very simple example, so activity is S1. And then in this simple example, this SW is two point. And this, again, another activity S1. So you take this cell style product, you have this diagonal segment cell, but this point you have the TQ and QP. So this is the unordered pair. CO2. This one corresponds to two points. And then. Then I want to split SW to SW plus SW0 SW minus and this is something like a P2 with F2 60009 FP and this is equal and this is as a set. So we have a kind this kind of self-transparent set. I'm not assuming that L the self-transparent L tilde is self-transversal, it means that SW is just a finite set. Then this finite set you can split in a positive one, zero one nematic one. And of course, if P2 is in a positive path, then QP is in a natural path. So there is something that you are doing. And usually, in a sense, like a Regendurian kind of cases, we assume SW0 is the empty set. It means that for each intersection point, this FP is not equal to the G. But it's not necessary for a mass random case of it. So now I want to define, and so I think SW plus is the ABM group. So it is it is a bit so you can just take this this positive switching point and this integer things. Then I want to define infinity operation. So I mean to define infinity To define infinity operator for this diagonal part is a bit more important because you need to do some kind of a chain level argument for the homogeneous. But if you just restrict to the positive switching part, it is easier. So you have this Mk positive sleating part tensor k to this positive switching part. So this Mk D1 D K is this R. is uh is uh this uh uh d k t one p k t zero t zero and this one is a number of the following polygons so for what this means so you have a hormone disc which bounds this this this this cones and on this on this uh ceremony intersection point you Serial intersection point, you require that this boundary value switch from one component to the other component of this element somewhat code. And this one is the P, so P1 is a pair XY. So this goes move from X to Y. So for each intersection point, you fix this switching for the switching component. Then you have this you can define the notion of this cable, K plus Bambon. And we calculate the number of this K plus Bamboons in the case CT to. Plus one bonds, in a case it is a zero dimension, with sine, and that is this empty operator. So now we define what is this moral carton element. So positive, the positive, positive value change, so moral curve term positive of L is a set of B so that So that V on the switching plus so that the k of m k m d is zero. And actually, this implies actually that variation, but I mean so this one is by definition V of EQ. So if this So if this is non-empty, then by the same reason, Vp0 is another sum of VPI. So this sum is always increasing by the operations. And everything is positive and only finite energy. So this equation, this is actually finite sound. And in a station, imagine a station we are working on not knowing exact cases. This kind of MVT relationship. This kind of AFT relation, okay, the Mola-Fartin equation has an infinite sum, so it's a bit more sophisticated thing necessary to make it sense. But in exact case, this is just a finite sum, so you have this equations. So now, so this Molar quantum sounds like this, right? So solution B, Molar quantum, is something like V P Q P Q. And V P Q. And VPQ is some kind of integers. So by each switching, you assign some integers, so that this kind of sum just vanishes. That is one cartridge element in our particular case with exact mass divergence. So now I want to go back to this. So the food test L1 F2 exact image I will write a summary for. I will write a summary for, say, quantum number. And we assume that B1, B2, they are this in a monocardon positive of L1 and monocardon positive of L2. So now I want to correct this Flare theory using these elements. So how to do it? So I just want to draw one picture. So here this x, y, this element. And the usual fair part of the just count, this kind of string. But then in our general cases, we consider this kind of configurations. So this is L1, L2. So you have this self-intersection point. Then we consider this kind of product speed. So count it. So there will be much multiple. So let me tell you, this is P1, P2, Q1 is weight. So weight is given here. So the in this case is B P one, B P two, B Q one. So by each switching, So, by each switching, this Mola Carta solution picks some integers. So, this kind of kind of polygons, a bit more generalized strip, you count with these integers which is assigned by this Molar contact element. So, you can start all these polygons with these things. And again, you can think a bit about the filtrations that this is actually a finite sum. You have only finitely many polygons, like this. So, this is something called a collective part of data. And the claim, I don't want to prove, but the claim is that after this collections, this is actually defined boundary operator in a prayer check of X. So, you can actually obtain this prayer homology in a mass case. And this story is very much similar to the, in a sense, a special case of a car-joy story. But in a counter-euthorized cases, they don't assume any exactness. And so they just kind of so you can if you have just a Rabina summary for no F of L, there's no way to have this kind of nice filtration. So and the only way, only reasonable way I can imagine in such generality, it just put all the generators to be very simple. Put all the generator to be with zero and use something like called a non-coplink, some format for AshesLink to make everything compass. And that's what this account just did in most cases. And that is this. And actually, and if you look carefully at this definition that I haven't I wrote, which is what the Chekanovat erash bang did. So Chekanov Erasme case is considered some general contact modeling. So in this case, so you have this kind of tilde F. Then you can actually Then you can actually embed it to the T sub M close now so that x goes to this I L X and this F of X. Then, so this is G and I think then we can also say this G minus P I equal I. So this so then this is kind of I, I star is actually zero. This is actually no T G equals So, this is actually a contact form. And so, this is the kind of Rejandrian embeddings. And for such a Rejandrian embedding, Chekhanov Erasperm defined some DGLing. And the Chekhov intersects the notion of augmentations. And this augmentation actually, in this case, almost coincides with this notion of positive band equation. And then Chekanov DGA is actually so called code dual to our IP targets. Dual to our in-person. So it's a kind of basically equipment story. Okay, so anyway, so now this is what what is, but then I want to show a very simple example, in this simple example of what this story was. So let me draw again the previous picture this picture, L1. And two, right? And then so what is this? This is the this is I think I draw X Y Z and I want to get two two more two more things if it's possible. So I want to consider this MK operator on L1. So let me construct this Mk operator on variable CP plus of L1. Let the first Then the first thing you want you want to follow is just M01. And the creator is this is U. U is here, right? So you so I just draw this picture again. So you have this disk, and this is a one one, and its output is here. Output is here. So one is something like an empty. So one is something like an empty Tensor product. So no input and one output, and that is this M01. This is a unit. So now, I want to... So the moral counter is something like this, right? M will start M01 plus M1B plus blah blah blah. But in this case, it's just so much simple, there's not so many room to play with more. You have another element which is W. W. So you see that there is some lambda here. This seems that M1 W is U. So maybe you can just take this B is minus W, then N01 plus N1 B plus blah blah blah is zero, because there is nothing either. So this is the U and this is the U.S. So, this is the U and this is the M1 and W. They cancel. So, that's a story. So, we have to make this W as a bounding function. But then we need to see about the positivity. So, this is A. This is B. And so then variation of U is actually A. A is a separate area of this bundle. Then u goes up D, then you know, you go to this. He said, then you know, you go start this guy, so you calculate, you calculate, so you have this f is something like f is starting here and coming back here, and then d of f is theta, and the d of theta is omega. So you consider this difference of theta, so then d of w is actually. So um uh I actually this is a bit cheating. So there are two two two W, right? You have a like one one PQ and one QP. And among among two of them, only one of them, so I mean if W is PQ, then this formula, it follows some PQ, but you change QP, then of course this doesn't work. If this goes here, but then you have to go other side. So you have to have one particular choice of P2, so that I'm chose a P2 so that M1W goes to U. But then the condition is that this particular P2, this variation, should be positive. And this condition is actually equivalent if you compare these two areas. Area A is bigger than area B. So this configuration, probably I have to super geometry to give you my smallpox calculated by these two areas. And then this line is bigger than P, is the condition that you have about the culture. Is a condition that you have a bandicoot. Bounding cochlear B. So that is very, that is this what this bounty cochain is doing in this very extremely simple example. So now, suppose you have this W. So this is the boundary function. So now I want to calculate so th this L two is the embedded, so there is no room to to take a certain positive quantity of change. Positive boundary coach. So we want to calculate boundary of w0 of x. So now you have a two switch. So you have another configuration. Something like this, right? You have this switching X B and this is a B. So this is actually a bounce replay. So this is actually. So the Joda is. So the Joda is just like this, right? So this is Y plus W. Y plus V. So before we put W, this is only Y exists. But then you put W, you have another configuration, you have this extra V. And then, as I said, boundary Y is Z. But then we have, we can see what is the boundary of B that is exactly this point, right? So boundary B is Z. So I think this should be nice, right? Because B is a nice W. So this means that the boundary w0, boundary w0, x is z minus z and 0. So you include this boundary cochins, you have a well-defined neural motive. So this is a very example, but I think this is a kind of just meanting example to show how the false model works. So now we have this free of motion. But now I want to stay explicit. But now I want to state two theorems. So this is a joint work with Ariaka Daimy. We are now writing a papers, but also this is myself. It's the following. So suppose that f is an adjoining functions and you can draw it at infinity. They take this little f, then there exists a positive boundary coach n. First, you bound equient P of F of this uh of this influence. What is the first statement? And then we consider V a J complex of zero section and this L of F and V of F and this is the field J equivalent to the most complex of F. So this is the second state. So, this is the second statement. So, this means that if you include this theory of the banking content, this parallelism of this Mohs theory and the Imam's Ramanjapya theory, it's something that I've already covered. And actually, this first statement has some kind of long history. In a case when this statement is one, this is studied for a long time in a world of gender contact logic. And we will also write some names. Yeah, this is started by Chekhov. This is a dimension one. And this dimension is two, then this uh loose field And Sariban. Michael Sariban. Yes. So they use language of regional contact topology and prove this. The second statement, I think in such cases, is probably known to them, but I don't remember how much precisely it is known. And they see that in the case where this F is embedded, this is. Case where this f eater embedded, this is due to Nikolich O as interval. So maybe rather than explaining the other part, I have just one minute injection. So I just want to say a few words of proof theorem one. And this proof of theorem one is kind of related to the other stories I have been working on. That is called the Lagrangian correspondence. Actually, this Actually, the idea to use general correspondence is very much different from the proof of those people. The first dimension one case is a bit kind of combinatorial. It's related to the notion of ruleing, which is introduced by Jakubana Kushka. And in a two-dimensional case, it is related to something like a parameterized Maus theory. And some catastrophe theory or something like that. But this is some different things. So, what is the Some different things. So, what is the organic correspondence? Suppose x1, x2 is a symbolic module and organic correspondence is some sub-micro of minus x1 x2. This is x1, x2 cross x2. We separate it from I1 star omega x1 minus plus I2 star omega x2. So, this is called the Labrador correspondence. Correspondence, say a Lagrangian sum of four. And the L1, suppose it's a Lagrangian sum of four. The idea is that we want to construct Lambrina summary of x2 in the following way, x l1 tells a product of x1, l12. Now foil up product of x1. So this one, in a generic case, is actually a mass. So this in a generic case is a You must have summoned it. So I think this is basically observed by Weinstein. So Einstein kind of proposed to regard this Ramanujan called the direct product as a kind of morphism. Then it transforms the Raman summit called X1 to Raman Summer called X2. So that's a nice property. And the theorem 2 is Phenomenal two is also related to these kinds of things. So this is a suppose that L1, L12 has bound equation, then L2 has bound equality. So this is a little image. So this is really in my paper in 2017, but there are similar previous work by Wilkin and Utworth Mo and I said there is a one uh on ongoing project by Botman Web for these kind of things. But uh but the But this is the case when every single is compact. Every single is compact and bounding cochlear is not particular positive bounding co. And we want to adapt the proof of this tool to our surroundings when this symplicat manifold x1 and x2 are non-compact and we restrict to the positive boundary protein. So how do we do it? I have one more minute, right? I can see this. So let me constantly So let me close the topic basis. So so we are just E to E plus E plus T star m. So this is the map from X to X to pi X. So that's the embedding. And the Wicked star, so for the connormal bundle, this is a connormal bundle. I think the condominium is that you have something called ten of m. have something called n of m. The holomorphic boundary is just xp and x is a point of n and b is the cotangent boundary of m at x so that b restricted to the tangent boundary of m is zero. That's a condominium boundary and this is typical typically a Lagrangian summary for Laboratory summary board. Then the observation is the following. You have this graph of DF. That is a quadrant bundle of this tanium. Then we have this, we regard this collomeral bundle as an algorithmic correspondence. So we take this graph of d of f and then final product of this double e and this collomal bundle. Then this is actually identifying this Language for J by F. And this observation itself is not new, proof, which is classical, at least we found it in a paper by Erash Berlin and Blomov about this stability as most steady. But then you see this, then D of F is embedded in exactly Randallian summary. So zero is a boundary control. Someone called so zero is a bound equation. And this conormal boundary is again exactly somewhere called nicely zero is a bound equal chain. So from the start zero to zero, then we apply this theorem, you get a bound equal chain of this arrow graph. But the issue is that this is not so much direct because we assume everything is compact. And the proof, you just look at this compact case, it has some difficulty to just go through. So we need some trick to make. So, we need some trick to make this proof work in this particular case to get positive bandicooting. But that's another story. So, okay, maybe the time is up, so I stop here. Thank you very much. So, can you um just bring it really explaining about um Is a bounded coaching the same as the Yes, I mean if you go to the duals, then the augmentation is something like a map from the bar complex of the HRG plus to numbers. So augmentation, in this case it takes the bar complex for this HW plus W plus to the ground link to dual. Then you have this kind of element to be phi. I think you can just config the just plugging this d is such a mass. Okay. But if you compare these equations, that's rather easy to find. How amount of protein and inverse flavoring you should have an augmentation? You should have an augmentation. Yes, yes, so if that involves the orange thermal, its positive boundary coaching gives this augmentation of this region of the t-style star. So the filtration is a bit difficulty for the non-compact case. Bit difficulty for the non-compact cases. I mean, because you have this f is can go to infinity. So, I mean, for example, you can consider something like a Colombian band itself. For example, well, this time the fiber is a typical non-compact things. And you have two fibers, there's a rare port between them. But the filtration is a, I don't know, it's kind of not finite number. So, but there might be some ideas how to. So, but there might be some ideas how to include it, but I don't know so much about it. I have one question. Is there any possibility of doing some equivalent theory of an action of Hamilton reaction over there? Correspondence probably has a lot of relation to the equivalent therapies, but I don't know if there's any notion of equivalent generating function. There's any notion of equivalent generating functions. But I don't know. I mean, for example, there are some uncoded group functions. There might be something, but I don't possibly. Are there? If there is no more questions, can the speaker hear? I propose to come up with any idea, because I know you've seen like existing marks and more than is this measuring something more than that, or you know, more strongly. Well definitely listening all the time. Once we have a general dimension. So it's for general dimension M and like uh like Lagrange that's the same. I mean, you know, one is not quite as convinced, but I think some of the things you have. Because at least I didn't have the abstract, I didn't know where people were going, so how much of email was selling between those English people. And they kind of say like this is a certain number of like double spins that they're all because of. So, for example, in a better case, in barnett of homogeneous isotope. That is the right, right. And in a mass case, I don't know. Because you know, you go to this particular example. But he was. Then you can just look like this. He just must have been worse than like five minutes before. So consistently, as well as you must embed the isotopy. But you have just a l uh then you have the serving intersections which is called a scrolling. Intersection, it's called the story. You were saying, I've got this first. Just to say some words about this. No, I've got this one. Then you reach it, but it's not evident. Oh, it's the marks the monster said. Yeah. So it means that the as long as So it means that as well as environment. One point that is tolerance. Yeah. Yeah. That's very much supposed to be. But I don't know actually like how you define it for the most part. So the problem in this case is S double plus S double minus, but you have to s double zero. But then you can just say something like uh uh which is for four S double plus. Not zero is plus. So you ignore that. Yes. And still this time it's a false, so But then you do it. And whatever, but then you do it in like you may do it in the next session. Well, but that could be more sensitive. The name is you want to do that. But then you don't count. Then you say that to the person. And then it's for you. They are banned. You want them to do that for the process. I want to have somebody. Anybody tell me what I'm trying to support? I was checking my base. I went to my brain. So I wasn't worried about the whole thing. Something that's going on and sending the two Australian English. I think why is this best in the way of communication? Two lists don't know how to use that and using the random that doesn't mean that they're all the fitness.
