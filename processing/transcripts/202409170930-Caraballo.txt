So the topic I have chosen is to talk about some reaction diffusion equation with non-local diffusion and about analyzing the dynamics when the equation contains some kind of memory. It's based on two papers published in 2022 in collaboration with my colleague Shui Yahui that was. Shui Yahui, that was formerly in my university, did a PhD there, and now is in Northwest University in Xiang. And then Jose Valero from the Universidad Miguel Hernandez in Spain too. Okay, so the talk needs more than 50 minutes to explain all the details, so I have to give you 25. So I will explain how is the problem and how it can be handled. And then I have some technical detail at the end. Then I have some technical detail at the end if I have time to talk about them. But I prefer to explain what is the problem and how it works. Mainly, the idea is to study the dynamics in principle to first prove the existence of global tractor for the problem. Okay, the importance memory or delay in the equation is clear because in the evolution of the dynamical system, always not only the present state of the system has influence. State of the system has influence, but also the past state. And in some concrete problems from physics, like materials with memory and some other related, appear intrinsically in the problem this memory expressed in the equation. So I just put here a list of some papers on the layer equation that we have worked a lot in our group. And only mention here some from Vittorino Pata and his colleague in the Politecnico de Milano. His colleague in the Politecnico de Milano, who work a lot on this regression diffusion with memory. And the idea is to somehow give a more appropriate framework for the analysis of this memory equation than the one that they provide because the reason I will explain later. Okay, so then of course, I don't need to emphasize about the importance of no local PGE. About the importance of non-local PGE because this is a non-local workshop. But I just put a few representative here papers, but they are missing many more. However, the model that I will work on, I will talk about, is based in the previous work that Michel and his colleague has carried out for many years in the 90s, which is based in this reaction diffusion equation with this non-local coefficient. non-local coefficient in which LU can be a linear functional and also non-linear in some models. Okay. So then this was somehow the motivating equation that we picked to study at the beginning and based on this our PhD student Marta Rirakobos carried out her PhD and considering essentially Essentially, non-autonomous perturbation of this equation. Okay, this is autonomous. So then, considering the possibility of non-linear, non-autonomous term. And then for that case, it's necessary to apply the theory of non-autonomous dynamical system. And we base our analysis in the existence of pullback theory, pullback attractor, and all the structure of this pullback attractor. So we developed. Attract. So we develop a series of papers on this topic, non-autonomous. But later, we extend the theory to considering many more facts in the model. For instance, when a PR delay or memory and when the model is affected by some stochastic perturbation or random perturbation, which made a complete analysis of this. Today, I will only talk about the deterministic model, okay, and it's based. Okay, and it's based in the equation that was studied by Peter Rinopata and colleagues, which is this one here. It's a reaction diffusion equation with this memory term. So this equation is an equation with unbounded delay or infinite delay, because in this term, we have the integral from minus infinity to t. So we need to know the values of the unknown u from minus infinite to the initial time. The initial time. Here is put in the initial time to, but as the problem is autonomous, to can be taken zero. Later, it will be picked zero. Okay, so then to set up an initial value problem for this, we need to fix the values of the solution for negative values. Okay, so my initial data will be a function defined from minus infinity to zero. Or yes, I define here. Or, yes, I define here, and then in talk we translate it here. So, then this is the problem: it's a problem with unbounded delay. So, then we need to set up in an appropriate problem to solve. How can we solve the problem? Okay, the way that first people from Milano did is: okay, I will split the integral with the delay, okay, this one into two, one from minus infinite to. into two one from minus infinite to tau minus infinity to tau and one from toe to t from minus infinity to tau is known the u is u zero is the data okay so then if we do this we pass the corresponding part for the initial data to the right hand side and then what we have here is just an equation without delay this doesn't have delay okay and then therefore we just fix an initial value u0 at time zero Value u0 at time zero or time tau. Okay, okay, so then this is okay. Then you have this equation, you can prove that this equation has a solution, etc. And then you need to study the asymptotic behavior of this equation. For that, you have to define a semi-group. And normally the semi-group is working in this way. You pick an initial value and assign the value of the solution at time t. This is how we define the semi-group for the theory of dynamical system. Of dynamical system, right? But in this case, we cannot do the following the same because the initial value here is u0 because we have hidden here the other part of the initial value. Okay, so we cannot pick u0 and assign the value of the solution at time zero because the solution depends on the part from minus infinite to zero. Okay, so then how can we deal with this problem? How to set up in a good framework? The one that Vita. The one that Vittorino Pat and colleagues did is the use of the Fermi's transformation and do one change of variable and create a system of PDE instead of just one PDE, the reaction diffusion equation. How? So you define this new variable u of t, which is the value of u t minus s. This is the history of the u up to time t, okay, when s is positive. When s is positive, this gives me the values of u from minus infinite to t. This is a segment of the solution, the history. And then consider what is called the integrated history of the u. The integrated history is the integral from 0 to s of this history of the solution. So it's the value, integrated value from t minus s to s. So it's the integrated history. With this notation, it's easy to rewrite just formally an integration by. Just formally, an integration by par, and assuming that the kernel k takes the value zero at infinite, we can rewrite the memory term into this integral with the new variable eta t. Okay, so for this, if we name now mu the minus key, right, we can obtain this is the original equation, but now this term rewritten correctly, okay, in the new variable eta t. And we need now to have another equation for eta t. The eta t simply, if you look at the expression, sorry, if you calculate the derivative here with respect to t, with respect to s, and add, you obtain u. Okay, it's very easy. So then, formally, we obtain this, this equation for eta. Then now the initial value of zero is u zero zero and the u zero zero and the value of eta tau initial value of eta t at time tau is by definition given by the integra from tau minus s to tau which is exactly the integra from minus s to zero to u zero so it's the integrated history of the initial value u0 okay so then this this is if i have a solution of the original problem i can obtain that the solution satisfies this but this can be considered as This can be considered as a system of PDE in two variables, u and eta t. And then, as a system, I need to fix initial values that does not need to be exactly u00 and the integrated history of u0 can be, for instance, other elements fixed in another phase space. So, this is what I will show you now. So, instead of considering this, which is the natural when one, when Which is the natural one when we start with the initial problem. What they did is to consider this space. L2 omega for the initial value of zero and L2 mu r plus with values in h1 zero for the history integrity history from minus infinite to zero. Okay, then this space is defined in this way. The function with the values in h Way are the function with the values in h10 with this scalar product, which is inner product, okay? It is simply the norm in H10, but with this weight, mu s. This is a weight space. So taking now the initial values in this space, general one, not necessarily the one that coming from the original problem, they were able to prove that the problem, the pre-problem. That the problem, the previous problem, have a solution, weak solution in the variational sense, have weak solution. And with this solution, they could define the semi-group in this phase space, have pick an initial value, u0, eta 0, and assign the value of the solution at time t. This is the standard way to create. And then they analyze the asymptotic behavior of this semi-group, okay, and then prove that there. Okay, and then prove that there exists a global attractor in this space L2 times L2 mu r plus from H10. Good, done. But what information do we have from our original problem? From our original problem, we fix a function from minus infinite to zero. And in this problem, we are fixing the value of the solution as zero and the integrated history from minus s to zero. From minus s to zero for the second component. And then we obtain, if we obtain an attractor for this semigroup, we obtain a compact set in this space, okay, in this space, which attracts any solution started in any bounded set at a uniform rate. But I want to know what happened to the original problem, only if I fix in the spaces of initial value, which are function from minus infinite to zero. So. Finite to zero. So for this, there is, okay, this is a first discussion about: okay, if I manage to prove that there exists this attractor, can I obtain that sign information for the original problem? I mean, is it possible to fix any u0, eta zero in this space? And then when I obtained last the solution, there is an The solution, there is another initial value in some space of function defined from minus infinite to zero that the solution corresponds with this. Okay, I mean, is this equivalent? If I have a solution of this problem, can I have a solution of the original one? No, this is no. But if I take u zero eta zero, eta zero, sorry, in the domain of this operator, which this operator is the Operator is the distribution of derivative with respect to the internal variable s. Then, if I take the functions in L2 mu r plus that the derivative with respect to s belongs to l2, the same, and eta 0 is 0, then it's possible to find a phi such that the corresponding function that I defined before here in this way, there is a phi that the eta zero is the integral from minus s. theta zero is the integral from minus s to zero to five. So in this case, the problem is one to one, okay? But in this space, in what is called the domain of t. So then the question is, okay, can we have a dynamical system defined in the domain of t? I mean, if I pick in easy data in the domain of t, the solution of the problem also belongs to the domain of t? Yes, this is correct. Okay, this is proof. So then one more. Proof. So then one can think: okay, then I define the semi-group in L2 times the domain of T. Yeah, you can define the semi-group. It's well defined. You can even prove the existence of an absorbing set. But then we need some compactness. This is the two ingredients to prove the existence of an attractor. But to prove the compactness, we need more regularity of the solution. And this had not been proved. This has not been proved. Okay, so we don't know if our solution has enough regularity to ensure some asymptotic compactness or compactness of some inclusion of the domain into the space. So have to stop there and cannot provide the equivalent of both problems. Okay, so then what alternative do we have? The alternative is based in a simpler case that we consider independently of the problem. We consider independently of the problem with memory, although we consider the model with memory. But the point is that we consider the kernel of the memory term an sub-exponential decay function. I mean, constant E2 minus constant E. This goes to zero, but does not have any singularity. I mean, from zero to infinite, this k is very regular. And the point is that in the problems in materials with thermal with memory, the kernel that appears in the model used to have a singularity of zero. I will show you later, but this somehow that we have. The typical situation is e to minus d0 t divided by t to alpha. Okay. And then the alpha between 0 and 1. So these have some singularity of 0. Singularity as here. But what we analyzed in this paper in 2010 was used explicitly that the kernel was non-singular. The technique work only on this case. It was just a lurking, et cetera. And then only for this case. So then, but in that paper, even if it was only for this, we construct a dynamical system in this space. In this space, L2H10. Okay, this is annotation. This is the set of functions defined from minus infinite zero to H10, such that this integral from minus infinite zero e to gamma s is finite, okay? For certain gamma that we need to choose appropriately. So somehow is a space with weighted from L two minus infinite zero to H one zero, but this space is bigger than L two. Is bigger than L2 from minus infinity 0 to H10. It's bigger because as gamma is positive, the norm of phi is allowed to go to infinite at minus infinite, okay, sub-exponentially. So this is a bigger space. And taking initial values in this space, it's possible to construct a semigroup that assigns to this initial value the solution, but not. The solution, but not the solution, because this is a function defined from minus infinite to zero. We assign the history from minus infinite to t. Okay, I will define later the definition. Okay, so then in this case, it was possible to do. In fact, we did for problems we are non-autonomous, so we use the pullback theory. And another point is that, okay, if we are working in this space and pick initial values there, the value has zero. Value there, the value as zero has nothing to do with the values of phi. I mean, the initial value, I can't change the value as zero. So I can split them, okay? And can have the value as zero in this space and the negative values in this space. This is the typical situation for delay equation when one is working with PDE that used to be in some LP spaces. So the initial value, if we work with continuous solution, then it can be. Solution, then it can be just the initial value continuous from minus infinity to zero. Good. So then this is the idea that motivate our analysis. And then now for our model, okay, we set up the model in this way. This is the memory equation, the same as before. The case that we consider is not the simpler one, although the main contribution of our Contribution of our papers are exactly the framework for this. We consider later we'll put ALU here. This is the non-local diffusion. So then, and the initial values are U0 and phi. U0 will be in the space L2 omega, and the phi will be in the space L2H10 with gamma appropriately chosen. Not any positive gamma. Gamma has to be related to some other. To some other constant. So then, when I fix this U050, we can prove that this problem, even with the non-local term, has solution, global solution. And then I can define the semigroup from this space into this space. This is the natural space. I mean, I fix the initial value of zero and the history up to time zero. Okay. And then I assign the value of the solution at time zero. The value of the solution at time t and the history up to time t. The history up to time t is defined as a function from minus infinity to zero, which is defined as u t plus s. This is the history. When s is negative, these are the values previous to u. So this is the way. So then this dynamical system is well defined and then we need to analyze the asymptotic behaviors to prove the system of global attractor implies or requires. implies or requires the existence of a borising set, absorbing set, and also some compactness that we will have. So this is what I mentioned before. So in fact, the method we use in the simpler case can be applied in the case of non-local term, but with non-singular and then in the And then, in this paper in JDE 2021, we developed a complete theory for functional partial differential equation. Functional mean delay written in general form. But the condition we impose to develop such a theory that includes constant delay, variable delay, distributed delay, and memory term, but the condition imposed on the term. Impose on the term have the restriction to be in the non-singular kernel, okay? E to minus d0 t. That's all, but not with singularity. So then this kind of kernel were not allowed to be there. And then now our idea first, before starting with this setup, is to analyze the problem in the same framework as Vittorino Pata and colleagues. So then, in this space, we already Space, we already carry out the analysis and proof for this setup, the one classical used by PATA and colleagues, the existence of solution and the regularity and the system of attractor in the space, this, which is not the more appropriate in our case. This is done. But then we wanted to get benefit of that. And instead of considering now the problem in the other setup, approve the result from the beginning. Result from the beginning, I mean, existing uniqueness, regularity, et cetera, of solution, we get benefit just using the result proof in this case, okay? Because these are proof already. So then what we did is the following. Let me show you. Okay, now this is the problem I will consider. This is the one that is written in the abstract functional formulation. functional formulation. The H T U T, depending how H is defined, includes different kinds of delays. Let me show you some cases here. For instance, if I define H T phi, phi is a function defined from minus infinity to zero. In this way, capital G phi minus tau t, when I replace phi by u sub t here, I get Here, I get variable delay, okay, because the u sub t of s is ut plus s. So then, if I define h t phi like Laplacian phi here, when I replace phi by ut, I obtain the memory term or any other problem. Okay, so having defined this formulation, we have a complete variety of cases included in a unified formulation. So Formulation. So then, this is what we did. For A, we assume that this is bounded below. M is important. Then, what we do to prove first that this problem has solution, I phi the initial value phi, is that we change to the case of, yeah, what we do is the following. We consider initial value u0 and phi, okay, in this space. In this space. This space, I will tell you how it's defined if it's not here, not yet. Okay, so then I consider this. Then I want to know if our gamma chosen that I have to choose, which is equivalent to say if our kernel mu warranty that when I pick phi in this space, the corresponding Space, the corresponding integrated history of this function, okay, belongs to the space L2μ. Because if I manage to do this, I mean, if I find gamma such that in the definition L2H10, when I pick phi here, automatically this eta phi belongs here, then I apply the Fermi's transformation, and the original problem becomes the problem that I use pattern with appropriate. Use pattern with appropriate initial values in the space. Then we prove the existence of solutions of this, which is proved in the paper of discrete and continuous dynamical system series S, already analyzed. And then we have the regularity. When we have the system of solution, pick the first component, the U, not the eta t, only the u. And with the u, I define the semi-group here. Because in this space, the semi-group is. In this space, the semi-group is the value of the solution of t, and the second component is the history up to time t. So, nothing to do with eta. And then, for this one, we need to prove that this is well-defined, it's construct a semi-group, and then the semi-group has an absorbing set. For this, we need to use the estimation in the setup of pattern because we already got, okay, and get the benefit of that. And get the benefit of that, and then proved that we have it for this case. And finally, we need to prove some asymptotic component, which is very, very technical and require also the energy method to complete all the conversions that are necessary, but it's possible to prove. So, let me show you only one detail, which is the key point to warranty that I can do this scheme. The key point is that when I five, when I pick five, That when I pick phi in this space, the eta phi belongs to this space. For this, we have here this, all this I explained before, is to pick this gamma is here. The gamma has to be chosen less than delta. Delta is the decay rate of the kernel mu. Okay, it's as a sub-exponent. Okay, it's a sub-exponential decay, although with singularity and zero. This is the delta, and the lambda one is the first second value of the minus Laplacian with the risk boundary condition, and the m is the lower bound of the non-local term A. If we pick the gamma in this way, then we can prove this is that when I pick a function phi in L2H10, the V is L10, the corresponding The corresponding integrated history, which is defined here as this operator j. Okay, this operator j is a linear and continuous mapping, and in particular, the constant can be chosen in this way directly that only depends on mu. So once I guarantee this, everything works because it has been proved already. So thank you very much.
