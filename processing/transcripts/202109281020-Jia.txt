Okay. And great. So then the final speaker of the present session is Ha Jiao from the University of Minnesota. And he's going to speak about recent progress on asymptotic stability of shear flows in vortices. Thank you. Thank you, Bob, for the introduction. Firstly, I'd like to thank the organizers, Monica, Bob, and Jun Chen for the invitation. I'm really happy to be here and I've enjoyed. To be here, and I've enjoyed all the talks so far. So, today I'm going to give a talk on this recent progress on symptomatic stability of shear flows and vertices. And this is based on joint work with Alex Ionescu from Princeton. Okay, so we know that three-dimensional flows are often turbulent, and you can see the picture here. And it's mind-boggling to think that we can Think that we can somehow understand this from a mathematical perspective because it's so complicated. But remarkably, there are some flow patterns which are quite stable. For example, you see here the very large scale flow, which is the eye of the hurricane. And the shear flows and vortices, if they are two-dimensional features, are dominant, they could be quite stable even at the very high Veynels numbers. Reynolds numbers. So, the analysis of the stability is a really interesting mathematical problem. So, in this talk, in this talk, I will focus on the asymptotic stability for the two-dimensional Euler equation, which I write in this vorticity formulation. So, we have the vorticity, which is transported by the velocity field, which is Velocity field, which is generated by the vorticity field itself. So, for this audience, I don't have to spend much time to explain what this equation is about. So, as Sasha has mentioned in his talk, it's well known that smooth solutions to a two-dimensional Euler equation is smooth, and so the solutions exist for all times. However, the long-term behavior of the solutions are very hard to understand because there's no global relaxation mechanism. Global relaxation mechanism. So, if you look at the equation, it's a transport equation. The vorticity is transported by a velocity field generated by itself. So, apparently, there is no mechanism for the solution to converge. However, in numeric simulations of slightly viscous two-dimensional flows, one often see two very interesting processes. The first is what I call, people call axis initization. People call axismatization of vertices, and the second is the so-called merging of the same sign vertices. These apparently are very important for the long-term global behavior of 2D Euler equations. So, here I'm showing a movie created by Theodore Drivers. So, you see on the left, you have the vorticity distribution. Initially, it's pretty random, but then you see that a lot of big vertices are. Lot of big vertices are formed almost automatically, and then the bigger vertex will eat up the smaller one. But even, I mean, perhaps even more remarkably, two similar size vortices will merge together as long as they have the same size. So, I mean, there are several subtle points about this numerical simulation, which I will not go into details. But what this shows me is that the vortices are very important for the 2D Euler equation. So in this talk, I will consider the symptomic stability of the vortices in R2. So these are the steady-state solutions to the 2D Euler, for which the vorticity function is a radio function, okay, with a certain center. And shear flows. The shear flows are just parallel flows. You have ux, the x-directional velocity is by, and the y component of the velocity is zero on some periodic. The velocity is zero on some periodic channels. So these two share a lot of similarities, both in terms of the methods and the results. So the stability questions is really a very classical one and it's already studied by the pioneers like Kevin Raleigh or Helmholtz in the late 19th century and early 20th century. So it's like modern. Century, so it's like more than 150 years old almost. So, in the last decade, almost just 10 years ago, starting from 10 years ago, there have been a tremendous progress on this classical topic, mostly on the, I think, mostly on the continuous spectrum. So, what is the role of continuous spectrum in this business in both linear and non-linear symptomic stability? So, let's start with the shear flow case. So, this is shear flow case so this is a flow by zero my x is periodic it's uh say from zero pi to two pi periodic and y is from zero to one so this is my parallel flow we assume that this py is strictly monotonic so this is a very important assumption for this talk that it's a monotonic and spectrally stable so the linearized operator has no discrete eigenvalues if you have discrete eigenvalues of course the discrete Of course, the discrete modes dominate, so then you have instability. And shear flows are actually quite important in nature because many laminar flows look like shear flows. And also in our setting, it also serves as a model for the vertices. So that's why it's natural to consider X, which is periodic, because for the vertices, X is like theta. So it's naturally periodic. So then we consider small perturbations of this flow. Then we consider small perturbations of this flow. So you have velocity, you write the velocity field as in this form, so you have By0 plus U. And then the associated vorticity field is given by minus B prime plus omega. So omega is a perturbed vorticity. And if you plug in this to the 2D Euler equation, then the perturbed Euler equation looks like this. You have, in addition to the 2D Euler equation, now you have two more terms. You have the By partial X omega. uh you have the b y partial x omega minus b double prime y partial x psi so these two additional terms provide the the crucial stability mechanism and u of course is given through the irresaval law in this way so you solve for the string function using the laplace equation and then you take the perpendicular gradient for to get the velocity field so that's the perturbed equation so our goal is to analyze this equation To analyze this equation. Now, since we work in perturbative regimes, we can assume, we can just kind of keep in our mind that the string function and vorticity are both small. And we want to study what happens to omega t as t goes to infinity. Again, we assume that B is strictly monotone and smooth. For us, B is extremely smooth. In fact, we will assume B is generally smooth. So now, So now, if we look at, I mean, for any perturbative problem, the first step is to understand the linearized flow. So if we forget about the non-linearity for a moment, then we arrive at this linearized flow. And then if you, so an important feature of the linearized flow is that for the channel case, is that you can take the Fourier transform in X and the the equation just decouples into the Fourier modes. So that's uh so there's no interaction between the Fourier modes in X. Between the Fourier modes in X. That's a very important simplifying feature. So we do that. Now we get this infinite family of equations indexed by the Fourier parameter k. For each k mod zero, you have this equation. So this is the first step to this is the equation to understand at the first step, so to speak. So this linearized problem has been analyzed by many, many authors. I'm sure this. I'm sure this list is not inclusive, for which I apologize if I miss your name here. But so the main result, what is the main result? The main result for this in the analysis, for coming out of this analysis, is that if we assume spectral stability, then if you write omega k and in the following, so in this way. So then this so-called profile f. Then this so-called profile, FK, we can call FK the profile for the vorticity. Then the profile is uniformly bounded in suitable sub-lave space. So it's clear that we have to take off, if we want to have a uniform regularity for omega k, we have to take off this oscillateral factor. Because if you look at this equation, even forget about this low-order term, it's important, but let's just forget about it for a moment. About it for a moment. You see that this term contributes to this oscillatory factor. And By is like Y, strictly monotone. So if you do not take off this oscillatory factor, it's not possible to prove uniform smoothness of omega k in y. But the result of the linearized analysis is that if you take off this factor, then you get this profile for the vorticity, and the profile can be bounded. Vorticity and the profile can be bounded uniformly over all times in a suitable subway space. So, I mean, this can be seen as I mentioned earlier, this can be seen if you just ignore this non-local term, okay, lower all the non-local term. So, if you take this term into consideration and study the full equation, that's more complicated. Because if we do not assume B double prime to be small, then this is a linearized equation. And this linearized equation cannot be solved explicitly. So we have to study the spectral measure of the linearized operator and study that, study the regularity of that. And there are singularities involved and so on. So it's a tough question to study. But so the first kind of complete result, so to speak, for the general situation, was due to Weizhang and Zhao, who proved optimal. Who proved optimal decay rates for the stream function? So basically, we were able to kind of bound this FK in a low-order soblet space. But this turned out to be not quite enough for the nonlinear problem. So one would like to get kind of more regularity estimates on FK. This turned out to be extremely complicated. In fact, I think there are still some interesting open problems in this area. open problems in this area in this simple setting because of the boundary effect. So in general, if we cannot assume, we cannot expect to have, for example, uniform time H3 control on the profile. This is because the boundary terms contribute different oscillatory factors. So OMICK really contains oscillatory terms, both of these oscillations of this type and other type of oscillations. Type of oscillations. So if you just try to modulate the oscillation by one factor, it's just not possible. And also the two different types of oscillation can interact and create new terms. So this is actually a very complicated problem. And this is already kind of observed by Zielinger in the case when B double farm is small. And I wrote a little paper where I managed to kind of capture the mantle. Manage it to kind of capture the main terms. So there are many, many main terms. So each time you can actually extract the main term and then get the faster decay for the next term as well. But this is quite complicated. And it's only possible to do it finitely for finitely many terms. I mean find a way to kind of somehow simultaneously capture all the terms. But okay, so this is the boundary effect. But if we assume that the double prime of B is compactly supported by the boundary. Is compactly supported strictly inside the channel. Okay, so the and then moreover, the initial data is also supported strictly inside the channel. So you kind of everything moves away from the boundary. Then it turns out that the boundary effect can be removed and we can prove that the profile is as smooth as the initial data in both Soblef and Jibre spaces. So this latter factor is very important because for the non-international Important because for the nonlinear problem, as we will see in a moment, the level of understanding required for the linear analysis is unprecedented. Okay, so you have to understand this profile in Geoffrey space. So you have to understand very, very precisely the linearized flow. So for that reference, let me just recall the so-called Geoffrey space, where you take the Fourier transform of the function and then multiply this huge. And then multiply this huge, huge weight. But s is from 0 to 1, that's important. So if s is equal to 1, that would be analytic functions. But for our purpose, we only need s is exactly equal to 1 half. So that's the chef-related 2 space. So you see that this is an infinite many derivatives, much stronger than the Soblef regularity. So, but okay, that's the linear analysis. We know that you could, as long as, at least when you remove As long as at least when you remove the boundary effects, you could define clearly a profile and the profile by taking off the oscillatory factor in the vorticity, and the profile can be proved to be geovari regular. So very precise understanding of the profile. But then the next question is, can you extend this linear analysis to the full nonlinear problem? And this is a challenging problem. And just last year with Alex Ionescu, Alex Yonescu, we were able to do exactly that, and roughly speaking, we proved the following result. So, again, now you take, you define the profile. Okay, so omega k, we know that omega k carries this oscillatory factor. If we want to prove uniform regularity, we have to exactly take off this oscillatory factor. Now, for the linear problem, you have k T y, but for the nonlinear problem, it's very important that we capture exactly. We capture exactly the oscillatory factor, which is now depending also on the non-linear solution. So the oscillatory factor, in addition to have this linear contribution, also have this nonlinear contribution. So this is very important. So the nonlinear contribution, so this is exactly the kind of the precise oscillateral factor that we have to take off in order to get uniform in time G-vary regularity of K of FK. Regularity of Fk in V. So, but once one writes this, one can prove that Fk is actually generally too regular in V uniformly over all times, assuming that the initial data is generally too regular. So, very precise control on the profile. So, let me just mention that, so previously, in the case when the shear flow is so-called very important. Is the so-called very important colliet flow on the infinite channel. This was already proved by, this was firstly solved by Bedoshi and Mass Modi in a very important work. And in that work, they identified resonant structures in the nonlinearity and designed time-dependent energy functionals associated with imbalanced weights to control the accumulated nonlinear effect. So basically, you have to derive the equation for this profile, Fk. Fk satisfies some non-linear. FK satisfies some non-linear equation, which I will not write because it's a little more complicated. And then we kind of design energy functions on this Fk, which the energy function is actually decreasing, so it's getting weaker and weaker as time goes to infinity, because this FK satisfy this transport equation. And for transport equation in GV space, the only correct hope is that the regularity will get worse and worse. The regularity will get worse and worse. So, the hope is that then you weaken the norm you use to measure this function. But so the two kind of things exactly balance each other in the end, you can control the energy function. It's a very clever argument. Let me also mention that just slightly after our work was posted, Masimbudi John obtained an independent proof with a different method, this result. They obtained a different A different use a different method from ours. So the extension is a bit non-trivial, and the major difficulties are that the linearized flow, so after the Baidershi-Mass Modi work, and then you have this redundant child work on the linearized flow. But at the time, it was clear that the major difficulties are that the linearized flow was not understood precisely enough to. Was not understood precisely enough to identify the so-called resonances in the nonlinearity. And the spectral analysis used for the linearized analysis seemed to be incompatible with the very delicate, precise, and specialized fluid analysis for the non-linear analysis. And the proof uses several new ideas. Firstly, as I mentioned earlier, this is the first step is an extremely precise understanding of the linearized flow, almost like you have precise Almost like you have precise, like explicit solutions. To the second step, because we have this problem where the linearized flow is, oops, the linearized flow is the dominant flow, so to speak. The linearized flow changes the solution in a dominant way, subject to small non-linear rough non-linear perturbations. So somehow we have to combine these things. Have to combine these things. So it turned out in the paper with Alex, we found a space-time transform. So the original profile does not evolve perturbatively. But we found this space-time transform, which transforms this profile F to an auxiliary profile. And the auxiliary profile actually evolves in a perturbative fashion. So, in a way, this transformation completes. This transformation completely decoupled the linear and nonlinear evolution. So, this is quite robust, and we hope that this can be used for other problems. And the last step is to use the precise understanding of the linearized equation to invert this space-time transform. So, this is non-trivial because the transformation is actually only bounded. So, to depend on space and time and infinite dimension on everything. So, to invert it is not a trivial task, but turn out that. A trivial task, but turn out that the linearized analysis is set up in a correct way so that this can be done. Okay, so that's all I want to talk about. Okay, so that I also have a few remarks on the results. So important remark is that because we have this uniform control on the FK, and remember that omega is given from Fk multiplied by this oscillatory factor. Okay, so the oscillation as t goes to infinity. As t goes to infinity, it gets stronger and stronger. That implies, in particular, that actually the vorticity converges weakly, but not strongly, to the final smooth state. So, okay, to begin with, you have a smooth perturbation, okay, very smooth perturbation. At the end of the story, you also have a smooth profile, final state, but the convergence from the initial perturbation to the final smooth profile is extremely violent. So, this is a kind of this is what So this is a kind of this is what is really interesting about it. And this is also consistent with the so-called 2D turbulent theory, which in contrast to 3D turbulent theory predicts a partial transfer of energy to high frequencies and also a reverse cascade of energy to low frequencies because you have weak convergence. Naturally, part of energy is transferred to frequency infinity, but it converges to some non-trivial guy. So then you have some lower energy left. Left. We have to assume that the linearized problem is spectrally stable, and this can be guaranteed if, for example, we assume that the background flow satisfies this condition. And also, okay, there's a question about GIV regularity. I got asked about this question a lot. I think in the afternoon, Nadel Masmudi will talk about this. So, you have a result of. Talk about this. So, this you have a result with them, which I think pretty definitively demonstrates that, I mean, at least if you want to get this level of control, then this geo-regularity is necessary. Okay, so now let me move to another question, which is the vortex symmetrization problem. This is a problem that I showed you in a video, right? You see that the vortex in 2R2 is extremely important in the long-term behavior of 2D Euler, and this is. Of 2D Eula, and this is really the, in my view, the kind of the most important problem in this business. So, unfortunately, the general case is still open. The only available results are for the linearized flow. Oh, I should mention that if you include viscosity and so on, so this is a really big topic. Tons of people have worked on it and many important results with viscosity with high. Results with viscosity with high order, like with viscosity dependent estimates and so on. So, I will not kind of list all the references again. I apologize because this is a lot of people have worked on this. So, with wonderful results, too. But I will only focus on 2D Euler and with low viscosity. Viscosity plays an important role, but I will not consider viscosity in this talk. Ideally, you would like to have a uniform bounds. Like to have a uniform bounds, everything uniform with respect to viscosity, but that seems to be the kind of even harder question than we consider here. So, the only available results are for the linearized flow in general for general vertex and non-linear flow, but around very specific point vertex. So, for the point of vertex problem, with Alex, we consider this vertices, which are written this way. So, you have some common. You have some kappa times the Dirac mass centered at the P D plus some perturbation. So, this perturbation is extremely smooth, again, extremely smooth, and also supported away from the Dirac mass. We cannot allow the Dirac mass to kind of be in the cloud of the perturbation. It has to stay away. And that's what we prove. So, then you can write down the equation for the Tudiola with this extra guy, and then this extra guy will. Guy, and this extra guy will generate these rotations, right? The differential rotation, it generates differential rotations on the vorticity. That's the mechanism that drives everything to converge. But also, the perturbation will move this Dirac mass, because the perturbation will generate a velocity at the position of the Dirac mass, and the Dirac mass will move. Okay, so we assume the support is outside of the omega t and this of the point of vertex is outside the. Point of vertex is outside the support of perturbation, and this is propagated dynamically by the flow. And then we can prove the following. So, if you assume that the emission perturbation is extremely small and also checklist regular, then the system is global and the PT always sits outside of the support of omega t. And moreover, this is actually a little surprising to us initially, that the point of vortex actually stabilized to the final position extremely. To the final position extremely fast, almost exponentially fast. And this is actually very important for the whole setup to converge. So the point of vertex almost immediately stabilizes to a final position. And omega t again, converging weakly to a final smooth profile. So again, initial perturbation is extremely smooth, final thread extremely smooth, but the convergence is really violent. So, okay, so I think how much time? I think how much time I have 10 minutes, right? Okay, so in the last few minutes, let me just briefly mention a recent work with again with Jonesco. This time for the linearized problem around the general radio decreasing vertex. So this is again, this is a problem that we really want to, I think everybody really wants to solve, but it's still open. Um, but it's still open. Okay, so now let's consider our two case and then use the polar coordinate. So you have theta r is the coordinate, and the velocity field, we consider velocity field, which is just rotations, okay, but it's a differential rotation. So UR is not constant, okay? That's very important. And this gives a steady state of 2D Euler, and you have this associated vorticity distribution. This is the radio. Distribution. This is a radio. If you have a radio vorticity, then it generates this rotational velocity field from the BS above law. And then you have the equation connecting the velocity and the vorticity. Now, if you linearize around this, linearize around this flow, you get this two-dimensional linearized Euler equation. And again, you have this line, it looks almost like. It's like it looks almost like the shear flow case. You have partial, previously you have partial x, now you have partial theta. Again, previously x is in t now theta is in t I mean periodic interval. Now, we want to understand this system. Okay, also this, but okay, so what is the difference? The difference is that stream function is determined from the what is diffused through a slightly different form, right? You have this now the leading order. Now, the leading order differentials have coefficients which are kind of singular as R at R is equal to zero. So that's something special. And moreover, U R over R, if you take the derivative, previously we assumed that B is strictly monotone. This is still true. But unfortunately, as R goes to zero, the derivative vanishes. So that's the huge difference that partial R of this guy is equal to zero as R goes to zero. To zero as r equals to zero. So that follows from a simple computation. So all I can say, like we can say safely that all the difficult additional difficulty for the vertex problem coming from this fact that partial r at of this guy at zero is equal to zero. Now, if we take the Fourier transform in theta, because theta is periodic, so take the Fourier transform in theta, we get this, again, the linearized equation decomposing into this infinite family of Of simpler equations. Now you have this equation. Okay, so we want to analyze this equation. So naively, just following what we have done in the shear flow case, people have done in shear flow case, then one might expect that you can take off. So again, this oscillatory factor generated by this term, right? You have positive omega k plus i k of this guy times omega k. So omega k is, so you learn this generates this oscillation. This generates this oscillation, and then you say, Okay, let's just take off this oscillation. Okay, take off this oscillation. Uh, then we get this profile, right? This profile, maybe we can prove that the profile is uniformly smooth in R for all times, because all the perturbative analysis, which are really delicate, are based on define the correct profile, identifying the correct profile, and prove uniform smoothness of all times. All times. And this actually was done, I mean, attempted at least surprising accuracy given the way we define this by Badoshin Koti Delatin recall, where we prove this guy has some sort of derivative. You can control several derivatives, and the number of derivatives you can control depends on k. The higher the k, you can control more derivatives. Derivatives. So that actually turned out to be sharp because, in general, it is not possible to show this guy to be smooth. You can control several derivatives, but not all derivatives due to the degeneracy that I already mentioned earlier. Instead, it turns out that we should decompose using two profiles. Okay, so you have, so the first profile is like here. So, the first profile is like here. The first profile carries this oscillatory factor, but importantly, there's an additional guy that is already smooth. It doesn't really carry this oscillatory factor. You should not have multiplied this guy to this guy because this is already smooth. So, we can show that if you write like this, I mean, okay, I will not have time to give like precise definition of these two profiles, but if it is possible to define profiles like this. Possible to define profiles like this such that these two guys are both G-vary regular if your initial data are G-variant. And in fact, also the second profile decays over time. So the second profile decays over time, extremely smooth. In fact, much more smoother than the initial data. This smoothness only depends on the background flow. So this is kind of generated by the center r equal to zero. The center R equals zero due to this degeneracy. So there's two profiles. This is done in the recent work of Alex. So let me check my time. Okay. So but this is totally compatible with what Pajoshi and Kodizalati recall has done in their quite difficult difficult and complicated paper. So you see that in their definition, they multiply this guy to Apply this guy to everything. Okay, you multiply to everything. Great, you cancel this oscillatory factor, but then for this guy, which is already smooth, you introduce this artificial oscillatory factor. And why can they still prove some sort of control over all time? That's because this guy decays. Okay, if you decays over time, even when they carry the raw oscillatory factor, you can still control the first several derivatives. But it's not possible to control all derivatives. Control all derivatives. So that's the kind of explanation. Now, this ambiguity of profile poses a major problem for non-linear problem, non-linear analysis, because we cannot identify really one profile to do analysis on. So in our recent paper, we actually propose to study for non-analysis not the profile, but the so-called spectral density function. So this spectral density function is kind of associated with a spectral measure. It's like the derivative of a spectrum measure. It's like the derivative of a spectrum measure associated with the string function. And then we can write, we can, by analyzing this, we understand the evolution completely because we can recover the linearized flow by this integral. The stream function can be recovered from the integrating the spectral density function, where we have worked not in R, but in V, where V is like log R. V is like log R. So in this what heximatization problem, it seems that the natural variable is not R, but V, which is log R. Writing everything in V, and now we have this. And for me, a critical point is that now we are able to prove, so theta k, this is in W at least, in W, it is as smooth as the initial data in G every space. So this is kind of a hallmark of any sort of analysis for linear analysis. For linear analysis, is if you can reach a TV space as precise as in the same kind of GV space as the initial data, that we can reach for this guy. And the goal now is to, okay, this is for linear analysis. The goal is now to somehow find a suitable time-dependent spectral density functions for the nonlinear problem and try to control the evolution for all times. So, the funny thing is that non-linear. So, the funny thing is that now we have one more variable because previously we only have T V, but now we have T V W where W, so V is like a space variable, W is a spectral variable. So, somehow you have one more variable, and how do you define this? That seems to be an intriguing question that we haven't really figured out. Okay, so I think that's all that I want to say. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you for the very interesting talk. The very interesting talk. Are there any questions? So let me ask, at the very end, you, or almost the end of the previous slide, you have this representation involving the F1 and the F2, exactly. Is that decomposition canonical, or is that when you say ambiguity, you mean it's not canonical? It's canonical. Okay, so this is a decomposition. This is defined through theta k. Okay, so the theta k, an important feature is that theta k is, I mean, this is connected to the so-called regularity structure of the spectral density function. The cd is smoothing w, but it's not smoothing v. So basically, those profiles are defined by localizing v from zero and center around zero. So this gives you these two profiles. So the ambiguity comes from the fact that you could choose a colour anywhere. So that seems to be a little So that seems to be a little, that's where the ambiguity is from. And also, another important thing is that in general, if you want to measure the regularity of this guy in the variable R or in the variable V, it is just simply not possible to measure the regularity in the same Java space as the initial data. This is because you have this oscillateral factor. I mean, you have to use extremely precise free analysis. Precise free analysis to actually measure irregularity. But that's only possible when this guy is a linear function. If it's non-linear, I have so far not been able to find any harmonic analysis tool which can measure geo-regularity without a loss if you carry this oscillatory factor, which is non-linear. So I think for me, a more challenging technical question is if you want to work with these two profiles, is somehow you're not able to measure regularity in the same way. To measure regularity in the same Java space as initial data. Yeah, and so the point is really that the spectral density function is the right object to work with rather than these two profiles. I'm sorry, can you say the question? Is it not better than to say that the conclusion is that the spectral density function is the right object to work with rather than these two profiles? I think I'm not as bold at this time to claim that this is exactly the right object. Exactly the right object, but for me, at least it somehow addresses several of the conceptual difficulties associated with this problem. Other questions? How Jia, yeah, thank you for a very nice talk. Very interesting results and very interesting. So just for the last slide, this is spectral density function, is this related to distorted Fourier transform? That's a very good question. I think it is, actually. I think it is actually. It is. It's kind of given by the kind of generalized eigenfunctions. It's some sort of integral of the one-hand side against the generalized eigenfunction. So in that sense, it is. I mean, the special feature here is that we have to control this in Jeffree space. Somehow, kind of a much more precise control is required for this problem. Okay, if there are no further questions, then let's thank Haoja again and all the speakers of the session. And we'll resume in about 32 minutes. So thank you very much. Thank you very much, everyone.
