We will talk about the dynamics of convex mean period dynamics of mean convertible flow of convex hybrid circuits. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So yeah, I'm going to talk about the dynamics of mean curvature flow of convex hypersurfaces. I changed the title a little bit. Everything is joint work in progress with In progress with Toti Das Kalopoulos and Natasha Sesum. So let me begin with a reminder: what does mean curvature flow? It is flow of hypersurfaces in Rn plus one. So we have hypersurfaces M sitting in Rn plus one, and the hypersurfaces are n-dimensional. And these hypersurfaces move in such a way that their normal velocity at each moment and at time is. At each moment and at time is equal to their mean curvature. So, typical solutions that you find are, for example, if you have a plane, a hyperplane in Rn plus one, it has zero curvature, it sits still. If you take a sphere with radius r of t, then its velocity is minus r prime of t, and its mean curvature is n divided by r of t. And therefore, the sphere will shrink, and the radius decays by this differential equation, which you can solve. And if you solve it, you find that the sphere shrinks to a point in finite time. There are other stranger shapes. There's a surface, a torus-like surface that shrinks to a point without just by dilation. Just by dilation. There are more complicated solutions that shrink by dilation. Then one that's going to show up a lot today is the cylinder, which is essentially the product of a sphere and a line. In general, it's a k-dimensional sphere and an n-k-dimensional subspace. This cylinder will also shrink, and in finite time, it will shrink to its axis of rotation. Yes, there's been a lot of study by in geometric analysis by uh many people on uh ancient solutions. So these are solutions that are that ha exist for all negative times. And I've spent so there's a lot of work on finding such ancient solutions and classifying them even. And so I what I want to present today is an attempt to use uh to to um cast that question in the terms of dynamical systems and to um Systems and to somehow catalog the various solutions that have been found and to create some order in the zoo of solutions that has been found by thinking of this thing as a dynamical system. Okay, so here's the outline of my talk. So I want to study mean curvature flow as a dynamical system. I will actually most of the time not talk. Actually, most of the time, not talk about mean curvature flow because mean curvature flow has a lot of scaling invariance. It's a parabolic equation. If you scale space and time by the right factors, the equation is invariant. So, I want to, at some point, I'll break this invariance by doing a transformation that gives us an equation that is equivalent to mean curvature flow, but that is not invariant under dilations. Then I want to regard it as a. Then I want to regard it as a dynamical system. So that means we're going to have to find a phase space and I'll have to put a topology on that phase space. So the phase space will be a set of suitable surfaces and we'll have to say when two surfaces are close to each other. That topology that we introduced should have compactness properties. I want to make I want to make arguments about omega limit sets and arguments that were used to from ordinary differential equations and there you need compactness. For example, to conclude that an omega limit set exists, you need some compactness property. So we want the topology to have that compactness property. Once we've chosen this phase space, we'll have to prove well poseness for the initial value problem. For the initial value problem. Now, of course, the initial value problem for mean curvature flow has been solved, much has been said about it, and it's sort of a classical topic. But nevertheless, it turns out that the well-posedness includes the fact that the flow should be continuous with respect to the topology that we introduced. So, there still is some uniqueness, some work to be done. Once we have all. be done once we have all all that set up then we can we can try to we can play dynamical systems and we can look for we can look for fixed points uh we can look for connecting orbits uh between the fixed points uh if we have chains of connecting orbits we can try to see if there's a shadowing lemma and we could do more but not today okay so here's the phase space Here's the phase space. Okay, so we're going to think of embedded hypersurfaces as, and that's a choice because mean curvature flow exists, is well defined for non-embedded hypersurfaces. For example, you could take a Klein bottle and try to evolve it by mean curvature flow. And I don't know of any applications of that, but just from a geometric point of view, it sounds like a fun question, but that's one we're not going to talk about today. One we're not going to talk about today. And in fact, I'm going to only look at convex hypersurfaces. And why is that? That's because to fulfill that wish list that I just showed you on the previous slide, taking arbitrary hypersurfaces is way too general. I don't think I would know how to do that. It may be that this program can be carried through for mean convex hypersurfaces, so hypersurfaces whose mean curvature is. mean curvature is greater than or equal to zero but that that would be considerably more complicated so for now we're going to be satisfied by just looking only at the evolution of convex hypersurfaces so a convex hypersurface is the boundary of a closed and convex set subset of rn plus one so closed not necessarily So, closed, not necessarily bounded. Right, so our sets are not compact, right? For example, the cylinder, we want to consider the cylinder and things or compact surfaces that are close to the cylinder. Okay, so the topology on our space X is going to be as. Our space X is going to be as follows. I'm going to, it is essentially the topology of Hausdorff convergence for closed sets. The Hausdorff metric on say it like that. So here's the precise definition. For each closed set, I'm going to define its distance function. So if I subset an element of x, so that's a closed and convex subset of Rn plus one. convex subset of Rn plus one. I define the distance function in the usual way. And I will say that a sequence of closed sets converges to CK converges to C if the distance functions converge locally uniformly to the distance function of C. And now an important observation is that distance functions are Lipschitz continuous and they all have Lipschitz constant one. So So I said here local converges locally uniformly. That's equivalent to pointwise convergence because these distance functions are all equicontinuous. This topology, so I've said I've described it in terms of convergence of sequences. There's a topology and the topology is metrizable. So the distance between two closed The distance between two closed convex sets can be written like this. You would like to take the supremum norm, the distance in the supremum norm between the two distance functions. And that, since we're considering unbounded sets, that is not good because this supremum could be infinite. So we have to weight it with this one plus x squared here. And this weight is rather arbitrary. It just has to be bigger than linear. Just has to be bigger than linear in X. And so this defines a metric. And in this, the convergence in this metric is the one is the topology that we have on X. The observation that the distance functions are all Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant one gives us this very nice result here. This by Ascoli's theorem, the set of distance functions is compact. Functions is compact. That's not completely true. You have to say if I have a sequence of distance functions and if their value at one point is uniformly bounded, then you can find a convergent sub-sequence. So in this topology, in the space of closed and convex sets, if I have a sequence of closed and convex sets, and if the distance to the origin to those To those sets is bounded, then there is a convergent sub-sequence in this topology. So we have nice compactness properties. Okay, so we have a space, a phase space with a topology. Now we need to define mean curvature flow. Now, if you have a smooth and compact initial hypersurface C0, something like this, then there There exists a the initial value problem, the existence follows from parabolic PV results. You could quote, if you write it out in local coordinates, you can quote a theorem. You get a quasi-linear parabolic scalar parabolic equation, and you can, if you quote the right theorems from, say, Ladis and Sagaya and Uladseva Solonikov's book, then you will get existence and smoothing. Existence and smoothing for solutions. What regularity are we assuming here? So, first of all, I'm saying C is an arbitrary closed and convex set, so that means that the boundary is locally Lipschitz, and that's the only regularity that I require. So, smooth, you can replace by, we will have to replace by locally lipshits, so convex. Lipschitz, so convex. And so this can be done. And also, I want to prove we need an existence theorem for, say, non-compact initial surfaces. So let's say I have a paraboloid, something like this. If I take this, that's a convex, that's the boundary of a convex set. Imagine that it extends all the way to infinity. Can I take that as an initial condition for mean curvature flow? And the answer is yes. And so the quickest way to use existing results to get solutions is to approximate these things from the inside by smooth compact surfaces and just say that the solution is the, using the maximum principle, the solution is just the largest, the union of all smooth, compact solutions that are contained in this set. And that approach is equivalent to using. Equivalent to using the theory of viscosity solutions. So there was, and this was in the 80s done by Evans Brook. There's work by Giga, Goethe, and Chen. Giga wrote a book on viscosity solutions that includes a discussion about the non-compact case. And then Tom Ilmanen defined in his thesis the maximal sub-solution that also applies to the non-compact case. So this would give us existence of a solution. Existence of a solution. There is a problem with using the viscosity solution approach because there's a little confusion about language. If you read texts on viscosity solutions, they will say that there exists a unique viscosity solution. But this means that the level set function that you're describing there is unique and the actual hypersurfaces could be different. So let me give you one example. And so this one appeared in Ilmanen's thesis. If you Illman's thesis. If you, and so I'm going to draw an initial condition. So if my initial condition in R2, my initial condition is the following curve, which is not connected. It is the x-axis and the graph of this function. And this could be, say, 1 over 1 plus x squared. The important thing is that the total area under the graph is finite. So now I can evolve this in two different ways. One way is I can say, well, the x-axis has curvature zero, so it doesn't move. Which is zero, so it doesn't move. And the top of the thing is the graph of a function. So that will evolve by some PDE. So that evolves separately, and that gives you a solution. So this is at time t is zero, and this is at time, sometime positive t. There is a different way of evolving this, because what you can do is you can say, I can take, I can add somewhere at infinity, I can cap off the ends here, so here and here. And here, and I can put so these are regions that are really high curvature, and they will move inwards with very high velocity. And this will happen so fast that instantaneously at positive time, there exists a solution with the same initial condition that has this shape. It is a connected curve. So, there exist two solutions. So, both the red curve and the blue curve, which is disconnected, both are solutions. Both are solutions to curve shortening, which is mean curvature flow in the plane. And they both have the initial condition that I have on the right. So what is the viscosity solution? The viscosity solution, the unique viscosity solution says that the solution is the whole region in between those two curves, which is not a curve. It's a set with positive area. So if you use viscosity solutions. So, if you use viscosity solutions, this is a case of non-uniqueness. You could choose the blue solution or the red solution, which one is it? If you want continuous dependence of the solution on initial data, this is very bad because we have one initial data that has two solutions. That's the most discontinuous that you could be. So, note that the example that I drew here is not convex. And so What we proved. So, for compact convex initial conditions, it is well known and it's easy to prove with the maximum principle that this kind of fattening cannot happen. There was no proof for general non-compact solutions. And in fact, it is not known if you take as initial condition a As initial condition, the graph of a function. And so if your initial curve is the graph of, so I'll write something, I'll say e to the x times sine e to the x. Okay, so what does that look like? It is a curve that is very nice here and then starts to oscillate faster and faster. and then starts to oscillate faster and faster and faster. And it is very much not a Lipschitz graph. It's very non-convex. As far as I know, there is no proof that the solution to curve shortening with this initial condition is unique. That's not known. We did find the proof. So Tascalopoulos and Saias had a proof for and size had a proof for um um for graphs that are bounded from below so if if you if this if you square this then there is a proof of uniqueness but it really uses the lower bound so this is a delicate issue and using their proof we we adapted their proof and we showed that for arbitrary convex initial data no matter how large they are and what they do at infinity there is At infinity, there is a unique evolution by mean curvature flow. Once you have the uniqueness, continuity follows. So mean curvature flow defines a continuous local semi-flow on the space X. So and continuous with respect to the topology that I just described for you. So on the space of convex hypersurfaces of Rn plus one. Surfaces of Rn plus one, we have a continuous local semi-flow defined by mean curvature flow. So now we can go to what time should I stop? Seven minutes. Okay, let me hurry up. So we look at the rescaled mean curvature flow. Rescaled mean curvature flow, which a motivation for that is that there are a lot of self-similar solutions like the sphere and the cylinder, and they all look like this: they are squared of time multiplied with a fixed surface. And so to get rid of this rescaling, what we do is we say take any solution C of T of mean curvature flow and then consider C bar of tau, which is this gadget. So we change time. So we change time. So we change the time here and we rescale. And so if you undo this transformation, you get this. So in particular, if the C bar is constant, then C of T, the original solution of mean curvature flow, was self-similar. So for example, if you apply this transformation to the spherical solution that shrinks to a point at time one, what you get is Time one, what you get is a stationary sphere. It turns out that C tau coming out of this transformation evolves by a modification of mean curvature flow, which I call rescaled mean curvature flow. Mean curvature flow would be just this, velocity equals mean curvature, and we add an extra lower order term. And this, so the transformation is very simple, and you can just go. The transformation is very simple, and you can just go through the motions. It's very simple to turn the previous result into the statement that this rescaled mean curvature flow defines a continuous local semi-flow on the same space X that we have. And this transformation, if you it's analogous with the old, which maybe you might be more familiar with, if you look at blow-up force, this semi-linear heat equation, you do this. You do this transformation. So, there are many papers by Giga Cohn and many, many others. You take the logarithm of time as a new time variable and you rescale, and your new function satisfies the original equation with two extra terms. So, these are the two extra terms. And those extra terms are analogous to this extra term in Riescaldme curvature plot. Okay. Okay. So then I'm going to define a reduced phase space. So first of all, I'm going to simplify things a bit. I'm going to look only at surfaces that are reflection symmetric, so that are symmetric, invariant under reflection in the origin. And then T. And then Tc is for a given complex hypersurface, Tc is the time at which the solution becomes singular, the solution to mean curvature flow, not rescale mean curvature flow. Okay, so we're going to take we're going to take surfaces that become singular at time one. And so this condition tells us that the solution. tells us that the solution that we're only going to look at hypersurfaces that are not too large and not too small. And so one parabolic scaling tells you that T of lambda C is lambda squared T of C Lambda to the minus two. Okay, so there's a simple scaling. So if you have a convex set then and it's vanished Then, and its vanishing time is not exactly one, then you can just take a you can dilate it, and there's exactly one dilate of that surface that will become singular in time one under mean curvature flow. This set y turns out to be invariant under rescaled mean curvature flow. And that's so I only have that's a very short calculation, but I only have a couple of minutes left, so let me not do that. In particular, there's only one of all the spheres centered at the origin, there's only one sphere that sits in this set. Of all the cylinders whose axis goes through the origin, there's only one that one radius that belongs to this set. Okay, so the rescaled mean curvature flow is globally defined on this set. So that's a motivation for looking at this set. And then one final thing that I'm going to do is. Final thing that I'm going to do is mean curvature flow and the rescaled mean curvature flow are invariant under scaling, well, and but also under rotations. And so if you have cylinders, those cylinders could be pointing in any direction. And I don't want to pay attention to which direction they point in. So mean curvature flow acts, the orthogonal group acts on surfaces. And we're going to say that two surfaces that are equivalent up to rotate. That are equivalent up to rotation, we're going to call those the same. So we'll look at the actual phase space that we take is the space Y, which is a closed subset of the original space X, and the quotient of that by the action of the orthogonal group. The orthogonal group is compact, so this quotient is again a nice metric space. Okay, so that's so it really is a so the phase space is all convex hyperserved. phase space is all convex hypersurfaces that are uh that are that are dilated to the right size um and we uh if two of them are equivalent up to up to rotation we say they are the same that's that's the um that's the uh this our phase space which i call z okay which okay so um in our space z the fixed points Space Z, the fixed points are the cylinders. Okay, so there is the sphere SN with radius square root 2n is a fixed point. The cylinder, say, in R3, the cylinder with R1 cross R1 with radius square root 2, with radius square root 2 is Is a fixed point. So there exists a finite number of fixed points, and these correspond to all the self, the convex self-similar solutions. So that's a theorem, and it was proved by Huskin in the 1980s. He also proved another theorem, which is very well. Another theorem, which is very well known. This theorem says that if you start with a convex hypersurface that is compact, so the crucial, if you start with a compact convex hypersurface, then it stays compact, it shrinks to a point in finite time, and right before it disappears, it becomes like a sphere. So if you that's for me curvature flow. That's for mean curvature flow. If you translate that into what it means for rescaled mean curvature flow, it says that if you start with, so if your initial curve belongs to Z, then the solution exists for all time. If C is compact, then P of T converges to the N-sphere. So if you look at the set of all hypersurfaces and you only look at the ones that are bounded, At the ones that are bounded, then those all sit in the domain of attraction of the n-sphere. Okay, so one more ingredient for this flow is also due to Huskin. There's this, so in his terminology, there's a monotonicity formula. What it means in our language here is that this quantity, this integral that he wrote down is non-decreasing. Is non-decreasing along solutions of rescaled mean curvature flow. And in fact, it's always strictly decreasing except on fixed points. So and this quantity h, this integral is invariant on the rotation. So it's also well defined on this on this quotient space z that I described before. You can calculate this integral on the various spheres that. The various spheres that we have. So you get explicit formulas in terms of gamma functions and powers of pi. And we verified that this integral depends continuously on the boundary of C. It depends continuously on C. So the Huskin energy is a continuous function in our topology. And more importantly, it is a proper function, meaning that. It is a proper function, meaning that the set of C where H of C is less than or equal to any number H, this is compact for all H. For all H less than two, and we only care about values of H less than two. So that's good. So that this means we could talk about all. This means we can talk about omega limit sets of solutions. If you start, if you have an initial convex set that starts, or a family of convex sets that are all contained in one of these sublevel sets, then the omega limit set of under the under this rescale mean curvature flow is well defined and it has all kinds of nice properties. Okay, so now there are running out of time, so there, so There, so what is the here? This is what do we have so far? We have a phase space and there are fixed points. So, sigma one, this is the cylinder S1 cross Rn, and then there's sigma two. So, let me look at the case of R4. N is three, four is three plus one. There's sigma two, that's S2 cross. two that's that's s2 cross r and this is s1 cross r2 and then there is sigma 3 the three sphere what we have shown is that if you look at the sohuskin's theorem says that if you take compact compact initial conditions then the flow all goes to sigma 3 so compact compact surfaces all So, compact surfaces all go to sigma 3. Then, on the other hand, sigma 2 and sigma 1 are not compact. Now, there exists, so there was a construction by Brian White and it was later added, you know, improved on by Hasselhofer and Por Hirschkowitz. They proved, they constructed a homoclinic orbit, heteroclinic orbit from signal. Heteroclinic orbits from sigma 2 to sigma 3. So, and they constructed this heteroclinic orbits from between these. So, these heteroclinic orbits exist. And then in one lower dimension, there is a heteroclinic orbit from so the picture in one lower dimension in R3, you have only sigma 1. And there is sigma 2, which is the 2 sphere sitting in R3, and sigma 1 is S1 cross R1. In this space, you also have a connecting orbit. Now, if you take the cylinder on, so this is a solution to rescale mean curvature flow. If you take the cylinder of that, multiply it with R, you get a connecting orbit from here to here. So these solutions exist. And then later, Hasselhofer. So there are mass formal mass asymptotic expansions, and there have been theorems proving by many people, including Dascalopoulos and myself, and also Hasselhofer and Du, proving uniqueness of these connecting orbits. And so So, I guess one of the main results that we can do with, yeah, so here are the uniqueness theorems. So, let me skip those. Here's the, let me finish with this result. There's a shadowing lemma. So, there exists, so here in this picture, we have sigma one is is sigma two and sigma three. So this is the case of hypersurfaces in three-dimensional hypersurfaces in R4. There exist connecting orbits that were constructed before these, one from sigma one going to sigma two and one from sigma two going to sigma three. So there is a construction and there's also a connecting orbit going from here. So there is a construction that we did of That we did of that shows that you can shadow, there exist connecting orbits going from sigma one to sigma three that are arbitrarily close to the union of these two orbits. And the construction is really completely topological. Basically, there's this little green curve here, you choose a suitable set of initial data, a little arc of Initial data, a little arc of initial data. One end sits on this red curve and ends up over there. Another end sits on this red curve, ends up over there. And the idea is that if you, that somewhere in between, there has to be something that goes very close to that. And I think I'm probably out of time. So what are the ingredients? So the precise statement is written here. If you take any neighborhood. Written here, if you take any neighborhood open set containing these two solutions, these two connecting orbits, then there always exists the connecting orbits from sigma one to sigma three. And the yeah, so I think I'll stop there. I'm assuming the time is up. This is the case, NS3. There should be. This is the case NS3. There should be many more of these results. And I think when we finally write it up, there will be a more general statement. In higher dimensions, what you have is you have a simplex of solutions. So sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3, sigma 4. This would be the next highest dimension. There exists connecting orbits going like this. And there should be, there should be the whole simplex in. Should be there, should the whole simplex in between should be filled up with connecting orbits, um, and there.
