Great, so all right, so just to remind you, the classical Weinstein conjecture tells us that a read vector field on a closed contact manifold has rab orbits. So, as L C S manifolds sorry, when is a rab orbit? Oh, um Oh, so we okay, maybe I should write that. Okay, so let's go back. Okay, so we have okay, so we have the contact manifold. Let's say C, and let's say lambda is a contact form. So lambda. So lambda uh sorry, D lambda to the nth power is non-degenerate. So this is a on-dimension 2n plus one manifold. Manifold. And then you get a red vector field, which is basically defined by so the red vector field satisfies so it so it's in the kernel of D Lambda so D lambda And it satisfies this, right? So this determines, these conditions determine a vector field, and a rev orbit is just a closed orbit of this vector field. So see here's dimension 2n plus 1. Okay. Okay, so um So as we already saw in some talks, in some sense, LCS manifolds generalize contact manifolds. We can see that, for example, from the work of Eliasberg-Murphy. So one natural question is, does the Weinstein conjecture generalize to L C S setting? LCS setting. So maybe another question is: why not generalize the Arnold conjecture as LCS manifolds also obviously generalize symplectic manifolds? And this might be possible in some way, but it's not quite obvious. One issue is that Hamiltonian flows can have so you can have Hamiltonian symplectomorphs. So, you can have Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms with no fixed points. So, in fact, you can have Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of exact LCS manifolds, closed LCS manifolds, with no fixed points. So, here's a basic example. So, we have the so C times S1, so here C One, so here C is a contact manifold. Maybe even just, let's just say S3, right? Let's say just to be more concrete, let's just say it's the standard contact structure. So contest standard contact form. All right, so this is my C. And so we have the LCS form on this, which is also called the LCS vacation, where alpha is the sorry, alpha. Sorry, alpha alpha is just the pullback of the theta to this m here. So this gives us a two-form on m and well it satisfies you know it's an L C S structure. So we can we can call this the L Cation of this contact manifold C lambda and so let's so let's take h, our Hamiltonian function to be minus one and maybe we've already seen this example but anyway so Anyway, so we want to solve, what is that? Oh, xh, right? So that's the Hamiltonian vector field. So the Hamiltonian vector field solves this equation. So the Lichnirovitz differential of H, which is just Which is just dh minus alpha wedge h. So this disappears. So this is just this is just alpha. Okay, so so I claim that the solution is just The rib vector field of lambda comma zero okay, so let's check this okay so okay, so let's see omega XH So let's see, omega xh dot becomes okay, so it's just by our definition so and So we have all right, so I have our R lambda annihilates d lambda, so it becomes and right and r lambda pairs with lambda to be one. Yeah, okay, so let me just okay, so you get let's just write it. So you have d lambda. Let's get let's describe it so we have Dolanda. And And this is just zero, and this is and this is alpha. This is alpha because This is alpha because so as I said, so xh is r lambda 0, so it pairs with lambda to be 1, and so you just get alpha. Okay, so indeed so indeed xh is this vector field, and of course for a small time, the flow does not have any fixed points. Flow does not have any fixed points. So, yeah, so for Arnold conjecture, you really have to do some thinking. What is the right generalization? So, but like I said, I wanted to talk about generalizing the Weinstein conjecture. So, the setup for this, we have an exact closed LCS manifold. LCS manifold. So exact means that our mega is. Can you actually see my cursor or no? Yes, yeah. Okay, so yeah, so okay, so exact just means it's given like this, where lambda is some one form. So it's just now general one form and alpha is closed. And alpha is closed. So alpha is closed. And we define a distribution v to be the kernel of d lambda. And it's easy to see that for every point Vp has dimension 2 or 0. And So, this distribution cannot be identically zero because if it was identically zero, then d lambda would be non-degenerate. And since we have a closed manifold, this is impossible. So, it cannot be identically zero. So, as a simple example, the LCS decation again. LC application again. In this case, the vanishing, so I call this thing V the vanishing distribution. So the vanishing distribution is just the span of these two vector fields on M. So just C times just one here. Okay, so we can define a cone so So basically, a certain sub-distribution by this condition. So it's just vectors satisfying lambda v is greater than zero. And then we define a rep curve to be a smooth map which is tangent to the cone. So for all T, for L T For OT, OT is in C? You mean DGT over OT, no? Ah, yes, this should be a point here. Yeah. And the. Sorry, Yasha, could I ask? So you said that V was the span of these two vectors, and you also said it was the Of these two vectors, and you also said it was the kernel of this d lambda. Is that so? If I have that the kernel of d lambda has dimension two, then that's then those are equal. But if it has dimension zero somewhere, is that necessarily the case? So I didn't quite understand the question. So in the example, I have LCSification of a content. L CSVA of a contact form. So in that specific example, in that specific example, dimension is always two. Oh, I see. I understand. Just for that. Right. So in general, it can be varying. So really, I shouldn't really call it a distribution. I should say it's a generalized distribution. Um yeah, maybe that's more more accurate to say. More accurate to say generalized, I don't think we hear you. I don't think we hear you anymore. I don't know if you're speaking. Yeah, we don't hear anymore. Can you hear me now? Yes. Yes. Okay. I don't know what's wrong. Okay. So if we have a closed manufacturer. If we have a closed manifold and an exact L C s structure, d alpha of lambda with alpha integral, then there is a red curve in M and actually the case m is equal to 2 is also interesting, it's just that I have very bad intuition for it, so I decided to exclude it for now. So So right, so first observation is that this implies the Weinstein conjecture. So this is pretty easy to see. So again, we have a contact closed manifold and omega is the LC aspication as before. And so let's say we have a red curve, right? So it's this curve which is tangent to the Spanish distribution. distribution to the cone of the nine chain distribution. So let's say pi is the projection from M to C then pi of O well so pi of O is going to be red orbit after parametrization because pi of O is going to be tangent to the rep vector field. So that's just because of That's just because of just because this is our vanishing distribution. And yeah, so yeah, so the column there is everything which pairs positively with lambda. And so if you project that to C, you just get multiples of the red, well, you just get the red distribution. Well, you just get the rep distribution, right? So, so indeed, if you project all, you get a rep orbit up to parametrization. And so, well, then that implies the one-step ejection. Okay, so as a first step, well, so yeah, so I want to I want to have some partial result. So, in this partial result, we take the half-LCS structure, which is the LCS location of the standard contact form on S2K plus 1. And the first theorem is that, well, the CSW conjecture holds for a C3 neighborhood. T3 neighborhood of this hub LCS structure. Okay, so some idea for maybe can you maybe first question before all of that? It's not even clear, right? If you before going in C3 neighborhood, if I take an L C structure and I take an equivalent this L C structure, just multiply by E to the G. E to the g it totally changed this distribution, right? So that's right. Well, it's just like it's just like for the one, it's just like for the Weinstein conjecture. If we multiply the contact form by a function, that completely changes the whole REP distribution. Uh but for the this particular case of the sphere, any gauge transformation is just changing the compact form, right? That's what you say. The compact form, right? That's what you say, and so you know that since, right? Because it's not obvious. Yeah, okay. I'm not sure. No, but I mean, maybe my question is: what does it mean a C3 neighborhood of the LCS structure? It means that you take the standard form and you allow C3 deformation of that. And you also see two deformations of that form, or you take any representative of the standard structure and you take any deformation of that. And I think it's a different picture. So you take the kind of the half LCS structure and you look at its C3 neighborhood. But well, I mean, but if you take an equal and I mean, but if you take an equivalent, if you take an equivalent of okay I mean for this here maybe it's okay I mean I guess I guess the size of the neighborhood will change but okay maybe we can discuss that so okay so all right so they um Okay, so basically, we want to introduce holomorphic curves, and one important ingredient there is the right kind of almost complex structure. So, this is also might be something that always is going to talk about tomorrow. So, what we want to do here, well, so the D is the vanishing distribution as before, C is defined to be the C is defined to be the d lambda orthogonal complement to D. And J is called admissible if it preserves C and D and chains d lambda on C. So it's very similar to what you do usually in contact homology business. Business. Except that now this splitting of, well, except now you have a kind of a complicated splitting of V and C. So it's no longer, so there's no longer any S1 action and dimensions are varying and so on and so forth. Right, so yeah, again, as the basic example. So, wait, what is exactly? Sorry, what is psi? It's orthogonal complement? Yeah, to V. It's much harder to do online, but when V is zero, it's everything. Sorry, G long Development. So you have two situations, right? G lambda is non-degenerate, and v is zero, and psi is everything. And then you have g lambda. Ah, it's g eta lambda, maybe? I'm super confused, right? So is either degenerate or non-degenerate, right? Well, the definition should not be Well, the definition should not matter on the okay, so let's try it. Let's try it. I don't know what is complement in well, I know what I don't understand the word complement, maybe. Yeah, it's just it's just V in so this is at a point, right? So TPM such that can make this bigger. But V is the kernel of the lambda. So it's everything, no? Oh, sorry, derivative is wrong. Wait, what do I want to say? I think V is defined that it's like this thing is everything. No. Do you mean G is a lambda? Wait y do you mean E da lambda? Uh no, I don't think so. Okay, so okay, so C is like the contact distribution. V so V is the cur the kernel of D Lambda is like red vector field N D D theta. So no, but you d you define V to be the kernel of D Lambda, right? D Lambda V. You define V to be the set of vectors, like the set of vectors so that. Oh, sorry. Oh, I guess. Sorry, this is. Oh sorry, oh I oh I guess sorry this is this is not what the protocol I want. So I want V in TPM so that for all W in D lambda between L left to the right left to the right then Then I claim this is everything. It could, well, what do you mean? Am I wrong? Well, in this example, for example, so, okay, let's look at this example. So then, the vanishing distribution is this. But you see, it's the vanishing distribution. Its orthogonal complement should be the contact distribution. Contact distribution? Right? But ah, no, but this is not what you write. Okay, so maybe now I understand what you mean. You take a metric, right? You take a Riemannian metric, which you build with your complex structure, and you take the orthogonal for that metric. Is it what you want to do? Does that point to having enhanced? Because this is not what you but what is written here on the slide. Okay, maybe now I understand what you mean. It's not what is written. Do we agree on that? Let me let me think for a moment. So it's a little more accurate, but it's certainly something that we're doing. I think I am right. I think you take the lambda isn't non-degenerate, then the orthogonal complement is kind of in mind, Yasha, is the following thing. Like you take a J that gives you a metric, and you take the orthogonal complement of the matrix. Of V with respect to this metric, which is given by the J. It depends on the J, though, right? No, but the J, and it's like you define admissible so that it preserves or I know because then you define admissible after you define this side, which is not yet defined. Okay, so there is something wrong there, but okay. So, are you saying we should be fixing a metric first and then? Should be fixing a metric first and then define just the orthogonal complement. Yeah, yes, zero. But okay, go on. Maybe we can fix this up. But I think yes, okay, I see. So okay, maybe I should look at my notes later. So perhaps I yeah, okay, so well, the example is supposed to be this one. So you have the This one. So you have the L Creation of C lambda. And in that case, the distribution should be the span of these two vectors. And the X C is just the contact distribution, basically lifted to M. Okay, and in that case, we can take an admission. An admissible j satisfying this property j of r s d theta, and that is very much similar to what you do for in the context of contact homology. Okay, so all right, so so one example of holomorphic curves for this. For this complex structure, this complex structure here, admissible complex structure. So if I have a repe orbit, then I can define a torus basically by this formula. So UO of S T is O S, T and this map is j holomorphic for J-holomorphic for a unique complex structure. So the complex structure is basically determined by this condition, where C is just, well, it's the velocity or the period of the raybar. Sorry, if I understand correctly, this is an almost complex structure. You don't know if it's really integrable or not. This is a torus. I'm talking about I'm talking about company structure on Taurus. Okay, so okay. Yeah. So yeah, so J so J here is meant to be fixed, the capital J is meant to be fixed, but for these maps to be J holomorphic, well, I have to vary the complex structure on the torus. Are are you in the are you in the like L C L Contact Manifold case there? Yes. So I'm I'm still in this example. So this is still about this example. Yeah. So okay, so this is the example. And right, so okay, so the complex structure is has to vary and this map UO I call a Reptorus, so it's a holomorphic curve. So it's a holomorphic curve. And so you get a map from the space of red orbits, modulo of S1 action, into moduli space of elliptic curves with a sort of charge. So charge basically is defined as follows. You pick a pair of generators, integral generators. Integral generators of homologic torus, and then you have this condition. So the pairing of alpha with eta is one, and the pairing of alpha with rho is zero. So alpha here, so alpha here is d theta. So here we go. So alpha is d theta. So because we Yeah. So because we so we're still in this example C times S1. Okay, and so lemma is that this is bijective so yeah so so every elliptic curve with charge one zero is Is what corresponds to a reptilus. Okay, so then this gives the following strategy for the proof of the theorem. So the virtual dimension of this moduli space is zero. So you want to compute the Gromov-Witten invariant, which sort of counts elements of this moduli space of elliptic curves. And this, so in principle, you can get an infinite answer. That's because we don't have any energy bounds. So you have to also make sense of this kind of extended drama of Witten invariant. And then, so after you compute this Drum of Witten invariant, you Wooden invariant, you conclude that a nearby LCS structure has J-coulom of elliptic curves. And then you apply the following theorem. So if you have a if the form alpha is rational, then every non-constant J-curve J-form of a curve from a closed even surface contains a red curve. Contains a red curve. Okay, and right, and so to prove this, basically we need the following lemma. So we have an exact L C S structure, J admissible. If you have a J holomorphic curve, Curve, then the image of the differential is an event distribution. And proof, okay, okay, that's what I'm supposed to say. So the proof. Okay, so we can do the proof, I guess. So we have zero. Sorry, can you go up again just for one minute? So I just want to read again the lemma. Okay, and the theorem. So if alpha is rational, then every non-constant j curve contains a red curve. Okay, thank you. Yes, okay, thank you. We may have lost him again. I I sorry we uh because of my question, you become muted again. Oh, he completely did he disconnected. Did he disconnect? Hello? Yes. No, I'm still here. Yes, we hear you. Yeah, yeah, we can. No, we hear you. Okay. Okay, so we can split this as so. This is basically Okay, basically, we'll have to partially write this. Basically, I want to split into the C and V components of the differential. And right, and and this this vanishes by well, because V is the vanishing distribution. V is the vanishing distribution, so dylam de vanishes there, and right, and this integral here so this integral will be positive if Because rational is very relative to your higher education. So this the projection of du onto C is non-zero. And that's because And that's because that's because U is J holomorphic since U is J holomorphic. And uh Thames and J Thames um Um uh sorry um D alamba tames J on on C um right, so that means that um For all P, this has to be zero, and so we get what we want. So the image of the differential has to be in the vanishing distribution. Okay. Okay, so first question is why is this theorem only a local result? Well, that's because this Gromo-Wutton theory can only be done locally because we have no energy bounds. Sorry, how do you get the orbit from the curve now? Did you say that? Oh, that's left up to your imagination. But basically, But basically, the idea is that the image of the differential is in the vanishing distribution. And then using the fact that alpha is rational, so here we have the alpha is rational condition, you can find some, you can find a curve so that Curve so that you can find a curve which is actually a red curve, so it's so it's tangent to this cone. So I mean we wait for the questions to show the question. Yeah, so okay, so the point is that the fact that du is an advantaging distribution. Fact that du is an advantaging distribution already gives us a kind of pseudo-rep curve because so it's so you just you have so it tells you that like any curve you draw is tangent to v but then you have this positivity right yeah yeah so and so you have to use you so you have to get this extra geometric condition and you you so basically the fact that alpha is rational you just construct a Is rational, you just construct a vibration over the circle, so the vibration determined by alpha, and then the fiber, a regular fiber of that, is going to be a red curve. So that's I mean, uh there might be a little bit more to say about that. Okay, okay, let's see if I understand. So you say that alpha is the pullback of GGTA by your map to S one. Back of Gigita biomap to S1. I restrict this map to the holomorphic curves and I look for a regular value of that map and you tell me that. Yes. Okay. Okay. So then I will make the computer. Okay, we'll make the computation. Yes. Okay. All right. So okay, so as I was saying, this theorem one is only a local result because there is no energy bounds, and because there is no energy bound, we can have Because there is no energy balance, we can have something called a sky catastrophe. And what this is, so here this axis is the L2 energy, this is time, sort of the deformation parameter, and points on this curve represent elliptic curves, JT elliptic curves. JT elliptic curves. And well, what happens is the energy can explode, the L2 energy can explode as you approach some finite T1. So this kind of phenomenon is known to exist in dynamical systems. It is an open problem if this can exist for holomorphic curves. So even in just plus So so even in just plain, almost complex setting, at least it's it's open to me, I should say. But so there's a lot of experts here on holomorphic curves, so perhaps they can add something. So an elementary version of the problem, so let's take the elcification of the standard contact form and that's three. Of the standard contact form on S3, lambda t deformation through contact forms. And the question is, can we find such a family lambda t so that there's a continuous family of curves? So these are curves which are lambda t rev orbits. Okay, so t is this parameter in 0, 1. one so we just we're just drawing a curve through the through kind of the moduli space of orbits um you know lambda seraph orbits okay and so that the per so that the period goes to infinity as ss goes to infinity so here's a picture so you have a period here time here and you have a curve And so at each so each point on the curve represents a lambda t lambda t rep orbit. And well, you have some kind of explosion going on as you go to one. And so there is a reason I drew these zigzags here. So these zigzags are actually necessary. Well, small calculation with variational calculus tells us that you cannot just smoothly explode to infinity like this. This is impossible. So what you have to have, so if you have, oh yeah, so I guess I forgot to say, this is called the blue sky catastrophe. Catastrophe. So, this kind of thing was originally discovered by Fuller for dynamical systems. The name blue sky catastrophe is more recent. Yeah, but anyway, so if you have so if you have a blue sky catastrophe For red curves. So, if you have a blue-sky catastrophe for red curves, then you have to have this condition. So, the projection to the time parameter, the length of the projection to the time parameter has to be infinity. So, basically, it means you have to zigzag. So, this, so I should say this is. So this so I should say this is for rev curves. This is for rev curves. So in general, in general, you don't, you know, in general, you could have a smooth explosion like this. Okay. So does a RapScite catastrophe exist? And for Catastrophe exists, and well, my conjecture is that at least they are not C0 stable. And so this would be actually enough for some applications, like with this conformance of the Weinstein conjecture. So, anyway, so if you want to have a more robust approach, we should develop We should develop an LCS homology theory. So, this is something I am discussing with all. So, basically, you want an analog of contact homology for LCS manifolds. And so, at the moment, closed exact LCS manifolds. For non-exact, I think I have zero ideas. Zero ideas. So the generators, so one idea for generators is that they're elliptic curves for admissible J. Okay. And instantons. Sorry? Did you say something? So and instantons are finite energy holomorphic cylinders. Holomorphic cylinders basically, as usual, energy has to be so. This is like Hofer energy, and this is something that all might talk about tomorrow. But anyway, the idea is that finite energy forces cylinders to wrap around elliptic curves. So you have a, so I have my cylinder in my closed exact L C S manifold. Manifold and holomorphic cylinder, right? And the finite energy condition forces them to wrap around elliptic curves at the ends. And how much time do I have? Sorry. We have another probably ten minutes or so. Okay. All right. Yes. Okay. All right. Yeah. So so why must you approach this? Okay, I know it's just an idea or whatever. So what is the non-degenerate definition? You know, like this similar to non degenerate non degenerate form. It should be something on this elliptic curve, right? You should have a condition that tells you that they are isolated. condition that tells you that they are isolated and yeah that's right well so so remember actually uh as i said the virtual dimension of uh the virtual dimension is zero yes and uh yeah and uh so uh yeah so in principle you're you know you want uh some kind of non-degeneracy of of the you know Of the moduli space. So regularity. And so I mean, the picture you should have in your mind is like, so the rep orbits correspond to reap tori. And this is actually something I'm going to say. If a rib orbit is non-degenerate, then the corresponding reptorus is a regular curve, is a regular holomorphic curve. But if instead of just taking But if instead of just taking the trivial L Cificification, I take, you know, the suspension of a protactomorphism, of a strict protactomorphism. I think Giovanni is going to speak about that right after. So you have again something where this V is of dimension two everywhere. And so do you know what are the this reptile in that situation? Oh, that's a good question. I actually haven't thought about that. Yeah, I think that might be like the first example one should study. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay, so let me skip this because this is somewhat conjectural. So I wanted to say a bit about the computation of the Gromov-Witten invariant. So the setting, remember, is you have the L CSV of the standard contact form on S2K plus 1. And so the picture for the moduli space that you're looking for is something like this. So the left, the y-axis is the L2 energy. Axis is the L2 energy, and then you have a deformation of the almost complex structure. And the x-axis measures the C3 distance of the deformed LCS structure to omega 0. So the form you start with. And okay, so the moduli space At parameter zero, so it's just all it consists of reptori, so they're all reptori, and basically you so and so you they all correspond to rep orbits, and so you have connected components which are basically just all CPK, all diffeomorphic to CPK. So this To CPK. So, this I should say this is a diffeomorphism. So, these are the connected components with discrete energy levels. And what you want is you want to find a cutoff parameter. Find a cutoff parameter T0 so that these components don't interact Well, don't interact in this region. So there's no interaction here. So they can interact outside this cutoff region, but here they don't interact. Okay, so if you can do this, then basically you can define your Gromov-Wutton theory. So it's kind of local Gromov-Wutton theory. So in that case, So, in that case, the regularized count of elements of this moduli space of elliptic curves makes sense. And so, this gives us kind of a formal infinite sum of rational numbers. Okay, and basically, all you have to do. Basically, all you have to do is compute the Gromov-Wutton invariant contribution of a particular component. So, n here is one of the nth components. So, remember we have these components which are diffeomorphic to CPK. Okay, so we just have to compute. Okay, so so we just have to compute that and my computer is now really slow. Okay, and so to do this you you relate this Gromov-Witten invariant to the Fuller index, which is a kind of fancy fixed-point index for orbits. And as I mentioned before, so the orientation of a rep torus is determined by so this is the this is the orientation, this is the determinant line bundle orientation, so determination, the orientation of an element of the moduli space and it's given in terms of the concept. And it's given in terms of the Connie Zender index. And if all is in a degenerate rev orbit, then this curve is irregular first. And yeah, so and that's right, that's that's basically that's That's basically the story, except that you still need a virtual moduli cycle. So, although we have this nice result that an undegenerated rep orbit gives us a regular curve, we still need virtual moduli cycle because of period doubling. So, let me just quickly draw this picture. So, the kind of period doubling bifurcation, you have you have kind of you have doubly covered doubly covered curve curves here doubly covered and here simply covered Okay, so I don't know if people are familiar with the period doubling, but so the usual kind of period doubling bifurcation for orbits of dynamical systems can appear for our elliptic curves. elliptic curves and and this is and this is C infinity stable C infinity stable okay so here here I have a deformation parameter and here I have And here I have much so holomorphic so space of holomorphic curves should say yeah yeah okay so yeah okay so actually I don't know let's put this what is the I mean it's it's nothing I guess okay let me let me not put this okay um It's just, I guess, it's just the ambient space, I guess. And then you have, so points represent elliptic curves. And right, so because this is a C-infinity stable phenomenon, we cannot regularize by geometric perturbation. So we need So, we need virtual modules article to regularize. And okay, that's, I think, all I wanted to say.
