is in fact very essential for the system to work and which also means that the quantum correction has to be time dependent. You will find that without time dependent the system actually doesn't have any solution. I also not assume any swampland criteria. I will show you that maybe this criteria can come out from a generic consideration. So my aim would be to actually show you that some of the swampland criteria and all may emerge from this kind of analysis. All right. Alright, so how to realize decita space in string landscape? Let us first consider a metric of this particular kind. You may have already recognized this. This is one in the flat slicing. I will not talk about static patch because there are a lot of issues with the static patch which I don't want to get into. So it will be flat slicing or any slicing that related to time. And in flat splicing, you know that the time goes from minus infinity to zero. Time goes from minus infinity to 0, so it's in the opposite direction. That's a flat slicing. That means the late time is given by t going to 0. That's the late time limit. Now, how do we realize such a metric in string theory? One of the simple answer would be that take the metric in four dimension like that and put some internal space with a metric along that direction. Unfortunately, it turns out that this is actually does not work. I would have. I really won't have time, much time to discuss that. But what really works is a metric of this kind with some time dependence in the internal space. So, this is some internal space, this is some 4 direction, this is the remaining 2 direction, this 4 plus 2, 6 plus 4, 10. So, it's a 10 dimensional construction and so for that to be string theory. So, that's the way we divide. The space is divided into 4.6, these are the coordinates of 4 and 6. 4 and 6. And these, these time-dependent factors that I talk about has to satisfy this condition so that the Newton constant remains time-independent in our four-dimensional. Our aim would be to show that this is a solution in string theory and then we'll realize this as a state in the theory, not as a vacuum solution, but some kind of state in the theory. Now, two questions arise: why do you want to realize it as a current state? Why do you want to realize it as a coherent state? And how can we realize it as a coherent state in string theory? Now, one question: In what sense do you oppose like coherent state from vacuum? Because a vacuum sometimes such a configuration as a in string theory or as a coherent state or some related state like that, we need Some related state like that, we need exactly time-dependent degrees of freedom, otherwise, such a configuration has no effective field theory description. I will show you why this is the case. Again, I will not assume any of the Swamp Land criteria. I'll show you that this can naturally arrive from string theory. Since there is no free vacuum in string theory, if you want to create such a state, you have to take an interacting vacuum. And this interacting vacuum has to be shifted by some displacement operator. Be shifted by some displacement operator, and it turns out it provides an easy answer to some of the very hard questions. Now, we have raised too many questions. Why time-dependent degrees of freedom? Why coordinate state? Why not a vacuum? Just ask this question. My question was that the vacuum is sometimes a coherent state. I don't understand why there is a difference between coherence states. So, by coherent state, I mean that vacuum. So by correlation I mean that uh vacuum shifted by a displacement operator. Yeah, but the vacuum could be the displacement of another state by a displacement operator. It could be it could be but in this case I'll specifically choose Minkowski as my vacuum and then I'll shift that Minkowski some excitation over Minkowski and shift it like that. Sorry I didn't quite understand what you're asking. Why interacting vacuum instead of free vacuum and so on and so forth. So to see this let us So, to see this, let us try to see how to realize this in string theory and we will lift it up to M theory where the configuration takes this particular form. So, let me explain what are the stuff over here. So, this one is the space direction that you have. This is the G string, which is a type 2A coupling. Note that the type 2A coupling is time-dependent. It has depend upon this factor. Lambda is the cosmological constant, some more factors. Logical constant, some war factors. So, it's proportional to time. These are the internal direction that we saw in the type 2p case, and this is the 11th and direction, torrent and direction along the 11th direction. And you see that all the information of the time has gone in the definition of GS. That's the thing. So, T is actually, you can invert it T, T, you can write it in terms of GS. So, whenever you have attached to a G string, standard by it. So, that's the configuration. Now we have already started so now more complicated stuff is that the fluxes that control the system are also time dependent. These time dependent system should solve some equation of motion. Question is what kind of equation of motor motion and as we showed in our 2014 paper, no classical sources can solve this system and Heludson will also tell us that in our next talk, Helutson will that in our next talk Ellison will tell that how a classical how no go theorem actually rules out all possible classical sources that can give rise to above background so that means we all the classical sources that you know and love for example fluxes drain orientifolds or any mixture of these things are completely redheading in the problem okay so question is how to realize such a background So, to realize the background, one thing you should note that we are, of course, taking flat slicing over here. The theory is at late time, you can easily see that the theory is weakly coupled because the late time is t going to 0. The theory becomes weakly coupled at late time. Although the coupling is changing with respect to time, and we can note that the weak coupling is maintained between this interval. The system remains weakly coupled between this interval. This interval, and many of you may recognize this. This is exactly the transplant kin limit that Robert was talking about. It comes very naturally from our construction that this is the regime and the system we will switch up. Okay, this is also the boundary we talked about. Now, let's see how we can solve this. So, what we want to solve is this equation of this particular form: Rmn minus half GmnR equal to the energy momentum tensor. Energy momentum tensor. So, what are the energy momentum tensor? We have a classical piece which is made up of flux, brains, anti-brains, opens, and all. And then there is a quantum piece which is made up of all perturbative correction, non-perturbative correction, non-local correction, topological corrections. The question is that if we plug all of these things, can we solve the system? And according to the logo theorem, this is completely a red heading in the problem. There have been papers. There have been papers showing that orientable planes can actually solve the system, but that's all we showed. That doesn't work. None of this ingredients can ever solve an equation of this form if you demand a kind of background that you want. Alright, so there is also another issue which actually results in the thing is that the system in principle. The system. In principle, we also want Wilsonian effective action to be defined in the system, but it's not clear to us that Wilsonian effective action can be defined. So we'll come back to this issue if I have some time. One of the simple reasons why Wilsonian effective action might be a problem is because if you take a D-Ceter vacuum and you study fluctuation on top of that vacuum, then the frequencies are changing with respect to time. Frequencies are changing with respect to time. When frequencies are changing with respect to time, you cannot integrate out the high energy modes and write an effective action at low energy. Because if you start integrating out the high energy mode, after some time these high energy modes will become low energy, so there is no meaning of integrating out high energy mode. So these simple aspects of Wilsonian effective action does not actually work in this kind of setup. So that's a subtle aspect. All of these come under the package called the Trustmanthian problem. I would say that that's not an instruction effective theory at all. I'm not saying that it doesn't rule out effective theory. I'm just saying that integrating out procedure cannot be done in the usual way. But I would interpret those words to mean that you can't integrate effective theory, but then it gets false. Maybe I'll come back to, I'll answer your question. So let's see. How do we actually try to solve this problem? So we actually don't know what are the perturbative correction. Perturbative correction to a quantum to a system like that. So, we'll take all possible perturbative corrections into account and maybe they can sum up into some kind of trans series and all this thing. But again, I'll not have time to talk about the summation procedure. So, let us take a simple example that we take a perturbative interaction of this particular form. So, here is I take an exhaustive list of all possible curvatures. List of all possible curvature, all possible fluxes, raised to the power of arbitrary power, arbitrary number of derivatives, and put it on the right-hand side of the Einstein's equation and try to see whether we can solve it or not. It looks like an impossible problem to solve, but after one and a half year of work, we finally managed to solve that system. Okay, so I just showed you some conservative thing. I worked with Hellutson with hundreds more term were there. Eventually managed to solve that system. So this is the most generic perturbative. So, this is the most generic perturbative correction you can think, you can add to that. Now, note that summing over all possible this here is all possible derivative. Note that there are some fluxes called Gmn AB, alpha beta AB and so on and so forth. Let me just point out the coordinate. Small mn are these four-dimensional base, alpha beta is the two-dimensional base, and AB is the 11-dimensional torus. Just remember these three and remember that. 3 and remember that M and A B, alpha beta AB, these come with L36, 37, 38 powers. Can rest are all kind of curvature raised to the power of you see arbitrary number of derivatives and so that's the most generic configuration. So what about the energy momentum tensor for that system? You just take the derivative with respect to the metric and you ask what is the energy momentum tensor. What is the metric unsurge? So that's my metric answer. Concept, so that's my metric concept again. Alpha beta is that two-dimensional mn is four-dimensional, this is the 11-dimensional torus. Note something that I have isolated all the time in the GS. This I could also write it in terms of GS, but GS is the type IIA coupling which has all the time sitting inside it. What are the flux? You need to put fluxes. Okay, here are the three possibilities. These are the possible fluxes written in terms of space and time. Of space and time is the spatial part, this is the time part. K equal to 0 means that it's time independent, and k greater than 0 is time dependent because they all be function of G. And Mn is going from M2 and M4. This one kind of flux. This is a second category of fluxes, which is with two legs along the toroidal direction. They are always written in this particular form. Note that it's some kind of gauge field times, say, compact two-form. You cannot write it in this particular form because of some quality reason. Because of some quality reason, and third kind of fluxes which has legs along the space direction, space-time direction, and that takes this particular form. So, that's the kind of fluxes. It turns out that these are the only exhausted list of fluxes that can actually solve the system. Alright, how do I solve it? Of course, you have to take F1, F2 again, as I told you has to be a function of this thing. But I also have to make sure that the Newton constant remains time independent, and that's the condition in which the coordinational Newton constant remains time independent. Constant remains time independent. And because that I have not used any Swampland criteria or anything like that, I'm just trying to solve a simple system in quantum field theory, especially in quantum gravity, and try to see whether a solution can come out from this analysis. Alright. What is the strategy to solve such a system? So, you work and make your student work for some time and then One strategy, we figured out that since G is a time-dependent factor, all I have to see is to compare powers of G string on both sides. That would be a strategy to solve that system. As I said, everything is written in terms of GS and so on and so forth. Even the G-fluxes have GS expansion, so all I need to do is to compare the GS expansion on both the side and try to see whether I can solve that system or not. What about the quantum terms with all these hundreds of different terms? Do they have a nice GS expansion? That was our first miracle that happened. You can work it out yourself. Say one of the very pleasant surprise you can get from that system. Take this huge, humongous amount of term, calculate the G S expansion of this thing. You can show that the Gs expansion takes this particular form. This whole quantum term scales in this particular way, Gs to the power of theta, where theta. Gs to the power of theta, where theta take this particular value. Remember 36, 37, 38, all these factors. All the curvature term scales as two-thirds of Gs. That's a miraculous thing. You can check it again. No matter what curvature term you take, you'll always scale as two-thirds of GS. Gs being the type to a coupling. Here are the fluxes and all this thing. Note that these are these localized fluxes, they come with K. When K is 0, is the time-independent pieces. When K greater than 0 is the same. pieces when k greater than 0 is the time dependent pieces and k is the power of g okay l1 to 27 are the powers of the 27 curvature terms so these are the and rest are these are the derivatives and note something interesting there are some relative minus signs here so there is minus this there is a minus and mostly plus and so on and so forth And so on and so forth. These are the derivatives and so on. Now, what goes wrong if we take time-independent fluxes? Imagine I try to solve this system with time-independent fluxes. So, that means I take k equal to 0. This gives us this vector, factor I put k equal to 0. So, you see theta kl becomes some stuff minus some another stuff. So, you can write this s minus s prime. minus s prime. The time independent pieces is stuff minus tuff prime. Well that's not a good sign. Of course no pun is intended. Why? Because if you look at the Einstein thing the Einstein action Rmn minus Rgmn scales in this particular way. The classical piece which is all the red herring in the problem scales as Gs to the power of times some function of this. The quantum pieces no matter how complicated it is scales as Gs to the power of Scales a G to the power of stuff minus stuff time plus all the non-perturbative non-local and everything scales a G string to the power of something minus something in the presence of in the absence of time Now you can easily see what's going on We have lost the GS hierarchy the reason is simple Let me give you an example imagine I want to compare this equation the GS scaling of that let's take theta E and theta F to be equal to 8 for simplicity and so Syntheticity and stuff and stuff prime B equal to A and B. Then I have an equation A minus B equal to 8, which has an infinite number of solutions. Showing that there are no finite quantum corrections that can actually solve the system. There are infinite number of operators with the same G scaling on the right-hand side of our instance equation. So the system does not have any G stream hierarchy at all. You can check this, it will come as a bad surprise to you, but you can check this. At this, this is a clear sign of the breakage of G-string hierarchy. The system does not have a G-string hierarchy, means there is no simple effectivity description. But then you may ask, all of this operator which comes with different G-string has a different power of M-planck. Maybe I can use M-planck hierarchy to actually kill some of these G-string and keep the system under control. It turns out that that cannot happen in the system. The reason is. Cannot happen in the system. The reason is because, remember those fluxes, the localized fluxes over here, GMNAB. The localized fluxes actually turned out to scale secretly, has a secret M-plant power in front of. These localized fluxes are secretly, they have M-plant sitting inside them. And remember the quantum term has lots of derivatives in it. So when you hit this e to the power of minus M Planck square, and if you hit it by a derivative, you bring out M Planck, and you have lost both G string and M Planck hierarchy. You have lost both G-string and M plan hierarchy, so the system has no solution. You see, you have lost neither G-string nor M plan hierarchy, the system has absolutely no solution. Thus killing both. You can check it any way if you like. Read our paper or sit down and work it out. You'll find a very bad surprise. This means that there is no simple effective filter description in four-dimensional medicine isometry in the absence of. In the absence of time-independent fluxes. The system identified the non-protective, they have even worse situation, non-productivity, non-local and all. Nothing can say that these backgrounds are truly in the swampland. So, Wafa was not wrong when he said that these backgrounds are in the swampland. We never used any swampland criteria, we did hit upon the swampland, considering that the system has. Considering that the system has no solution, it's without a look. You cannot control the system, I'll tell you, because e to the power of minus 1 by G string will not be controlled. It could be that there is such a solution. Yeah. No, no, resurgence doesn't solve. Resurgence of oral summary will not solve. They sum up again into some. I don't have time to discuss this thing. You can check it for yourself. Check it for yourself, but that's not the end of the story. If you take k greater than 1, you get a plus b equal to 8, which is a finite number of solutions, showing that the system in the presence of time-dependent fluxes and all can have a solution in the system. And since once you have a time-dependent fluxes and all, we can realize this as a coherent state. I don't think I'll have time too much, but let me tell you. Too much, but let me tell you what we can do. Supersymmetry is broken by the coherent state because the zero-point energy is canceled in this system. The cosmological constant in that system, although the supersymmetry is broken, the vacuum remains supersymmetric and the cosmological constant appears from the fluxes and the quantum term with no contribution from the zero-point energies. Wilsonian analysis can also be performed because the modes that we are talking about. Because the modes that we are talking about are modes of the time independent Minkowski background. So that's why I'm not worried about those modes at all because we are not studying it as a fluctuation. We are realizing the previous solution as a coherent state over Minkowski background. So the Wilsonian effective action can be done over here. That means TCC no longer poses any issues. Encouraging, but we cannot declare victory. But we cannot declare victory, go home, take off masks, take a shower because there are more hard problems there. The hard problems are that although we have controlled some of the quantum correction, there are other issues that we did not talk about. The issues are the following. For example, the action at a finite value actually is a little more complicated. Anyway, I will not go into that thing. But let me point out the issue. We have to show how. Ratio. We have to show how the system is quantum mechanically stable, how the fluxes, since the time-dependent fluxes are necessary, how the fluxes remain quantized with time dependence, how anomaly cancellation works, how Baus law is satisfied, how modular stabilization works, how noble theorems are satisfied, how the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are overcome, how perturbative correction, non-perturbative correction, non-local correction, and all these how. And all this, how Newton constant, study the renormalization of the Newton constant, and so on and so forth. All of these problems appears, how By Ankey identities are satisfied, and so on and so forth. So, that combination of these two makes it a very hard problem since we cannot get rid of the time dependence. Now, all of these questions have to be answered, and that's why a vacuum solution is not a good idea. We have to study it as a solution, as an excited state of atomic loss. As an excited state of atomic losski pandrom. And because of this reason, because of other reason, like Wilsonian integration cannot be done, supersymmetry can create, breaking of supersymmetry can create zero modes in the problem, not zero modes, non-renormalizable zero modes in the problem. Plus, all of these issues suggest us that the only possible way by which the system can have a By which the system can have a decisive solution with string theory is as a correlant state over superscent union constant diagram. There appears to be no other way by which the system can be under control and that's all the equation of motion in this language appears as Schwinger-Dyson equation and so on and so forth. You can stabilize the bottle light dynamically in that system when in the presence of current states there appears to There appears to be no problem with TCC. Wilsonian effective action can be written down. So, as of today, it appears to us that we are still living in a disseter space, but more like inside a COVID state. See, you would not have seen any of this problem if you did not take it exhaustively. If you have chosen, see, when I looked into the other paper after we did that, I found that many only a selective number of quantum terms are taken. That's why you. Quantum terms are taken, that's why you don't see this problem. Take all quantum terms, then you will see the problem. If the system is very subtle, very complicated, and Lafa, although he made an ad hoc list of Swamplam criteria, he is not wrong. I think in my opinion, he is not wrong. It was presented in a way that some ad hoc ideas were presented, but at the core of the subject, the system is highly delicate, highly complicated, and Highly complicated, and there is no solution. The only way the solution could exist is probably. Maybe we are wrong somewhere, maybe even this doesn't exist. If this doesn't exist, there is no VCA solution in the system. Finally, how we stopped worrying and started liking the time-dependent background. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Teacher, for in Max Poke. Are you in question? Yeah, so the M2 and M4, are the geometries important and what are they? They are non-Killer geometry, not necessary K3, but no Calabio appears, they are non-Killer, non-complex. Not necessary. But their geometrical structure, we could not solve those equations. But we know that they are not KL and neither complex. So the founder is explained to the state of the Minkowski means that the The state of the Minkowski means that at infinity you have the Minkowski one that you can kind of local absolutely. So, what is the time scale for you to minus 1 over lambda between t going from minus 1 over lambda to 0? And surprisingly, after we wrote this paper, we found that Diwali and people, Gia Diwali, also came to the same conclusion. And they found that this coherent state, they used a different technique. The coherent state only survives between that. The correct state only survives between that limit minus 1 over lambda and 0. Lambda being the cosmological constant, showing that it's only between that region. Yes, it is exactly the quantum break time. We got it by imposing that the type IIS string coupling is smaller than 1. They impose by using calculation, we got exactly the same answer. And then Robert Brandenburger came and told me he's also getting his answer from Transplant Stain. But we never Transplanckian constraint. But we never used any of Transplanckian thing. We just asked what can only be nesting theory give us. That is what our conclusion is. There is no solution in that system. Yes. I kind of lost the thread of the argument at some point. But in the end of the day, have your solution to the equations you solve in your Einstein's equations? They're almost like Einstein's equation, they are the Schrodinger-Dyson equations. So they look like R mu nu minus half G mu nu, but this is an expectation value of R mu nu minus half Hu. But at the end of the day though, there's usually an issue of control parameter. And so what's the control parameter that you and at various times you said that the string coupling wasn't small and that the pure rubber kind of wasn't working. But I wasn't sure if that was a blind. T S is the control parameter between minus one over lambda and T. So it's a it's a term of string theory and it's Curve string theory. Do you have a long approximation? Yes. So we have this G smaller than 1, and then we can control each power of minus 1 over G string correction in the system. That's called G string here. Do you have a one-way line approximation? We only have these two approximations. So that means that you really are not. So when you said you're not in an effective field for limit, you meant it. And it says that all the string modes are... That sense that all the string modes are all the string modes are there, but we are low energy. Only thing we are taking is that low energy. Well, low energy, so that's the that sounds like that's low wavelength. Sorry, long. Did you say long wavelength? Yeah. Yes, low, low energy in the Minkowski side. So we are taking that the system is so if this is the cutoff lambda, this is M Planck. So this is the scale at which the system is work. I mean, we integrate out all the modes over here and we write. Get out all the modes over here, and we write this also, all the quantum term we wrote over these two conditions are maintained. So that at the end of the day, you're using some type of A or Type 2B or something, effective theory in that regime. Yes. And you're solving those situations. Yes. And we don't have to worry about higher mode interfering because it's all tango over him in cost. Because it's all tango over him in costly bedroom. So hence. I was worried about that for stage-based either. So your control, you really are relying on the effective description to control the system. Yes, yes. And there exists there in this setup. And there is a desiter as a. So we have at least shown that the cosmological constant can be found. For example, if I want to calculate the metric, I will do g mu nu on this coherent state over here and write this as a path integral. Uh e to the power of minus s and then I write it as d dagger g g dagger something like that and I do this path integral and I try to calculate it and when I do a path integral calculation I get a perturbative series and what we find is that perturbative we don't even have to use any non-perturbative correction only the perturbative thing we can put it in this action and when I calculate I get a perturbative series And when I calculate, I get a perturbative series, and the perturbative series diverges because of the asymptotic nature. So, hence, automatically Borel resumation of this die will produce this correction in the system. They are playing a role by controlling the perturbative series. So, in the end, those perturbative corrections was enough for us because you can easily see that this series will. Series will be asymptotic, it will diverge, and therefore we have to resum this thing as a Borel resumation. When we resum the whole thing as a Borel resumation, we get a closed form expression for this G mu mu and that for specific choice of this displacement operator, we could get the decision. This is probably something we should be talking about line or something, but it sounds like if I've understood your criteria, if you have a series in G string, and you're not calculating the whole series, you're kind of calculating it. You're current topic. No, I'm calculating the whole perturbative series. Well, you're not really, but then you have a resumation argument which you think captures that. Captures all the non-perturbative things. And then you're balancing it against an exponentially small thing. That's right. And the control parameter for that whole story is the smallness of G string. That's right. And that's automatically built in because we took G string greater than or equal to minus 1 over root lambda less than sorry t going to this less than 0. So in this particular Less than 0. So in this particular limit, G string becomes, and as T goes to 0, which is later, G string becomes much, much smaller than 1. So it is a nice control parameter in the system. This is the type of exotic. How is that our fire answer? Okay, let's run. Our next speaker is Ted Saw Avalon.
