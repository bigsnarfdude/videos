Okay, well done. Okay, thanks again. Okay, so the introduction for inviting me here for this meeting that I'm greatly enjoying. Okay, so what I'd like to present together is, I think I hope a couple of this work. Into the goal of this workshop. So it's joint work with my former student, joint with Adrian Huffman, Halifaz Mohamedi, and with the Arik Sanen. Okay, and so let me introduce the question we would like to address. So we want to consider a setting of a Lorentzian metric, a general Lorentzian metric, on a domain, let's say, which is B3 for the purposes of discussion. B3 for the purposes of discussion, cross R. So living on this, and a Lorentzian metric, which is a general n plus one metric. It is not assumed to be time static or anything like that, a time-dependent learning metric. And we want to assume, we want to study on this bulk the problem of waves. Solving equations of this type, box plus some potential, zero. Okay, and we want to consider waves which start at rest and which are excited by data that we prescribe on the boundary. Okay, so we start with phi eight phi identity zero at some time t equals very very negative some far apart way and then Part way, and then we decide to find we prescribe the original detail of manifold as manifold element as well. Okay, so we would like to study waves like that. So, we're usually start at rest and we prescribe their boundary data, and what we get to measure. And what we get to measure is again the data at the boundary, only this time the normal data. So we measure for any such source, such frequency that we've described, we can measure the Neumann data again at the bottom. Such measurements for the data. Such measurements, for knowledge of such how such rays behave, we would like to reconstruct the operator. Okay, so this is the broad question that I would like to address today. We're dealing with manifolds which are spatially compact. One expects you could generalize this to formally compact manifolds, for example ADS. And as we'll see, we'll be considering manifolds which do not contain black holes for the purposes of this lecture today. This lecture today. This is the broad question in which we're interested. Okay, so from knowledge of the map, so lambda, which inputs F and puts the normal derivative of the solution find the operator, the operator L. We will not address this question in fullness today. We'll do a simpler version. And the simpler version is when the metric G is known to us. What is unknown is the potential. The potential depends on space and time. Okay, so for today, the metric G And the potential is unknown, and we'll try and find it from knowledge of this. So, this is a linear operator, and we're trying to reconstruct the potential of a linear operator for knowledge of how it treats the waves that we send it from the back. About. You could maybe in the discussion you could transition from results like this: the results of finding perturbations of space-time metrics that are based on equations of motion, perhaps, when you know you start at a background state and you're trying to find perturbations. That will not be my focus of the lecture. That's direction one could take once one establishes results. Okay, so So let me start by recalling that this problem has been studied and successfully solved in certain special cases and very classical by now literature. So one that it works solved is when G is static and the potential does not depend on time. This problem has then been solved and at least there we go now in good generality. Our interest here is when nothing is static, everything depends on time. So in particular to answer the question we can answer Particularly, to answer the question, we can answer even more precisely how much of this dirty tenomin map do I need to know to determine my potential? And exactly where, like, suppose I'm only interested in finding the potential around time equals zero, where would I need to know the derivatives in an map to achieve that? All right. So I'll present this result and I'll try to go even quite a bit to the proof today. Given quite a bit to the proof today. I want to start though by presenting a different question, a completely different question, which doesn't seem related, but in fact, it will be the main tool by which we will approach this problem. It's a related approach. Scaros, can I actually ask a quick question about your left board here, Herc? Yeah, sure. The measurements that you're able to make, are they at all space and time on the boundary, all X and T? That's a very good question. So for now, I'm going to say yes. So for now, let's say yes, but it was going to have only all of that. Okay. So related question the following. Suppose I have one solution of a wave equation, and I know both Dirichlet and Neumann data at some strip of the algorithm, at a point in the algorithm. Where does that determine my solution? So the unique unique continuation question. Suppose we have a solution like this, and let's say I measure, I know phi and dt phi, it's on dd. So it's on the caller neighborhood around the boundary, phi and sorry, d nu phi. Uh, sorry, denu phi know. Let's also say we know the operator. My question is: from this data and knowing the operator, pretending I know the operator, where can I reconstruct my solution? How deep inside can I reconstruct my solution? This is not the same question as that. They seem, okay, maybe the same category somehow, but they're unrelated questions in principle. But this will be the main tool of addressing that. So, let me start with this. So let me start with this. So let me change the kind of bit. So note where we decide. Okay. An equivalent question, this really seems to be a proof, is if these are not just known, but suppose they're actually identically zero. zero on this strip, this time x strip, then where must phi be zero? It's clear that the latter implies the former. Okay, so thought one, which we can all see, I think, very quickly, is that, well, let me consider this wedge. Let me consider this wedge that comes in from the upper boundary by considering a null surface that goes in. And let me consider a null surface that goes in from the lower boundary. They consider a null surface that goes in from the lower backer that goes out. They define a wedge like this. It's clear from domain of dependence that you could not hope to determine phi, phi zero, anywhere except inside this way, by domain of dependence. If you put a permission, then you will only register further. So it's clear you couldn't hope for more than this. You might expect that I can actually do this. I can actually prove that file is zero normal error. The final v zero nowhere is actually not true. So let me now geometric intuition. These questions have very much to do with null GD6 and the behavior of null GD6 in non-Lorenzymetrics. So let me consider, let me try to argue. Imagine a null GD6 that goes vertical to the board. And start at the lower tape here and cut straight through at the exit. Cut straight through and exit at the upper tip there. Okay, all right. So I can even imagine it leaves slightly below and exits slightly above. Now we all know you can construct solutions to wave equations which are very localized near an L G D sick. Well there's an L G D sick just a four weight of the region where we're measuring data. Okay, so you could very well convince yourself the solution that's very big along this GDSIC, but really small everywhere around in this. Everywhere around in this region, maybe you could even make it identically zero around here. So, this is the reason why you cannot beat such an LGD6, you can't go beyond such an LGD6. That's believable. All right, so it would seem that the best region you can vote for because of this example is the region where you can't apply this trick, a point where you can't draw such an old GDC that avoids. That avoids your data by shooting through the space that it would seem so. So, now to win some intuition, what would such a region look like in Minkosta? The region where you can do this trick? And the answer is it's smaller than the red, so it looks a bit like this. So it's more curved. And you imagine this curve which you rotate around towards McCosky, that would be the best region for you. It's going to keep you consistent. Okay. All right. So I'm not going to get great many theorems that describe this, but let me say the key thing you need. Okay. So the key thing to show that phi will be identically zero in some domain. In subdomains, omega inside the space-time is to, but to a mathematical record, is to foliate omega by some hypersurfaces which are convex with the spectral GD6 only. Right, um, now So the region that I drew, this best region that you can attain, is actually the union of lots of different surfaces that start from the boundary where I have data and extend into it. The property is. Their property is that if I take any point of these surfaces as I shoot a tangent null GD sig, it will land on the outside, it will go hit a portion of my cylinder where I have data. So the best surface that I can hope to attain is the ones that are foliated by such non-convex surfaces. So this is a very watered-down version of the result that essentially goes about 400 and the sixth. Okay. So, um, okay. It's worth asking, therefore, when can one obtain such foliations? It's a question one wants to ask. The second question is: what is the relation between what I wrote here and what I wrote there? Okay, so let me. So let me persist with question one. So it seems like if you take a short script, like of short height, you can only derive any solution to the wave equation. Boundary data determines the solution all the way up to here, all the way up to inside, okay, up to this first. If I took a very high strip, then it looks like I can pursue that, right? I can get zero everywhere because any LGBTQ event. Everywhere because any LGBTIP will eventually ship a very big split. What we study, and what our proofer lies on, is trying to get the optimal bound between these two scenarios, where you can only recover a portion of the inside and recover absolutely everything. So, okay. So the results. If I establish means, that means we'll say that phi is identically zero all the way in some hypersurface t equals zero up to one point all the way up to one so let me explain what I mean. So, let me explain what I mean. I would like to see so we would like to consider only points p inside m equals zero. So let's see here. Let's say this is my time equal to zero. Let me say I choose one point on this surface. And I'm trying to determine where I need to know the wave in order to reconstruct my wave all the way up to that point, but no more. So it seems very natural that the best, the place where you can measure data, the place where you should be. The place where you should be telling yourself to measure data is this very, very, very explicit set. Choose your favorite point p at time equals zero and choose the null cone which originates at that point. Okay, that cone intersects your boundary. There are no black holes, there's nothing like that here. So that cone intersects the boundary. Where you would want to put data is on this region, on this region that is cut out. By the malcone on our siphon. Okay, and then you can hope to establish that your solution is determined all the way up to that one point. Okay, so what we want is to establish that this result is true. That if you give me a wave operator and you give me the value of the solutions precisely this set, then that implies that I can determine the values of my solution all the way up to one point. All the way up to 1.2. The key condition we impose to derive a result is a geometric condition that ensures that this property is true. You might think it's always true. I severely doubt it. I severely doubt it's always true. You need some geometric condition. I need something about the null GD6 behaving nicely all the way uniformly up to this point. So I'm going to give you the condition we have in our paper. And I'm also going to announce a better condition that we haven't published yet, but we're really confident enough to present. Already we're confident enough to present. Okay, so we kind of think the unique technology draws like I'm drawing here under the following geometric condition. So, A, I'll give you the results from 2020. And B, I'll give you the results from this year. Let me sort of the results. The condition is a condition on curvature. It's not very surprising. You're trying to control the geometry and the convexity of null geodesics. The geometry and convexity of geodesics is seen by curvature. So it's not surprising to be the curvature condition. The condition, of course, involves Lorentzian metrics. So it's not. Lorentzian metrics. So it's not going to be something nice and clear-cut, at least the first result we could. But the following thing: a curvature: XY for any vector do like it, okay, should be less than or equal to k, some number of k, times times uh g x x g y times g x y. For some constant k. Okay. Moreover, if k is positive, then we need some uh some something on some condition on the diameter, some diameter to what cut points. At points, diameter, let me not define exactly what diameter means, but less than one over square root of k, more or less. Okay, and we also need for reasons that we believe are somehow technical, but we can't get away from it, is that the exponential map center that p is non-generate. Let me say a word about this condition. If you have equality for some k, choose any k, this is the space of constant curvature. If you have equality, it means constant curvature. So I'm allowing curvature positive, I'm allowing curvature negative, right? So ADS, for example, fits this picture, has constant curvature. Okay, yeah. Oh, book, that's healthy. So, okay. And that suffices for us to derive this uniqueness. For us to derive this uniqueness, and then by what I hope to sketch in the last five minutes, I'll show you how you go from uniqueness to actually construct it. Before I do that, let me also announce our next result, which is in some sense, null GD6 all that count, right? Like the key notion, the key property you need to have to derive extensions of this kind is the behavior of null GD6. So the full curvature is maybe overkill. What really counts on null GD6? So you should see curvature components that determine the geometry. Curvature components that determine the geometry of an altitude. So the condition we actually need is the curvature of x. For now, it's strictly negative. We can't completely get any case yet. Where n is a null vector and norm is perpendicular to So it's a very special curvature component. You input any null vector you want and any space like that's normal to the null. That's all that counts. Okay. Okay. So if you notice, for example, here, if you put n new and new, this right inside it's always zero. Okay. All right. So for now, this is quite conditioning. And we can do a small variant of this. It's still interesting to do metrics which don't quite have this curvature condition, but we can still. But we can still play some tricks and reduce its current conditions and it has we can also do metrics that are perturbations of the McCloskey metric. Also works for small perturbations so this is not sharp in the word small perturbation because can have curves between positive or negative right but we can see Curves going positive or negative right, but we can still catch that. So neither needs a super chart. Okay, so that allows us to extend up to time equals zero. Okay, so let me tell you morally now, I'm not going to give full details, but let me tell you morally why matters reduced to such a question. So if you know that there is a denominator max, so let's do why hope what will happen as result? Okay. Uniqueness, right? Implies the input problem. It's because knowledge of this, I mean, once the statement is true, you can determine one, essentially exactly one solution of the wave equation. Solution of the wave equation. Essentially, a fundamental solution. This allows you allows us to introduce one another solution. For time equals zero. And the fundamental solution is the one whose data at time equals zero is exactly a distribution, so part of that p equals zero. So the one where phi at t equals zero, the dt phi at t equals zero, gives that the delta function is the point. That initial data induces a solution which Initial data induces a solution which needs to be zero outside an all-common. Domain of the tendons, we know that if we find this precise financial data, then we will be zero outside an all-common. But it will be a distribution support precisely on the non-common. Allows us to identify this one solution. And you could believe me, if I find this one solution, a fundamental solution, maybe I can find all solutions. Solution, maybe I can find all solutions. And if I find all solutions, I'm pretty close to finding the potential. That's at the moral level. Okay, let me highlight a few points, which is not sure any bit more detail. You can't find one solution this way. You can find a whole class of solutions which are multiple for that. So any solution which lies in a suitable space, this initial data lies in precisely one space, the solvable space, H3. So I am allowed, by knowledge of my Diri Slate denominator map, I can identify the unique element that lies in this space, which will be zero, all the way in the exterior of the small cone. If it was a tiny bit more regular, then it would have to be identically zero. But I chose exactly this space so that it will be that it's allowed to lay this one more. It's allowed to lay this one more circular space. But what we find is not the, right? We actually find the whole class, right? All multiples of this solution. Okay, and let me highlight a tiny bit. I'm not going to give you the flow proof, but let me highlight how you go from knowing a solution that does this to reconstructing the space of all solutions. And I thought this might be of some interest here. You're interested in really reconstructing, not just abstract unique these theorems, but really reconstructing. These things, but we need to reconstruct them. Okay, so if I really know the geostrategic normal map, how do I use this one solution to find all others from the geodesic phenomenon map? So let me show that. That's an integration of path argument. So I'm going to show it. Thank you. Thank you. Solution solutions at P it's one point P, V, here's another method. So the key thing is the following. The key identity is the following. You want to take your operator and acting on some function. acting on some function okay multiply that by u okay and you can integrate let's say between those between time equals zero where we knew we had uh we had a trivial data and between time equals zero so you got some negative t up to t equals zero and all the space space of course this is zero right because this is a solution of the equation um now i can subtract Now I can subtract from this the same v analogous integral where I switch v and u. So false v times v. And now I can integrate by parts to go from one to the other and cancel the bulk terms that arise and I'll only pick up terms of the boundary. Okay, so I'll pick up a term at time equals negative t. At time equals negative t. I will pick up a term. Negative two. I will pick up a term at time equals zero. And I will pick out some terms at the time-like boundaries. So on time-like cylinder in between the terms I'll pick out in the time-like boundaries will be the digital Norman map applied to, let's see, V minus the digital map applied to U times V. Okay? These are things I know. So these are things I know. The term I get as n equals zero because these are solutions that serve trivial data, long and cover zero. And what I learned from I know these maps, what I learned here is the following expression, dtv times u minus dtu times v. Okay, and now if I've hooked up my v, if I've identified the unique v, which gives me this delta function, right, then function right then um this term will vanish and this term will give me dtp is a delta function that will be giving q at the time p so i can learn solutions right from all other injections i can learn what my solution does at p okay from this okay using this uniqueness okay and with some work which i'm completely handing out we can transform this into really identifying the type okay um Okay. Okay. I could say things which problems of interest one might try to get from here, but I think I'll be able to say it and I'll stop exactly on the spot. Okay. And then we can have a discussion. Okay. So thank you very much. So questions from the Brisbane audience? Quick question about the logic. So, this fundamental solution depends on V. Yes, of course. And the goal was to determine V. That's right. So I haven't shown you how you determine. No. That's what the rule of the interglaw, yes, right. That's right. That's right. So from here, we determine. It's not very easy because you don't know the one fundamental solution. One fundamental solution, you know, the whole class of multiples of these. Okay, so you can get what we've actually proven in the paper is a uniqueness result. If you have two V's that give the same, with the same data set on the map, you want to show the V's are the same. Okay. Okay, so it takes some work, which basically I have. I think it may be a little bit too technical to discuss. Other questions? So, in principle, what you've talked about today is about finding a V. But your original goal was also to find box G. I'm assuming I know G. Okay. Right. Which means I know the Malcolm. Sure, but I'm imagining now you don't know G. Yes, so that's quite a bit of a hunter question. That's quite a bit of a hunter because then you don't know the Malcolms. Bit of a harder because then you don't know the outcomes, and it's quite a bit harder. But there's a variant people do here, which is you could say I know g of the conformal factor, right? And then I want to determine the conformal factor. Let's say with v identity to zero. So that should be completely doable. Okay, but we haven't done it. That should be doable. But that's a good question. So you wrote that. Can you ask a question? So, you wrote down those sufficient curvature conditions to have uniqueness up to P. Yes. Do you know any sufficient conditions to not have uniqueness? Which is not quite as strong. Like, of course, the Gala-black bulb problem fails. Right. Yes. So we don't know counterexamples of the inverse problem. One can construct counterexamples to uniqueness. So our tool, the unique continuation, is a tool of the words solving the inverse problem. Tool of the words solving the inverse problem. I'm not saying it's the only tool, it's the only way to do it. I don't know. Okay, but there are examples, there are counterexamples to uniqueness. I can try to give the idea if you're interested. Okay, sure. So what is not, so if you don't, okay. So all the counterexamples are built on having a null GD6, which does not intersect the setting. Intersect your set where you're measuring data. So it's even a formal, you can get an approximate solution to the wave equation, which stays very local as any fraction whose energy stays along with non-G's. You can construct examples of box G plus V. This has been done in specific situations. It hasn't been done for every entry, but for specific, it has been done. It would be special. Where you can have your identity, which something you should do is identity. Zero, which is identically zero on this set, but the solution is not zero. Okay, but these are very special things, but they can be constructed. So that's how it goes. So maybe I should have said actually, maybe I didn't stress this enough. So the conditions we put, you could ask how do you construct your foliation? So the conditions you put are, our foliation is super explicit. It is the design function. Distance function. Okay, so take your point and look at the Lorentzian distance function. Look at space flag gv6 of constant distance from your from that point. Those hypersurfaces are not convex. That's what the curvature condition gives you. Okay. Maybe there are other, but basically these are the ones we do. And it's believable, right, that you have to recati equations even for states like QD6. And a certain sign of curvature will benefit you in terms of non-convexity. The terms of non-compact. Any other questions from the online audience or some questions?
