May, hello from June. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't believe what happens this morning. Okay, my name's Andrew White, I'm at the University of Queensland, and I'm a member of the Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems. You're getting to see me, but of course, there's a very talented group of PhD and master's students and postdocs who are in the lab making all of this wonderful stuff happen. And recently, we've had a bunch of postdoc. We've had a bunch of postdoc PhDs go off to postdocs, including in Canada, and postdocs go off to academia and industry again in Canada. And we've been working with some great collaborators in Europe and Australia. There's two papers I'm basically discussing today. The 2018 one was led by Kaumudi Goswami down in the bottom left as the experimental student. The lead PhD was Christina Giamazzi, but I need to single out Fabio Costa for his absolutely Fabio Costa for his absolutely patient explaining of why we misunderstood the physics. It took us a long time to get across it. And it was work with Jackie Romero as the lead postdoc. And then the 2020 paper was again Cal Moody and Jackie in the lab and working with Yakow and Gerardo Pasilva at Griffith University. So that's communicating via ignorance. What do I mean? Well, just say that the microphone I had here that I'm using to talk to you today was completely staticky and no information. Completely staticky and no information was coming through except white noise. Well, technically, it's all white noise, but anyway, you know what I mean. So, in desperation, I then grab another microphone and put it in series, but it's also completely staticky. So, all that means is after 20 minutes of talking, you know, you will all look like this. And it wouldn't matter if I'd done things in the opposite order. If I'd gone for the bottom microphone first that was completely terrible and used the top microphone, we'd still get the same result. The same result. But of course, there's this beautiful work by Kirabella and colleagues showing that if you now have a superposition of those two possible processes, then you end up with this stock photo of a happy, smiling audience, and you can send information through despite all the noise. The idea, and this reminds me of Feynman had this saying about never underestimate the pleasure an audience gets in hearing something that it already knows. So given all Hearing something that it already knows. So, given all the talks you've heard today, this is going to be a very pleasant talk. You have a control, which is shown here as the zero, acting on a target, which in this case is going to control the process, so it's process G, then process F. Or if the control is one, it acts on the target, so it's process F, then process G. And of course, when I'm in a superposition zero plus one, I'm in a superposition of those two processes, GF plus Fg. And of course, this is called indefinite causal. And of course, this is called indefinite causal order. You can think of it as strange, but of course, we'd like to, as physicists, instantly regard these things as useful and start finding out how they're useful. And the first work on that was by Philip Volter's group, who asked the question, are the operations FG commuting or anti-commuting? And built this beautiful experiment, which they published in Nature Communications, all the way back in 2015 now. This was a lovely paper, and it started a lot of discussion. For those of you not familiar with it, Discussion. For those of you not familiar with it, the important thing is shown at right, which is you have the control being provided by which path the photon takes through the circuit. And what you're acting on as the target is the polarization of the photon. And you're acting on with this combination of quarter, half, and quarter wave plates. We were very excited by this for a bunch of reasons, and we went off to and To, and the conclusion of the paper was it could allow quantum algorithms to be implemented with an efficiency unlikely to be achieved on a fixed-gate order quantum computer. We found that very thought-provoking. And we, in 2015, as some of you on the call will remember, there was a conference on the Sunshine Coast in Australia called Causality in a Quantum World, nice location. And it was an unusual conference for me, at least in that it was a mixture of philosophers, theoretical physicists, and just a couple of experimental physicists. Couple of experimental physicists. And one of the experimentalists presented this paper just in the discussion session. And we got a really strong reaction from the philosophers who said, hang on, we can put a line down through those wave plates there or through there. And you've got actually separate operations. It's not F and G, but F1 and F2 or G1 and G2. Someone else from the audience commented, and look, they could occur at different times. You've got well-localized photons in time, so you could get timing information. On some time, so we could get timing information. And one philosopher who I shall not name said very sarcastically, Well, congratulations, you physicists have made AB plus C D. So my group got a little annoyed by that. So we decided we'd do a version of the experiment where you could answer all of these philosophers' objections. And just spoiler, you can never answer all of a philosopher's objection. So don't ever do an experiment for that reason. But what we chose to do was now we have the controllers. Was now we have the control as the polarization of the light field, and we act now on the transverse spatial mode as the target. And we also used photons with a very long coherence length, much longer in fact than the length of the experiment the light was going through. So they were never localized to any one point within the experiment with any high accuracy. Let's talk about those spatial modes that we're using as the target. Some of you may remember from undergraduate optics that you can have these Hermite. You can have these Hermite Gauss modes, and they're characterized by a dark stripe through the mode. And in the same way that polarization is the kind of locus of the electric field, it's the average path it traces out over many wavelengths or a wavelength, this dark stripe is the locus of the phase discontinuity in the wavefront as it propagates forward. Now, that can be a rectangular symmetry, it can be a cylindrical symmetry, and each of those families, the Hermite Gauss, Laguerre Gauss, The Hermite Gauss, Laguerre Gauss, are infinite, and each of the modes in them are orthogonal, so they're separate ways you can encode information into the optical field. There are, in fact, two special cases of something called the Ince Gauss, where there's a single parameter that as you vary it, it goes from rectangular coordinates through to elliptical. So things kind of bend round and form circles or squares as shown. And then any of those families, you can also combine in quadrature to form vortex families. So you're spoilt for choice when encoding information. Your spoilt for choice when encoding information in transverse spatial mode. Our operations might do something that looks like a rotation, but actually, that is taking, say, a logical zero, which is the vertical stripe here in the field, and that's a superposition of the zero plus one underlying modes of the field. Or we might take the zero and turn it into a superposition, zero plus I one. So they're two different operations we can do with our A and B's. The setup. The setup for just sketching it out on paper is these little dark squares of polarizing beam splitters. By coming with a horizontal photon, it first goes through A, then goes through B, and then I do a polarization measurement at C. A vertical photon goes first through B, then through A, and then I do my measurement. And of course, if I come in with a diagonal measurement, I go through B and A simultaneously and then go through B and A simultaneously again, and I have indefinite causal order. That's what you draw. That's what you draw when you're working it out on the whiteboard with your students. What you actually build, you need these kind of Lego pieces in the lab if you're doing it in free space, and you actually build something that looks like this. And I'm just going to take a moment for the theorists in the audience to talk me through some of the subtleties of the difference between the line drawing and what you lay out in the lab. So, the first thing is consider the polarization qubit. You can show any two-level quantum system on a characteristic sphere, sometimes called the Ponchari sphere or a block sphere. Ponchari sphere or bloch sphere. For polarization, we manipulate that using quarter, half, and quarter wave plates. And what the quarter wave plate does is it takes you from any arbitrary position on the sphere and moves you down to the equator. The half wave plate then lets you move around the equator by any distance that you specify. And then the third quarter wave plate then moves you back off the equator to any other point in the sphere. So this is universal transformation. You can do the same thing for the two-level spatial modes. This was first shown in 2003, but it was a paper by. First, shown in 2003, but this paper by Galvez et al. using cylindrical lenses as the quarter wave elements and a rotation optic as the half wave element. So how the cylindrical lenses work, remember we said before that if I had this horizontal stripe plus this vertical stripe, I get a diagonal stripe. But if I have a 90 degree phase shift between them, I get this donut mode. And this was first pointed out that you could interconvert between these things using cylindrical lenses back in a paper. Cylindrical lenses back in a paper of early 90s by Christian Tam and Carlotto Weiss. So that's the element we use for the quarter wave plate. And for the half-wave plate, this is work from Miles Paget's group over the years in Scotland. You can use various kinds of inverting prisms. The one on the left is called the dove prism. The one on the right is a flat-ended inverting prism. But in both cases, as these papers show, while you're rotating the spatial pattern, you're also due to irregularity. You're also due to irregularities and real-world effects affecting the polarization. So you have to correct for that. So, in that lab experiment, these pairs of wave plates after all the optics in the middle are there to correct the polarization as you rotate all the optics. All right, so as I said, we send in diagonal, we do our measurement at the end, and we use a witness, which is, you know, for an experimentalist, it's just a set of correlations that tell you if something interesting is going on. We used a witness based on the process matrices, which you've already heard quite a lot about today. And we asked ourselves: is the value of the causal witness that we measured negative? And if it's negative, yay, something interesting is happening and we have indefinite causal order. So you've already heard talks about finding, well, process matrices, and there will be separate talks on how to find a causal witness. That's not my gig. I'll be just talking about how we measured it, which I've already talked about. Which I've already talked about, and then what we found. So, the witness we used has three parts: there's some coefficients, which comes from optimization of the problem. These measurements or operations that you do on A and B, and we restrict those to unitaries just in the spatial mode, and we don't want those to affect the polarization. And then we do a polarization measurement in either the X or I basis at the end of the experiment. It turns out. It turns out when you write down the theory the first time, there's a kind of a long list of unitaries you need to do, but you can collapse that down to just six unitries, which are the basis unitries, identity, X, Y, Z, Pauli operations, and then just the equal superpositions of X plus Z and Y plus Z. So that's great. Simpler is always better for experimentalists. Again, we can use these rotation elements and cylindrical prisms to do those operations, and we end up with this. Do those operations, and we end up with this table. And so, instead of more generally, you might need five rotations to do things, we just need two. So, that's great. So, what ideally you would measure is a witness of minus 0.248. And what we ended up measuring was a bunch of measurements like this, which, when you put them through the maths, gives you a witness of minus 0.163. Or, more importantly, from our point of view, it's 12 and a half. More importantly, from our point of view, it's 12 and a half standard deviations away from the classical boundary of zero. So we felt very comfortable in saying the quantum switch we built has indefinite causal order. And now all the information was encoded co-linearly on the one photon. So that we couldn't have criticisms from philosophers, although we still did. To our very pleasant surprise, that became nominated as one of the top 10 breaks. And nominated as one of the top 10 breakthroughs in physics in 2018. And if you want to disagree with that, I won't fight you at all. But it was a very pleasant surprise. And I think it highlights not only to the general public, but to our colleagues, how interesting, how much interest there still is in foundational problems. And also it made the lead PhD student a very happy student indeed. So back to the noisy problem that I started the talk with. I've got some information, I'm wanting to send it through two noisy channels. I'm wanting to send it through two noisy channels and have a happy audience at the end. So, if I first, how do we make the noise? So, the Pauli operators, we'll get sick of seeing these unitaries. Now, in this case, we just need the identity x, y, z. If we send in the mode shown here in the middle of the screen, the identity leaves it unchanged. The x and y appear to rotate at 90 degrees, although there's a phase difference. Although there's a phase difference between them, and the Z-flips it in phase. That's theory down the bottom. You can see the experiment, and I'm not sure if it's coming through in your screens, but you'll notice a lot of little diffractive interference patterns on top of that. And this happens in the lab. You never get the ideal to make a noisy channel. You just choose to apply one of those four operators randomly. So the map for that is as shown where when q equals one, Shown where when q equals one, I'm equally likely to apply the identity or the x, the y over the z operator. And effectively, then I have a perfectly noisy channel. But I can vary q between zero, which is just identity, through to one, which is perfectly noisy. And there's a lot of different ways you could put channels together. I've experimented with those as well. But this one's clean to talk about. To measure the information capacity of the channel, we're going to denote the quantum switch by this gothic S. The quantum switch by this gothic S and define two physical parameters. One is the minimum entropy of the two qubit outputs from our switch, the qubits being the polarization qubit and the spatial qubit. And the other one is the von Neumann entropy of the control after you've traced out the target. And then you just get the Halebo capacity called the switch by taking one, adding to it the von Neumann entropy of the control after you've traced out the target, and minusing off the two qubit minimum. And minusing off the two-qubit minimum entropy. When you do that, you now get a parameter which you can plot versus the noise strength. Remember, Q is no noise, perfect channel. Q equals one is a perfectly noisy channel. And we plot on log scales because we're experimentalists and we love log scales. And now we're going to have two noise channels, A and B, both being fully noisy. The theory is this blue curve here. And what you can see is as you turn the noise up, you very quickly start. Noise up, you very quickly start losing your ability to send information down this channel. And as you head out to one, you go to minus infinity on the log scale because you've got zero ability to send information through the channel. That's if I'm doing A then B or B then A, the two classical options. However, the theory predicts that if I have indefinite order, so it's A then B or B then A, and I'm ignorant of which it is because they're in superposition and there's some phase. Because they're in superposition and there's some phase, I get this black curve shown here. Now, the interesting thing is that black curve never heads down to minus infinity. In fact, I end up with some limit of about one bit in 20 makes it through the system, 0.049 bits. And the other interesting thing is I even get a little bit better than that when I've not got perfect noise. The way to think about this intuitively is what's happening in the perfectly noisy cases. Happening in the perfectly noisy case is you've got an equal superposition of, say, identity then x, or x, then identity, or z then y, or y then z, spread across all 16 permutations. And what happens with the indefinite causal order is it allows some of those things to interfere and they cancel out. And because they cancel out, some information leaks through, although not very much. That's the theory. We're experimentalists. So the red dots are what we measured, the orange smear. Measured the orange smear in the background is what we predicted would occur given our limited visibility and known losses and other issues in the system. And so we ended up about one bit in 33, made it through the combination of two completely noisy channels. We also got interested, could we apply this in situations where you've got one fully noisy channel that's going through some environment you don't control and one classic, one control channel that you control. Control channel that you control, and you have a perfect unitary, some lab channel. Again, it doesn't matter classically whether you do the perfect channel and then the perfectly noisy channel or vice versa. As you go up to full noise at Q equals one, your ability to send information goes to zero, minus infinity on the Lung scale. But now the theory predicts that for all values of noise, you'll be able to send 100% of the information. So we got very intrigued by that. So we got very intrigued by that. Of course, we did the experiment as well. Again, the red dots are what we measured. The orange is the background of where we expected we would be given our measured imperfections in the system. And now two bits and three, roughly, we're making it through the system. So that was a very intriguing result. We got interested in that, came up with a bunch of applications. Cal Moody is very keen. Bunch of applications. Cal Moody is very keen on sending encrypted information with this system and came up with some protocols to do that. We also got interested in the possibility of being able to send information through turbulent media, for example, from the ground to a satellite. That might be some turbulent path, but I have some ground control path that's perfectly unitary. Or on a different length scale, I might be able to retrieve information through some turbulent path. I've sent light down to some tissue, it's scattered. To some tissue, it's scattered. I'm getting some scattered light back, but I also have a unitary control path. So there are possible things to explore. And of course, as we heard from Philip Bolter's talk last night, there's been quite a lot. Oh, hang on, before I get to that. We used encoded spatial modes, and I said they're wonderful things because you can go up to infinite dimensions with them. But in practice, once you get to 15 or so, they start becoming so large that you hit the boundaries of the optics that you typically have in the lab. You typically have in the lab. Now, you can order bigger optics and get around that, but it's probably worth exploring other photonic QD architectures. And two come to mind. There's a lovely paper in Science Advances by Islam et al. in 2017 looking at using path encoding in fibers. And last year, there was a great paper in communication physics on using multi-core optical fibers that are intrinsically Q-dits. And then you can spread your information around that fiber in a very robust and compact way. And they can scale to very large degrees. And they can scale to very large sizes. As Philip mentioned last night, this has led to an explosion of people doing experiments in this area. In 2019, there was an Australian-Chinese collaboration between Jen Wei Pan's group in Hefei and Jeff Price's group in Brisbane, where they showed that when you go to d equals thirteen qubits, you get exponentially superior quantum communication complexity over the best known classical protocols. Classical protocols. From Guo's group in China and working with Kirubella in Hong Kong, there was a paper last year on experimental transmission of quantum information using a superposition. Again, they showed that you can do better than the best known classical approach if you use the quantum switch with the indefinite causal order. And then Philip talked briefly about his experiment last night where the take-home message was they looked at a bunch of different Message was they looked at a bunch of different ways that you might put these things together and found that the way that we've discussed here so far today with the indefinite causal order of channel A, B, or B, A, was in fact the superior way to do it. So that's good to know. Just to my experimental colleagues, you'll notice something that every one of those papers starts with the word experimental, experimental, experimental. Stop that. Physics is an experimental science. You don't see our theoretical colleagues starting every one of their papers with theoretical. Don't do that. Do that. Okay. So, what are the take-home messages from this? Well, Jackie always liked this image. So, I guess the take-home message from the switch is that the chicken and the egg can both come first. So, indefinite causal order is a real thing and you can do it in the lab in a variety of different ways. And then, the other take-home message, at least from our group, is that indefinite causal order is definitely a resource for computation and communication. For computation and communication, and as we've just heard from the last talk, entanglement harvesting as well. So, there's a lot of things you can do with this, which is very wonderful for something that started as a foundational physics exploration. And now we're turning it into something that may or may not have applications, but it's a lot of fun finding out. I particularly want to thank my co-authors on this and the ones on the call, in particular, Fabio. Thank you for your patience as we figured out the theory, or figured out, you figured out the theory and you explained it. You figured out theory and you explained it to us, which has been great. So, thank you everyone for your time. And if you've got any questions, please go. So, yeah, thank you very much. Let's thank Andrew. And we have a lot of time for questions. Sorry about that. I went a bit fast. No, no, it's fine. Yes, team. Thanks, Andrew. I don't know if you're just down the corridor or not, but anyway. I am. I am. I've been here all night. This slide actually is the one I was thinking about when you talked about using. About using this on a turbid medium. It reminded me of Jim Franson's technique from a long, long time ago using entanglement to cancel out dispersion in channels. I'm just wondering if there's a relationship there. Because basically, you sample the dispersion in one direction and then you sample it again coming back behind. And then you sample it again, coming back the other way. But the time scales are such that it hasn't changed much, and you can cancel it out. Yeah. Something like that. It's been a long time since I looked at the paper, but it just reminded me of that. And I wonder if there's a link. That's a very interesting point. I don't know, but I'm going to charge off and have a look. If I recall that, that worked because of the momentum entanglement. Was that the experiment you're thinking of where they had? Was the experiment you're thinking of where they had down-converted photons, and then the entanglement here too because of the different parts. Yes, but I wonder if that maps onto the momentum. I mean, that works for the dispersion because the momentum changes in a known way. That's a really interesting thought. I don't know. Tim, I'll charge off and have a think. Thanks. Thank you. Rob, you're. Rob, you have a question? Yeah, very interesting talk. So, there is a common theme, I think, between your talk and the previous one, and that is that indefinite causal order makes things better. You get better entanglement, you get better communication. So, an obvious thing, at least to me, to think about is whether you'll improve quantum teleportation in some way. Teleportation in some way. Has anybody thought of A, if that is correct, and B, if it is, doing an experiment to that end? So as far as I know, no, but I'm probably not the one to ask. Probably Laura is from the previous talk. The only areas I know of advantage at the moment are computation, communication, and the intangible harvesting. But on behalf of everyone in the group, But on behalf of everyone in the group, if anyone does have an idea for a new experiment to do with indefinite causal order, let us know and we will try and do the experiment. Laura, have you got any comment? Well, I need to point out that I must, you know, I do theory. No, that's fine. Have you seen any theory on the improving teleportation? No, I haven't. But I think I'd actually But I think I'd actually say that there's an even stronger link between these two things, and that's this indefinite temporal order makes things better because it reduces noise. Right. I mean, you are using it to reduce the noise in noisy channels and it makes entanglement harvesting better because it reduces the local noise. Is the physics like our hand-wavy picture of why it reduces noise is we get cancellation with the indefinite causal order between the With the indefinite causal order between the various noise terms. Do you see that in what you do as well? Yeah, that's, I think, I think so. That you, well, you pick up cross terms, and those cross terms necessarily reduce the noise. Yeah, yep. They always contribute negatively. Yeah. Thanks, Robin. So, Bobbio just put something in the chat indicating there is a paper out about this, at least theoretically. I'm gonna bring it up on the screen for everyone to read. Oh no, that'll take too long. Sorry, my steam-powered computer. Yeah, once again, it looks like it's reducing noise. Excellent. Fabio, do you know if anyone's done an experiment on that? He said not completely disinterestedly. Not completely disinterested. I think not. Excellent. Are there more questions? Okay, well, we still have the discussion session, so I think we can thank Andrew again and we can move to the And we can move to the discussion session. So, for that, I would ask the speakers. All right, we have the group photo. Thanks, Rob. I was going to say that. Sorry. Hi, guys. I'm just going to take the group photo. So, in order for me to do that, I will ask everyone to put your screen on. It will take just a couple of seconds for me to do it. No idea. Okay, I will still have a couple of people there. Okay, everyone ready, Fabio? Okay, I guess this is ready. Give me just one second. I'll make sure this is working properly. Okay. Okay, just to make sure I got this one. Okay, perfect. Awesome cat, Margaret. Oh, yeah. Oh, we got it. Okay, thank you guys. It's done. I got the picture. Thank you, everyone. Thanks. Thanks. His name is Bobby. Bobby. Okay, so now we can move to the discussion session. And I would ask the speakers of this session to turn their video on. Well, Fabio can apparently cannot.
