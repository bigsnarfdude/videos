Of the conference, the Brown conference. And we have two speakers just this morning. The first speaker is Javik Dome Serrano from Brown and from Barcelona. And he's going to speak on symmetry in stationary and uniformly rotating solutions of fluid equations. Okay. Great. So yes, thanks a lot for the introduction, Alex, and thanks a lot to all the organizers. To all the organizers, how Alex, Sasha, and Jacob, for this wonderful conference. You've, I mean, managed to do a great job this week, and I've enjoyed the conference a lot. So, today, we're going to talk about some new results and maybe some not so new results on symmetry and stationary solutions of some fluid equations. And it was sort of vague. Fluid equations, and I was sort of vague as to what were the equations on purpose because the equations are going to be changing throughout the talk. But we see that the common theme is going to be symmetric solutions of a particular type, like steady solutions. Okay, so let me start by mentioning that this is joint work with Yao Yao at Georgia Tech. Her graduate student, Jamine Park, who is now. Jamine Park, who is now with me, sort of between Brown and Barcelona, and JSC, who is my graduate student at Princeton. And let me also stress that she will be applying for jobs in the next cycle. So she may be a good addition to anyone who is here. Okay, so let me start slowly and easily by writing out. By writing down the 2D Euler equations, perhaps using some non-conventional notation. And instead of using omega for the vorticity, I'm going to use theta. And you'll see in a minute, in a minute, why I'm choosing this sort of unconventional notation. So the point here is that one can write the velocity in terms of the scalar by means of this. scalar by means of this singular integral and the relation between the Laplacian and the street, sorry, the scalar and the string function via this full Laplacian. So I guess in this context and in this audience to the Euler equations don't need any introduction whatsoever. And throughout this talk I'm going to be talking about the scalar, the vorticity in two different flavors. Okay, so I'm going Flavors. Okay, so I'm going to talk about the settings when theta, when the scalar is a smooth function, and I will refer to that setting as being the smooth setting. Or else I will consider theta to be a step function or a collection of step functions. And I will say that I'm in the patch setting whenever that happens. Okay, and depending on what setting I'm in, the results are going to be slightly. The results are going to be slightly different from one setting to the other. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about patch problems, as I said. So I'm going to be assuming that the scalar theta is a step function that is equal to one inside a moving domain, and it's going to be zero outside of it. And if I do so, then by using contour integration. By using contour integration, one can write the dynamics just in terms of the boundary. Okay, so one can write the evolution of the free boundary in terms of in the normal direction. So this is the velocity in the normal direction just by some singular integral that depends only on the values of the boundary, on the parameterization of the boundary here. I'm also assuming that the boundary is e of alpha t. Of alpha t is either a vector or a complex number. I will use these two notations indifferently. So I will call z to be z1 and z2, or simply just z as z1 plus i, z2. Okay, so in this setting, in this patch setting problem, because of Judovich theory, one can have a solution in L1, L infinity of the Euler equation. Of the Euler equation. And by the works of Chemin and Bertosi-Constantin, we know that if initially the free boundary, the interface between this set where the vorticity is one and the set where the vorticity is zero, is C1 gamma, then it stays C1 gamma forever. Okay, so there is global regularity if the initial data is sufficiently smooth, C1 alpha, and it's still open, what happens in the case? Uh, and it's still open. What happens in the case of just C1? Okay, so what solutions do I care about? So, in this setting, I'm going to be focusing on either stationary or uniformly rotating. And by uniformly here, I'm going to be meaning uniform both in time and in space. Okay, so what is a stationary solution? What is a stationary solution? It's simply clear, right? It's a solution where the partial t of u is equal to zero, of theta is equal to zero. So essentially, u dot graph theta is equal to zero. This is what I mean by a stationary solution. And a uniformly rotating solution with angular velocity omega is going to be a stationary solution in the rotating frame. Okay, so if Rotating frame. Okay, so if I take out the rotation accounting from this angular velocity capital omega, then in this rotating frame, theta is going to be uniformly rotating as long as it is a stationary solution taking out the rotation. Okay, and now if I substitute for what is u and I write everything as a grad per of something and I call that something f, then by doing so, Then, by doing so, we know that f is going to be constant in each connected component of every level set of omega, if we are in the smooth case, or if we are in the patch case, it's going to be constant on each connected component of the boundary of the patch. Okay, and what is very important here is what is highlighted in red. So, that this function f is constant in each connected component. In each connected component is good, it's a nice thing, it's something that we're going to exploit, but it presents really a problem if there are multiple connected components. And then, even though it is constant, then this constant may be different from component to component. And at first sight, this doesn't look as an obstruction, this doesn't look as an issue, but in all the previous methods that were used to tackle these problems, this Tackle these problems, this was a big obstruction. This presented a big technical obstruction, and we have been able to overcome this by using a different family of methods. Okay, so this is the main enemy, and we'll see how to deal with this main enemy using new techniques, as opposed to the previous literature. Okay, so the main question that we want to address is the following. That we want to address is the following. Suppose that we have a radial function, then it is trivial that it is a stationary function just by looking at the way the string function looks like. And this is also trivial to check that this solution is also uniformly rotating for any omega. So what we want to answer is the converse. So suppose that we have a uniformly rotating solution. Now, under what assumptions or Now, under what assumptions or what do we need to know to prove that this is radially symmetric? So, can we characterize the set of stationary solutions or the set of uniformly rotating solutions? And if so, under what conditions or not or what happens? Okay, so for 2D Euler, in the patch and in the smooth case, Frenkel and Midi And midi, so Frenkel in the case of omega is equal to zero, and later mid in the case of omega equals to one-half and omega negative. And all of them were assuming that the patch was, okay, either simply connected or perhaps something stronger than that. Here, I wrote convex for simplicity, it is not quite that, but let's not get into the technical detail. But in any case, But in any case, all these three results are assuming that there is one connected component of the boundary, plus perhaps even more things. And all these three results use moving plane methods. Okay, and this is where having one connected component is crude. Connected component is crucial as part of the proof, and it doesn't work if you have multiple components. Okay, and later, there are some new results in different settings, one by Jamel and Viras Billy, where they consider punctured domains or annuli and some extra hypothesis in U. And they show that in the stationary case, then the velocity has to be radial. Be has to be radial. And there is also another paper by Konstantin Driebas and Ginsberg, where they consider similar results for periodic channels or perturbations of periodic channels. And then instead of being radial, things have to be shears. Okay, so this is in the positive direction. However, in the negative directions, meaning solutions that are stationary or uniformly rotating and non-ravial, there are examples and the main Are examples, and the main canonical example are the Kirshov ellipses. So, these ellipses are known for 150 years almost. And if you put an ellipse, if you put an elliptical patch of semi-axis A and B, then this is going to be a rotating solution and it will rotate with some angular velocity that depends on the ratio of the semi-axis of the ellipse. And somewhat importantly, in the numerology, Importantly, in the numerology, is that this angular velocity lies between zero and one-quarter. Okay, so the one-quarter is important, the one-half is also important, and we'll see in a minute why or how do these numbers enter into place. Okay, so just to summarize, between zero and one-quarter, there are counterexamples. At zero and below zero, it seems that there is nothing, and at one half, using some tricks. Using some trick, there is nothing, or there seems to be nothing at least. Okay, now still going in the positive directions, there are these families of solutions which are known in the literature as V-states. So these are rotating solutions. And this term was coined by Deem and Sabuski in the late 70s. And they computed numerically bifurcating from disks. Bifurcating from disks. So they took sort of a disk, and then for some angular velocities, they managed to find a direction or a perturbation of the disk in a non-radial way. So these are uniformly rotating solutions, and they were finding branches emanating depending on the symmetry of the solutions. So these are threefold, fourfold, and so on. On, they managed to compute numerically, given the technology of the time, some solutions that were uniformly rotating and had some symmetry. Okay, so this seems to suggest, at least numerically, that there are other things, other solutions that are non-trivial, yet, I mean, non-trivial, but yet uniformly rotating solutions. Okay, and there is even more than that. So this is. Than that. So, this is Kam's thesis. This is taken from Kam's thesis 1987. And this diagram is a little upside down. This omega is omega, is minus omega, because they chose a different orientation of the rotation. This branch corresponds to the disks. This corresponds to the ellipses. And then again, he recovers the threefold, fourfold, and so on. And so on from Diem and Sabuski, but moreover, Kam showed numerically that in the elliptical branch, one could even construct secondary bifurcations. Okay, so there seems to be a very rich zoo of non-trivial solutions or non-trivial solutions, but yet doing this sort of rigid movement, which is just rotation. Okay. And again, let me stress that. Let me stress that everything here lies between zero and one half. Okay, one half in our convention for the rotation. Okay, and this number still kind of keeps playing a role and all the solutions seem to be found just in this range, zero, one half. Okay, what happens at the end of the branch? Nobody knows. It is still an open problem whether at the end of those branches. Whether at the end of those branches, what you get, the sort of patch or the sort of limiting patch that you get, may develop a singularity in the form of a 90-degree corner. Okay, so this is still open. And well, there is numerical evidence strongly supporting this conjecture. This holds true no matter what branch you pick, or seems to hold true, no matter. Or seems to hold true, no matter what branch you pick, but it's still an open problem. And Liguindi and John constructed singular solutions of a different type that had corners, but these are not these ones obtained at the end of the branch of the V-states. Okay, there is more to that. So Lusato Feyes and Williamson also computed numerically this. Also, computed numerically this very nice picture. This is a schematics. Again, keep in mind that there is no dynamics here. This on the left, you can think that this is omega. And then you have two topologically different solutions that sort of converge to one point. And if you approach that point from the left, you approach it from the family of single vortices, of vortices that just have one collection. One connected component, but if you approach it from the right, you are approaching it from the family of two vortices. Okay, and at the end of these two, there is one sort of common endpoint, which is this figure eight patch that also seems to have a 90-degree corner here. But yet, nobody knows how to. But yet nobody knows how to prove any of these things, not even finding the limiting patch. So I'm not even discussing how to do this sort of branch or this sort of approach from both sides of the branch, but even finding the limiting state, which should be an easier problem, is still not known. Okay, so these are all numerical results. All numerical results. Now, what can actually one prove? Well, Burbia 1982 showed that you could do local bifurcation, what is known as local bifurcation at these explicit values of omega. And let me stress that this is equal to one-half minus one over two m. So, in particular, this is smaller than one half and positive. So again, So again, Bourbia showed that you can find local bifurcation and local branches emanating at these values of omega, which turn out to be between zero and one half. The boundary of these patches was shown to be C infinity by MIDI, Mateo, and Berbera, and then improved to be analytic by Castro, Carlo, and myself. And we also computed the second. And we also computed the secondary bifurcations from CAM. So all of these are local results, local bifurcation results. There is a paper by Cassainia, Masmoudi and Miles Wheeler, where they do global bifurcation of these V-states and then they can travel the branches until something bad happens. We also were able to singularize a patch and turn it into a smooth function together with Angel and Diego. And nonetheless, there are many, many other papers by lots of people in the last 10 years. So this has become a very active area of research in the last years. Okay, now what can we actually prove? Now, what can we actually prove? So our first result is the following, and this is also strongly suggested by what we were seeing in the numerics up until now, which is the following. So if you take omega below or equal zero or above one half, then there are no B states. Then there are no rotating solutions. There are no stationary solutions, no matter what. And here there are. No matter what. And here there are no hypotheses on the topology. This is the important thing. We make no assumptions on the connectivity of the patches. Okay, so this is kind of summarized in the cartoon that we see in the middle that eventually shows what was known before us in black and what we prove in red. So So, pretty much is what I mentioned. If we were at zero or below and convex, then we know that there is rigidity and there is flexibility between zero and one half. And above one half, nothing was known. And all of these results under the extra assumption that the patch has to be simply correct. be simply correct okay so so our method and our proof is going to is going to be a calculus of variation proof and this is going to be the new thing or the new topic as opposed to to to what was done before which was uh using uh using moving planes transforming the equation into an elliptic equation and then using moving planes okay so let me give a sort of A sort of a short taste of how the proof works in the easiest setting, and then I will explain how to upgrade the simple setting into the more complicated ones. And of course, this is what it makes the paper to be long. This is a very short proof, and then we'll see how to upgrade it. Okay, so let's start by considering this functional, this energy E of rho. This energy of rho, which is given by these two terms: the potential term and then the rotation term. And let me move the density rho. Let me evolve it by this vector field B. And let's compute the first variation along that vector field. So, if I initially take the density to be a characteristic function of a set, which I will assume for now that this Assume for now that it's simply connected, then I can compute the first variation. And I'm left with this integral v dot gradf. Okay, so now the goal is to choose a v depending on rho, for which this number i will be zero and at the same time it will not be zero. Okay, and I'm also assuming that. And I'm also assuming that the draw is a uniformly rotating solution. So I want to derive a contradiction by picking the right V. So let me start by showing how to prove that I, the capital I, is equal to zero. And for that, the only thing that I will assume is that V is incompressible and okay, smooth enough to integrate all parts. Integrated by parts. But the only thing that they will use about V is the incompressibility. Okay? And I'm going to use as well that F is constant on the boundary. So if I do so, the proof is very easy. All one has to do is integrate by parts, move the gradient from F onto V. So this gives the second term. And then there is a boundary term. A boundary term involving f, but since f is constant on the boundary, I can put the constant out and I can integrate by parts once again. Okay, and if we do so, then we are left with this divergence of v, which is zero by our assumption that v is incompressible. Okay, so up to now, we have proved that i is zero, and the only thing that we have used or we have imposed on b is that b is incompressible. So, we still have a lot of freedom, we can choose any. A lot of freedom, we can choose any incompressible vector field. And now the goal is to show that if we pick wisely, we can make i to be non-zero. Okay? So what do we want? The intuition is the following. So if we had some patch like this, ideally we would like to pick our V in such a way that this becomes more radial. Okay, so we would like to push the points which are furthest away stronglier than the points that are closer. So a natural guess, a natural candidate, is minus x. Okay, so we would like to choose v to be minus x in the in the sense that the points which are the farthest get pushed The furthest get pushed the strongest and the patch becomes more radiant, right? But the problem is that minus x is not divergence-free. Okay, so okay, that's too bad. But instead of picking minus x, we're going to pick the closest divergence-free vector field to minus x. Okay, so we're going to consider minus x plus the projector onto. The projector onto the divergence-free vector fields, and this is essentially given by this p. Okay, so if we write v as the gradient of some potential phi, then this is the one or minus the gradient, then this is the one coming from this term minus x, and then we have this p. And the p satisfies this elliptic equation. Delta p is equal to minus two, and p is zero on the boundary. And P is zero on the boundary. So now Phi is harmonic, and therefore B is divergence-free. So we are allowed to pick that Phi, and therefore we are allowed to pick that V. Okay, and the intuition is pretty much what I said. If we take all divergence-free vector fields, then the closest to minus X is precisely this particular V. Okay, and this particular V will help us to prove. Will help us to prove that I is different from C. Okay, so now this is an easy calculation. We substitute onto the expression of V. So we take V to be grad phi, and we substitute by grad phi by what it is, and we end up with this term coming from X, and we end up with the term coming from B. So if we Coming from b. So, if we now further calculate even more and we look at what this is, this term x dot grad f, we substitute by what is f, then we have again the other two parts. n is the Newtonian potential. So we can write explicitly what this term looks like. The rotation term, we leave it unchanged, and then we symmetrize and we get this nice cancellation after the symmetrization that essentially cancels out this factor. Cancels out this factor here. So this is one, and we are left with one over four pi, the area of d squared, minus omega the second moment of d. Okay, so very easy calculation. So this is I1. And now we want to see what to do with I2. With I2, we just integrate by parts once again. So we move the derivative from P. The derivative from P onto F, and we substitute by what is F. Remember, F was the convolution between the Newtonian potential and the density, so the Newtonian potential and the Laplacian cancel out. And then there was some rotation term, which is like x squared, so then the Laplacian is going to be constant. And if we do so, then we are left with some number times the integral of p. Okay, so that's that's. Okay, so that's good. And if we put everything together, we are left with this value of E, value of I. Okay, so let's pretend for a minute that omega is zero. So if omega is zero, then this term is not here and this term is not here. And we need to link the integral of p and the area of d. But this is precisely a result by Talenti in which he proved pretty much the equal. Pretty much the equality that we need. So he proved that the integral of p is bounded by 1 over 4π, the area of the area squared. And the equality is achieved if and only if d is a disk. Okay, so this gives us what we need in the case of omega is equal to zero. And in the case of omega not equal to zero, we just use that the second moment is also extremized by the disk. By the disk. And again, we can have an equality of this type depending on the sign of omega times some constant that depends on omega, but nonetheless something for which we can extract a sign. And therefore, we can show that i is different from zero as long as the patch is not a disk. Okay, so this proves the theorem in the easiest setting, namely a patch A patch and simply connect. Okay, how to go further? How to upgrade it? If we have a multiply connected domain, then as I said, f may take different values on each piece of the boundary. So we're going to need a little bit more. We're going to need to ask a little bit more from B and from P. So we're going to keep the same V as before, but then V as before, but then we will modify the p in such a way that the p on the boundary of the holes takes some value that depends on the area of the hole. And then under those conditions, the same integration by pulse and the same tricks work. We need to reprove a lemma in the spirit of Talenti that I showed. Talenti that I showed before for this case where P is slightly different than what he proved. And we can get the same thing now for multiple connected domains. If omega is smaller or equal than zero or greater or equal than one half, then it follows that theta has to be rated. Okay, so now this deals with the patch in the non-simply connected. Simply connected domain. We can further upgrade this to the smooth setting. And in the smooth setting, what we do in order to patch, in order to go from the patch setting to the smooth case, is to sort of consider a discretized version of the patch and then take, approximate our smooth function by a collection. By a collection of patches. So we approximate our density by a sum of characteristic functions. Let's say that we have n characteristic functions, we have n layers, and then we derive quantitative versions of the previous estimates that I showed before. Okay, so now we have some estimates that depend on n. We send n to infinity. To infinity, and we can close similar inequalities as in the previous cases. Okay, here we are also assuming that the profile that the vorticity omega is not just smooth and compactly supported, but also positive. Because otherwise, the whole thing sort of flips around. So, under this assumption, So, under this assumption, we can prove a similar result. Now, what we can also prove is that the assumption that they highlighted in red is necessary. If we don't have that omega is positive, then we can find stationary or uniformly rotating solutions even with. Even with finite energy, that just have a sign-changing vorticity. So, this shows that the extra condition that I highlighted in red is actually necessary, because otherwise we can construct counterexamples. And these counterexamples are different from some other constructions of stationary solutions in the literature. In the literature, which were obtained the singularizing point vortices. Okay, so these solutions are going to be different by construction. They are not going to be close to point vortices, but they will be close to annular solutions, annular patches with different values of the vorticity in the different regions. And to do so, we're going to singularize this solution in a Polarize this solution in a clever way. Bifurcation theorems are not available in this case because there is some technicality having to do with the amount of derivatives that you lose, and we have to resort to an asthmoshere scheme. Okay, and this theorem will appear hopefully this summer. Okay. How about if instead of 2D Euler, we consider the vortex sheet problem. So now the vorticity, instead of being concentrated on a patch or being a smooth one, now it's going to be some direct delta concentrated along some curve and it's going to be like a measure where it's a direct delta supported on a given curve. And a certain amplitude. Then a similar result holds. So we can prove both rigidity and flexibility. What do I mean by this? So if the vorticity amplitude is greater or equal than zero and we have a rotating speed, an angular speed which is smaller or equal than zero. speed which is smaller or equal than zero and the deltas are supported in a collection of curves gamma i so this doesn't need to be necessarily one it could be a finite amount of them then necessarily if we have a uniformly rotating solution or a stationary solution then the the the curves have to be nested circles and the vorticity amplitude has to be constant. Amplitude has to be constant. There is no other choice. And to do so, we sort of singularize the sheets by considering like a small layer opening out the sheets, let's say, of with epsilon, and then derive again quantitative estimates in terms of epsilon. And we send epsilon to go to zero. To go to zero, okay, and then apply the machinery that we developed for the smooth case. Okay, so this is more or less how the proof works for this rigidity result in the case of the vortex sheet. However, we can also prove flexibility. So we can construct rotating solutions with positive omega that are not supported on a circuit. On a circle, okay, so that they are weak solutions of Euler that are measures like Dirac measures supported on a curve gamma that I will show some examples of how it looks like, which is not exactly. Okay, so we're going to use bifurcation theory here. The standard methods, if we try to do Lyapunov-Schmid or Kranda-Pravinovic, will not work. And we need to do And we need to do a higher-order expansion of the bifurcation point. So, just to give a feeling of how the bifurcation diagram looks like, the standard case, which is when one can apply these other methods, is when one has a trivial branch and then there is some kind of crossing, and this is a non-trivial branch, and you sort of follow the non-trivial branch like this. Here, we also have a trivial branch. This is the disk. Branch, this is the disk, and then we have sort of like two crossings. Okay, so we need to locally expand the bifurcation around this point. And I will explain in a minute what is B and what is R1. Okay, so now I can show what are these capital letter A, B, C and D. So all of these correspond to solutions and the branches do not stop here. Solutions and the branches do not stop here. This is just when we stop computing, we sort of run out of patience, but the branches should go further. Okay, so this is not by no means this is a claim that the branches stop there. Okay, so if we look at A, B, C and D, which are which are here, so this is A, B, C and D, I hope. Yes. Um we can see so the interesting ones uh are maybe A and D, but perhaps A is the most interesting one. So if we see here, the vertical scale is not the same always. So for D, we are thinking about a vorticity amplitude of uh forty or twenty, whereas for B and C, which were sort of in the middle, this is like two point four or seven. Like 2.4 or 7, but the point is that it seems so the numerics suggest that there may be some loss of smoothness here. And sorry, so this is the vorticity amplitude on the left, and this is the boundary of the sheet. Okay, so this is how the curve in which the vortex sheet is supported looks like. So this is interesting. So, this is interesting because in the limit, it may be that this sheet loses regularity here. This is something that may happen. I mean, maybe perhaps some of these things happen simultaneously. But it could also be that somehow the support of the vorticity is only concentrated in just these two arcs. So, the top one and the bottom one, which correspond here to the One, which corresponds here to the non-zero parts on the left of A. So somehow it could be that there is also a change of topology in these sheets. So if you continue up until the point where the branch disappears, there may be some connection with a branch of vortex sheets that started as maybe two segments. And then, sort of, as you moved along the branch, then Moved along the branch, then it ends up being something like this, or which is the same as something like this, something like this, plus something like this, but where the vorticity amplitude is zero. Okay, which is kind of what A seems to be going towards. I mean, this is all conjectural. I have no clue. I have no clue about what really happens, but it's kind of nice. And it may be another transition, like another topological transition between solutions of having just one curve into solutions that have two curves. Okay, so now let me change gears a little bit and finally talk about the SQG equations. So the SQG are also So the SQG are also some equations that probably need no introduction in this context. They come from geophysics and they were used previously, mostly numerically, by oceanographers and meteorologists to describe phenomena in the atmosphere and in the oceans. And it wasn't until the nineties where 90s were where they were sort of more mathematically studied. Okay, so if you write them down, then essentially everything is the same as for 2D Euler. The only thing that changes is the law between the scalar, which now is theta, because it accounts for the temperature, and the stream function. So instead of having a full Laplacian, now we have a half Laplacian. Full Laplacian, now we have a half Laplacian, the velocity is more singular and therefore they are harder to analyze and to study. So there is also some connection between 3D Euler and SQG, which lives in one less dimension. And this was noted by Konstantin Maid and Tabak in 1994. And it is still an open problem whether there is blow-up or there is global. Up or there is global workflow. And moreover, one can consider some interpolating family of equations between Euler and SQG, which is called generalized SQG or modified SQG, in which the exponent of this law is taken as a function, is taken as a parameter alpha that ranges from 2D Euler up to SQG. up to sqg or perhaps even even beyond. So alpha will be between zero between zero and two. And as before we're going to work in the patch case and in the smooth case and in the patch case Rodrigo and Galcedo prove local existence in C infinity and in H3 respectively and we are not expecting and we we are not expecting really any sort of stability of uh of any of any solutions uh i mean any any asymptotic stability i mean perhaps some stability um and we started working on on finding because the keep in mind that the global hilosness is still was still open um we spent some time trying to focus and trying to see if we could find rotating solutions or v states Rotating solutions or V-states for SQG because there were no examples of global solutions for SQG which were non-trivial, which means that they were non-radial. And indeed, we were able to find them. So we were able to find B states that were C infinity and convex. And later on, we showed that the boundary of these B states is indeed analytic. And for doing so, Analytic. And for doing so, we used local bifurcation theorems. So, again, this is a local bifurcation problem. From the disk, the multipliers get nasty, and we have to cook up some spaces that account for the technical problem with the derivatives, but nonetheless, we can do it. And we can even improve it to deal with smooth. To deal with smooth solutions. So, before it was for patches, and here we were able to construct global solutions which were smooth. And this became very technical, and part of this result is using a computer-assisted group. So, after our results, there have been also a lot of activity involving constructing global solutions for SQG. Global solutions for SQG, Gravejat and Smetz constructed smooth traveling wave solutions. Ao, Davila, Delpino, Musso, and Wei, the singularized k-vortex solutions. And then there are more works by Claudio Garcia and Godarka. Okay, so how about the stationary problem? So the stationary problem was conjectured by Hassainia, Midi, and Delaov that should Allowed that should have non-trivial solutions as opposed to 2D Euler. Okay, so this is a striking phenomenon that for 2D Euler, there is no non-trivial stationary solution, whereas for SQG there seems to be. So Nasainha and her collaborators were able to bifurcate from disks at positive and negative angular velocity. Um, angular velocities. They were bifurcating from annuli, um, and then they said, Well, perhaps these branches are connected, or perhaps there are so many because they could bifurcate essentially at any speed in between. So perhaps there is a way to sort of find these stationary solutions. And indeed, there is, but instead of choosing the parameter to be the Choosing the parameter to be the angular velocity, fix it, and then choose as a parameter the radius of the angles. And if you do so and you do some sort of lengthy calculations, then you succeed. Okay, so one can find stationary solutions or stationary patches of SQG and generalized SQG, which are non-trivial. And this method fails for 2D Euler, as we now know. To the Euler, as we now know, but back then I didn't know that this was a real obstruction. So, this is sort of how we started working on the first theorem that I presented. And now, let me briefly state what we can prove in the SQG and generalized SQG setting. So, we can prove the following. We can prove that for the patches, there is nothing below Is nothing below omega smaller or equal than zero or omega bigger than some number which is omega alpha which is optimal. Okay, and here we need to assume that we are in a simply connected setting because otherwise we have seen that there are counterexamples. So now the simply connected assumption is necessary because of what I just said. But then, under this assumption, pretty much nothing was known in the sense that, okay, there were examples of non-radial, non-simply connected patches at zero and below. There were some positive results bifurcating all the way from zero up to omega alpha, which is an accumulation point of these bifurcation points. And the case zero. Points. And the case 0 is special and had been dealt by many authors, including a result by Choksi, Noemeyer, and Topaloglu from last year or two years ago, dealing with cases all the way up to five-thirds. Remember that the alpha is between zero and two. So our result basically closes the cases below zero. Below zero, saying that there is nothing, and above omega alpha, which is finite in the case where alpha is between zero and one, and infinite if alpha is between one and two. And pretty much this is optimal, and because this is an accumulation point of the bifurcation points, so we cannot do better than this. And the proofs are sort of very different. And the proofs are sort of very different in nature among themselves and also among the one that I presented before. So, for omega smaller than zero, we use a continuous stein symmetrization. And for omega bigger than omega alpha, we use an argument based on the maximum principle. And the omega smaller than zero proof can be upgraded to deal with smooth solutions as well. Smooth solutions as well. Okay, so let me in the last three minutes let me explain in two slides how to do the last proof. So remember that our setting is going to be the following. So we're going to have some patch that we're going to assume it is not radial and we're going to put it inside a ball of radius r and this point which is the furthest point I'm going to call it x naught. point I'm going to call it x naught okay and this is what I'm going to call d and this one I'm going to call u which is the complement of d inside the the ball of radius r okay so because of what we discussed before any any v state satisfies that the corresponding f which now uh depends on alpha is constant on the boundary okay and let as i said let me take the furthest point Let me take the furthest point from zero and call it x naught and next x zero, I will have modulus r and so now let me pick first an omega big enough such that this function g is an increasing function in x, which I can always do if I select omega to be large enough. If I select omega to be large enough, then just by looking at the expression of f and adding to both sides this term here, then this quantity, the indicator function of u convolved with the potential x to the minus alpha is equal to just this on the boundary. But keep in mind that this is g minus c. Minus C. So this is increasing in X, and therefore it will attain a maximum at X naught. Okay, so now let's compute this quantity here in two ways. So the first one is just direct. And if we do so, differentiating the integral kernels, then we can extract a sign because now these points x naught minus y and x naught. minus y and x naught are all in the same hyperplane because x naught is the furthest point and therefore the tangent at x naught has all the patch on one side and along the boundary as I said the maximum of this function is achieved at x at x naught because g was increasing so then given that the laplacian of the function is positive Of the function is positive, and one can do the actual computation. And applying the maximum principle and the Hough lemma, then we can extract a sign of the gradient, of the normal derivative of this function at that point. But this has the other sign than in the direct calculation. And this contradiction is coming from the fact that we are assuming. fact that we are assuming that d is not is not a disk okay so this proves that the d has to be a disk and therefore therefore the the the the only solutions are disk and if one does the explicit calculations for what is the correct omega that makes this function g increasing one gets precisely the omega alpha that that I mentioned before which is That I mentioned before, which is optimal. Okay, so let me stop here and thank you very much for your attention.
