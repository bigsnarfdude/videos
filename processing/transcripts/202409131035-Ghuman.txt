Okay, so why are we interested in developing orbital-free large-scale quantum mechanical modeling methods? So, the blue is the title of this conference. Any guesses? Why are we doing all this? This conference is so much work. No guess? It's for the students. It's for the students. Yeah, it's for very few people here. So, you guys are in trouble because you have to answer. Why are we doing this? Any guesses? Why are we too? Absolutely. Thank you. Anything else? What is the end goal here? What is the end goal? What is the end goal for DFT? Why the DFT was developed? Yes, for doing calculation, absolutely. Okay, so I'm gonna, because I have only 30 minutes. Oh, sorry. For applications, right? Ultimately, what we want is to use computational modeling for applications. And the end goal is application to have more sustainable devices, to have energy applications, right? To deal with Right to deal with problems like climate change, energy issues, sustainability. That is our end goal. So we want to accelerate the process to, as somebody was saying, insights and numbers, even though this is debatable, numbers. We want to get insights and numbers, but ultimately the goal is to improve the application, to reach to that point faster, much more accurately. Much more accurately, and so on, and to aid experimentalists, right? Okay, so, and when we think about applications, I'm going to talk about the bigger picture here, so sorry about that. When we talk about applications, we talk about materials, like whether it is devices, catalysis, CO2 capture, whatever, right? Materials are not perfect. Most of the materials have defects. It's very hard to synthesize actually single crystals, right? Single crystals, right? And they're very expensive to design single crystals. Most of the materials exist in nature with defects, whether they are point defects, like vacancies, interstitial, substitutional, or line defects like dislocation. So when you have like interfaces, there is strain in materials, and because of the strain, you get dislocations at the interface. Then you have grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials, and then sometimes you have pores, cracks, and so on. Right? So this is naturally existing material. This is naturally existing material. So, what we are looking into is not just very perfect material, but also materials with so many defects. And so, my group is interested in this. We are interested in analyzing defects and disorder in materials. And that's why we work on several applications. So, we work on catalysis applications. So, if you guys know about oxygen evolution reaction, this is very important for green hydrogen. We work on ammonia synthesis, CO2. On ammonia synthesis, CO2 catalysis, reducing CO2 useful fuels and chemicals, CO2 capture, which is not exactly catalysis. Devices, we work on fuel cell devices, batteries, photonic devices, and some tools, not the tools that you guys are working on, but some of the tools to automate defect detection, for example. Or, for example, you have a polymer and you want to detect the footprint on that or any print on that using machine learning. That using machine learning, so we use Raman spectroscopy and machine learning to design that, right? So, these are the applications, but ultimately, the core is to analyze defects and disorder in materials faster, more accurately, so that we can impact these applications. Okay, so today I'm going to take two examples, ammonia synthesis and fuel cell materials. I will try to be fast. Originally, the plan was not to include ammonia synthesis, but I thought it would be interesting. And so, well, this is very briefly. This is my team. We are mainly the users of what you guys are developing. So, if you have a technique that can help us, I'm ready to use it. So, I'm the user of what you're going to do in future, right? So, we use DFT molecular dynamics, some machine learning techniques, and we analyze materials under ground state within light, temperature, pressure, and under different conditions because you cannot avoid them. Most of our projects. Most of our projects, well, 100% of the projects are with experimentalists. So, you know, when it's with experimentalists, you have to really design realistic materials and give realistic mechanisms. And some of the projects are with industry partners, so it's even worse there. So you cannot simply justify doing fundamental analysis. You need to find an application for your work. And the ultimate goal is. Your work. And the ultimate goal is carbon neutral society. Okay, so this is the first example. So, in fuel cells, this is a schematic of SOFC, solid oxide fuel cells. Basically, it has cathode, anode, and cathode. At cathode, oxygen reduces into O negative. It moves through this interface, okay, to electrolyte. There, hydrogen is coming from this side, it combines with the electric, it goes here. It goes here, combines with hydrogen, forms water, and the electrons go here and they produce electricity. This is a very simple definition of SOFC. But if you see it carefully, there are a couple of things happening here. Oxygen moves from cathode to anode, right? That's the main driving force for SOFCs to work. So when oxygen is moving from cathode to electrolyte, it passes through this electro interface. And then, secondly, And then, secondly, when it goes through this electrolyte, it passes through all these grain boundaries. And this affects the efficiency of this fuel cell. Okay. So let's talk about the interface a little bit in detail. So usually YSC is utera-stabilized zirconium. It's the current material used in industry right now. It's the commercial SOFC uses YSC. Okay. And when Okay, and when, since it works at very high temperature, you because there is an interface with cathode, it forms this insulating layer usually. And when you have an insulating layer, oxygen is not able to transfer from cathode to electrolyte, and the efficiency goes down for the cell over a period of time. When we sometimes use protective layers like ceria, and again, you're forming an interface with cira, which is again interesting. And one of the interesting things Interesting. And one of the interesting things about Syria is that when you're forming these interfaces, as you keep on increasing the interfaces, the efficiency goes down, oxygen and conduction goes down. Okay, so what do we need here? We need to understand what's going on. So in an experimental work, it was identified that Siria reduces to CR3 at this interface. That's why it gets insulating, it forms this insulating layer, and the efficiency goes down. So there could be many reasons: strain, compositional change. Reasons, strain, compositional changes, chemical changes, and so on. So, we need electronic-level understanding here. Okay, now we're going directly from devices to electronic-level understanding. So, if you think about the literature, this is what we have been doing so far. We design interfaces by designing just one material, one part of the interface, and introducing defects. Or we take hundreds, about 100, 200 atoms, like zirconia and Syria interface, and we design them like this. interface and we design them like this. Okay, what is the problem here? By designing interfaces like this, we are introducing about 3% of strain. There are two different materials with different lattice constants. And in reality, the strain is about 0.3%. Secondly, the lattice misfit is accommodated through just strain. Usually, in reality, it is accommodated through dislocations. And the third problem is that there is no interdiffusion. Problem is that there's no interdiffusion of atoms. But in experiments, you see interdiffusion of atoms at these interfaces. So, really, when we are modeling this, we are totally analyzing different material. We are not analyzing the interface that exists in reality. So to solve this problem, what we did is we designed the interface using molecular dynamics. Luckily, we had really good force fields. And you can see by using a And you can see by using amorphization and recrystallization, basically we heat and quench the material, two materials. You can reduce the strain, and the strain is accommodated through dislocations. You can analyze several properties like interdiffusion of atoms. Here you can see the interdiffusion as well. Zirconia goes into the ceria, which is a very well-known fact. You can see diffect clustering. If there is any clustering, you can see phase change and so on. Clustering, you can see phase change and so on. So you can actually analyze structural properties and be able to say that I design realistic interface rather than doing the DFT models, right? Okay, now what is the problem? We need an electronic level understanding. Molecular dynamics is still far away. So what we did is we took parts of the sample, the sample that had dislocation or non-dislocation, and we analyzed by using DFT. Okay? That was. Okay, that was the best case scenario. This was what we could do with current methodology, well-established methodology, right? So, what do we need? There are two good solutions, better solutions. One, if we had better force fees, that would have been a good solution. Secondly, if we had large-scale DFT, right, then we don't need this. We can simply do it with DFT because this model is now. Because this model is nanometer scale. And we can really, we don't, this model, the model that we made is approximate model. It's really not helping as much. But this is the best case scenario. So you can clearly see the need. If we have large-scale DFT, you can model these kind of interfaces and grain boundaries. And similarly, a quick example of grain boundaries. So I also said that oxygen goes from cathode to anode. It has to pass through the grain boundaries. And we asked our And we asked our experimental colleagues in Kyushu University in Japan that how many grain boundaries are there that are symmetric, and how many are there that are mixed grain boundaries? There are two kinds, right? And they said about 16% are the symmetry grain, oh, 17% are the symmetric grain boundaries, and rest are mixed grain boundaries. But you know what? In literature, if you see the literature, most of the work is done on symmetric grain boundaries. And very few publications you will see on Mikhail. Very few publications you will see on mixed grain boundaries. And the reason is we don't have the right methodology. It's very, very hard to design symmetric grain boundaries, sorry, mixed grain boundaries and do DFT. Because when you talk about mixed grain boundaries, you're talking about disorder. You're talking about bigger models. So people stick to symmetric grain boundaries where the models are small and you can analyze them by DFT. Since we don't have the methodology, we cannot actually model 80% of the sample, right? The sample, right? So that's a problem. So, here again, we used amorphization and recrystallization. This is the best case scenario I'm showing you guys. We designed the mixed-frain boundary. You can see the disorder. This is the experimental TEM image of the mixed-grain boundary. And you can see the disorder here and the same misorientation angle. We prepared a realistic model. We analyzed the grain boundaries. I will not go into the details, but this is, we analyze different parts of the grain boundaries. And what we actually saw and also We actually saw, and also at different temperatures, we saw the conductivity, oxygen and conductivity. What we saw is that this is single crystal, the black line. Okay. And single crystal is well known that 8YSE, 8% of uteria doping in zirconia is the best sample. And when it comes to symmetric grain boundaries, people say that 8YSC so far, it has been said that 8YSC is the best, again, for symmetric grain boundaries as well. For symmetric grain boundaries as well. But when we talk about mixed grain boundaries, this difference reduces. So, really, we can also use 11 by SE. So, switch-grained boundaries not a good representation of the whole sample. If we really should be concerned about something, that should be mixed-grain boundaries. So, and there is a reason for that. Basically, the defect distribution is more uniform in 8 and 11 than 4 and 14. I will not go into the detail because I really want to make the point. Go into the detail because I really want to make the point here that we do need better force wheels and you know large-scale DFT, right? And if we had large-scale DFT, we could actually design mixed-grain boundaries, go into the electronic level understanding, and be able to say which sample is the best one, what kind of doping we should be doing, right? And this has a direct industry application. This material is currently being used. Is currently being used. All right. So now a quick right now, what we are doing. So now you will say there's another problem here. You will say we analyze few grain boundaries, few mixed grain boundaries, few symmetry grain boundaries, but there are thousands of them. So the grain boundary that we investigated, is that a good representation of the whole, all grain boundaries? Probably not. So what do we need? We need to analyze all these grain boundaries to be able to say what kind of To be able to say what kind of oxygen ion diffusion we are looking here, right? And that's very time-consuming. First of all, you will not get TEM images, right? We saw here in this work that we needed this image to make this brain boundary. Doing TEM analysis experimentally is very hard. So, first of all, we will not be able to get that many TEM images to be able to model these brain boundaries. And it's time consuming. And it's time consuming, it lacks consistency, and so on. There are several problems. So, here we decided to use machine learning, where the idea was we designed these, these are TEM images, these are computationally generated TEM images, right? So, we generated these TEM images. We generated about 1700 images with different nanometer scale of the film thickness with different defocus conditions and different types of. Focus conditions and different types of defects, and we were able to detect point defects in these materials, right? But we are still, it's not there, we are not there yet. We still need to go beyond that. We need to analyze grain boundaries. We are not even there yet. So another way which Sergei is actually working on is to make, is to automatically generate these grain boundaries in the sample, slice them, and be able to use that for training purposes. So we are still working on that. So this is the We are still working on that. So, this is an ongoing work. I just wanted to give this other perspective of this work that maybe machine learning could be really useful here. Okay, another point that I want to make here is another problem that we have with the SOFCs and the grading boundary is that segregation of impurities. So, when they buy samples from industry, the samples usually have like 0.001% of iron or silicon. Silicon is mainly present, always present. And that Always present, and that segregates in the green boundary over time because it works at high temperature. Over time, it segregates and that reduces the efficiency. Right now, the problem here is we wanted to really understand it. Many, many people wanted to understand the segregation behavior. We don't have potentials. Silicon, which is the best, one of the best, one of the most common impurities, we don't have potentials for that. So we ended up analyzing aluminium and iron. Analyzing aluminium and iron only because that's what we had. Experimentally, there is a recent work unpublished, but it's a recent work that shows the impact of these segregations and how different ions behave differently. So if we had good force fields, probably that's another way of accelerating this work where we can, we really are limited with the number of force fields we have. Okay. Okay, so now the second example here is catalysis. We work on a lot of applications, as I said, CO2 capture, blah blah blah. Okay, so I'm going to give you a quick example on how, where, and what you should be thinking when you're developing these methods. So without going into too much detail, ammonia synthesis is a very ammonia is a very important chemical. It will be about 110 billion of industry in 2028. Okay. And it Okay, and it has similar power density and has zero carbon in it. It has several applications. You can see here, mainly it's used in fertilizers, right? We wouldn't be alive today if we didn't have ammonia. But it has application in fuel cells and generating electricity as well. So, if we can produce green ammonia, it has a huge application, right? Currently, there are several problems. Main problem is CO2 footprints. The way we produce ammonia. Footprints. The way we produce ammonia is using iron at very high temperature and pressure, and that leads to about two gigatons of CO2 footprints. So, there are a lot of researchers working on designing a new catalyst. So, when I was in Japan, we decided to work. Iron is currently used. We thought, well, maybe we can mix iron and ruthenium because ruthenium is one of the best catalysts, but it's expensive. Iron, on the other hand, is cheaper, but it gets. Other hand is cheaper, but it gets poisoned. So, why don't we mix them and see if we can make a catalyst that can work better, right? That was the plan. So, there were we did experimental work was done. They created ruthenium iron catalyst. They did some analysis to see which composition is the best. Here, 50% of ruthenium and iron was the best. They also tried to understand the poisoning, and it turned out that this catalyst is poison-free, it doesn't get poisoned, so that's great. Okay, and then they. Okay, and then they the problem: one problem they that happened here is that it was the efficiency was not good. So, so they tried to understand the catalyst and they asked me to do the simulation. This was my model. Okay, this is ruthenium iron alloy system. It has nine active sites. So, I analyzed the model, without going into the details, we analyze the mechanism, I explained why it is not getting poison, and so on. Okay, the problem. Okay, the problem here is the reaction rates are low. So we needed to improve this catalyst. And the limitations of this project, if you go back to the model, are alloy structure. Is it a right alloy structure? Does this alloy structure represent this experimental samples? Absolutely not. Alloys have interesting disorder, right? And this is super crystalline material. And there are only nine active sites. In realistic samples, there can be hundreds of active sites. There can be hundreds of active sites which cannot be analyzed through this model. So, the model is not accurate, it doesn't represent properly the experimental sample. So, there is a huge gap. So, when I came back to Canada, there are these 10 different materials that are available in Canada. The top 10 global producers Canada is. So, I decided to work on ammonia synthesis again, this time with copper and nickel. And I said, Well, I'm not going to make this. And I said, well, I'm not going to make the same model because it doesn't represent the experimental samples realistically. So, in this case, we use generic algorithm and SQS. If you know these methods, basically, you are permuting atoms in this case, like you have initial population and you start permuting and you decide a target property. Here, the target property was the correlation function. And we wanted a correlation function of an ideal random alloy, right? And then, if you get, if you reach. Then, if you get if you reach the target property, great. If not, you change this population through mutation, crossover, and so on. And then you go back to the initial population and you keep on doing this until you reach your target property. It can be anything. Okay, so we use these two methods. SQS was used to calculate the target property and genetic algorithm was used to do the permutation. And now, this time, there was no experiment. So, initially, the project was led by experiments. Here, we are doing just theoretical analysis. We designed different alloys. Analysis. We designed different alloys with different compositions. And now the question is: can we analyze all these compositions? We don't have that much computational power, right? So we calculated deep end structure. We thought that the deep end structure or the center, the one that is close to Fermi level is the best alloy, is the best case scenario. So we took copper 50, nickel 50, which had deband center close to the Fermi level. Now, if you see pure copper and nickel, they are inactive. They don't do ammonia. They are inactive, they don't do ammonia synthesis, they cannot adsorb nitrogen, hydrogen, whatever, right? But in this case, we were able to change the surface densities, and by changing the surface densities, you change the active sites. And guess what? Here, the number of active sites were 96 on this system, which is more realistic compared to what we have been doing so far. And there are thousands of paper using DFT where models are small. We deal with only nine or 10 active sites. But realistically, these are the activities. Sites, but realistically, these are the active sites, and we analyze them one by one. And there were some important insights that we got from here. For example, nitrogen in most of the cases was parallel to the surface when it adsorbs. And the second insight was that the strongest binding site is the bridge on the top side. We could see that the metal nitrogen prefers to adsorb only at highly coordinated metal sites and so on. So we could find these insights. Find these insights. We also analyzed four sites which were able to dissociate nitrogen and analyze their energy structures. And then we went back to our experimental colleagues in Kyushu University and said, why don't you design copper nickel and let us know how it works. According to us, it should work better, right? And that's what they found. The copper nickel showed 21 times higher activity than just copper and three times more than just nickel. Okay. Sorry for all. Okay, sorry for all this, but I'm coming to the OFDFT. So here we try to analyze: okay, now it's not the best catalyst, it cannot replace iron still, right? So the correlation that the important correlation that we found from this analysis is that if you want to make an alloy that works the best, we should have a catalyst with the number of nickel atoms should be higher. It doesn't matter the active site, whatever, is it nickel or copper? Whatever is it, nickel or copper doesn't matter what, but the number of coordinates should have nickel, or the coordinates should be nickel, and the neighboring atoms should be nickel, and the charges on those nickel atoms matter the most. These are two things, highest correlation that we found in all the different properties. So, we thought, okay, well, so all we need is a number of higher number of nickel atoms and higher charge on nickel atoms. So, what if we replace these with different elements? Replace these with different elements, right? So that's basically what we did. We replaced them with different elements, okay. And we tried to find the most stable structures. We calculated the pathways and so on. And clearly, we found that if you have, instead of nickel, you replace it with gold, you can get higher activities or lower barriers for the reaction. Similarly, dissociative pathways in this gold work the best. So you can actually get better catalysts. You can actually get better catalysts, and we try to find some correlations or the descriptors, right? And there was a clear correlation between the dope and charge and some not so clear correlations. So if you are from this field, you probably know spillover energy. Spillover energies is the energy difference between adsorption energy on the host, which is copper nickel, and adsorption energy on the dopant. Usually, when you talk about doped alloy systems, Talk about doped alloy systems, this is considered as one of the good descriptors, but not on single atom doped alloy catalyst. That's what we found. Okay, so this is not a good descriptor. So all this analysis and what we realized is that not all chemical reactions are the same. You know, you change the material, you change the chemical reaction, you need to change the descriptors. You cannot say that this descriptor works for CO2 reduction, it will work for HGR. No, if you read this paper, we talk about. If you read this paper, we talk about different catalysis problems and how the descriptors, even with the different shape and size of the structures, it changes. The descriptor changes, right? So when you are developing these methods, you need to consider these factors. What materials are you developing and for what applications? Now, if you say, okay, can we change the host alloy? So we work on ruthenium iron, copper, nickel. Chondrutlinium iron, copper nickel. What if I want to go with vanadium copper? Right, I can spend another two years doing the same analysis and end up with nothing. Basically, that doesn't work. So the road is quite long. And so we decided to use machine learning and we were looking through the data sets. And I added this because one of the presentation a couple of days ago about data sets. And we thought to use OpenCatalysis database, but it turned out, so this is amazing. It turned out, so this is an amazing database by the way. It's done by Facebook, and there are about 1 million DFT relaxations. Okay, and the structures are huge. And they investigated a lot of adsorbates. So we were like, okay, we don't need to generate data. We can use this data. But can you find CO2 here, carbon dioxide? There was no carbon dioxide. There was no hydrogen. Secondly, you see the energies of the adsorption energies, they range between minus. Energies, they range between minus 10 to 10. That is crazy because these are not stable. These structures are not stable. So we thought, well, it's not useful for us. Let's generate our own data. So we were interested in these because they are available in Canada very, they are abundant. So we designed, we generated our own data for 70 font surfaces with three adsorbits, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide with different 4 to 69 surface sites. So, each, for example, zinc cobalt has 69 active sites. You cannot ignore the sites that are available on these kind of alloys that have intrinsic disorder, right? And then we try to do some simple machine learning analysis to calculate the adsorption energies. So, this is the current ongoing work. We have generated a lot of prop data sets, and we are. Data sets, and we are interested in analyzing or predicting the energies of CO2, hydrogen, and nitrogen. So, we are doing this. Well, I'll using graph neural next, but these are the objectives. So, I'm going to finish soon. Our objective is first is to go from initial structure to relaxed energy. This is the most time-consuming job, as you guys know, right? Optimization of structures of 100 and more than 100 atoms using DFT is the most time-consuming simulation. So, we want to go from initial. Simulation. So we want to go from initial structure to relaxed energy and relaxed structure. Most of the work, if you will see in this catalysis area, they stop here when we have relaxed energies or adsorption energies. But ultimately, we need relaxed structure because if you don't have structure, you cannot do post-processing. You cannot go into the details. You cannot calculate band structures and so on, right? So you need relaxed energies, whether it is adsorption energies or the just the energies of the system, but at the same time, you need those relaxed structures. That's why we are using. Redact structures. That's why we are using graph neural nets. And then ultimately, we want to calculate the properties. So, this is the ongoing work. We have done the first part. It's not published yet, but we are getting decent accuracies. We are training the models on OCP, non-OCP, our data set. It's a tiny data set, but it's a high-quality data set. So, that's another thing that we should be careful about. As someone was mentioning earlier, the data set should be high-quality. It doesn't matter how big it is, right? matter how big is it, right? So here we go. So I hope I convinced you or provided you a different point of view. When you're thinking about method development, think about where are you going to apply this? What is the end goal? So, ultimately, what I want to say is that focus should not be improving just speed and accuracy of the current method, but also on the capability of But also on the capability of modeling realistic materials with defects and disorder. Realistic materials are the key. You need to talk with experimentalists. Ultimately, you need to go to the industry when it comes to simulations and modeling, right?
