Knew how we view it. So, a schematic plot is like this. Now, I follow the tradition and show you some photos. And so, one of the reasons why we study or why we care about these guys are because they are seen in nature. But there are only like a very small number of rivers you can actually see these phenomena. And even for those small number of rivers, you don't get to see them every day, right? You have to be somehow lucky. Every day, right? You have to be somehow lucky. And I wasn't lucky, but I was not a very good photographer, so I have my own photo to share. But some people that we know, they are better photographer or videographer. So one famous place that you can see underla bore or like a slotter board is that it's a suburb river in England. And I'm going to show you a video that was provided to us by Ken McNobin. Okay. I just say open work. Oh, yeah, might be a separate. Oh, so, okay, so it's on my No, I lost my uh so I will bring this uh to oh now I lost it okay here we go and now let me find the play button. I don't want to find this Alright, anyways, I thought it was nice to do videograph, so There's a sound button, I'm not gonna play it. Okay, so close it. Okay, so you got the idea, right? And the Qingtong River in China is famous for its world's largest. Famous for its world's largest bore. And this is a very famous tourist spot, as you see in this photo on the left. There was a conference about a month and a half in Ningbuen, China. The title of this conference was Waterways and Boards. So I guess boards are not technically considered as water waves. And this talk is not entirely relevant for this workshop. It's only about the water waves. So if you have very, very high standard of water waves, you have no High standard of water waves, and don't consider this as water waves. And this is about the statement waves. Okay, anyways, Mike Bierry was at the conference and he went to see this Qingtang River board. This is a very nice nickname called the Silver Dragon and this photo on the right is him. Now, we want to do some math, right? So, Willam and some other people in the 70s proposed to In the 70s, they proposed to use the KDB equation. So, after all, there's some waterways here. The KDB equation, but add some dissipation effect. And the simplest way to do it is add some Burgers type term. So, create a KBB Burgers equation that you see here and use that as a heuristic model for under the boards, provided that this has the correct boundary condition that connects two different water heights and plus and minus. Different water height and plus and minus infinity. And I have to say that there is a large community, both math and math and physics, that uses the KDB equation without burglar and considering the resulting dispersed shock waves as a heuristic model for underbores. But the disk-burger sequence has many standard properties that makes the sequence interesting to study theoretically. Now, from a physical standpoint, From a physical standpoint, you probably want to keep the KDB part and add a smaller dissipation term. But mathematically, the other way around is a lot more convenient. So going from out, I'm going to fix the viscous burgers equation and here mu is the parameter that measures the strength of dispersion relative to this region. And this equation has a lot of symmetry, so without the loss of generality, we can assume that our bore is traveling from That our order is traveling from plus one at infinity to minus one at positive infinity. Alright. Now, Bonnen Schoennock in the 80s, they proved that this KD Fergus equation has a traveling front to a traveling wave solution that satisfies this old E plus boundary condition. And in dynamic systems, this paracletic orbit is sometimes called the front solution as opposed to purse equation, per solution, that's a sorted way. Some sorted wave. And it is not hard to show that the wave speed of this traveling resolution has to satisfy the Rankine Kmoval condition in hyperbolic conservation laws. And with our normalization, this is zero. So we are talking about the stationary solution here. Now, when mu is zero, so if you have a this is Broglos equation, that has a traveling wave solution, traveling form solution in closed form, a separate volume. In closed form, a separate polytension function. In particular, the solution is monotonous function with respect to x, but as new increases, the KDB dispersion effects become more and more prominent. Among many other things, the dispersion makes your solution start. So when you start, then your solution start is no longer a monotone function. This transition from monotone This transition from monotone to oscillate before happens at exactly at mu is one quarter. And by the way, here the side of mu doesn't matter, so you can safely assume that this is positive. Anyways, the situation we have is we have non-ninear PDE and we have a traveling wave solution. So a natural question to ask is vitamin C stable or not. To that matter, we're going to write the solution to the KD reverse equation as a sum of the Equation as a sum of the underlying Front solution plus its perturbation V. And we will say that V is animatorically stable and the perturbation details to zero as time goes to infinity. And the U, what we here as a solution to the non-linear equation. So this is a non-linear stability we're talking about. And also, for the equation and the traveling weight solution are The traveling wave solution are invariant under spatial translation. So, this has to be understood in the orbiter sense. Now, if you do the most naive thing, the energy method, then you have this energy identity. This equation is so simple, so there's no inequality. Everything is exact. Now, for stability, your hope is that the right side is at least not positive. And now, if you look at the right side, there's a negative. And now if you look at the right side, there's a negative sign and then there's quadratic form that comes from this 1D shredding operator with the potential one half of the derivative of our front solution. And our front solution has connects plus one to minus one. And because of that, there has to be at least one negative eigenvalue to this shorter operator. It makes the right side not negative. So what I'm saying here is that the most naive Saying here is that the most night thing does work. Then, Teigo indicated, he suggested that we look at the antiderivative of the perturbation function instead of perturbation itself. And call that the uppercase V. Because if you write down the NS method, NS identity for the uppercase V, then the first term on the right side, the kinetic NS part is the same as before. Is the same as before, but an important difference is that the sign of the potential energy term changes. And if the underlying order condition is monotone, so that the phi prime is negative everywhere, then we have sign control of the second chunk of the right side. But there's one small drawback of this approach. Drawback of this approach. Now, once you integrate up this equation, then you break the symmetry of the equation. So now you have an additional term, this cubic term, that comes from the non-linear term of the equation. But when we consider stability, we tend to say the perturbation is small. And if B is small, then BQ. Small, then B cubed is much smaller than B squared. So overall, we have sign control on the right side. And Pago was able to turn this idea into a stability proof, but this proof makes very strong use of the monotonicity. And it is not clear how to extend this idea to incorporate non-monotonic proprieties, which we have a lot in this inquiry. Which we have a lot in this equation. Also, there is a new evidence dating back to the 70s that suggests that all these KBP burgers from solutions are at least vectorally stable, whether or not the profile is modeled. So, the goal of this project is how we get rid of this monotonistic if we're not going to use monotonistic. If we're not going to use monotonicity, then we don't have to innovate our equation anymore. So we'll back to our original value of u and little v. And we already know that the energy identity for this little v has one bad direction. And to hinder that one back direction, our idea is to use the translation invariance of the equation and solution in a smarter way. To be more specific, To be more specific, we're going to now allow this x0 to be a function of time instead of a constant. In other words, we're introducing temporal modulation, this picture. And a useful way to think of this is that as you evolve your perturbed solution in time, at every instance of time, you're chasing your underlying problem solution in a certain way to minimize some action. Meaning by some action. Anyways, now if we write down the energy identity for this new Zuch Ansas, then first we have the same old term as before, but we have an additional term that we get when the time derivative hits on x naught. And that term is the speed of x naught multiplied by the integral of b prime against b. And we're going to choose the speed of our speech of transfer. The speed of our speech translation to be proportional to this integral multiplier. With that, now we can arrange the right side of the energy into two parts. The first part is the same as before. It comes from the Nonde-Schrodinger equation, and there's at least one negative i with that. Now, if you look at the second term, then this comes from the This comes from the projection of your function in the direction of P prime. And this can be viewed as a rank 1 perturbation of the shredding operator. And since this is rank 1 perturbation, it can move one negative eigenvalue of this unperturbed operator to the other side. So our hope is that f this unperturbed operator has exactly one at the One bad direction, then we control it. So, a qualitative statement or theorem is that a traveling front solution to the KD-Burger's equation is asymptotically and non-linearly and alter stable, provided that this regular equation has exactly one bound state. And we have to take out this option for technical reasons, which example into detail. And if you care about And if you care about which option space that we're proving this theorem, this LP space will be p greater than 2 all the way up to and including infinity. And we were able to prove, we were able to give a pen and paper proof, this is an analysis, that this stability criteria holds true for monotone profiles. In terms of less than or equal to one quarter. Now, in the interest of time, I'm going to skip the remark. But so, our original goal is to get rid of the monotonicity condition requirement, and our parent proof stops when the solution starts to oscillate, right? So, this was the moment that we switched to a computer-assisted program. Now, if we ran a preliminary medics, it looks like Luminar matics, it looks like that the trigging operator has exactly one negative eigenvalue all the way up to 4.1. And beyond that point, a second negative eigenvalue is born, but that does not necessarily imply instability. Anyways, so that was uh uh non-regressive schematics and recently And recently, we're able to provide a rigorous numerator that verifies that this step information holds true or new between 0.2533 and 3.9. And this covers about 95% of the conjectured range of 0.25 to 4.1. And if I have time, I'm going to comment why missing these two edges. Missing these two edges. But, anyways, for the remaining time, I'm going to go through how we do this computer. Now, it's a step zero before we do anything else. So, we're going to consider this zero energy Schwartz equation together with the boundary condition that the solution of plus one at plus infinity. Then, thanks to that, the strong oscillator theorem. Strong oscillation theorem, the number of bound states of our shredding operator is the same as the number of zeros of the solution to this problem in the box. And the right side is a lot better suited for comparison because you only solve one equation and count the number of zeros instead of searching for eigenvalues in the dark. So, that what we're doing is that we're going to solve both the p equation. Both the V equation, the traveling Front solution equation, and this Schwarzenegger equation. And we're going to write both equations as the system of first-order ODEs. And for the P equation, for phi equation, we have boundary conditions both at plus minus infinity. And for V equation, we have only boundary conditions at plus infinity. So it's somehow like an interval problem. And a basic of a computer assisted proof. A computer assisted proof, if you haven't done it yet, then you have to do all your computation in integral arithmetic. That means every number is now becoming an integral to control rigorously the rounding error. And for this project, we use the intra-propagate that's written in that slot. Alright, so actually this slide is busy, but this is less than half. Is less than half of our work. Now, once you fix your problem, then now you're going to somehow produce the solutions both phi and v and its derivatives. Now, our solution lives in a whole bound domain R. And this is never good news for numerics, rigorous or non-rigorous. But thankfully, our solution approaches two boundary conditions, xm. Two boundary conditions accomplished fast. That's proof. So we're going to use that. So at near negative infinity, minus infinity, so we're going to make a solution on just phi is 1 plus exponential zomatic series. And this is inspired by some methods called the parameterization method by the Carlberg and other people, and that has been already used for comparisons proof before us. Anyways, so we make this. Anyways, so we make this solution on that plug into the equation and then we make a lot of estimates on this coefficients by hand, by induction, so that later we're going to truncate this empty series by finite minute terms. Then we have a rigorous analytic control of our error. Okay? But then the computer sense probe or the computer symbol comes in to verify the initial step of our induction. Initial step of our induction. So once you pass the first induction, then everything can be improved. And we just do the same thing on negative and plus infinity. Here the solution oscillates, but otherwise it's the same idea. So you take care of both negative infinity and plus infinity, and you're left with a finite domain. And in this finite domain, And in this finite domain, you make a grid point, and in each grid point, you're approximating your solution with Taylor series. This is not the smartest way to approximate your solution, but it is the easiest step. And we do the same thing. So, what we have is we're dealing with only finite interval and finite many points, and it's finite many points. points and its finitely many points, its finite point, we have finitely many coefficients. And then we're going to quote this big theorem called Newton-Control's theorem and this is a user-friendly version of fixed point theorem or contraction weapon theorem or a computer proof. So you prove regular proof once you bound, then you get the unique existence of exact Existence of exact solution to your problem in some neighborhood of your numerical approximation together with a rigorous error balance. But of course, you have to verify a lot of things that I'm not here. Alright, so at this point, we have solution for phi everywhere with the regressing closure of the solution everywhere. Closure of the solution everywhere, and we have a rigorous closure and closure of the solution B of our Schrodinger equation, but away from minus infinity because we don't have any information. So that we have to do another pen and paper proof to ensure that there are no zeros at negative infinity for our Schradinger equation. So we ended up doing more penetrative proof than we thought. More kind of proof than we thought we needed to do. Anyways, so this after this, what you have is if you give me any value of mu, and then I can show you what the solutions are, and I can tell you this stability criteria is better or not. But we want to have a theorem for an interval of mu, that a single value mu, and that actually takes most of our computing time. Takes most of our computing time. So, what we do is that now we're coding this theory of analytic integration. Now, every coefficient in the previous steps now becomes an analytic function of our crown mu. And we're going to approximate each and every analytic function by some chaptership parameters. And then we can And then we can open it up from one single point to a small interval with the rigorous error bound. So to give you some idea, near infinity, so these are some simple small intervals of mu that we computed. And theta, there's some parameter that appears in this rigorous enclosure solution. So this is a parameter. Enclosure with solution. So, this is a problem that you have to tune to get this principles of this exponential series. And n is the number of terms that you have to take in your infinite series. And rho is another parameter that appears in this analytic interpolation. And n is the degree of check polynomial that you need, and time is. Need and time is in and so this is a plot of what the solution looks like and the solution V up to the shredding requisition. And I think this is more interesting. And now I have to slide this slide again. Alright, so we were showing the movie output D as a function of the prompt. D as a function of parameter nu, starting from 0.26, and then all the way pass 4.1. And what you see is that there is a big negative slope, so there is one episode always. And then at some point, it starts to go up. Then I can do it another zero far out at the new. zero far out at the negative infinity. And so when this turns around and the starts go up, that's exactly when you gain the second negative eigenvalue. Okay, so that's the end of the story. And here are some ongoing projects and future projects. But I think my time is up, so I'll stop here. Questions?
