So, what I want to do is tell you about in the next 10 minutes the basic ideas associated with a preprint which just has been posted a few months ago, which you can see on the right side. I don't have my arrows, so I can't just control anything right now on my screen, which is associated with the question of how to grow a flat leaf. And I want to start with a picture, which I think is from Enrico Cohen's group from about 15, almost 20 years ago now. Almost 20 years ago now, very beautiful paper showing how they were able to use genetics to essentially control the growth patterns in a snapdragon leaf and then convert a flat leaf to something which looks like a potato chip. And since then, more or less, many people have shown that in fact, you can think about leaf morphology as a consequence of inhomogeneous growth, different parts of the leaf growing relative to each other. They're not essentially able to be compatible in order to keep a flat leaf flat. And a consequence Flat. And the consequence of that is that the leaf starts to essentially curl. And so one can create phase spaces of this. And the simplest picture that I'd like everybody to be reminded of, I think everybody knows over here, but I nevertheless like to say it, is it's very easy to deform a thin sheet in three dimensions because it's essentially very thin compared to its other two dimensions. It's extremely easy to deform because energetically it's extremely inexpensive. But most leaves are approximately flat. And so this begs the question. Flat. And so this begs the question of how this is possible. And the answer, I think everybody more or less, I think, would also agree on, which is that you need feedback from both shape and or strain in order to maintain flatness. And this is the topic that I'd like to spend the next few minutes on in the context of some very nice experiments published about a year, year and a half ago by Iran Sharon's group from Israel, who basically have started to measure patchy growth and fluctuation. Patchy growth and fluctuations. And then there are other people who've also been involved, different groups, I think in France, R.S. K. Budog, Olivia Hamant, and many others whose names I'm sorry I won't be able to remember right away. And there's a very interesting review from some of the people at this conference right now published last year in the context of asking how fluctuations may shape plants for properception. So, the fact that you need feedback essentially says that the plant needs to have a sense of itself or the leaf needs to have a sense of itself. And I want to essentially tell you. And I want to essentially tell you about how we've been thinking about this in the next few minutes. And unfortunately, this is going to be somewhat technical, but I hope to give you an intuition for the mathematics. So the fundamental question is, if I have a spatially distributed system, such as a leaf or a shoot, how can one part of it communicate with another in order to essentially end up with the prescribed shape? And so in this case, we're thinking about a flat or approximately flat object. It can grow at different locations and the growth at different locations. Locations and the growth at different locations not being the same can essentially lead to fluctuations out of the plane, or and the upper surface can grow relative to the lower surface, or vice versa, and also give rise to non-flat shapes. If I was thinking about the linearized equations, then the linearized equations for what happens in the plane and what happens out of the plane, I've written down on the top right over here, and they correspond essentially to saying that growth in the plane leads to strains in the plane. Plane leads to strains in the plane, and growth out of the plane leads to deformations out of the plane. So, phi in this case is something called the area stress function. The only thing that you need to worry about is that the Laplacian of Phi essentially controls the relative changes in the area from one location to the other. W corresponds to the out-of-plane deflection, and Laplacian of W corresponds to the mean curvature. And the right-hand side is the growth in the plane as a function of space and time in the first equation, omega, and lambda corresponds to growth from one. From one of the top layer relative to the lower layer, or vice versa. And these equations would tell you how the shape changes because of growth. But as I said, we need feedback. And the most general linear feedback law that you can write down basically says how omega and lambda, omega corresponding to the in-plane growth, and lambda corresponding to the outer plane growth relate to the stresses and strains in the plate. And I've written down the most general linear form. So essentially a convolution. So essentially, a convolution tells you how the in-plane and the out-of-plane forces and deformations feed back onto the growth rates themselves. But unfortunately, this is not closed unless I tell you what these convolution parameters, G1, 1, G2, 2, and so on and so forth, which tell you essentially how growth in the plane corresponds to or feeds into stresses and strains out of the plane. The simplest local form that you can write down. Local form that you can write down is what I've written down on the bottom left now, which says that area changes relate per unit time relate to whatever the current change, current shape is through a pre-factor alpha. And then there are some noise terms, the fluctuation terms that I told you about. And similarly, the same thing for the out-of-plane dot. So phi again is the Addis stress function, which tells you about how things change in the plane. W corresponds to the deformation out of the plane. Response to the deformation out of the plane. I'll just tell you the result. It's not terribly hard to calculate, but I'll tell you the fundamental result. And the fundamental result is the question that I raised in the beginning, how hard or how easy it is to essentially keep the leaf flat. In order to keep the leaf flat, all normals should be pointing in exactly the same direction. And if you go through a little bit of algebra associated with these now coupled equations, the first two at the top and the last two associated with Laplacian of phi and Laplacian of W, you find a result. You, you find a result which tells you that the angle-angle correlations diverge logarithmically. In other words, as I go further and further apart, the angles will not be correlated. And the reason they won't be correlated intuitively is associated with the fact it's very, very easy to essentially bend a flat sheet, particularly on long distances, because if I bend it on long distances, the curvature is very small. And energetically, if the curvature is small, it's very easy to do so. So that means this calculation tells us that it's very, very difficult with local feedback to Very difficult with local feedback to essentially control the shape of a leaf and keep it flat. So, what does that tell us next? We have to worry about non-locality. And so, the simplest non-local generalization of the linear feedback law that I just wrote down, I've written down again over here with a specific form. And the specific form is that if there are any signaling processes at play, then it takes a certain amount of time for whatever happens at one location of the leaf to affect what happens at a different location. Belief to affect what happens at a different location in belief. I've assumed a simple exponential kernel, e to the minus gamma t minus t prime. Gamma characterizes a character is associated with a characteristic time scale, and that time scale tells you how long it takes for, or how long it takes in time for a signal at one location to essentially make its influence felt everywhere else. And when you work through the calculations associated with the deterministic part, you find, first of all, that in the absence of feedback, it's impossible to keep the leaf. It's impossible to keep the leaf flat. Alpha positive and beta positive are necessary. Alpha corresponding to the local contribution, beta corresponding to the non-local contribution. Important to essentially keep the leaf flat. If alpha is negative or beta is negative, you get unstable growth, either on short wavelengths or on long wavelengths. And if you introduce now noise terms, you find that you can indeed keep the leaf flat as soon as you have these. Soon as you have these non-local in time feedback terms without necessarily telling you, because I don't know what the molecular mechanisms are. And in this case, then you find that the normal normal correlations do go to zero as Q, the wave number goes to zero. That means on long length scales, and of course, it's also true on short length scales. So you can stabilize growth of a leaf on both short and long length scales if I have this non-local feedback. Have this non-local feedback that I've indicated on the top left of this transparency. And my last slide is: we've then gone back to analyze some of these very beautiful experiments from Eran Sharon's group, where they measured changes in area of the leaf as it's growing. So they hadn't measured normal-normal correlations. And when we try to fit it, as I've shown you on the right side, to the simple linear theory, we find interestingly that we get, we are. That we get, we are able to essentially explain, explain in quotes because it's a fit rather than a real molecular explanation. We are able to understand the area correlations, patchy area correlations associated with growth that they've seen and find a power law using this non-local feedback term that I essentially showed you. We cannot explain it with the local feedback. Okay, so I will stop. I think I'm pretty much out of time. I hope that this at least gives you some intuition for a potential path for stabilizing a flat leaf to grow so that it has feedback from both in-plane and out-of-plane deformations. And the spirit of what Anya Keitman asked, there are some questions. First, there are experiments needed. Forgive me if I don't know about them, experiments associated with normal, normal fluctuations. What are the different molecular What are the different molecular mechanisms that essentially couple shape back to growth, and how do they essentially control things locally and non-locally? And everything that I've told you today is associated with linear theory. How can we start thinking about non-linear effects if and when they are important in the context of, for example, asking about pulsatile growth, waves, flutter, and so on and so forth. Thank you so much. Thanks a lot, Madam. We do have time for questions. I see the first one in the room, Veronica. Hi there. I don't see you yet on the screen, but my question is, it's super elegant, your analysis. I was wondering about the time scales. If you think about this leaf growth and the feedbacks involved, could you make any predictions about how quickly a response would have to feedback? So, the feedback you're talking about, how quickly it has to be in tune with those perturbations for it to remain flat, is there anything that you can say about the dynamical progression of such a process? So that's not an easy question to answer because different leaves have different sizes. So, if you go to the tropics, you can get leaves which are of the order of a meter in size. And of course, over there, gravity starts to become very important as well. Gravity starts to become very important as well because the leaf can't remain flat just because of the forces of gravity. So, on smaller scales, the time will be less, on larger scales, the time will be more. If I think about diffusive processes, and that's the simplest null hypothesis, most processes associated with signaling are faster than diffusive. But if I think about diffusive processes, the characteristic time that it would take for a signal to essentially traverse a length L would be L squared over D. L would be L squared over D. And so as the leaf becomes larger and larger, it becomes harder and harder to control it. So I'm not sure I can say a lot more than that because I need to know something about the mechanisms, which essentially are telling you how one location in the leaf is communicating, or one part of the leaf is communicating with another. I'm afraid I don't, I mean, I can get you and tell you some simple scaling estimates, but beyond that, it's hard for me to say anything unless we actually able. Say anything unless we actually able to measure experimentally what the active processes are. Thank you. I see Enrico waving his hand. So go ahead. Oh, by the way, let me say I can only see some of the participants at any given moment. And so I may miss you if you just wave your hand and then that's it. You can, somewhere on the Zoom, there's an opportunity for raising your hand. And so it stays. Your hand, and so it stays permanently there. And each platform is a little bit different, so I can't tell you exactly how to do it. As I say, each platform is a little different. It looks different on my Zoom than on yours. Okay, but and if I miss you, speak up. Okay, so Enrico. Yeah, no, thank you very much for that very interesting talk. I suppose I Very interesting talk. I suppose I found myself right at the beginning of the talk, you said we all agree there has to be feedback. And of course, being a questioning individual, I straight away asked, is that the case? So there's two things I would point out. First of all, if you look at the length of your arms, they're exactly the same length, pretty much, and yet there's no feedback. There's no feedback between the growth of one arm and the other arm. There's no correction mechanism. The other thing is, we know there are mutants that create a wavy leaves and so forth. A wavy leaves and so forth, or cup-shaped leaves. So, you'd have to argue that in all these mutants are affecting the feedback mechanism because clearly the leaves aren't flat. So, I'd just like to ask a general question. Actually, is it the case necessarily that there has to be feedback? I mean, the leaf has a certain thickness, and as long as growth is uniform enough, do you actually need feedback? So, maybe address the question, the analogy, I don't think it's the correct analog. Address the question: the analogy, I don't think it's the correct analogy to essentially say that one arm and the other arm are the same, and therefore there isn't, and they're not interacting with each other, and yet they're the same length, because there is feedback within the growth of every arm. That's a different question altogether. I'm happy to talk about that. I don't think that is the right analogy. But the point is that the arms, there's no connection between one arm and the other arm, there's no cross-checking. That's the point. So the fact that they end up with the same length. That they end up at the same length, all right, has to do with the fact that you can have feedback within the armor, yeah. Yeah, yeah, one armor. So, so, um, your question about so I don't disagree with you that there can be places where without feedback, you can get a final result. If you want to get, however, a robust result, I think that you would expect to have some level of feedback. Now, if I'm not sure where you're going. I'm not sure where you're going with this. So, if you're saying that you can grow a flat leaf without feedback, the answer is yes, you can, but then you would have to have some mechanism which essentially makes sure that homogeneity is present at all scales at every place. If that is to say, everybody's got to be doing the same thing all the time. If I have fluctuations, which we know exist, you may have local feedback rules, which may be able to correct. My point and the My point, and this is the only point of the calculation that I tried to essentially give you an intuition for, is that local feedback rules don't seem to suffice at least at the linear level in order to keep the leaf flat once I introduce fluctuations. So let me be very precise now. If we introduce fluctuations either in in-plane growth or in out-of-plane growth, local rules do not suffice to give you a flat leaf. On the other hand, if I have non-local, non-local in time in this. Non-local, non-local in time in this case, feedback that seems to be sufficient, not seems to be, it is sufficient to essentially keep the leaf flat. Is this true? I don't know. Until someone tries to do an experiment or says that the mechanisms associated with linear theory are irrelevant, I won't be able to tell you one way or the other. Does that help at all? I think it revolves around the question, what you mean by feedback, I think. What you mean by feedback, I think, because I think what you're saying is if growth is regular, for example, if you have a diffusible substance that controls, that ensures that growth in one place is similar to growth in another place, all right, from a certain distance. So is that in your view feedback? So, but I don't want to hog the discussion because I'm aware other people might have questions, but it doesn't, what I'm left with thinking, and the arm example is another one, is I don't really understand, which is my problem, what you mean by feedback. What you mean by feedback, I suppose? Maybe I can just say that, answer that question in a sentence. Growth inhomogeneously leads to stresses. Stresses can change shape. The question is, do the stresses and strains associated with the growth feedback on growth? Mathematically, all I'm asking is, is the growth independent or is it dependent on the shape? If it is dependent, I call that feedback. And that was exactly what I tried to quantify in that very simple framework. Quantify in a very simple framework. Thank you. Gabriela had a question, had a hand raised. Answer in the very last part. I was about to ask us to see if I was understanding correctly if the type of feedback was based on the stresses and the curvature that was generated in the growing leaf. And maybe just to be sure if I'm understanding the long-range feedback you are hypothesizing would be. You are hypothesizing would be of such range that the extension, which the local stress fluctuation would not be present. Long range would be far away from where you can measure that stress fluctuation that you are, that is causing, that you are using for getting this feedback. I want to understand how long ranges this require long-range feedback. I don't know if I'm making myself clear, like there's maybe a Myself, clear, like there's maybe it could use okay. So, maybe I can answer this. Uh, the assumption that we made was that it's non-local in time, okay. And the reason it's non-local in time is we basically deduced by asking if I have a particular molecule which is diffusing from one location to the other, it takes a certain amount of time for its influence to be felt further and further away from the source. Yeah, so how long or how short now depends on the relative time scales associated with the scale of the leaf compared to the rate at which the molecule that I'm essentially secreting is either degrading and/or diffusing. So there is a parameter, and the parameter is associated, as I said, with the characteristic diffusibility of. Of the morphogen, which may be controlling how quickly or how slowly growth responds to the strain, relative to the characteristic size of the patch over which you are thinking about introducing this non-locality. It could be the whole leaf, but it doesn't have to be the whole leaf. So I'm not able to give you quantitative estimates. I can only tell you about scaling ways of thinking about this. Okay, so the idea would be that there's a diffusible molecule that do. That link is connected to an increase of stress. Sorry to interrupt, but we need to stick to the schedule. I would appreciate if we could keep some of the questions and we'll press that also a question for the breakout a bit later. We need to move on. And our next speaker will be Tatiana Groshkova from the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics in Kazan. And she's interested in growth and She's interested in growth and cell wall composition. So, how the chemical and the physical properties of cell wall impeach on growth patterns. And today, she's going to talk about tertiary cell wall and how they control growth of crops, fiber crops. Well, I don't know what to say. Good day or good morning. Don't know what to say good day, good morning, or good evening because it is so much different for all of us. But, anyhow, hello to everybody. And indeed, I would talk about the mechanical role of fibers with tertiary cell wool. And let me share the screen so that it would be a good idea. And I hope you can see that. Yes, we can. Okay, good. So, the ongoing project that we are working on is devoted to the role of mechanical factors in plant in. In plant in herbasses, plant development. And we all know that the major parameters that determine the mechanical properties of a plant tissue are the value of toker pressure and the composition and structure of the cell wall. And there are several types of cell walls within plant tissues. The primary that is present in all tissue type, the more rigid secondary cells are the same. The more rigid secondary cell wall that is present in some specialized tissues, and tertiary cell wall, which is present in some fibers. It is also known as G layer, and it can provide tension and causes emergence of additional mechanical stress. So, how all these tissues with different mechanical properties live together within the same plant and what kind of And what kind of information or what kind of factors image due to that during plant development is. We try to study on the example of, sorry, on the example of flats plant, which is quite remarkable from many points of view. First of all, it is a very simple structure. The stem is relatively uniform and with small leaves, no branching, and so on. It is very well characterized anatomically, and the various zones are well defined. And there are tissues with all three cell wall types, like parenthema with primary xylem tissues with secondary cell wall and flow fibers with tertiary. It is quite a remarkable plant architecti, which has a height of around one meter. Around one meter with the diameter of only two millimeters, and it is outstanding even among the plant tissue, the plant species. If you consider the pattern formation during plant development, we shall start with the very apical part of a stem and it is the very top millimeters of stem. And here we would have a very simple pattern which is Very simple pattern, which is basically the ground tissues and some surrounding envelope that has more differentiated tissues like vessels, fibers, epidermis and so on. Later on, roughly at the region of two centimeters, the cambium ring is formed. And this is the end of elongation zone of the stem. And it is the beginning. And it is the beginning of secondary cell wall deposition. So usually the induction of cambium green is related to the load from the upper part of the stem. And this is considered as the reason for chemical indifferentiate, mechanical reason, let's say, of chemical. So the pattern changes like that. Changes like that. To add to that, there are so-called intrusively growing fibers. So the fibers with primary cell wall, which increase their length so that individual cell reach in average a couple of centimeter. Later on, there is another change in the pattern, and this can be easily manually determined at certain position, roughly at 10 centimeters from the. Roughly at 10 centimeters from the top, a plant gets much more mechanically strong, so that you need a larger weight to break it. This region can be visualized in plants in the field or what it is not quite mechanical stable and then the various factors this part can bend. The this part can bend while the rest of the stem stands still. So, this is so-called snap point, and it of course moves up when a plant develops. The reason for this increase in mechanical strength is due to development of mature layer or mature G layer, let's say. So that if you see the check the cross-section, you see. Check the cross-section, you see the fibers with developed thick wall are highly cellulosic, and it would be a cross-section below snap point. So the question, if in this case we know that it is plant weight, the weight of the body apart, the first question is what are the mechanical factors that induce tertiary cell wall deposition at specific point of a stem? Right here. What are those factors? What are those factors that can be important to this case? Jana, Tatiana, could you switch off your video? Your voice is interrupted at times, and if you switch off your video, you have more bandwidth. Okay. I'll try. Just a second. I have to go back to
