Thank you for hanging on. This will be a little bit of a change of pace because I'll come to this from a much more applied point of view. And I guess maybe I'll just give a little bit of an introduction because a lot of the work that I do is based on running prevention trials for endometrial cancer. So we are Cancer. So we are currently have. So I start thinking about surrogate markers in that context because we're running currently a feasibility trial, which after it ends in a year, we're going to be proposing an effectiveness trial to see whether or not the prevention that we're proposing will be effective. And that we really need to start thinking about what are we going to use as an endpoint to evaluate effectiveness. And so this is how I started thinking about this. Started thinking about this. And I feel like my thinking, my pathway is a little bit different than what we've seen this morning. So hopefully this will be useful to add to what we've already looked at. So first of all, I would like to start by saying that I live and work on the traditional ancestral and unceded territory of the Coast Salish people. That's the Squamish, Sailor Tooth, and Musqueam nations. So, a brief outline of my talk. I'll start by giving a bit of the epidemiology of endometrial cancer, which is the gynecological cancer that I study the most and focus on in my research. I'll talk a little bit about the etiology of the disease and some approaches that have been used for preventing it. And then I will continue to discuss some surrogate markets that have been proposed and how I'm looking at using causal discussion. I'm looking at using causal discovery to think about these markers and how to use them in the future. I will sort of preface this by saying that probably by the end of the talk, you'll see that I have more questions than answers. And so that's what I'm hoping that we'll be able to have some discussions and then you can help guide future thoughts on that. So, first of all, in the mutual So, first of all, endometrial cancer is cancer of the uterus. That's 95% of the cancers in the uterus occur at the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. And anyone is the most common gynecological cancer in the developed world, and I will say also the developing world. Anyone with a uterus is at risk for getting endometrial cancer. There's an increased incidence and mortality. An increase in incidence and mortality, unlike most other cancers. So we're expecting that in the next 10 years, 50% increase in incidence and doubling in mortality. We're also seeing increasingly the cancer impacting younger women. So the age of diagnosis is consistently decreasing, and more and more women are being diagnosed younger. And this is tracking rates of obesity, which is the Of obesity, which is the primary risk factor for endometrial cancer. However, there is good news. If detected early, this cancer is pretty much curable if it hasn't spread beyond the uterus. And so just a simple hysterectomy would remove the uterus and the cancer that's in it and will cure the patient. So that's really good news and really good for early detection and screening. Early detection and screening. Also, there is a precursor lesion that precedes endometrial cancer. So, if we are able to identify the cancer before it even develops, that's even better. And there are prevention strategies that are effective, and we know that. I'll talk about those in a bit. But sadly and unfortunately, there are no current screening or prevention strategies in the general population. I will also add that probably the I will also add that probably the reason for that is because this cancer has been like historically severely underfunded compared to other areas. So people haven't really worked. And because it's a good outcome, cancer hasn't really received. But now I feel like things are starting to change because of those increasing curves, which are very alarming. One thing to also add is that most of those who survived the cancer die of Survive the cancer die of cardiovascular disease, which are comorbidities associated with obesity. In fact, it's more likely that at five years post-diagnosis that someone will die of cardiovascular disease than they would die of the cancer. And there's a very large racial disparity, and primarily that's associated. Well, we don't know why exactly. It could be It could be a hereditary component that's associated with race, or it could be socioeconomical status, or it could be just cultural differences that may be associated with race as well. So in order to sort of understand a little bit how the cancer arises, we'll just step back and look at a normal menstrual cycle. The uterus is a very hormone. The uterus is a very hormone-responsive organ, and we could totally see that when we consider a menstrual cycle. So, in the first part of the menstrual cycle, the first four days, that's when the lining of the uterus is shed through menstruation. After that, in the presence of estrogen, it encourages proliferation. So, that's the proliferative phase. It encourages cells to grow so that it reconstructs the lining of the uterus. Of the uterus in profaration for ovulation. And in the second part of the cycle, progesterone kicks in to counteract estrogen and so that it stops the proliferation, but now it increases the vascularity and it prepares the uterus for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, both hormones will drop and will start the cycle again. Now, what happens if for whatever reason we don't have? If, for whatever reason, we don't have a progesterone, then what happens is that the uterus is just going to continue to proliferate. And what will happen is that these cells will take over in a way and they will start increasing and crowding and forming these gland shapes. So this becomes something that we call hyperplasia. And hyperplasia could turn into develop at. Turn into develop atypia, which then develops endometrioid cancer. So there's really two types of endometrial cancer. The endometrioid type is what's mostly known with the cycle. These other less common types are kind of a different etiology. But so I'm focusing on those individual cancers in my research. And what we know from studies in From studies, is that there's a 3 to 5% chance to go from endometrial hyperplasia to cancer. If ATYPI is found, then there's a 12 to 50% chance. So that's a true precursor, atypical hyperplasia or endometrial entrapilphelial euplasia, which is the technical term, is truly a precursor lesion for the cancer. So, all this to say that, you know, the model to The model to, or sort of what drivers, the primary four drivers of endometrial cancer are unopposed estrogen, which is what's been mostly studied a lot till today. But I think more recently, there are three additional pathways to developing the cancer, and those are chronic inflammation, hypertension, and hyperinsulinemia, which are independent, but could also be correlated with unopposed estrogen. Correlated with anophosed estrogen. And orchestrating all of this is obesity. And there is a dose-response relationship between obesity and incidence, meaning that the longer someone has been exposed to obesity, so the longer they've been abused, the higher the likelihood of them developing cancer. Of course, that's associated with poor lifestyle, but also age, because again, But also age, because again, as we get older, the longer we have the chance to be exposed to obesity and to be exposed to have unopposed estrogen. So there are a lot of reproductive factors, early onset of period, late menopause, parity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and inalvulation. So this happens a lot with women who are experiencing infertility. There are exogenous estrogen exposures. Exogenous estrogen exposures, for example, those that have taken tamoxifen to treat breast cancer, or those who are taking hormone replacement therapy, especially if they're taking a single hormone estrogen, as opposed to both estrogen and progesterone. We also know that there are a lot of endocrine disrupting environmental factors, exposure to pollutions and chemicals, that may both impact the risk, may increase the exposure to estrogen, but also. Exposure to estrogen, but also impact in the mutual cancer risk. And of course, there are hereditary factors which impact probably all of these things, as well as in the mutual cancer incidence. And so when you take taking all of this into account, it's a very complex picture and lots of things to take in. And really, the interventions are not a single intervention, it's often multiple interventions. That's often multiple interventions. So, for example, the feasibility study that we are running is addressing the unopposed estrogen, but it's also addressing obesity. And so, simultaneously looking at those. And so we're trying to find like what are we going to do to measure whether they're effective or not. Now, before I move on from this graph, I want to just sort of preface the next slide so that this may look like a nice causal graph, but it's an oversimplification. Graph, but it's an oversimplification of what reality is. And wouldn't it be nice if we knew exactly that these are how things are related to one another and the directionality of all of this? These are mostly risk factors that have been looked at and they're association measures and not a puzzle. So, for prevention strategies, we know of a few things that work. So, the most radical one is hysterectomy. Of course, if you don't have Hysterectomy. Of course, if you don't have a uterus, you're not at risk of uterine cancer. But of course, that leads to loss of fertility, especially for premenopausal women who are increasingly at increased risk. Also, surgery could be very patient for patients with morbid obesity. And we're not talking being overweight here. Like a lot of the patients that we see with endometrial cancer have BMI over 40, but these are really. 40. But these are really very like extremely, extremely obese patients that operating tables cannot hold them. They have to have special operating tables, special MRI to detect their cancers and so on. And also, if we just cure endometrial cancer, we have a missed opportunity to prevent the death from comorbid disease. Other strategies. Other strategies that have been considered are chemo prevention, so hormone therapies, oral progestins, or intrauterine device. These are IUDs. The IUDs are like contraceptives that have a very low dose of progesterone, which have been shown to be extremely effective at reversing hyperplasia and even reversing cancer if it's in the early stage and not a very aggressive form of cancer. Form of cancer. But also, other people are starting to look at now in light of these new pathways that to do to get to endometrial cancer, they've started looking at diabetes medications. So metformin, for example, maybe in combination with some of these hormone therapies. And other people are looking at obesity medications like orlistat, for example. And those are very interesting preventative approaches. Of course, though. Of course, though, I think the key thing that works is weight loss. But of course, weight loss is very hard. So in the brute force approach, folks have looked at bariatric surgery and the probability of that reducing risk of endometrial cancer. And it's quite effective, 50 to 70% reduction in incident cancer. So, this is what a study that looked at all cancers among those. Cancers among those that have had bariatric surgery. But what was interesting is a lot, is some of the findings of those studies. And again, these were not randomized studies, they were just observational studies. They saw mostly differences in female cancers, not in really male cancers that were associated with obesity, but in female ones, particularly breast and uterus. And they found them not to be. And they found them not to be very, perhaps not very cost-effective, not very effective because the number needed to treat was 56 in order to prevent one of these female-specific cancers over 10 years. So it was not recommended to be a good prevention approach necessarily. Not to mention that there is risk also associated with that intervention. Other interventions, the weight loss. Interventions, the weight loss, for example, they're very difficult because weight loss, often, as measured in observational study, could be attributable to illness that causes weight loss. So people have to look at intentional weight loss, and that's often not often measured. But the Women's Health Initiative has looked at it, and they did see a lower decrease of the type one endometrial cancer, endometrioid cancer that I'm considering. Cancer that I'm considering. The only thing to mention here is that we, you know, it's very difficult to measure weight loss sustained over time. And how long do you need to measure it? And when do you need to intercept it in order for it to have this effect? Those are all still open questions. So here are the challenges that we have with these prevention effectiveness evaluation. Effectiveness evaluation. So, in specifically, maybe in other diseases, it's different, but in cancer, there are very few randomized trials for preventions. First of all, these are very, and so we rely mostly on observational data. So they take too long to evaluate. It's very hard to motivate funding agencies to fund these types of trials where you're going to have to wait 20 years before you could. 20 years before you could learn the outcome. Often the outcome is incidence of cancer is still fairly rare, despite endometrial cancer, despite it being the most common gynecological cancer, it is still like a 3% lifetime risk for the general population. So we're trying to look in our clinical, in our intervention, we are Intervention, we are looking at high-risk populations, so we are potentially trying to determine who's at increased risk for cancer before we give them the intervention, which may increase the prevalence. And so, you know, we get a little bit more, a few more events, but generally they're rare. And it could take again for someone if we're intervening at age 50 to prevent the cancer, they may not be really getting it until the age of 50. Getting it until the age of 60, 65, and so that's a very long time. Also, it's very difficult to recruit participants into these trials. And these are people that are seemingly healthy. They don't have any problems. And so, if you're trying to tell them, okay, here you go, you're going to come and you're going to do this intervention, or maybe take this drug, the drug may have some side effect that they may not be willing to put up with. Be willing to put up with, and or there may be a way to sort of learn about the markers. You may have to go and do a biopsy, and that's painful, and they don't want to do this. And even like the IUD, the intraaturine device that we're using in our trial is still not an unpainful procedure. Like there is a little bit of discomfort that's associated with that. So, folks are often a little bit reluctant to join these studies, and there's a high rate of attrition. And so, maybe, for example, someone that would And so maybe, for example, someone that would start a lifestyle intervention may not want to stick with it for the duration of the 15 years that we need to experience the outcome. So people have looked at tissue and circulating markers for endometrial cancer pathogenesis, but they, you know, these have not never been evaluated for relevance or impact on cancer incidence. And that's the problem that we have. And so a recent systematic review. A recent systematic review identified all the different markers that have been considered. So there's one study only that looked at incidence of endometrial cancer. The others looked at hormonal and proliferative tissue markers, K67, estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors. And others looked at circulating biomarkers. So one looked at biomarkers of adiposity, insulin resistance, and reproductive function. Function. So, what constitutes a good surrogate? And again, this is really just from our perspective. And I'm sure there are other criteria that I'm not considering here, but for me, it needs to be biologically plausible and it needs to represent an early event in the causal pathway or an earlier event than the actual incidence of the cancer. We need to be able to frequently measure. To be able to frequently measure it using minimally invasive approaches and standardized and reliable assays and methods. If each time someone measures the same thing is going to come up with a different answer, this measurement error becomes problematic. The frequency is really nice, not only because it gives us an early indication of whether something is working or not, but also because it encourages participants to stay on the trial because they're seeing something that's changing, that their effort is actually yielding. That their effort is actually yielding a change, you cannot change what you don't measure, and this is one way of sort of observing that and seeing that, oh, look, my markers are going down, this is good, I'm on the right track, as opposed to nothing until we observe the outcome. In the case of endometrial cancer, we likely will need multiple surrogates because there wouldn't be a single surrogate that will affect all of the pathways all at once. So we'll probably need multiple surrogates. So, you'll probably need multiple surrogates. And then, finally, the statistical quantitative validity is important. And how to do that is also a challenge. I'm not really sure as of yet how I would do it. So, how to identify and evaluate these surrogate endpoints? I mean, there are some that have been suggested as I showed earlier, but are these the right ones? Like, should I just kind of go with these? Because someone suggested. Go with these because someone suggested them. And the answer is: if only we knew the causal graph, right? If we only knew what things affected what, we know that there are many known confounders. Most of these pathways are actually, even though I draw a straight arrow leading from one to another, there are arrows going all over the place which I have omitted. And sometimes adjusting for all of the confounders without knowing the Confounders without knowing the structure is a little bit tricky because we can induce correlations that wouldn't be there, right? So we can't just adjust for everything and solve the problem. So maybe causal discovery could be something that's useful. Now, the problem, of course, is that causal structural learning is very difficult. It's increasing exponentially with the number of things that we're trying to look, the number of variables. We're trying to look the number of variables that are considered. And even if we had enough, let's say, a few enough variables that we could do it, we could only do it up to Markov equivalent. So in other words, in some cases, we will not have identifiable directionality. And so we need to somehow come up with a way to encode known biological mechanism, which we haven't been able to do. Which we haven't been able to do. And that got me thinking: oh, wait, like if we do this a lot for like systematic previews, meta-analyses, we have a way of going and synthesizing what's known in the literature. Why can't we do this for causal graphs? This could be something that's doable. And indeed, that's what we are planning to do. And we started doing. I didn't find very many studies, so I found three, and then I'm going to discuss them. Three, and then I'm going to discuss them here. Maybe there are others that I've missed, but but again, those are the three studies that we're or three approaches that we're hoping to use. So one is the first one, which we started working with already. It's called it's an evidence synthesis on DAGS. DAGS stands for directed acyclical graphs. And so what the idea is, is to look at look at the literature, maybe. The literature, maybe reviews or umbrella reviews, like reviews of reviews, and take each study and try to map the conclusion from each of these studies onto a DAG. And then from there, we could look at the causal structures, look at all the variables that were addressed, and run these through some principles to see whether or not they meet sort of, we could sort of rule out. And so the idea here. And so the idea here is that everything is associated with everything, and that's your starting assumption. Now, let's try to prove to ourselves that two things are independent so that we're removing errors from the graph. And so, this is the second point. That's where we're trying to look at temporality, for example, or things that we know to be biologically untrue or unrealistic. And so we start removing these edges. And that results, that gives us a bunch of DAGs. gives us a bunch of DAGs that we then repeat the process to integrate them together into one final DAG or one integrated DAG. So that's the first approach. The second approach uses Mendelian randomization. So this was done very recently. So this is a paper in MedArchive by folks at University of Bristol. And that's where they're using, they're basically capitalizing on the genome-wide association study. The genome-wide association studies that are out there to derive propensity scores that then they could use as instrumental variables to sort of try to come up with mediators between exposure and outcome and try to sort of say, is this a mediator? Is there an edge between this variable and that outcome? And so on and so forth. And they integrate this with known. So they've looked at Looked at so they call this MMR Eve, everything versus everything. So they generate a list of causal factors. So they're doing it in breast cancer. They integrated with literature mind relationships, which are in this epigraph database. And this is where they've mined the literature to look at all of the traits that may have been shown to be associated. And then they identify potential mediators from there. And then from there, they use multivariable Mendelian randomization. Mendelian randomization. Again, Mendelian randomization assumes that your genetic makeup or your genes are randomly, it's some form of randomization because what you're getting from each of your parents, you're getting it in a way at random. And so that could be a reasonable instrumental variable to help you sort of identify some of the direct directionalities of some of these arrows. So they have a system here. This is too busy for me to go through now, but they have a way of doing this. They have a way of doing this, like an algorithm to go through this. And that's one way of triangulating evidence and synthesizing the literature. And then the last one that I found was an automated method that uses AI. This was published in AAAI in 2019. So they use text analytics, machine learning approaches to search the literature and capture some of the causal relationships described there. And then from there, they did. And then from there, they did. So, what they did, which I thought was interesting, and again, something that is very interesting, is they actually also looked at medical records to build an association graph. So they did one from the literature, one from the EMR, and then they intersected them or they overlaid them and then they kept the intersecting edges. So I thought that was also a very interesting approach to aggregating or synthesizing this evidence. Synthesizing this evidence. I feel like there would be more challenges still, particularly in our setting. So we may not be able to elucidate all of the relationships and their directionalities. This could be then maybe some of the things that one would consider here, something like a latent construct for unobserved confounders and sensitivity analyses and so on, or maybe even some active learning approaches where some. Active learning approaches where some we do some interventions to try to sort of assess the directionality of things if that's possible. There may still be a lot of unmeasured synth founders. We don't know what we don't know. So it's just because someone hasn't looked at it before, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And then finally, I'm not even sure how we would combine all of these surrogates together. So I'm really looking forward to some of the talks about combining multiple surrogates and values. Multiple surrogates and validating those. And I feel like no single set, at least from the data that I know I have access to, will have all the exposures, the surrogates, and the endpoints in the single data set. So we need to think of ways to maybe learn something from one data set and bring it on onto the other data set using some sort of a Bayesian way of sorts. Not sure how we'd integrate. Not sure how we'd integrate that. And then the confidence in evaluation and reproducibility across data sets. That's also, especially when you have something that's very complex and not measured uniformly across the board, that's very challenging. We're mostly using observational data, as I mentioned. Even the trials that we're running, they're not randomized. It's the sort of thing where it's a prospective collection and everyone gets the intervention that's signed on. Intervention that's signed on. And so that's also a challenge in methods. And then finally, there may be, of course, measurement errors with the surrogates. Like I know a lot of the markers that we don't measure them perfectly. And that's another can of worms also that would need to be looked at. So just to conclude, it's really important to address these questions in a systematic way so that we're able to properly design. That we're able to properly design prevention trials for the effectiveness of interventions. I'm really hoping to learn from all of you and over the next two weeks and to get some more ideas around that. So thank you. Thank you. That was great. I actually really appreciate it. I actually really appreciated the applied shift for the late afternoon. And applied doesn't mean easy, obviously. And I also, to me, I mean, I feel like what you talked about with, you know, looking at the medical literature to, I guess, better inform and understand what your DAG looks like, like actually kind of gets at what Tyler was maybe touching on, that to answer those questions. Touching on that to answer those questions that Tyler brought up, like, might there be a negative direct effect of A on Y, not through S, like you have to, part of that, besides being a clinical expert, is knowing what the true DAG looks like, which we can never know, but that's largely, you know, what you're talking about. So I'm sure there are questions for you, and we do have a discussion now, but I think everyone will hate me if we don't have a break right now. So I know. Right now, so I know we're supposed to have a panel, but we're going to take a 10-minute break and then we will come back and ask questions and discuss. Okay, thanks, guys.
