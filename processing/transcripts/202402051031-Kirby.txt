Introduce today Jonathan Kirby from the University of East Anglia, who's going to talk to us about towards costume minimality and explanation of break close. Take it away, Jonathan. Thank you very much, Sebastian. It's a pleasure to be speaking to you, and thank you very much for the invitation. And I'm also very sorry not to be there in person. I can see behind you there's a window with some beautiful trees outside and they look better than the trees I can see out of the window. Than the wind, the trees I can see out of the window beside me here, so I'm sure that would be much better to be there. Weather's probably better there than here, too, although they're different. Okay, so I'm going to talk about quasi-minimality and exponential algebraic closeness. I will survey these things. Sebastian asked me to give some sort of survey, and but as Francesco Gallinaro and Vincennes. Francesco Gallinaro and Vincenzo Mantova are both talking about this topic or things relating to it later in the week. I thought I'd also talk about some other things as well. So my talk has four parts. I'll talk about quasi-minimality and then about EAC, this exponential algebraic closeness for exponential fields. Then I'll have an interlude, which is some other things which you might also call exponential algebraic closures. Break closures and independence notions. And finally, I'll talk about powered fields, which is work, moderately recent work with Francesco Gallinaro. So in contrast to the previous talk, this is about the algebraically closed situation, not the ordered situation. Although hopefully the third part will have at least some things that could be done in the ordered situation. Okay, so to start. Okay, so to start with, let's start with something everyone knows. The definable subsets of the complex field are finite or co-finite. So the complex field is minimal, also strongly minimal, but minimal is what I care about just now. And the complex exponential field is definitely not, because we have the integers here given by this formula. And unless you're a sort of computational numerical analyst, Computational numerical analyst, the set of integers is definitely infinite. Unfortunately, I can't hear anything from the audience, and I can't see you either. So, this is very much like speaking to myself. Anyway, Zilber's quasi-minimality conjecture from 1997, or at least published then, states that every definable subset in course one variable is countable. Then, of course, one variable is countable, or its complement is countable. And some vague motivation here. So, suppose that's true, then we think there's at some level a theory of exponential algebraic varieties, a bit like algebraic geometry, and it should be accessible by model theoretic methods in the sense that definable sets in the structure should be more or less these exponential algebraic varieties. Now, you have things like the rationals definable, so fine. So, your countable things, zero-dimensional things you might not have much control over. And then you get, but at least in the dimension one and above, you would hope it looks something like there's a geometry. There's a geometry going on. At least that's the idea. But of course, it's a conjecture and still an open question. And still, an open question is whether the real field is a definable subset. And if it is, then because you have the integers as well, then every continuous function will be definable from the complexes to the complexes. And definable sets have no geometric meaning at all. That subject of definable sets in Cx becomes descriptive set theory. And well, and also there's no particular, one doesn't care about the exponential function. One doesn't care about the exponential function anymore. So, because it's just all every continuous function is definable. With parameters, of course, there are too many continuous functions to be defined without parameters, but nonetheless, plenty definable without parameters. Okay, so that's the conjecture. So, we can broaden it slightly to the question. So, for which complex functions f does the expansion of the complex field by f become or remain? By f become or remain quasi-minimal. So, some orientation on this question. So, a sensible function is complex conjugation, but the fixed points of that are the reals. So, r is definable. So, that structure is really o-minimal, definitely not quasi-minimal. You can think about the j function. The domain of that is the upper half plane, and the domain of the function is, of course, definable. The domain of the function is, of course, definable, or you can define the j function on the upper and lower half planes. But either way, you get the reals again, and so that's not quasi-minimal. On the other hand, we can look at a generic case. So the generic case should be that most entire functions are quasi-minimal. So, my current student, Anna Dmitrieva, is one of the things she's looking at, and it's one of these things where. And it's one of these things where experts, of which I don't know how many there are, but experts think, oh, yes, this should be true. And then when we tried to chase up the references and things, there was too much work to put it together just to say, yes, it's definitely true. So it needs a bit more putting together and maybe even some proving some things. So some examples of those. So the Uville functions. Examples of those are the Euville functions defined by Alex Wilke, which he worked on, and Pascal Coiron worked on. They showed that those functions, which are given by special power series, which converge very rapidly, so they're very well approximated. The functions are very well approximated by polynomials in the same way that Louisville numbers are very well approximated by rational numbers. So it's a sort of beginnings of transcendental number theory sort of idea. Of transcendental number theory, sort of idea. So that's where this Liouville name comes from, coined by Alex. Not to do with Liouville functions in any other sense. Anyway, they show a first-order theory given by Zilber for a generic function. And there's related work of Olivier Legal on strongly transcendental functions, of which these Lutheran functions give an example. So we think most functions So we think most functions are quasi-minimal. Okay, what other questions? So most functions, of course, aren't interesting. Some of them are, but the generic behavior we'd want to know. But what about other specific functions? So Veistros p functions are exponential maps of elliptic curves, and they seem very similar to the normal exponential. So probably if we can answer the question, the quasi-minimality conjecture for exponential. Minimality conjecture for exponentiation, we can answer the same question for the p-functions and with the same answer. At least that's what we would hope. We can look at exponential maps for abelian varieties of high dimension as well. So that really gives you a map from C to the G, so some Cartesian power to AC, so to the C points of the abelian variety. We can just choose an embedding of that in projection. In projective space or whatever. So we get a sensible way to define this as an expansion of the complex field. And again, it looks to me that it's similar to the p-function case, similar to the exponential case. So we probably expect the same answer. And these, of course, are functions of several complex variables, but definitely not true that every function of even two complex variables gives you a quasi-minimal. Variables gives you a quasi-minimal structure because there's an example by Bieber Bach and Fatu from the 1920s. Fatu is one of the people with Gaston Julia who invented fractals, essentially. And one of the sorts of functions they were looking at is an entire complex function of two complex variables, but its image in two-dimensional space is open but not dense. So it has an open complex. So it has an open complement. Well, there's an open part of the complement. The complement has interior. And from that, you can show that the expansion of the field by F is not quasi-minimal. So Coiron asked a question. I don't know where he asked this question. Maybe it was spoken, but it's in a paper of Alex Wilkie. He asked, is the expansion of the complex field by all one? Of the complex field by all one variable entire functions quasi-minimal. And Alex's observation is that we don't have a counterexample. And Anna was asking me why entire? What about mirror morphic? And I don't know about that either. Why not? That seems like a perfectly good question. I think for complex analysts, the difference between entire and meromorphic functions is quite large. But for us, certainly for me, For us, certainly for me, I don't see much difference. So it seems like a reasonable question, but also not one we're about to answer. But a counterexample would be nice to have. Well, or actually, no, a counterexample would not be nice, but it would be better to know about it if it exists. Okay, so those are some questions. How about some theorems? So now, six years ago, Martin Bayes and I Martin Bayes and I showed that we can reduce the original conjecture of quasi-minimality of a complex exponential field to the statement that this complex exponential field is exponentially algebraically closed. So I haven't defined it. This is the second topic of my talk. So if you don't yet know what it is, you will soon. And we also proved some similar results. So there's an analogous definition. So, there's an analogous definitions we can make for other functions and other things like functions. What we need is that the function has a known x-channel theorem. So that's true. X is original. Theorem is true for exponentiation. It works for the exponential maps of abelian varieties as well, or semi-abelian varieties. So, those are the sorts of things that we can do this for. And using that technique, I was able to show that if you take not the exponential map itself, but something quite close, the multi-valued function where you take z maps to e to the z plus q plus 2 pi i r, where q and r are rationals. So this is like a function, but the image of a of a single point is actually a dense. A single point is actually a dense subset of the complex field. So you might think that's a very weird thing to do, but maybe it is. But anyway, it is quasi-minimal. And one of the things you can see is that certainly in terms of geometry, in terms of pre-geometry or something, what happens if you take this function here, this exponential of Z, and look at all the different values on it. Z and look at all the different values of it for a fixed z, they don't vary very much in terms of spreading out over the trans, then they're not, they don't have large transcendent degree of that set. They're all close together in that sense. So they're metrically, of course, they're dense, but in sort of transcendent sense, they're very close together. So there's some hope that this gives strong. This gives strong evidence towards the original conjecture. And a variant of the theorem with Martin Bayes proved by Francesco and me, plus Galinero's proof of the relevant analog of exponential algebraic closeness, gives another theorem. If we take the complex Theorem: If we take the complex field and we put in predicates for every raising to complex power, so the map is w goes to w to the lambda, where lambda ranges over complex numbers. So that's a multi-valued function, but it's only the sort of Z multi-valued. So that is quasi-minimal. And I'll talk about that. And I'll talk about that at the end. Okay, so those are things about quasi-minimality. If you do have questions, please shout out because I can't, as I say, I do have a small picture of you down on the side here, but I can't, I'm not looking at it. And actually, as far as I can tell, nobody's even moving. So it could be a static picture. Oh, no, someone's moving. Good. So maybe you can still hear me. Still hear me? We can hear you if we're all away. Okay, so exponential fields, then. So some basic things. So I realized that the topic of the program is exponential fields, but I'm still going to give you a definition. So an exponential field is just a field of characteristic zero equipped with a homomorphism from its additive group to its multiplicative group. So, what I'm going to care about in this talk is exponential fields with standard kernel, by which I mean tau times the integers where tau is transcendental. So tau is 2 pi i for the complex field, and we might as well define 2 pi i to be tau in any other situation we're in. And my notation to extend Notation to extend this. So, this exponential field could be an E field. E A field means the A stands for algebraically closed, meaning as a field. And the E L A, the L stands for logarithm and means that the exponential map is surjective. So it's not, of course, it's not like the real case where the L means you have a logarithm function. The logarithms are not just on positive numbers because we don't have positive numbers. Because we don't have positive numbers, they're just every non-zero number. But of course, we don't have a particular logarithm. Logarithms of a point are cosets of the kernel. Now, if you take any exponential field with standard kernel, then you can get a definition of the integers out of it. The same definition that I gave on the first slide. From the integers, of course, as a ring, as a sub-ring of the field. As a sub-ring of the field, you get the rationals. But what this means is that having a standard kernel is obviously axiomatizable in L omega 1 omega. So you write down a disjunction of a countable disjunction. We'll give you this. Or if you don't like infinitary logic, you can just say we omit the type of a non-standard integer. Type of a non-standard integer comes to exactly the same thing. Something else, which I guess everyone in the audience knows, is Schenmel's conjecture. So this is important. My terminology is that if we're taking this property on some field, exponential field F, we'll call it the channel property. And the conjecture means, is the conjecture is that the property holds. The conjecture is that the property holds in the complex case or the real case, but for me, the complex case. And I guess you know what this states, so I'll leave it there for you. Okay, and maybe convenient is that this channel conjecture is actually axiomatizable by a first-order axiom scheme, modulo the standard kernel. So if we have amongst those fields with Those fields with standard kernel, you just take this axiom scheme. So you take varieties, sub-varieties of c to the 2n defined over the rationals with dimension less than n, and you take this axiom. If x, for all x, if x need to the x is in v, then x must be q linearly dependent. And of course, that's definable, that's axiomatizable, that's a single sentence because q. If that's a single sentence, because q itself is definable up there. Of course, if you take the same axiom scheme and you try to interpret it in an elementary extension with non-standard kernel, then what happens is that this queue becomes a different field and it tells you something else, tells you something weaker. So you could be in here and be non-standard Q linearly dependent without. Dependent without actually being Q linearly dependent. But if Zilber's conjecture on intersections with tori is true, which is what's now sometimes called the multiplicative Zilber-Pink conjecture, then in fact, for any given V, there should be a bound, a height bound on the rationals that come that you need to quantify over. And so in fact, the shallow. The channel property becomes first-order expressible, although it's not quite the same. It's not just, you don't get linear dependence on the x variables, you get multiplicative dependence on the y variables. So it's almost the same, but it becomes the channel property relativized over the kernel. So I won't actually define it. I just thought I would advertise this relationship with this Diophantine geometry with turning With turning this material into what other people might recognize as model theory. Okay, how are we doing? I'm going fast. Okay, so what's important in understanding the exponential algebra that comes up in trying to solve these problems is the notion of strong extensions. Extensions. So, this is how we use the channel property and more generally how we use the X-channel theorem. So, given an exponential field F and any subset A, and we'll take a tuple B, we have the relative pre-dimension delta of B over A, which is just a transcendence degree of B and its exponentials over A and their exponentials. Over a and their exponentials. Exponentials, so this means the exponentials of each little a and capital A as a set. And we subtract the rational, the Q linear dimension of B over A. And we'll declare the extension. So if capital A is now an exponential field, not just a subset, we'll declare this extension to be strong if but. If for all two poles B and F, delta of B over A is non-negative. And well, for this talk, the kernel is always standard, but we should, it's useful to also impose that the kernel does not extend. Okay, my notation for this is the open triangle here, like a normal subgroup. So maybe the thing to know. Maybe the thing to notice here: if we take A to be the empty set or zero, then delta of B over A delta is just transcends degree of B and e to the B minus the linear dimension of B. And the assertion that that is non-negative is exactly Channel's, well, the Channel property. And essentially, if A satisfies the Channel property, and we want F also to satisfy the Channel property, then we better make sure that A is strong enf. A is strong enf because this pre-dimension is additive. So, if the pre-dimension of A is zero, say, then the pre-dimension of F over A should also be zero or non-negative for the pre-dimension of F over the empty set to be non-negative. So that's essentially why string extensions are useful, is they're the ones which preserve the channel property. Okay, but using strong extensions, there's a very strong conclusion we can draw very quickly. So, if we start with a finitely generated partial exponential field, I haven't defined partial exponential field. I mean, it can be an exponential field, or I only require exponentiation to be defined on some subset of the field, which should be a Q linear space, so a Q vector subspace. So, a Q vector subspace of the field. But if we do that, we take something which is finitely generated in it's not a very important condition of finite generation. You need something else if it's not there, but you need not to be stupid. Well, okay, as long as you're countable, you need not to be stupid and these things work. These things work. Or you can take a countable ELA field and then a finitely generated extension of that. And then you get a unique smallest strong extension to an ELA field. So there's an ELA closure, which is unique. So what does that mean? I want to iterate exponentiation. I want to take algebraic closure, field theoretic algebraic closure, and I want to take logarithms. So pre-images under exponentiation. Images under exponentiation, and I want to keep iterating those until I close off. And being strong means whenever I take an exponential of something I already have, which doesn't have an exponential, it's going to have to be transcendental over everything I already have. Whenever I take a logarithm, that's got to be transcendental as well. So essentially, everything is so algebraically independent that there's nothing that can go wrong. And so you get a unique extension. So that's the idea. Extension. So that's the idea. That's essentially how the proof goes. You know, but back and forth to prove it. And there are some subtle things with the, but it's involving Kuma theory to get this uniqueness. But nonetheless, and that's where the subtle things with having with the word countable here is. So I'm sure it's also true without countable, but I don't know how to prove it. Okay, so why do I care? I want to classify finitely generated strong extensions of exponential fields. So I want to do something like field theory, where you take fields and you want to understand what finitely generated field extensions exist or what algebraic field extensions exist. So, and I want to do that for exponential fields. And the thing is, we can do that. And this theorem gives us, gets a long. This theorem gives us gets a long way to do it. So now I have something technical. So I'm getting what I want to do in this is get towards what is exponential algebraic closure. And it's to do with these field extensions, exponential field extensions. So here, this may be one of my more technical slides of the talk. So we take, let's take an ELA field, or if we want, we could take something very small, partial exponential field. Um, partial exponential field where the exponential is only defined on the kernel on the Q linear span of the kernel, for example, something finitely generated, finite dimensional vector space. Okay, here, an ELA field. We take an extension of fields, b, and it's going to be generated of array by finite set b1 to bn, together with things we're going to declare to be the exponentials of those things. Things and the exponentials of the rational multiples of them. So, m is a natural number, a positive natural number, and we want to have the exponentials of these things. So, we're going to assume the bi are q linearly independent. If not, just throw some of them away until they are. And then, obviously, once you've done that, you're forced to define the exponential of anything. To define the exponential of anything of this form, anything in the Q linear span of capital A and the Bi's, the exponential of some sum like this has to be the product of the exponentials. So it's clear that if you know, what that hopefully tells you is if you know the algebraic type of all these B's and the E to the BI over M's, that's an infinite tuple. But if you know the algebraic type of that over A, that tells over that over a that tells you how to extend your it tells you the isomorphism type of this extension of the exponentials so you have these ideals if you like or the varieties so we just look at the nth level level m here uh we look at the the exponentials of these and all the polynomials which are true of those gives you an ideal take a spec that to get a for algebraic variety Algebraic variety. And so we get a sequence of algebraic varieties Vm. So if we know what that infinite sequence of algebraic varieties is, then we know the isomorphism type of the extension. And the theorem, which due to Zilbra and called the thumbtack lemma, is actually in nice situations and being an ELA field here, so being algebraically closed, ELA. So, being algebraically closed, ELA field like this is one of those. We don't actually need to know all of those Vms. There's just one. There's some natural number that if we go down that far and we specify that Vn, then all the others are uniquely determined. So, this tells us now about these exponential extensions, and Let me say something a little bit more about the varieties V which occur. So there are these two words free and rotund. What are we trying to do? So V is really the locus of B and E to the B. So we might as well assume this M or this capital N bun here is one. Otherwise, replace Bi by Bi over N. So we're looking at the locus of the B's together with their exponentials. Exponentials. So we assume that V is free. Why? Well, we can deduce it's free because the X bar, which is the generic point here in V, X bar is Q linearly independent over A. We can assume that without loss of generality. And the Y's must be multiplicatively independent over A. So, well, the first part ensures that X is well defined. We're not trying to make it a multi-valued function. We're not trying to make it a multi-valued function. And the second thing ensures that there are no new kernel elements. So, assuming that these are linearly independent, the y's being multiplicatively independent means we're not having anything new equal to whose exponential is one. And the other thing we can deduce about the variety v is that it's rotund, and we're assuming that our extension is strong. In fact, I haven't on this page. Strong. In fact, I haven't on this page assumed if the extension is strong, but let's assume it is, in which case we get that the variety is rotund. So that tells us that the dimension of v is at least n. That means that the transcendence degree of the x's or the b's and the e to the b's is n. So that's needed for being strong. But let me go back to strong extensions definition. We need all tuples b and f, that the pre-dimension is. That the pre-dimension is non-negative, not just our basis tuple. So we need to take any Q-linear combination of those or any Q-linear projection of those. And then we get some condition on the variety, on projections of the variety, which I won't state. But this is just a requirement to ensure the extension is strong. And once we do that, And once we do that, every free and rotund V will give a strong extension. So, a corollary is that finitely generated strong ELA field extensions are determined up to isomorphism by a single algebraic variety V. So this is what I wrote a paper when I proved this. I called this finitely presented exponential fields. And this probably hides the fact that there's some model theory involved because I thought I was. Because I thought I was writing a paper for algebraists. Maybe this was a mistake, but that's what I did. So, this is really about isolation of types. And this is what the corollary says. So, if we look at, basically it says there's only countably many isomorphism types of finitely generated DLA fields with standard kernel, and only countably many isomorphism types of finitely generated strong extensions of them, or indeed of a count. Or, indeed, of a countable ELA field. Okay, so we've got a sort of omega stability result. Of course, we've got standard kernel. We're fixing the standard kernels. What it's saying is that in this setup where we have the channel property, we have omega stability provided we keep the kernel standard. So any instability in terms of counting types comes from the kernel. Okay, so this is what I'm really talking about: Zilber's exponential field. So we can amalgamate all these finitely generated ELA fields with standard kernel. So there's a category where if you take all of those with a channel property and standard kernel, and you take strong extensions as the extensions you care about, then you can amalgamate them. You can apply Freisse's theorem and get some Fresse limit. Get some Fressay limit. And then there's another process you can do using Shellach's and Zilber's excellence to build a continuum-sized model of this. So Zilber's exponential field is a continuum-sized elementary extension of the Frese limit. But for model-theoretic questions, actually, one can just work, well, depending on what your question is, you could just work with the Frese limit if you want, or you can work with this Zilba. Zilba continuum-sized model. Okay, and basically, what we get is that to translate that finite presentation theorem into something about types, the exponent, I haven't also haven't told you what exponentially algebraic is, but there are generic types which are exponentially transcendental, but the exponentially algebraic types of finite Types of finite tuples over the empty set and over certain parameter families. So, okay, strong finitely generated DLA subfields are isolated by a single formula. And the formula looks something like this. It says that, so these are one types, but it doesn't, you can do something similar for n types. So given our x1, there should be exist x2 up to xn. Up to xn, such that the x's and their exponentials are in some variety v, and x is q linearly independent over some a naught. And this a naught is a certain finite subset of a. So I guess it's more or less the finite set of generators. Okay, so we've got some explicit formulas here. Formulas here. And those are the ones we care about, isolating the types. And so now what we do is we take, now I want to formulate the Null Stellensatz, Zilber's Null Stellensatz, and the exponential algebraic closeness property. So just to summarize what I already said, so if we take an exponential field F and a suitable algebraic And a suitable algebraic sub-variety v, which suitable is free and rotund, you know, of f to the n cross fx to the n. We define an extension exponential field with, we can use this notation, actually I won't use this notation again in this talk. We just add some point in the extension field such that a's and e to the a's are in the v, and we can close off under this ELA. Off under this ELA closure, which is uniquely defined. So we get, in fact, what we're really doing is we take an ELA field and we extend to an ELA field. Or you can do it just this way with our active, with partial exponential fields. Both methods work. And the Neul Stellensat says that if V is free and rotund, then there is already a point A in F to the N such that F. Point A and F to the N, such that A and E to the A is in V. And that's true in Zilber's field. It's true in the Freese limit because of the way we've constructed it. It just says that everything you do in the amalgamation construction is there when you get to the Frise limit. And we know this is all first order axiomatizable, so it's definitely true in the elementary extension, Zilber's field. And the conjecture is that it also holds in the complex. Is that it also holds in the complex case? Okay, so a bit more terminology. We'll say an exponential field is exponentially algebraic closed if it satisfies the Zilber Nostellensatz. And a construction like the one I've just explained actually gives you an easy way to embed any exponential field in an exponential algebraic closure. So, any exponential field at all, you can embed, you can play. Field at all, you can embed, you can take a strong extension to an exponential algebraic closure. And under reasonable conditions, reasonable being, I don't know what reasonable means actually, but under reasonable conditions, that will be unique. The real exponential field, I think, probably doesn't satisfy these reasonable conditions. But certainly, it's embedding in the complex field. Embedding in the complex field, complex exponential field, is not strong because you don't increase the linear dimension of the domain of exponentiation by a lot, and you increase the transcendence degree by zero. So it's definitely not strong. So it's definitely not an example. But there's no reduction to exponential polynomials in one variable. So this is maybe an interesting observation here, it's an important observation. It's an important observation. Just in the pure field sense and also in the differential field sense, if you want to axiomatize algebraically closed field or differentially closed field, you only need to solve equations of one variable. Differentially closed field case, also not satisfying a lower order differential equation, but only one variable. And you have quantifier elimination. Here, you can't reduce to one variable and you don't have quantifier, nor do you Quantify elimination, nor do you have model completeness, even accounting for the kernel. Okay, so and the theorem at the bottom is the one that I mentioned earlier. So if this EAC conjecture is true, that's one way to prove quasi-minimality. Okay, so progress. So I'm going to skip over this very quickly, but there are, so the question is: given a V variety V, Of V variety V, is there a complex tuple such that A e to the A is in V? And we can certainly reduce the case where the dimension of V itself is N, where N is this the N up here. So if N is one, Dave Marker showed this is true. If the projection of V to the additive side here is dominant, so the dimension is N, then that's true. Then that's true. And that was shown by Dave Massar in a paper with Brownwell. There's another paper by Daquino, Foniciero, and Terzo, which gave another proof of the same theorem, similar proof of the same theorem. Bahagan, Aslanyan, and Vincenzo and I give another proof of the same thing, more geometric proof, and we did something, we did the analogous case for abelian varieties. Vincenzo has a case of the mention of W is one with David Maso and Galinio and Galinaro and Detrovic and other people have various other situations here. And I think Gallinaro is going to talk about some of these ones perhaps. And Vincenzo, I think, is going to talk about the last one here. About the last one here. There's some interesting examples here: the j function and the gamma function. So one can formulate the same statement, this EAC, but you don't have quasi-minimality as a consequence, certainly, because of other reasons. Well, this one we don't know. The j function, certainly not. The gamma function, I guess we don't know. Okay, let me move on to say something, talk about something slightly different. So, exponential algebraicity. So, this now applies to any exponential field, even an ordered one. So, maybe it's of interest to people who, to other people in this workshop. So, there is a definition of being exponentially algebraic, which is certainly quite old. There's a paper of McIntyre which uses it, but these are. Which uses it, but these are sort of called Havansky systems because Havansky used them, certainly used in work of Wilkie. And it's well, effectively, what we say is that so A1 is exponentially algebraic if there is a system of exponential polynomials, n of them, such that A is a component of an isolated zero, isolated in the sense that the Jacobian of these things at the point doesn't vanish. Things at the point doesn't vanish. And as I said, this notion depends on the existential type of A over B, not the quantifier-free type. And this is related to what I said previously. The theory of the Zilber exponential field is not model complete. But the theorem is that this definition gives you a pre-geometry on any exponential field. Any exponential field. So, in fact, it's known on Zilber's field before because of the next slide I'll show you, and it's known on the real exponential field before, and in the complex exponential field by Wilkie. But there's a relation to this pre-dimension. So, suppose we take an exponential field and we take a strong subset B, then A1 is in the exponential closure of B. Closure of B in F, if and only if there are these witnesses A2 up to AN, such that the pre-dimension of the A's over B is zero. So B being strong means the pre-dimension can't be below zero. It could be above, but if there's some witnesses that bring it down to zero, that means it's in the exponential closure, and that's equivalent. So initially, So initially, this looks very similar to the previous thing, but it's not quite the same. We have this much stronger assumption that we have than B, which is, well, the B that we care about is strong. So these witnesses, I made a mistake here on the slide. So if we take a minimal n here to give you this, then the A2 up to AN are called witnesses of exponential algebristic. So it's not any tuple up to a n, it's a minimal, one of minimal length. But once you choose them of minimal length, then that's actually unique. Minimal length, then that's actually unique up to a change of basis. And the hull, there's a strong hull. So this may be familiar to people who have seen these things in other construction, other model theoretic pre-dimension constructions. So the hull, which is this is my notation for it, of ceiling brackets of B, it's the smallest Q-linear subspace containing B, which is strong. And in this case, Is strong, and in this case, this case here, what you say is the hull of B and A1 will be the Q linear span of those witnesses together with B and A1. And you can take the EA closure, the ELA closure of these things. And they are indeed the smallest exponential subfields containing the whole, which are relatively EA closed or ELA closed in F. So this makes sense even if your original field is not algebraically closed. Field is not algebraically closed, it doesn't have logarithms, just a relative closure. You close under as much as you can. So, here's a theorem you can prove with that: that the model theoretic algebraic closure in BXP is given by one of these things. So, you take the whole of A and the EA closure. So, I guess I don't have time really to explain why that should be true, but Hagen and I have been working on that for a while. And while it seemed not Seemed not, shouldn't be difficult. It turned out to be more fiddly than we expected. So, model theoretic algebraic closure is definitely different from the exponential algebraic closure. And of course, it means something different again from the notion of being exponentially algebraically closed. So, it's a sort of third notion of algebraic closure in the exponential case. Okay, now I'll just say briefly, I have a little bit of time to say something about strong independence. So he has an independence notion on Schilbert's exponential field, several, but this is somehow the most fundamental one. So what do we do? Independence in the sense of forking or non-forking. Of course, this isn't exactly forking in the first order theory, certainly. But what do we say? What do we say? So, if you're familiar with differentially closed fields, then hopefully this looks a bit similar. What we do, so A is independent from B over C is if you take some closure of A and C on the left, the same closure on the right, and the same closure on the bottom, and they should be independent in the sense of transcendence degree, meaning the field, algebraically closed field independence. Dependence. And the closure here, you take the hull and this ELA closure. But there's another condition we also need that if we take the union of the things on the two sides, that should be itself be strongly embedded in F. Meaning, I suppose, that the Q linear span of that, the way I defined it, the Q linear span of that should be strongly embedded in F. So we can simplify that a little bit. Let's just assume. A little bit. Let's just assume already that A, B, and C are strong ELA subfields, which means A is equal to this whole thing up here, and so on. And let's also assume that C is contained in the intersection of A and B. So then we get just these two conditions. A is independent from B over C instance of Schroed-Sentence degree, and the union of A and B is strong. And under these conditions, what it means is that Is that if we take the hull of all those three things and then take the ELA closure, that's the same thing as the free amalgam of A and B over C as ELA fields. In particular, this notion of free amalgam exists and it is unique. The uniqueness here between A and the, this is the technical point I mentioned before about accountability and the uniqueness of the ELA closure. So if you probably So if you brush that under the carpet, then this is the free amalgam of A and B over C. If you don't brush it under the carpet, just pretend everything's countable and then you're fine. And a theorem proved by one of my PhD students, Robert Henderson, and then written up, made slightly updated and written up by Verhagen and Mark Kamsma and myself. Cams and myself. So, if we take any ELA field K, take the category of strong extensions with strong embeddings, which is what I did earlier for standard kernel when Curry was just standard kernel. Then this independence relation is stable. It's a stable independence relation, so you have stationary types and things. So, I'm not going to define what this means, but give you the impression that. Gives you the impression that this is stable model theory, pure model theory, which it is, but it's not quite first order. This is slightly outside the first order realm. And here's the same disclaimer that there's a subtle difference between Galois types and syntactic types. If you care about types given by formulas, everything's fine. If you care about automorphism orbits, If you care about automorphism orbits, then not everything is proved at least. Okay, any questions about any of the things we've talked about? It's a very silent audience. No? Okay. Okay, so powered fuels. I have five minutes left or something to talk about this, I think. So In the complex exponential field, or even maybe in the real exponential field, you can talk about very complicated equations that maybe you don't care very much about. So, here's an example. So we can look at e to the e to the sine of z squared minus iz plus cos of e to the z minus 1 over z plus 1 equals zero. I just made this one up to be something that no one should be interested in to point out that. To point out that these things, maybe someone is interested in this equation, but I don't know why they would be. But it looks quite complicated. I don't know how to start analyzing such a thing, except one can do some numerical thing, but otherwise I don't know how to analyze such a thing in a sensible way. So, but there are, and well, these things don't come up in the sort of differential equations courses. In the sort of differential equations courses that anyone teaches, as far as I'm aware. But often we don't iterate exponentiation, we just define complex powers, like I mentioned at the start of the talk. So the multi-valued w to the lambda is x of lambda log w for a fixed lambda. So here lambda will be fixed. Or you can do exponential sums. So we take fixed lambda i and let's Lambda i and let's say w j is the exponential of z j. So we can take the sum of lambda j z j's and exponentiate that. So that's really the product of these wi to the lambda j's in some sense. I mean this equality is a bit suspect. The thing on the left is a well-defined complex number and this is of course a multi-valued thing. So but nonetheless they're sort of morally the same thing. They're sort of morally the same thing. And more generally, we can take not just one linear combination of the Z's, but we can take a whole matrix of them. So we take some linear combinations, matrix multiplication of Z's. Let's take U to be the output of this and exponentiate that. We get Vi. So an exponential sums equation is an equation of the form P of V is zero. P is some polynomial. And the v's, of course, the exponentials of the u's. And or, yes, so the v's are the exponentials of mz's. And then we can have a system of those things. So a system of those things is several exponential sums equations. And what does that give you? Another way to describe that is an algebraic subwrite of Cn cross C cross to the n of the form L cross W. So L. L cross W. So L is the C linear equations that gives you this M matrix M and W is the algebraic subvariety given by these polynomials. And a solution is simply a point in L whose exponential is in W. And Francesco's big contribution towards EAC, well, one of his big contributions towards the EAC problem is to prove that. problem is to prove the Null Stellensatz in its entirety for this reduction. So when we only consider exponentiation like this, not iterated and with linear equations on the additive side. So he proves there is a complex solution in this case. So the complex powered field is what? So this is So, this is slightly more general or slightly different from what I mentioned at the beginning. We're going to take a two-sorted structure where we have this complex vector space on the left and the field structure on the right and the exponential map here. But we don't identify these two sorts. And the equations which are expressible in this structure with variables in this covering sort. Variables in this covering sort, the vector space sort, are exactly exponential sums equations. Well, more or less exactly. Those are the interesting ones. I guess you can also add elements of the cover itself. But those are the interesting ones. And the expressible equations from the variables in the field are the C-powered polynomial equations, which is what I talked about right at the beginning. And the theorem that we And the theorem that we proved last year, I think, yes, last year, is that the complex powered field that we get here is quasi-minimal. So it's a two-sorted structure. So I guess it means separately in each sort. Any definable set on either sort is countable or its complement in that sort is countable. And what I mentioned at the beginning, you take the field with predicates for the multivalue power functions, that's just the redux of the. Functions. That's just the redox of the right-hand side. So the quasi-minimality of that is a consequence of this. So, what I think there should be, and I would love it if people would play around with, is some geometric theory of algebraic geometry with complex powers. Since it's, there it is, it's quasi-minimal and should have a go. Let me say a little bit about the first order theory and what we can do in generic case. We can prove a bit more. Do in generic case, so we can prove a bit more. So, if you take a countable field, k as a countable field of powers. Okay, so we're only going to look at powers from that field. So, in here, we've got a vector space over the complexes. Now, we look at the structure whether you take a countable subfield. We just take the reduct with, which is a k vector space. Then, up to isomorphism, there's only one, there's exactly one k-powered field, which I'll write this way. It's cardinality continuum, which has. Contact cardinality continuum, which has a cyclic kernel, which is like a standard kernel of the exponential map. It satisfies a channel property appropriate for powers. It's k powers closed, which means that, well, which means that the EAC thing that Francesco proved is true here. And it has the countable closure property, which I won't discuss. But it's true in the complex case, anyway. And furthermore, this e to the k is quasi-minimal. And what we know that is for all but countably many lambdas, complex numbers lambda, certainly the exponentially transcendental ones, if you take the k-powered reduct of the complex exponential where k is q lambda, the rational functions with lambda, that's isomorphic. That's isomorphic to this EQ lambda. So we have a much stronger statement than just that the complex one is quasi-minimal, that actually in this reduct case, it's isomorphic to the analog of Zilber's exponential field. And well, if we assume channel conjecture, we can prove much more. We take lambda to be pi or 2 pi i, and the same thing is true. Thing is true. And the last thing I want to mention is that this maybe is not all the way that you would want to get towards complex exponentiation because the first order theory you get is already super stable. So in fact, this is you definitely don't interpret arithmetic here. Okay, so I think I'm getting got to the end of my time. So thank you. Time. So, thank you very much for your attention. So, now, Junathan, any good questions for Channel? Hi, Jonathan. So, I was curious about this cloud structure of yours. You treat it as a two-sort of structure. Do you have the other part of space mapping? You have the complex vector space mapping down to the Convention. Yeah. What would happen computed as a three-throwed structure where the domain was a complex vector space, but over the complex field, which is allowed to actually assume itself. So, can you say I take so you're taking the field of the scalar? Are you taking the Taking the field of the scalar, are you taking the scalars in the scalars? Scalars is one sort, and then you have the vector space of those sorts. You have the actual scalars on the vector space. That'll be the domain part, and then you still have your exponential. So you have families of these power. That's a good question. So it's not immediately all. I don't know. I don't. Francesco might be the. Francesco might be the person to ask because exactly where that fits in the EAC hierarchy, I'm not sure. I don't know what those equations look like. Because this is a separate sort. So it's not quite the same as saying you don't have equations between powers. You can't have an equation. You can't identify a power with a Power with, you know, if you have x to the y, you can't identify y and x. You can't say x equals y, for example. So it's less expressive, certainly, than full exponentiation. That's a good question. I don't know the answer. But maybe it's, maybe it's another. So there are not very many reducts of CXP where you can identify something that you could say is quasi-minimal. And maybe that's another one. Good question. Then so in the in the last result of in the structure the result of silver you mentioned can you yeah any reasonable description of uh the minimal types that minimal types um So, um, I guess this is uh, so I don't know. So, yes, I'm sure there is a reasonable description of them, but I don't have it. So, what is one thing that Verhagen and I working on started working on is looking at the minimal types or what we think of the strongly minimal types in the Are strongly minimal types in the silber exponential field. But we got stuck. We realized that we couldn't even prove what the rank zero types were. And now we have. This is the algebraic closure, model theoretic algebraic closure. So to do this in the powers case, it may be similar. It may not be a lot easier. So I guess if I think about it. I guess if I think about it, I could probably work out what I think the answer is. So it should be related to the things that we call perfectly rotund varieties. So when you take one of these extensions I described by an F and an F, and you extend by a variety V, it may be that you can split that into several extensions of ELA fields. So there may be some intermediate ELA fields. But if there are no intermediate ELA fields, But if there are no intermediate ELA fields, then your V is perfectly rotund. So it's a condition on the which I guess someone there will probably have to explain exactly what it is. But in this case, I would expect the types are strongly minimal. But would you ever have to worry or would you expect to have to worry about such splittings only occurring like over larger parameters stuff? Like over larger parameter sets or something like that? Or is that not really? So the thing about it's so when the kernel is fixed, even in the exponential case, essentially everything is omega stable. The bad stuff happens in the kernel. And the same happens in the powers reduct. What's bad is the kernel of this exponential map, which so everything which is orthogonal to that is sort of everything behaves nicely in the sense of omega stability, right? Sense of omega stability rather than super stability. So I think that's what I expect anyway. But I don't, as I said, I haven't written down. Well, I tried, but I didn't. It turned out to be a bit difficult. You have to use some Diophantine geometry, which isn't immediately obvious, or in fact, not even obvious after working on it for a few years. So, well, on and off. Well, on and off. But yeah, I um, no, it's a good question, and I'm sure it's it's tractable. Um, and if anyone, if anyone wants to work on this first-order theory of this, um, this power, this powers, there are definitely things to be done. So Zilba's paper is not published, but I mean, there's a, there's a, there's, it's been available for 15 years at least, but 17 years, I think, at least. So And there are more things that we can do on that. So, if you want to look at it, please let me know. I'm happy to discuss it. Thank you, Jonathan, once again. So, now there's lunch break. Let me just point out that we were still at home, and you'll know, you might notice if you look at the schedule, but there's nothing. Schedule, there's nothing happening between one and two. So that's because there used to be something there, and now there isn't. And I don't know why. But I had no control of the mechanics. So that's different. You refer to it. I don't know. It's still very close to the  They wait for side slide and they are
