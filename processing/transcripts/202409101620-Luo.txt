We're very happy to have Leon Bengu talking about logarithmic sub-blood inequalities at homogeneous spaces. Thank you for the introduction and also thanks very much for the invitation. In this talk, I will focus on the study of the constant in the Vaughan-Soviet inequality on the homogeneous space. And this space has a natural sub-Riemannian structure. And moreover, we want to study how this concept depends on the geometry of the underlying space, especially. Space, especially its dimension-free property. Note here that we only consider the sub-Riemannian spaces, but our goal is to develop a general framework for us to study the constant that does not have the rich potential lower bound. And this work is motivated by a paper of Gross in 1992. My talk is based on two joint papers with Masha 1 and 2. Here's the outline of my talk. I will record the explicit form, this equality Rn, and after that, I will formulate this question in the hypoeletic setting, which has a natural sub-Romanian geometry. After that, I will present our main result and provide some And provide some concrete examples. In the end, I'll take some future directions. On Rn, if we take the Gaussian measure, that is a probability measure. The Radon infantine derivative with respect to the big measure here is the Gaussian density. And another perspective to see it is that this density is the heat kernel for the Lafassian at the time equals 1. Time equals 1. Or also, you can think about it as the law of the Brownian motion generated by the Lafayette at the time also of t equals 1. Then we have such an inequality. That is, the entropy can be bounded by a constant capital C times the field dimension. And the constant C is independent of the dimension N. There are many important applications for this dimension. Important applications for this dimension-free property. Actually, this was originated from some problems in quantum field theory, where you study infinite-dimensional spaces where sober-life inequality is not available. But log sober left is the best you can hope for. And also, this inequality gives other properties. For example, for the Markov semi-group, you have the hypercontractivity, and also you have the convergence to the Convergence to the equilibrium of the semi-group if such equilibrium exists. And also from the entropy perspective, you have the exponential decay with entropy. This is used more often in the geometric flow where you want to prove the monotonicity formula in Ricci flow or in mean curvature flow. And moreover, it also has some application for. Also, it has some application for the concentration of measure and so on. However, this nice result, especially this dimension-free property, does depend on the ellipticity of the Laplacian. Or from another perspective, that is, you do need the curvature-lower bound of your underlying space, which was proven by Beckery and Akery in the 1980s. The 1980s. So the setting we look at here is that mostly you don't have the curvature lower bound, that is the sub-Riemannian manifold. So this geometric structure comes from the Homondas condition, which we have seen earlier. But let me just mention it again. That is, if you consider a collection of the vector fields, and on each point of your manifold, And on each point of your manifold, you take the finitely many iteratively bracket, like this. This would give you the whole titan space. And then the inner product, so-called sample-remannial metric, is equipped on this subspace. But one thing to be careful here is that we don't require the dimension of this collection of vector fields to remain the same at every point. So, what we consider Point. So, what we consider goes beyond the constant rank case. Actually, you will see later in some of our examples, we also study the rank varying case in the sub-ray magnetic. And moreover, you have the sub-Laccarsian, that is an analog of the La fashion in this case, and this operator is hypoelliptic, which you can Which you can regard it as a much weaker setting than the usual ellipticals. There are two most commonly seen examples. They are both three-dimensional sub-Riemannic manifolds. The first one is the flat model that is the standard isotropic Heisenberg group. It's three-dimensional, and this omega 0 here means a standard simple. A standard syntactic form. So if I have a standard syntactic form, I can associate it with a Pi set. And SU2 is the positive recurved model in that case. Here is the problem we want to study. So take a sub-Riemannian manifold. Suppose there is an analog of production metric there. Then can we prove a hypolliptic type of Hypoeniptic type of Loxovolette inequality of this very similar form. So entropy, some constant, and here, the gradient is the horizontal gradient coming from the subromanic structure. That's the first question. And if such an inequality holds, then what can we say about this constant capital C? How does it depend on the geometry of the underlying space M? And moreover, M and moreover, um can we still get the dimension uh independence result there? Yes. Yes. Actually, there are some fundamental difficulties. Uh I listed four, but actually they are talking about almost the same thing from different perspectives and in different languages. First of all, there is no canonical choice of reference. High non-equal choice of reference metric. Note that here you have a sub-Riemannian structure. You want to have an analog of the Riemannian volume, but this is not so trivial. Here there are two canonical choice. You can do Hausdorff measure or you can do the Hoff measure. But if you go if you look at an arbitrary separate minor manifold, um it could even be not so trivial just to get the explicit formula. Just to get the explicit formula only for your reference measure. Then, if you have different choice of measures, then you will have different formulas for your heat kernel. Then, how can you say about the constant in the inequality? It might be different as well. And second, the hypoellipticity of the generator makes the analysis more challenging. Challenges. So even in the group setting, in some cases, the heat kernel formula is known, it's explicit, but it's not as simple as the Gaussian case. It's long and you do need to work a little bit more to get the Gaussian estimate for the heat kernel. Of course, you do have the general Gaussian estimate for the heat kernel, but that is not enough to get the Enough to get the log salt. Well, even in the simplest non-trivial case, the three-dimensional heist group, it already costs one paper just to get the dimension, just to get the heat kernel estimate in order to prove the lock sovereign. And that is actually what was done in HQG's work in 2006. But third, geometric techniques are not Geometric techniques are not readily available. What I mean here for geometric techniques is the back-wheel MR estimate, the gamma-two lower bound. In this setting, there's no uniform way to define the curvature. Not even the curvature bound, of course. In some cases, for example, for the group, you can define it in some way by taking the limits, but when you do that, the curvature will blow up to negative infinity in certain directions. Certain directions. And of course, you do get gamma calculus to prove gamma to load bound. That's the so-called generalized curvature dimension inequality proven by Bodon and Bonifai. But their version of gamma 2 lower bound has an extra term of the z direction. So the log circle they get involves the z direction. Works the z-direction. And last but not least, functional inequalities are more difficult to prove. It's a PG that I cannot mention, all those nice work that have been done earlier. But one thing here is that most of the work have been done in the group setting. But if you think about arbitrary sub-remanual manifold, no. And even in the group setting, nothing has been said about the dependence of the constant. Of the constant. And actually, this is what we did. We studied a little bit more general sub-Romanian space that is a homogeneous space. We take M as a homogeneous space and it has a transitive and smooth action by a Lie group G. So suppose G has a subramanian structure and we can take its heat kernel measure. Suppose Suppose the Log-Soberlev inequality with respect to that hyperelliptic heat kernel measure on the group, what we prove is that first, on this homogeneous space, there is a natural sub-Romanian structure there. Second, there exists a unique hyperelliptic heat kernel measure on the homogeneous space, such that the heat equation holds. Actually, you can think about this heat kernel measure as the Think about this heat quantum measure as the law of the motion on M generated by its own second motion. Here we only talk about the measure. We do not care so much about the heat kernel or the explicit heat formula for the heat kernel because we don't need it. Even without those formula, we can still get the log-sober inequality. We get the inequality We get the inequality and moreover, we see that the constant in the log sober length on M can be chosen to be the same as the one on the action group G. So that means if you have two different homogeneous spaces, as long as they have the same action group, you can make the log-soberf constant be the same. Does it depend on the choice of the sub-remodel? The choice of the sub-Riemannian structure on G or just on the group G? Just on the group G. And I think it could depend on the separate manual metric. What do you mean by it? Does it depend on the choice of the left invariance of Riemannian structure on G? It could be just not. Uh let me mention briefly the uh idea of the proof. So Idea of the proof. So, actually, this is a very geometric proof. It relies on the homogeneous space characterization theorem. That is, you can rewrite a homogeneous space as a quotient space of the action group G mod its isotropic subgroup. And here, this isotropic subgroup can be characterized by some closed subgroup of G. That means there is a one-to-one correspondence between and the Between N and H. So next, let me give some concrete examples. So actually we provided two types of examples. They are built on these two most commonly studied examples are three-dimensional isotropic Heist group. Isotropic Heisenberg group and SU2. So the first type is that if you have the action group as product of three-dimensional Heisenberg group, then on this class of sub-Riemannian manifold, still to be step two, Log-Soblev holds, and they always have the same constant. And this constant can be chosen to be the same as the Log-Soblev constant on the three-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg groups. Isotropic isotope group. So you don't see any influence of the dimension. Here you have Grushen plane. What's special about the Grushen plane is that the sub-remineral structure there is singular. That means on the vertical direction, the dimension of the horizontal space is Is different from other points on the plane. And this Blushen operator, you get here, and you get the log-sober level inequality with respect to the Bluetooth operator. And the constant is the same. And also, we get the non-isotropic Heisembergroup, which actually comes from the study of the infinite-dimensional cases. So non-isotropic. So non-isotropic Heisenberg groups are highly dimensional Heisenberg groups which are characterized by some symplectic form, a finite dimensional space. So it's a family of Lie groups labeled by such symplectic forms. But what we showed is that on this whole class of Lie groups, they can all Groups, they can all have the same log sofa constant, which are dimension independent. And this allows us to extend the result to the infinite-dimensional Pisippa group. And the main problem there is that since it's an infinite-dimensional space, there is no hard measure. However, we can take the heat quantum measure and we show the log Soberlev inequality, and moreover. Quality, and moreover, that Logsov is also the same as the Loxovalene constant on the three-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg. Last one, that is the compact Heisenberg neomanifold. This is a class of neon manifolds and they can have different isotropy subgroups. What's interesting here is that if you take different isotropy subgroups for your neuron. Subgroups for your new manifold, the topology of this manifold could be completely different. What we have here is that you can ignore their different topologies, they can still have the same block sort of constant, and also they're matching independent. The second type of examples are built upon SU2. So, in a very similar format, you take the You take the action group to be S2 or its product, then you can have such a homogeneous space with this action group. We prove the Luxovolette inequality at the constant is the same as the one R S2. Therefore, dimension-free property is obtained. And for this class of examples, Examples. It includes of fibration that you get the inequality RCP1 and also SO3. Moreover, SO4, they all have the same log sober level constant. But what's special about SO4 is that, in this case, it goes beyond the step two case. SO4, it has step two. Uh so this is uh our main return. Is our main answer. In the end, let me just give some future directions. We want to look at more space and more groups, and actually, our result relies heavily on the symmetry which is induced by the group action. So, we want to study more how the inequality can behave on the all symmetries, for example, in the infinite-dimensional setting. The infinite-dimensional setting, well, there is a much richer theory about symmetry. And moreover, we want to look at other related properties and how they behave under different types of symmetries, for example, coupling and so on. So I think that's all I want to say. Thank you very much. So we certainly have time for questions. Certainly have time for questions, at least a couple. I will ask a first question. In your Grushian example, sorry, maybe I should remember this, but is the operator you look at the one that's self-adjoint for the Euclidean measure or for the singular Riemannian measure? We look at the Clausion operator and it's software joint in I know there is some paper that it shows clearly the software jointness, but I don't remember which measure exactly it takes. It's one of the reference measure, but what we consider here is the heat kernel measure. We don't rely too much on the choice of the reference measure, at least in this case. But so I think sophodron is that's sort of wondering how much so when you are having a homogeneous manifold right homogeneous place right you have some transitivity of your group action but I was just wondering how much explicitly does transitivity come into Explicitly does transitivity come into the pool. So, general, so in some sense, this is like a reduction problem. You have some structure on G and you are going to, some, you are trying to prove similar sort of structures on G mod H. Yes. And a lot of reduction arguments in general go through when you have just a free and proper action of a group on a manifold. So, you have something in M and You have something in M and sort of similar structures often carry down to M1 sheet. So I'm just wondering how much explicitly does transitivity factor in here? So I don't think they realize that much, but maybe I'm not being so explicit here. One place the transmittivity comes in is that the really just the characterization theory for the homogeneous space. But if you can think about Think about other way to reduce the problem of log soberf to some nicer space to study it. If there is some group action to do that, then maybe you don't need transitivity that much. But here in this concrete case, the transitivity will give you the capture as well. The only thing you're, so in some sense, you're just using transentivate transitivity. Just using transitivity to go from GPG modage. Exactly. Yes. So for the usual Riemannian structure on SON, for the standard Riemannian kernel, the logs of constant is known to be mentioned in N. How much different was your step three calculation for SO4 than for SO3 and SO2? Than for SO3 and SO2, do you think it will actually work for the generalized ladder all the way up for SON? Actually, I don't know. I don't know whether you can rewrite SON as such a way, like to rewrite it as a homogeneous space. Of course, it is a homogeneous space itself, but could you show SO4? Could you show that example? For ISO4 you can have for SO and button on sensorization and portion. I wonder whether you can express SOM more generally, but for some other ends. Thanks for the media. Thanks for the better answer. Sorry. Yeah. There's something about SO4. So when you say SO4 is independent of its dimension, you just mean the previous line that SU2 and SO4 have this. SU2 and SO4 have the same one? Exactly. So it is six-dimensional, but you find that it has the same constant as something that is three-dimensional. Right, so potentialization identified as some nice object. Required as a nice object. It's a reasonable observation. Just there's no dimension explicitly on the left there. Further questions? Let's thank the speaker once more and take a proper five-minute break. So our next and final talk is going to start at 4.150. Yeah, because these drinks were really
