Often off over a few years with various collaborators and students. Um but m uh most I'm going to focus on the non-smooth oh just not advancing On audio. I don't know. Some magical thing. All right. So I've been mostly thinking about non-smooth problems recently. And so the first question I'm going to ask is, you know, in a non-smooth case where you have like a switch where the dynamics just changes instantaneously or impact, is that really multiple scale? And so if the answer was no, I probably won't be here. But so you can think of how this But so you can think of how this might appear in various switching systems. So often people use a switch to approximate some more complex thing that's going on, but wherein vector dynamics changes. Some of that's been studied, sort of unraveling switches and things like that by Mike Jeffrey and others. Switches can generate bifurcations. That's what I'm going to focus on today. So we'll be looking at B-tipping in the language of the previous talk. And you can also have systems. And you can also have systems with impacts. I won't talk about those today, but embedded in larger systems, you can even have multiple scales in those settings. So the problem I'm going to at least use as a motivation is the Stummel two-box model. So I won't go into a lot of the application-specific aspects of this, but basically, just to tell you, so this is a two-box or two-compartment model between equator and plus. Model between equator and pole temperature and salinity, and describing ocean circulation. So, basically, this sort of reduced model here is the T is actually the temperature difference and S salinity differences between these two boxes, and then rescale, the non-dimensionalized, and so on. And so we're really going to focus on the bifurcation structure here. You notice here there's a term that depends on the absolute value of T minus. Value of t minus s. And so that's what's going to give us our switch at, and then we put everything in terms of v here, which is t minus s. So the switch is going to be at v0. And so what you have here is what's known as a non-smooth fold, so the non-smooth analogous subinhal bifurcation. And this system actually has a smooth fold as well. So in fact, if you vary, here we're going to focus on eta2, which is freshwater force mechanism application, varying. Application. Varying, increasing, and decreasing, you have a hysteresis loop where the system can switch back and forth between these two. This is a salinity-dominated state, a temperature-dominated state, and then of course an unstable branch in between. So it has kind of the feeling of your usual kind of S-shaped, you know, hysteresis-type loop that you're used to thinking about, but now with a non-smooth fold bifurcation in the middle of that. So the question is, you know. So the question is, does it matter? Does it make a difference that you have something non-smooth rather than smooth? And I'll just mention there's lots of non-smooth things that shows up in, especially the kind of reduced climate models, for exactly the reason I'm saying you might reduce a more complex thing into more of a switch. So here's just a few examples of the pellard and peridin is a pretty common model for these glacial events. Bodica. Events, bodicos for these snowball Earth sort of models. And the grounding line dynamics is an interesting one for motion of Antarctic ice sheets as well, which has a lot of stochastics and switching right now. Okay, so I'm just going to focus on a pretty simple model today, again, motivated by the Stommel model. And really we're going to ask the question of, okay, what can we do in the non-smooth case? What are the parallel questions we might have for the smooth case? We might have for the smooth case. And in particular, we're going to look at not just the bifurcation itself, but in the study, of course, of dynamic bifurcation, where you have variation of the bifurcation parameter, but also with some sort of forcing, oscillations or noise, and I'll look at both, and then see how that interplays with everything. And then later I'll actually go and talk a little bit about nearly non-smooth. Nearly non-smooth. So, of course, nothing is exactly non-smooth. So, what does it mean if you're nearly non-smooth? Is this more like smooth? Is it more like a switch? How do you tell the difference? Okay, so really these are kind of familiar problems, but now cast in the non-smooth setting, which has its advantages and disadvantages, as we'll see. And so, we'll really be looking at what are the drivers for tipping in these settings, and how does the non-smoothness actually play a role? So, going back to our stumble. So, going back to our Stomol-type model, so here again, the red and the blue is the underlying static bifurcation picture, which I showed you before. We're taking A to Q bifurcation parameter to our critical point here for the non-smooth fold, which is this particular value. We're going to let A to 2 vary slowly. We're going to focus mainly on this lower branch, because that's where we have the non-smoothness. Say a little bit about the Smoothness, say a little bit about the smooth case later. And we're going to look at high-frequency oscillatory forcing to start with. So you can think of that as something like annual variation or some other fast variation in the forcing. So I have that in here as well. And so here, just on top of this static bifurcation, you actually see different cases. So without oscillation, we have this lag. I'm going to call it a lag rather than a It's a lag rather than a delay, like Telso did, because we work on problems with delayed feedback, so I tend to call these lags instead. But then with oscillations, you can see that depending on the oscillation, you can actually advance the tipping as well. And tipping is just basically, in our setting, moving away from this lower branch. Later, it will be important to note that this upper branch is actually a node, the unstable branch is a saddle, and that this lower branch is not a node, it's a focal. Is not a node, it's a focus yet. So you want to, that will actually be important later. Okay, so we actually, you know, in order to just say like what's going on in a non-smooth problem, scale this back into even, or not advanced, okay. Into an even simpler problem. So this is a one degree of freedom problem rather than the 2D stomal model. And I'm just going to Thommal model. And I'm just going to start by looking at the case without oscillatory forcing, just varying a parameter here, which is Î¼, like our freshwater forcing. And then we just use these absolute values to basically come up with the same structure as in the Stomo model. And so you can do, you know, sort of for epsilon, small, slow variation of the bifurcation parameter, do your various constructions. The outer, let's say, constructing this branch breaks down when you get near. Constructing this branch breaks down when you get near the non-smooth fold. So you do a local analysis and basically ask when does this thing become exponentially growing, which gives you your tipping. And it's when mu is negative. Here we're able to put our critical value at mu is zero. So when mu is negative, this grows, you have your tipping. And that actually shows up to be at a value that looks like epsilon log epsilon in terms of this slow rate. You can do a similar analysis for stomling. Can do a similar analysis for stummel and get also this epsilon mod epsilon by acre. Now, just to contrast with the smooth case, so this is back for some analysis back to 79. So, this is your classic salmon bifurcation case. And there actually you do a rescaling in terms of epsilon to the 2 thirds, and you get this critical value in terms of epsilon to the 2 thirds. So it gives you the lag relative to the static case. So you can see a different scaling that shows up between the non- Scaling that shows up between the non-smooth and the smooth. And I might mention here: we kind of chose this model just to mimic Stummel. There isn't really a canonical example in the non-smooth case. These things don't really exist like we have in the smooth case. So in some sense, this is the canonical example, but there could be others. Okay, so that gives you different scaling just without any oscillatory forcing. So let's see what happens when we So let's see what happens when we throw in solutary foresting in the nice Okay, so this is with oscillatory forcing and for the moment I'm actually not going to I'm going to throw out this slow variation just so we can see what happens with the oscillatory forcing. So you know going through your usual multiple So, you know, going through your usual multiple scale type approach, you basically can see that you have a fast oscillation with some sort of center of that oscillation. It's the dynamics of the center that give you the tipping. And getting an equation for that center shows up as basically a solvability condition in the whole scales approach. And so, of course, here your multiple scale, your solvability condition, you end up integrating over this absolute value. So you have to sort of keep track of that. Have to sort of keep track of that. But in the end, what it gives you is a critical value of your bifurcation parameter over which you cannot construct these oscillatory behaviors anymore. And so what that looks like is oscillations around the lower branch. And then as you approach this critical value, which is this blue dashed line, this is no longer stable, and your solution, your attracting solution, will be on the upper branch. So that gives you a critical. Branch. So that gives you a critical value of the bifurcation parameter, and basically that's advanced. You can see this blue line is before your static bifurcation. So it gives you the oscillations giving you an advance of the tipping. And you can combine these in a similar way. You get, again, get this solvability condition, but then have to actually solve the time-dependent behavior for this kind of center of the oscillations. But it does give you. But it does give you basically a mixed tipping result, which says there's a contribution from the oscillations, which advances the tipping, as you can see here from these oscillatory cases. But you're slowly varying the bifurcation parameter, so that gives you a leg. And these two pieces are competing. This coefficient is negative here, so one is giving you a leg, one is advanced. Advance. And you can see here this term reduces depending on this size of the amplitude and size of the frequency. So the higher frequency means you get less of a lag. And as that frequency gets very large, then you actually get back to just the epsilon log epsilon magnitude. So this result holds as long as you have some oscillations that are. That are useful, and that breaks down, but then you asymptote to the basic case without any oscillations, then you have really high frequency forcing. Okay, so you can construct all of that and get this competition between the lag and the oscillations and the dynamic bifurcation. You can do the same thing in Stomall. I won't go through this, but it's basically. I won't go through this, but it's basically the same construction. You get a mixed term, again, which is a term that gives you an advance due to oscillations and a lag due to the dynamic bifurcation. And once again, this is really in terms of frequency, high frequency, you asymptote to this epsilon log epsilon behavior. And as frequency gets lower, you get more and more of an advanced. Lower, you get more and more of an advanced. Okay, yeah, maybe I'll talk about that. So, if we compare with the sound milk bifurcation, same sort of thing, you do sort of multiple scales, you get a solvability condition that again gives you a critical point, and you get also a term that gives you a lag due to dynamic piece. Due to dynamic piece and advanced due to periodic peace. They have different scaling exponents, and again, we have this epsilon to the two-thirds rather than epsilon term in the leg. And then these two combine and you can compare them. So if we compare for the 1D case, what we have for the non-smooth fold versus the salt-note bifurcation, really a lot of the difference comes in through this lag due to the... comes in through this lag due to the dynamic barification, this epsilon of two-thirds scaling rather than the epsilon log epsilon term. So your non-smooth foal will have much less of a lag compared to the salinal bifurcation, which means oscillations can have a much bigger impact. Okay, so that's our contrast so far between sort of the simplest case of just the non-smooth fold and the thaldonal bifurcation is seeing that Bifurcation is seeing that in the high-frequency oscillation case, the leg is much plays a much smaller role in the non-smoothful, and so the oscillations can play a bigger role. But then, you know, as happens when we look at these problems, it actually raises more questions than actually answers, right? So you basically say, well, but what about stochastic forcing rather than oscillations? What about if it's not exactly non-smooth, but it's sort of like Non-smooth, but it's sort of like a switch, but not exactly. Does that matter? Do I go back to the sound note case? And what about low frequency rather than high frequency? Because we also have variations that will vary on a completely different time scale. So I'll say a little bit about those things. A lot of them are ongoing work at the moment. And I'll just mention that some of the work for the Silenote case, you've looked at a more general problem. More general problems in various energy balance type problems, in biological problems, as is the case, Morris Lakar with a SNCC rather than sound node bifurcation, and also a little bit in systems with delayed feedback. This is a machine tool problem where the oscillations are delayed as well. But those are all in the smooth case. And most of the work we've looked at is in the stomach. Most of the work we've looked at is in the Stommel case for the applications for the non-smooth. Okay, so let's go back to our non-smooth. I'm going to say a couple a couple of things about stochastic cases. So one difference in the non-smooth cases I mentioned before is this branch with the non-smooth fold is actually a focus, and this is a bifurcation that's driven by a switch, not by the variation of the function, underlying function. The function, underlying function, like it is for this saddle-long case. And so that actually gives you a difference. In particular, you have complex eigenvalues, and the real part of your eigenvalues are not vanishing as you're following this branch. And that's going to give you a difference when you have noise in the problem. So, for example, if you look at sort of the classic early warning signals that you would use for the non-smooth fold, like autocorrelation. Like autocorrelation or sometimes skewness. You have kind of a, as you approach this non-smooth fold, the autocorrelation should be approaching one, and you see this sort of trend. But if you look at that as you try to approach the non-smooth fold, you get more jumping up and down, and there's not really a clear trend. And this is even zoomed in a bit just to see any sort of trend at all. So you cannot really use the same type of early warning signal. Same type of early warning signals that you can in the smooth case. But you can go back and look at it and say, well, what's actually going on when you have noise here? And actually, you see the noise is actually amplifying oscillations on this lower branch. Because you do see it's noise-driven tipping. And you can see this by just looking at the power spectrum. If you look at what's the behavior near either of these branches in the phase plane, over here we have the power spectrum. So in this lower branch, we actually see Lower branch, we actually see a peak in the power spectrum at some non-trivial value of frequency, which says there's some sort of resonance going on. And in fact, it's a coherence resonance, so basically the noise is exciting some inherent oscillation in the system associated with the focus. So one possible early warning signal type problem, which has been used more in sort of the neural literature, is something. Literature is something related to coherency measure, which basically just relates the height of the power spectrum to its width. And that actually seems to work a lot better in terms of showing a trend for tipping. These are two different curves for smaller noise where the tipping is not as advanced, but larger noise, and you get a larger beta here, and then a drop when you actually have the tipping. So that seems promising in terms of looking at a different type of Looking at a different type of early warning signals. And some of these have shown up in various works with Christian Kun and co-authors on looking at these in different types of oscillations and different types of early warning signals. Okay, so that's one difference in the stochastic business. And we've also started to ask the question, what about the stochastic effects in the nearly non-smooth case? And what can you say in that case? Say in that case. Okay, and so the toy model we've looked at in that case is instead of this just simple before we had absolute value of x here, now we just look at throwing in a sort of regularization parameter alpha here. As alpha goes to 0, we're just back to the absolute value of x. That gives us our switch. If alpha is large enough, then we're basically at a salvonome quantification. And so really our sort of weakly non-smooth case. Really, our sort of weakly non-smooth case will be alpha small, and you can actually do the analysis to show that it's alpha less than, much less than epsilon. So we've done some preliminary analysis just to say without even writing down the whole probability density or something like that, what can you get from scaling just by looking at this problem? And in particular, what is sort of a critical relationship between here's low drift rate and the normal? Here is low drift rate and noise in terms of when is noise going to drive tipping, advancing tipping, as opposed to just giving you some variation. It's kind of an ugly calculation, but basically you scale everything in sight with the size of the noise here, which is not to be too large, and then look at a WKB type approximation and thrown in with multi-scale to see where you get a balance and what sort of balance to get. So I won't take you through all that. So, I won't take you through all that analysis, but just to say that when you do this, you get basically two possible cases. So, one is sort of a quasi-stationary behavior where essentially the exponent for your WKB type expansion looks like what you would get if you actually had some slowly varying potential well and you're looking at exit from a potential well. So, that's sort of the quasi-stationary case. And then you could have a Gaussian type behavior where the system is basically following the underlying determinant. Basically, following the underlying deterministic dynamics with some variation. And so, those are two different behaviors. And the first of these is where you really get the advanced tipping that you're no longer following, sort of the underlying behavior. And this type of result has shown up in the, this is in the alpha much larger than epsilon, so this is the salmon bifurcation, basically the smooth case in lots of other work. And this relationship. And this relationship where the noise goes as square root of the drift rate as being sort of your critical place where your advanced tipping shows up. The reason I'm mentioning this is because it also works for the non-smooth case as well. You can actually take the WKB farther and actually construct the probability density explicitly. But without doing that, you know, you can actually just go to the similar The similar analysis in rescaling everything and trying to see where's the critical rate at which you get noise-driven tipping. And when you're in the, let's say, nearly non-smooth case, when alpha is pretty small, then you actually see a different relationship, which is basically the noise is larger than the drift right. So you'll see that difference in where the In where the tipping is advanced. It's a little hard to visualize this, but this is basically graphing the tipping point for different colors here correspond to different levels of noise, starting with zero noise. And this lower curve here is basically the curve that gives you the epsilon log epsilon non-smooth lag and then the epsilon to the two-thirds leg when you're. Two-thirds lag when you're in the regularized case. Okay, and then you can see as you get more towards the non-smooth case, the noise has sort of a bigger effect. And you can see this for different values of epsilon. So these are different values of epsilon related to the regularization on the log scale. And I tried to draw in here, again, it's sort of hard, is this the cutoffs between the square root of epsilon behavior, so this is the normal. Epsilon behavior, so this is the noise at the square root of epsilon, this is the noise at epsilon, and where you start to see more and more of the trajectory spreading out, meaning the noise has a bigger effect on the tipping. And so, for example, over here, if you zoom in, you can see much more of the noise pushing in advance of the tipping point above the square root behavior, whereas down here, Whereas down here, it already starts to fan out above just the epsilon type behavior. So and then of course there's other things at play here. How much is this lag related to the static point and so on? So a lot of stuff in here to explore more carefully with approaches to the stochastic behavior. Finally, I'll just say there's various rigorous results that you can pull out from this so-called canonical problem related to the non-smooth case. So this is just with the usual oscillatory forcing, not noise. As I mentioned before, the results that I showed you at the beginning were only for large frequency, but you can construct results also for small frequency and get the And get the critical oscillations that will advance, I'm sorry, the critical value Î¼, where oscillations advance the tipping for small omega as well. Basically, you construct the piecewise smooth solutions. So in the non-smooth case, on the one hand, you have the non-smoothness, which is bad, but then it's otherwise linear, which means you construct these things analytically and actually find that. And even though it looks like these are sort of And even though it looks like these are sort of the red is the actual solution itself, you can see the non-smooth is in the derivative, which I've graphed here in clue as well. So you really have to construct a piecewise solution. And there's some analogous things going on with the smooth case related actually to brazing and where you see sort of the advance or not advance of the tipping. So we've looked at that in the smooth case. Looked at that in the smooth case. It turns out some critical values show up and they seem to be related to the grazing that is when you approach a switching surface in the non-smooth case. So that's ongoing work. Okay, so hopefully I've given you at least a little bit of flavor of differences we see in these non-smooth bifurcations in this very simple problem. Essentially that the lag that you see is much less than the non-smooth case. Is much less in the non-smooth case. So, other types of forcing can have a bigger advance in the tipping that you might see. Coherence resonance can be important as well, particularly in higher-dimensional systems. We have to look at these different scaling limits as we go along. This multi-scale WKB turns out to be important in a number of different problems as well. There's a lot of work yet to do on the low-frequency. Work yet to do on the low frequency case. There are jumps in the tipping point that you see in the low frequency case related to phase and so on. And then gradually we're getting more and more rigorous results in this sort of at least toy economical constants. So thank you very much. Other questions? Concerning what you showed in terms of the early warning signals, which don't like these autocorrelations or variances, they don't really work and the scaling closest is not that kind of so you of course you don't have this smooth approach where the rate of attraction becomes smaller and smaller and then you probably like there's no mathematical way of how you could build this. Yeah, because the re the real part of the eigenvalue is not getting smaller. You're hitting the switch before that happens. You can see that, at least in typical parameters, you can see there is a fold somewhere, but it's way off somewhere, you don't get anywhere close to that side. I see. And then, so something like the approach that you've shown with the smaller scale of UKB, this would be the main kind of... Well, so like I showed, there's these things based on the power spectral density, which we've seen work. Some people look at skewness seems to also. Seems to also, some people use QNIS in the smooth case, so it does show up in the non-scroof case as well. You haven't totally examined that, but that you'd have to look at, I think, a little more carefully in this multi-scale WK or another way of constructing the power spectrum. I mean, the probability entity would show up in other methods. So, concerning this part of the system, you have noise as well. I saw in one slide that it was additive noise. Noise. So typically in these models, they use mostly because of the interpretation of ecological systems, they use multiplicative noise. Would that make any difference? It would make a difference. We actually, that actually shows up in this problem. This is a problem in the there's some bifurcation, but with state noise, this is one of these reduced energy balance type models. Energy balance type model. So we've actually used this method here to construct the densities. Probably the ugliest part of this is actually when you get into the tipping phase, it's hard to pick up this density because you're basically some sort of multimodal thing. And so you're trying to pick up this long tail. So there is another construction of the density, especially in this asymmetric shape, that you have to try to match that tail. try to match that tail. We did a little bit of that, but probably there's better approaches. I know that Eisenman and some other people he's worked with have used other types of approaches. I don't know if there's anything that's particularly satisfying. Okay, thank you. You talked about considering a low frequency case. Have you, thinking about the stochastic model, have you thought about more general noise types? You're not just going to add a Noise type, so not just going to add it versus both of them, but does it have any orange movement from sense driving the system? Yeah, we haven't really looked at that. I mean, definitely, you know, that's something to look at here. I mean, I think here, you know, from this, just going pure scaling without constructing anything, I think the scaling sorts of limits would probably, you know, give you sort of similar types of things, you know, that where you start to see the balance. Where you start to see the balance between the key parts of your problem. So it would be higher-dimensional, but still like where the diffusion and something else balance and you don't necessarily have the time dependence anymore. I would expect those sort of similar things to show. But you have to do it through the same thing. Yeah, if I can. I should just remove the discussion from actually. Yes. So thank you again.
