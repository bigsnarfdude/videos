This is Livier and other people from IPGP France. And so, okay, so like you've heard a couple of times, so far rivers are channels of sand or sediment that carry two things. So they carry water and they carry sediment. So obviously water is important, that's what makes the river. But on the other hand, they need to carry sediment because if they weren't able to do that do that, they wouldn't be able to Do that, they wouldn't be able to make their own channels. And in fact, it is this function where they take sort of sediment from the mountains and they carry it all the way to the ocean and they deposit it all along the way. In this way, they create all the landscapes. And sort of this whole project started in Olivia's group, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago. But recently, maybe a couple of years ago, Anna Sabramian did these experiments where she had a bed full of sediment and then she would feed in fluid, which is not exactly water, it was a mixture of water and glycerol, so it was very thick. So the flow that that was created was alumina, so so as to make the thing simpler. So, as to make the thing simpler. And then she would wait a long time so that everything equilibrates. And she would also feed in sediment at the prescribed rate. And then after a while, the channel would form. And then she could take measurements of the shape, she could take the close pictures, and so on. And the important thing is that everything would sort of come to an equilibrium. As much as you pour sediment in at the beginning, Sediment in at the beginning, every cross-section that you look at, and also in the end, at the outlet, the same amount of sediment would be transported. And this is sort of what that river would look like, but it's very straight. And from that camera, she could zoom in and she could track individual grains and she could track their trajectories, and then she could say exactly how much sediment is transported and where and so. Where and so, this is sort of one example of the results from those experiments. So, this is a cross-section of a river, and in this case, there was no sediment being fed in. And if we look at anywhere across the river, there is also no sediment transport. So, this little QS sort of says about the intensity of sediment transport. So, how many grains per unit. How many grains per unit width are being transported at some location? And then, if she feeds in segments, then the river changes shape, so it has to adjust somehow to the amount of sediment it's being carried. And also, you can see this profile of intensity of sediment transfer. So, it has some more or less well-defined intensity, maximum intensity, and there is a well-defined region of the river. Find a region of the river that carries sediment. It doesn't carry it all over. And then if we change the amount of sediment that's being fed in, so we can see that, so this is the aspect ratio, the width of the river divided by the height, the depth, as a function of how much sediment is being fed in. And you can see that the rivers become wider and shallower. And on the other hand, this is the And on the other hand, this is the sort of the maximum intensity of transport. And you can see that you feed in more sediment, it increases, but then it kind of stops increasing. So the amount of, the intensity of sediment transport saturates with the amount of sediment that's being produced. And then this is this transport with sort of the part of the river that's carrying sediment, and that also increases as you increase the amount of sediment. As you know, this the amount of setting being heavy. Okay? So these were these laminar experiments, and we built a theory for that. It worked, and I'll tell you about it. But then we also wanted to see whether this theory can apply to field measurements. And in fact, Eric from our group found this data set from a woman called Christine Bund, I think. I think. And she went for a long time, 15, 20 years, every summer to a place like here, somewhere in the US, all around, but in these mountainous regions, when there was snow melt, and then she would place these traps. And throughout the whole season of snow melt, when there was this high Melt, when there was this high flow, she would measure how much sediment is collected at each point along the river. And they did extremely detailed measurements of everything, not just the sediment, not just how much sediment is collected, but also the flow, the shape of the river, and so on. And those are sort of the places they got. And this is an example of some. And this is an example of such a measurement. So, this is the shape of the river, and then you could see also the intensity of sediment being transported. And also, you know, sometimes rivers transport a lot, sometimes they transport less. And if you look at these things, like the aspect ratio, the sentiment flux, the transport twist, they sort of follow more or less similar patterns as the measurements. Okay? So, Okay, so we want to model this. And so the model sort of has three components. First, the flow. So we assume the flow just adjusts to any shape. So whatever shape you provide, the flow will more or less immediately adjust, and this will create some stress along the bottom. So the stress is a function of the shape. A function of the shape. And then this stress will induce some sediment flux. So the sediment flux is a function of the stress. And then finally, these grains start to move and then they're no longer just controlled by the stress. They also want to move downhill because they're dislodged and they want to move downhill. But they also diffuse because they're not moving straightforward. And this, if you do sort of a statistical If you do a sort of a statistical analysis of this, it gives you that this flux should also be a function of the shape. So the stress is a function of the shape, the intensity of sediment transport is a function of the stress, and then it is also a function of the shape. And if you combine these two, you can find some shape which satisfies all of these conditions. Okay? And so the first thing, the fluid flow, if we just look downstream, Look downstream. Rivers flow down some hill, some slope, and their velocity doesn't change downhill. And this means that the amount of momentum that's injected by gravity has to be expanded by the friction. And if you just make this simple balance, you see that the stress on the bottom should scale as the sort of weight of the fluid column. The fluid column in the direction of the flow, something. And this stress is really the sort of the force per unit area on the bottom. So this is downhill, and then if we look at some cross-section, then we can assume that sort of the flow adjusts immediately. And then, depending on what the flow is, you can solve that, and you can find the stress. Let's say it's for the Laminar flow, you solve the Poisson equation. We can get the stress along the button. Okay, but because we're interested in the turbulent flow, we want to see what happens in the general case. So again, we look at straight rivers that flow along some slope, and then maybe they can be turbulent or they can be laminar. But in either case, the balance. Case, the balance for the momentum is always the same. So, a part of the momentum, so first of all, for each, we take a part of this section, if you slice it like this, you know, you inject fluid by gravity, you inject momentum by gravity, and then you expand some of it on friction to the bottom, and then there is a third part which is sort of exchanged across the boundaries. And if you write completely generally, regardless of whether it's lemoner or term. Regardless of whether it's laminar or turbulent, this is the equation that must be satisfied. So, this f is the flux of momentum across these boundaries. Prime is a derivative across the stream. And so, this is how much we inject by gravity. This is the amount of friction that's expanded at the bottom. And then, this is the divergence of the flux. And this is completely general, it would be true for. And this is completely general. It would be true for a turbulent flow, for a laminate flow, for a lava flow, hydro. So the only thing that differs from one fluid to another is how you model this flux of momentum. The only thing you want to know is the stress in the button, or the only thing you need to know is the flux across the stream. Assuming that this channel is straight. Okay, so if the flow Okay, so if the flow is turbulent, we can assume there are some eddies that sort of mix the fluid that is not moving exactly the same velocity across the stream. And these eddies have some length scale and move at some typical velocity. So they mix fluid from here with the fluid from here. And if we go through this sort of completely simple exercise. Completely simple exercise, we get that sort of the flux should be something like this. It should, this skies some constant, d is the depth, and this tau is the stress. So the flux should be proportional to a gradient of the stress, and we can compare with the data in the experiments. Turns out this ties about that. Surprise about that. But the interesting thing is. This is the gradient across the stream of the stress. So this prime is really the derivative across the stream. And then, and then, but the interesting thing is that for our laminar flow, it's kind of the same. So it's as if we put this chi is one-third, and just if we put this derivative not just on tau, but on both. Not just on tau, but on both of these. So they're actually very similar. And you know, you can write this in terms of the stress, you can write it in terms of the flow velocity, but it turns out that there is this equivalence only if you write it in terms of stress. Okay, so if we have so so this sort of already suggests that the experiments are not bad. Are not bad of a model for real rivers. And if we have the flux, then we can solve this equation because this is a function of the stress. If we have a given shape, we can solve for the stress. So, this is the first part where we can. Part where we get the stress as a function of the shape. Then the next is how sediment is moved. So if we look at the bottom and it's full of sediment grains and there is a flow flowing across and it's trying to move these individual grains, there are some forces acting on it. So the flow tries to dislodge the grains, but gravity tries to keep them in place. There is some friction. And then if the If this fluid stress can overcome the friction, then the drains move. So, if this sort of the ratio of the tangential force, which is the full stress, to the normal force, is bigger than some threshold, then the greatest certain okay. So, this force ratio is about the fluid force, the ratio. The force, the ratio of the fluid force to the gravity force. So the gravity force scales with the weight of the grains. So this is the size of individual grains, or gravity, and this is just the reduced weight because they're water. And then the fluid stress depends, the fluid force depends on the stress, which is force per unit area, and the area of the grains is just the Radius is just ds squared, so they're radius squared. So if they're close to the threshold, this means that this ratio is close to 1, which means that the stress should scale more or less with the grain size. And I think Olivia already talked to you about this. So we have on the one hand, river is close to threshold, and on the other hand, the velocity downstream. The velocity downstream is not changing. This is this other balance. And if we just say both are true at the same time, then more or less get that the size of the river, so its depth, is roughly equal to the ratio of the size of the grains to the slope. So if you go to that river where we're swimming, you know, the river goes up to here, it's about one meter. I don't know. It's about one meter. I don't know. Uh the the grains are one centimeter. So you can say the slope is one centimetre to where the bottom falls. So it's like 10 to the minus about. And so this also means that depth and slope are not independent. So so the river is not flowing down some prescribed slope, it makes its own slope and it makes its own depth. And if we look at the field measurements, And if we look at the field measurements, so these are the data from Boot, so there is this sort of relationship between depth and slope. And if we look at the data, this line is this relationship, sort of one over S, with the prefactors which correspond to the prefactors that come into here, with some fitting which is of order one. But you can see that more or less. But you can see that more or less the data follow this relationship. And again, this is independent of whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, because this is just a balance of momentum downstream and being close to threshold. Okay, so now that we have sort of this force that acts on the brain, it is a question of how much. Of how much, what would be the intensity of sediment transfer. So these are lab experiments. Sort of the we, or anise, anise again, who increased the stress on the bottom and then measured how much sediment is being entrained. And so you can see that there is sort of a this is the stress, and up to some point there is sort. To some point, there is almost no transport, and then it starts to grow more or less linearly. So, as a model, you could say that the amount of sediment intensity is zero below this threshold, and then grows linearly with the stress above it. And we can look at the data, and if we look at the data, it seems completely wrong. If we look at the data in the field, so this. We look at the data in the field. So, this is again the intensity of sediment transport, this is this distance to threshold, and these are all different days and different times that they took measurements on one particular river. And this is the logarithmic scale, so it seems like it's exponential. But in fact, it turns out it just doesn't really enter into this linear regime so much, because if we superimpose We superimpose what the experiments look like on a logarithmic scale, they're more or less matched. I mean, the scales are not the same, they're made, so this is shifted downward, so that they match, but the shape is more or less consistent. So even for a real river, we could say maybe this is more or less. And then the final thing: when the grains start to move, they move in this zigzag way. In this zigzag way downstream, okay, so they move downstream because the fluid pulls them. But on the other hand, they want to go to the bottom, but because of this zigzag motion, they also diffuse a bit. And so it ends up sort of you get the same kind of situation that you have in a gas in an atmosphere. So on the one hand, gravity wants to pull the whole atmosphere down. On the other hand, temperature sort of raises it up. Temperature sort of raises it up. And from this balance, you get an exponential density profile. So if you go up into the atmosphere, you know, the pressure exponentially drops. And exactly the same thing happens with rains. Now you have gravity pulling them down and grain diffusion pulling them up. So diffusion is like temperature. And then you get this exponential connection between the intensity, the number of grains. The intensity, the number of grains moved, and the depth. So, this is this Boltzmann distribution, exactly the same as what you have in the image. And if we look at the experiments, so these are again the experiments from the lab. This is the elevation and this is the block of the sediment flux, and they fall on a straight line, which means it's an exponential. So, you get So, you get this Boltzmann distribution in the drains, in the lab. And then, what about the field data? So, in the field, we do again. So, this is again sort of this semi-log scale of sediment flux and elevation. And these are all the different points, different measurements. Different measurements on the rivers, on the real rivers, and more or less you get the same thing. And if you look at our real river, this was a measurement 2007. So this is the profile of the river. These are where the traps were. And these bars are how much sediment was collected. And then we fit this Boltzmann distribution, so the exponent. This Boltzmann distribution, so the exponential to the shape, then it sort of follows the Boltzmann distribution. So the three components of the model are fluid flow sets the stress, then sediment, the stress sets the sediment transport, and then this Boltzmann distribution relates the sediment flux back to the shape. And you can find a unique solution to this process. So we can compare. So we can compare, these are the experiments, and we can apply the model. And now there is no fitting because in the experiment we can just measure everything. So this would be the result of the model. Of course, because this is zero, there is no transport of sediment, both model. And the experiments agree. And then in this case, we can also reproduce the We can also reproduce the experiments. If we look at these, you know, what happens as we change the amount of sediment being carried, again the model is correct. And then what happens with the field measurements? And now it's not true that there is no fitting here because the measurements are not so clean, let's say. But again, you can. Clean, let's say, but again, you can get something with reasonable parameters which sort of matches the field data. And again, if we look at what happens in the field data with the as the as the sediment discharge is increased, again you get the same patterns and more or less the model is correct. So there is one significant difference, let's say, and that's that the aspect ratio in the data In the data, in the experiment, they're around four, maybe. So the river is four times as wide as it is deep. Whereas in the measurement, in the field data, it is about 30 times. And how much time? One minute. Okay. Okay, so the key to understanding all of this is the fact that this sediment Sediment, the intensity of sediment transport saturates. So, how much you, if you transport a lot, you still saturate in intensity. And so, this means that, okay, if we increase the amount of sediment being carried, let's say this is a river and this is the profile of this intensive sediment transport, and it has some maximum. And then, if it reaches this maximum, if you want to increase the amount of sediment being transported. Increase the amount of sediment being transported, and you have to make the river wider, which also means that you have to make it shallower because you need to conserve the amount of water. And so the one big difference between the laminar flow and turbulent flow is the amount of momentum that's being transported. Because there was that pre-factor chi, which is the amount of Which is the amount of momentum being transported, that for the turbulent fall was much, much bigger than for the land. And so we can just ask what happens is we increase this amount of momentum, fluid momentum being transported. And it turns out that the aspect ratio of these rivers becomes bigger, which is why the real rivers are so much wider. This is the effect of turbulence. Turbulence makes them much wider. But on the other hand, But on the other hand, the intensity of sediment flux saturates. Even with this sky, with the amount of momentum being transported, you can't get very far. You can't get very, very intense signal transport. That's it. So maybe two questions. The juniors first. So I guess So, I guess. So, it seems that for larger discharge of sediment, your theory closer shape to the experiment for no sediment transport, no discharge. It was a bit wider than the theoretical shape. Do you have any idea why? Well, I have an idea for.
