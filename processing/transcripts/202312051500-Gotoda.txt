So today I'll talk about these topics: entropy variations by point about crops on in beached frauds. So first, let me explain the motivations of these studies. So one of the main motivation is I want to understand the 2D turbulent flows. And you know the entropy dissipation in the in-bist remit is a remarkable property. Remit is a remarkable property to characterize 2D turbulent flows. But and in my motivations, I want to characterize this dissipation phenomena by the solutions of the differential equations. But since the smooth solutions conserve the entropies, so we have to consider the singular non-smooth solutions of the differential equations to understanding this kind of dissipation phenomenon. Dissipation phenomena. And in the mathematical aspects, in this talk, I focused on the 2D Euler equations as in-bist models. And I know it is natural to consider the Navier-Stokes equations and consider the in-bis limit of the solutions. But in this talk, I directly treat the 2D Euler equations as the in-bis models. So we consider the ideal situations. Situations. And another motivation of this study is to characterize the dissipation phenomena by the vortex dynamics. I mean, what kind of vortex dynamics causes the entropy dissipations in the PC situations? So to realize this task, we consider the point-bodied solutions as singular and non-singular processes, ideal processes. But the problem is we don't have solvabilities for the 2D Euler equations with the point initial probabilities. So that means we have to regularize the 2D Euler equations in some sense. And in this talk, I treat the Friedrich Euler equations, which is regularized models of the Euler equations. So and this equation has global solvities for the point vertex initial. Point vertex intervorticities. So, in first words, we introduce these topics. So, first, I explain the point vortex system, and this is formally derived from the 2D Euler equations, and this is the probability form of the 2D Euler equations. And we consider the initial probes like this, and as I mentioned, for this initial probability, the 2D Euler equations. The 2D Euler equations in the probaticity form do not have the global solvabilities. So we have to consider the regularization of these equations. First, we can formally drive the point product systems, and this system has self-smircing solutions. This is very important in this talk. And we try to construct in-surface dissipating solutions by using these self-similar crops or point botanists. Next, I explain the regularized models which cause the virtual point systems. This comes from the 2D filtered Euler equations. And in this talk, I skip the details, derivations of these 2D filter Euler equations and the details properties. But for this form of the filtered Euler equation, it's given like this. The difference between the 2D Euler equation. Between the 2D Euler equations and the filtered Euler equation, is this term, convection term, U epsilon. In the Euler equations, we use user velocities, but in the filtered Euler equations, we use the filtered velocity velocity U epsilon. And U is defined like this. And in Euler case, we use the usual version of our rows like this, but here we use regularized colour capital. Regularized current k epsilon and k epsilon is defined by the compositions of the singular current k and some given functions h and we call this function h filter function and this function characterizes the regular regularities of the filtered Euler equations. So for example, we take this function h by the for example Bester functions, then we can derive the Euler alpha equations. So H is very So, it is very important functions to characterize the fertile models. And next, we introduce some recent results of the entropy dissipations that is caused by triple crops of point plot seeds. And the last one is the main results. I show the numerical result that shows the four and five point bottles that cause the insulatic spatial. That causes the insurficience by the collapse of 400 point policies. So, first, I explain the point system. This is derived from the Euler equations formally. And the gamma m is the strength of M's point product state, and Km is the initial position of that point vertex. And we express the point-bodied system in the complex coordinate for simplicity. And this system. And this system is a Hamiltonian system, and its Hamiltonian is given by like this, and this system has several conserved quantities. Okay, today I focus on the self-similar solutions of the point-to-plot systems. And we call the solution is self-similar if the solution is expressed by this form. Km is in. This form km is initial position and equip is independent of the number of m's. This is very important. Substituting these answers to the point protein system, we obtain these equalities like this. And this is a complex constant. So we can express these terms by the capital A plus IB, capital B. B's and raj capital A and B are independent of M and this is just characterized by determined by the given constant gamma M and K M and these two constants are very important and characterize the properties of the self-similar solutions. For example, if b equals zero, then a solution is solution is not rotating. Is not rotating and A goes zero, then it's a fixed point, and A is not zero, then it's a straight coefficient. And we have the explicit formula like this. And today's talks focus on the B is not zeros and A is not zero. In this case, the similar solutions is expressed by these formulations. So we can easily find the We can easily find this solution collapse at a finite time when the A is negative. So this formulation and the collapse time is given by like this. And we easily find this solution, CSMS solution satisfies this condition. These conserved quantities equal to zero. And also, the center pointistis is also zeros. So, this point bordering system has translation invariance, but we fix it at the origins. Fix the center vertices at the origins. And we also find this constant gamma is the summation of the strength of point vertices equals to zero. And we can easily find these conditions for the state-shimmer corruption. Conditions for the cell similar corrupting solutions. The problem is the existence of the cell similar corrupting solutions for the point-to-port system, and for the three-point-to-tox problems, we have the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of sensitial corruption solutions. And that condition is given by like this: gamma and m equal to zeros. That is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of self-stream collapsing. Of self-seminal corruption. Thus, for the n-bortex problems and n is greater than four, we have not obtained explicit formulas for existing self-stream corrupting solutions. But we know some examples of the self-stream corrupting solutions. We use in part following, we use these examples, and I explain this example later. Example later. Okay, this is the example of three-point bault seeds. So in the following numerical simulations, I use this initial configuration for the three-point bault seats. And the point about system has the rotational invariance and scaling invariance. So we have to fix some point, point both states. So in this case, we fix. So, in this case, we fix the third point process at the one zero point here. And we also, for simplicity, we also assume that the strengths of first and second point hypothesis have the same strength commas. Then, some invariant quantity determines the third ones, like this. This is the example of the self-smear collapsing solutions of three-point hypothesis. Of three-point hypothesis. Rather, in this example, the theta is very important. So, as we can see in these figures, so in these areas, the corresponding solutions is cell streamer corrosing, but in these regions, the corresponding solutions are expanding, cell stream expanding. So, in this talk, I want to focus on the cell stream cross-sing solutions. So, I restrict I restrict the regions of zeta to the interval of zero to pi over two in this region. This is an example of the serial simulator solutions. This is the example of the four and five point balancees. This is a five-point balance case. And we have explicit formulas for the initial configurations. Initial configurations of self-immaculating solutions like this, and we also assume these conditions. In this case, as well as the 3.46 case, we restrict the region of theta to the 0, 2 pi over 2, because in these areas, the corresponding solution is say general corruption. And the pdia is like this. So, in this So, in these examples, P and Q equals zero are automatically satisfied, but the rest of the conserved quantities is not satisfied, is not always zero. So, we have to assume some conditions for the conserved quantities like this. So, I and M and gamma equals to zero. This is the conditions. And for the four-point voltage problems, we see. Problems, we simply set grammar 3 equals zero. So just ignore the fixed point about this. They even have this initial configuration for the seriesremia collapsing. And this is the orbit of the self-streamer collapsing. So now I introduce the regularized point policy system. We call it the filter point product systems. This is almost the same as a This is almost the same as the polynomial system, but the only difference is here. There is a regularization term, PK. And this system is derived from the 2D filtered order equations with the mathematical rigors, with the point of vortex initial data. And PK is defined like this. It's a little bit complicated, but the important thing is PK is only determined by the filter function H. So, this characterizes the regularities of these filter models. And this spherical point-to-particle system has some conserved quantities. It's almost the same as the point-to-particle systems, like this. Whereas the Hamiltonian is different from the point-to-particle system. And the Hamiltonian over this spherical model is given like this, given by this one. And this part is the Hamiltonian. And this part is the Hamiltonian of the point, but in the Hilton model, there is additional terms, Hc. And this comes from the Hilta function H. And we next we derive the variation of entropies for the filter point vortex system. For the filter point vertic system. So, here we consider we are considering the point vorticity system, a point vertices as the initial vorticities. That means the vorticity is given by zero function, direct deltas. So in this case, we can define the entropies because it's defined by the Erson norms of the vorticities. So we can define the total entropies directories. But by using But by using the Fourier transformations, we can derive the variation part of the total entropies. Then we have obtained these formulas. This means we divide the total entropy into the two parts. One part is the time-dependent part, and the other one is time-independent terms. And we focus on the time-dependent term here. Then we can derive these formulas for the filter point for the systems. The filter point of the system J0 is the baseline functions of the first kind. Then the constructing the entropy dissipating solutions by using the self-stimulate crops or point hypothesis is not the this study is not the first one for constructing such kind of main surface dispensing solutions. And one of the pioneer works of One of the pioneer works of these topics is research by Professor Sakajo in Kyoto Universities. He constructed some entropy dissipating solutions by using the triple claps of point processes in the Euler alpha equations. But his result is using some numerical simulations. Some numerical simulations. And after that, we have proven his results with mass transgress in this article. And this result was extended to the 2D filter Euler models. So these results are for the 2G Euler alpha equations, but these results for the 2D filtered Euler equations. So I mean the engineering case. So, in the following, I show some numerical assimilations for the 4 and 5 point filter point. And in fact, for us, I use Euler alpha models because to do the numerical simulations, we have to specify the filter function. But here, I use Euler-Arpha models. So, H is given by the basic functions like this. Then, PK is described by. This, then PK is described by this one. And also define the sum critical time of the evolution of filter point voltage system by this one. So I mean we consider the summations of the distances of point voltages and we define the critical time when the this error arrive at reached at the minimum values. Minimum, minimum values. The numerical simulation shows that this critical time combines to the semi-streamer corrupting collapse time of the semi-streamer corrosing solutions of the point of system in the limit of epsilon zero limit. Then we in the following numerical simulations, I compute the dynamics of the solution of polyfilter points. Of the peripheral point body system with the initial configurations: these ones, IC3 and IC5 and IC4, like this. Then the initial configuration is parameterized by the task. So we can consider this variation of entropies and critical time as a function of the task. So we plot this function. So we plot this function as these functions as a function of CTS. The profital point body systems, we have these classifications of the corresponding solutions. So in this talk, we focus on these areas. Just shrinking. And as I mentioned, the filter model has the global probabilities, so there is no crops or point both these. Is no crops or point of both this if the epsilon is finite, positive constant? So just I write just shrinking, not crops. This is a case for the poor and fine point poses, like this. So we focus on these areas in this talk. This is examples of the numerical simulations of the three-point hypothesis, and this is from. And this is from time from zero to critical time. At the critical time, three-point bottles is on the same line. We call it the collinear state. And this is the simulation from t equals zero to the double critical time. Then this is a plot of the entropy variations. So enthalpy variation raises its minimal values at the critical time, like this. Like this. And this is just the orbits of three-point vortices by changing epsilons. So taking epsilon small, then the three-point vortices at critical time get close to each other like this. And taking the limit of epsilon limit, then the three-point bottles corridor at the same time. This is the graph of enthalpy variations by changing epsilons. So, as we can see, the entropy variations combines to the delta functions and its support is located at the critical time here. So, that means the entropy displace at the critical time. So, that means the triple collapse causes Triple crops causes entropy dissipation. This is a movies for the three-point both sides by changing theta from zero to pi over two. So variation of entropy is always negative and it gets its minimal values, the minimal values at critical time, like this. This is the configuration of the variation of entropies at the critical time. And the horizontal line axis is the C death. The vertical line is the variation of entropy. So the variation of entropy is always negative. That means the stripe collapse always causes entropy dissipations. This is the This is the numerical simulations for the PowerPoint about the system. So in this case, there is a critical theta. And if theta is less than this critical values, then the entropy variation is always negative. So that means the collapse of four-point both is causes entropy dissipations in the epsilon zone limit. Because if the theta is greater than discrete carbon, Greater than these critical values, then the entropy is positive. But I don't know why this happens, so we have to study these situations in the future. But at least in these regions, we can say the collapse of point topic causes entropy dissipation. This is a case of the five-point both seas. So in this So, in this case, there is also the critical values, and this is the dissipation areas, dissipation range. This is movies for the four-point bosses by changing theta. So, theta is small. When the theta is small, then the variation of answer is negative. Ratio of entropy is negative, but after the critical values, the entropy at the critical time is positive. And the entropy variation is negative, then the configurations of the critical time, the point both is forms the collinear state, but after the critical values, this forms some, it's not on the same lines. This is a case of the four five point. The case of the five-point velocities. The same situation happens for this case. So, when the variation of entropy is negative, then the point of voticis at the critical time on the coronian states, but after the critical values, they are not on the same lines. So, we don't know what happens. We don't know what happens after the critical values, but so in the future, I have to study what happens here for the anthropology is positive. This is the concluding remarks. So we already shown proven the enthalpy dissipation by the triple crops, but in this talk, we show us the same situation. talks we show that the same situation happens for the 4 and 5 point topic systems. So I mean the selfish mere crops of point sites causes entropy dissipations. So as the future works, I want to study the large number of points, but in this case it is very difficult to numerically simulate because we have to use some high precision schemes for solving the point about the For solving the point about the system. Okay, this is the end of my talk. Thank you.
