Yeah, thanks for the invitation. So I'll be talking about various processes happening at the RC interface and how they influence or control mass exchange and why it's important to look at that. So my name is Gutdaijk. I'm an assistant professor at Princeton and this work has been done with several students and postdoc in my group, which are listed here. Group which are listed here, as well as collaborators at the NOAA National Lab, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, as well as St√©phane Popini and Tomasion in Paris. So to give a picture of what we are studying, this is a picture and then a movie of the ocean surface under a very strong wind. So this is a storm with Winds. So, this is a storm with the wind speed at 10 meters, that is up to 25 meters per second. So, it's not yet a tropical cyclone condition, but it's getting close. And what you see on these pictures, I'm really is like these white patches of foam, of bubbles that have been entrained by breaking waves. And this is really sort of what I've been interested in in the last few years, and what we have been trying to understand and ultimately model to include the physics associated. To include the physics associated with breaking waves in large-scale models. So, some motivations to look at these problems. They are sort of, it goes two ways, right? You have exchange that are going to go from the atmosphere to the ocean. So from air to water with these bubbles being entrained, and that enhanced gas transfer, and that's going to impact the climate system through cycles of gases. So, carbon uptake is. Gases. So, carbon uptake is affected by the presence of these bubbles. Oxygen exchange is largely controlled by these bubbles. And so, for that, you need to understand the physics of breaking waves and how much air is being entrained and what's the size of the bubbles. And so, an example of this in my own work has been to understand the partition of the bubble-mediated gas transfer. So, on the left, you have a plot of the ratio of how much the transfer is controlled by bubble. Of how much the transfer is controlled by bubble versus the unbroken surface. And what you can see is that above 15 meters per second, the bubble contribution starts to be large. And we implemented a model formulation into a global model to sort of estimate or assess this role of the bubble gas transfer globally. And so what you get is that if you look at regions of the world with high wind speed, then the bubble contribution becomes significant. becomes significant the other reason to look at this problem this problem is is transferred towards the atmosphere and the production of sea spray and aerosols so the the droplets that are being ejected by the breaking waves or the bursting bubbles are going to transfer momentum heat and moisture and they are going to leave as aerosols either sea salt or biotic particles that can be transported in the upper atmosphere That can be transported in the upper atmosphere and impact climate because they are going to modulate the radiative balance in a direct effect. And maybe even more importantly, they are going to enter the cloud life cycle. So they are going to serve as cloud condensation nuclei. And anything you can understand on clouds is sort of a good step forward from a system modeling point of view. So the challenges that are around this sea spray production. Around this sea spray productions are sort of twofold. From a practical point of view, right, you need to understand how much of these aerosols are being emitted. And so this is usually represented in terms of what is called the production factor and the size distribution of the droplet or aerosol being produced. And here you have two review papers: one from 2011 that reports particles from below the micron up to Below the micron, up to 10 microns, and then a more recent review where they also have large particles. And so, without going into too much detail, if you look at this plot, you see large variations between the different data and different parametrization. So, you have a large uncertainty in how much particles are being emitted by the ocean at a given instant, and that for various wind speeds. The other large source. The other large source of uncertainty that you have, that's been very recently discussed a lot, is if you start thinking about the role of temperature on emission of sea spray. And so you have that on the plot on the right, where you have a normalized concentration or flux. So let's say normalized emission of aerosols above the ocean. And you see that some of the curves on the plot go up when temperature increase and some of the data go down. So there is just like an order one or even order zero. Order one or even order zero uncertainty on what temperature is doing to sea spray emission. And all of that, in my mind, tells us that we need an improved physical understanding on the production processes. And that's been sort of a large focus of my group in the last few years. And I'll give you sort of like three snippets of this work in the remaining 20 minutes or so. What we have been doing is developing We have been doing is developing what I call a multi-scale approach for ocean atmosphere and then apply it to the sea spray production problem. And so we think about this problem. It's a problem that involves a wide range of scales. So you start from bubbles that can be as small as tens of microns, and you're going to need to go to like scales of ocean. So of course, you can't do everything at once. And so what we're going to do. And so, what we're going to do is we're going to look at it from three sets of scales. My large scales are going to be typically a meter to a few kilometers, so a small patch of the ocean, and understand what's the sea state for a given wind condition, and then what's the breaking distribution? How many breaking waves do you have, how big they are, and how much air they are going to entrain from a statistical point of view and collectively. And this is going to be the large-scale constraint. And then you have. And then you have the intermediate scale, which so the disguise scale constraint, which you're going to describe statistically, you're going to do it either from field data or modeling. You really can't look at that in the lab, at least. I haven't found a good way to look at this in the lab. The intermediate step where I'm going to say, like from millimeter to meter, we're going to look at the breaking wave physics. So how much air is being entertained, how much energy is being dissipated, how many bubbles and How many bubbles and what are their sizes? That's the sort of question. These range of scales, you can start looking at them either in large-scale facilities in the lab or with direct numerical simulation, and I'll show example of that. And finally, the third step of scales is the smallest one in the system, and it's going to be around the physics of bubbles. So, bubbles bursting at the surface and generating spray, or bubbles breaking in the water and Breaking in the water and sort of controlling the size distribution. So, I'm going to tell us three pieces of this and then connect them all together to propose a new formulation for sea spray production about the ocean. I'm going to start with the smallest scale, so the production of drops or aerosols by bursting bubbles. And so, this is an old fluid mechanics problem. And the literature has sort of described two ways to produce drops. Two ways to produce drops, film and jet drops. So, film drops are illustrated on the right. You see the bubble, which is about five or six millimeter and with a large cap that goes above the surface. And at some point, the film that separates the bubble from the air bursts and produces this very nice rim that shatters and eject drops. And so, this process is going to be mostly. The process is going to be mostly happening for bubbles above the millimeter, and it's going to create a wider, it's going to create film drops. The other type of process is the collapse of the cavity, which is illustrated on the left. And so once the film has broken, then you see the cavity at the bottom with capillary waves that propagate toward the center of the cavity, that focus in the center of the cavity, and then it ejects a drop, a jet that then. Ejects a drop, a jet that then breaks down into a set of drops. And jet drops is going to be effective for bubble size that are going to be typically from about 10 micron to one millimeter in water. I'm going to be discussing some of the physics of jet drops. There is extensive literature on film drops, and so at the end, when I'm going to sort of put pieces together, I'll use the results from the literature that's being cited here. But we have been. Cited here, but we have been working directly on the jet drop problem. So I'll show that. The tools to do that have been some lab work and then also some direct numerical simulation. We use the open source solver Basagis developed by Stefan Popiner. So we solved the two-phase Navier-Stokes equation with surface tension. The movie you see on the right is a single bubble that is the left, and then you see the cavity collapsing with the capillary waves propagating towards the center. Towards the center, and then the jet is going to form. There is no small-scale modeling, so it's really like the Fulnay-Stokes equation in two phases, and it's a sharp geometric of reconstruction. And one feature of this code is its adaptive mesh refinement. So we can really focus the grid where we have features of interest. So vorticity drops and bubbles. We have extensively validated this work. Here are some comparisons with graph. Are some comparisons with lab work done by Thomas Sion. And so the blue line is the results from the simulation. And then in the background, you have the lab work. And you show a very strong agreement for the cavity collapse and for the first drop. Okay, so once you have these simulations and then you have validated them, you can start looking at their dynamic and try to find theoretical scaling to describe the properties of the jet. Properties of the jet, and then ultimately the size of the drop for a given bubble size. And so this is the work that's been done by Yao Rai when she was working as a graduate student. And what we have discussed is this dynamic of cavity collapse and then jet ejection. And you can think of this as being processes going towards a singularity, which is the type. Singularity, which is the time where the jet forms, where the cavity reverses, and then going away from the singularity. So, T0 here is this singular moment where the jet forms. And so you have previous work that has shown that the dynamic is described by an inertial capillary similarity solution. So if you normalize a space by the time to the Space by the time to the power two-thirds, you can collapse all of the data together. And what Yao did was to find universal profiles by identifying the critical length scale so that we can do this for various sets of parameters. So we went into finding a critical height, a critical time to rescale these profiles. We used a budget that. A budget that was done by Gen Yankee during the curvature reversal. And the argument was that there was at the moment where the jet forms a balance between inertial surface tension and viscous forces. And that by applying this balance, you could find scalings for the jet velocity, the jet width, and the vertical gang scale of the jet. Without going too much into the detail, this paper really identifies these. Identifies these critical length scale and time scales, and how they scale with a variable that's called phi here, which is dependent on the Lapglass number, the Laplace number being sort of a Reynolds number in this problem, comparing the size of the bubble to the viscoca lengths, which depends on viscosity, density, and surface tension. And so we use these results to find this critical time scale and this critical gang scale. Critical time scale and this critical gank scale. We verified that the scaling rule from Ghana and Calvo were working fine, and then we applied them to our data. And so here you have a set of simulations for various Laplace number or Ones-Augen number. So you can think of this as fluids of various viscosity for the same bubble size or just varying bubble size. And the parameters are changing quite a bit, right? The Gaplas number goes from 1000 to 50,000. So it's about 10 microns. So it's about 10 microns in water up to a few millimeters in water. And you see that if you take all the data at different times, it initially looks like the dynamic is different. But then if you use these rescaling, these universal profiles, these universal length scale and time scale, you can rescale the shape of the jet quite well. And the only part that doesn't follow this dynamic is the size of the tip, which is the size of the jaw. Size of the job because this one doesn't follow this similarity solution, but follows directly the scaling proposed by Genyon Calvo as it's the typical size of the jet. And so this other piece with Alexi Bernie, we ran a sweep of simulations and counted the drops and measured the drops from these simulations. And it gives this master plot with the drop. And it gives this master plot with the drop size here in a non-dimensional way: the Laplace number for the drop size as a function of the Laplace number for the bubble size. And we have our data as well as RAP data from the group in Paris, RAP data from the group in Boston, and then the Terrex call skilling, which is the black line. And what you get is this very nice collapse of all the data that we could find in good agreement with the Skilling. In good agreement with the scaling proposed. So, what to do with all of that? I have skipped some details, but the main idea is that if I know the size of the bubbles and I know the properties of the fluid, viscosity, surface tension, and density, then I can predict how many drops are going to be formed and what's their size and what's their statistics. And so, if I have all of that, then what I need to construct What I need to construct a total production is the size distribution of bubbles. And so that's what I'm going to describe in the next five minutes or so is the bubble size distribution and the breaking waves. So that then I can take these results at the scale of individual bubble and integrate to predict what's the size distribution of drops above a breaking wave. And so I've described some of the physics at the scale of the bubbles, and now I'm going to go. Bubbles, and now I'm going to go looking at breaking waves and bubble breaking, bubble breakup by turbulence. So, the scales of breaking waves, the physics of breaking waves is going to be controlled by the speed of the wave and the wave height. And that's been identified by extensive lab work in the last 30 or 40 years from various groups. And so from that idea that the That idea that the breaking wave is described by how fast it's moving and how steep it is. We have developed numerical simulation, direct numerical simulation of breaking wave where we can compare the parameter, right? We can compare the wave scope. We go at high Reynolds number, so we reach regimes that are comparable to the lab. So on the left, you have the top view. You see the breaking wave and the production of drops. Breaking wave and the production of drops. And on the right, you have the bottom view where you see entrainment of bubbles. And this work was done by Wuther Mastard, who was a postdoc in my group and who is now a faculty in Oxford. What we get from this simulation and from the literature is the bubble size distribution under a breaking wave. And once it's properly rescaled using energetic arguments and geometric arguments to constrain the total volume. Arguments to constrain the total volume, you get a picture like this. So you have a size distribution that presents two power goals: one above what's called the inascale, that's about the millimeter for the conditions I'm going to be talking about, and one below this Instascale. You have seen the talk from Rouini a few days ago, so you at this point you probably know what the interscale is. It's the scale at which surface tension prevents Extension prevents breakup by turbulence. And so above this critical size, you get a steep power level with empirical evidence showing that it's falling in R minus 10 third. And below, most of the data show an R minus three half. The R minus 10 third had been discussed in the literature with arguments around a steady model for turbulent breakup and dimensional analysis. And what I'll be discussing more is the scaling below the interscale. Digging below the Interscale. So above the Interscale, it can be described as being a local process. So each breakup is sort of a mild breakup and happening over a time scale that's close to the editor and over time at the scale of the bubble. And so if you use these arguments and you do a steady-state population balance, you can recover the R minus 10 set. Minus 10 third. I won't talk too much about it. Rui has been doing a lot of work on that part of the problem and really putting a lot of emphasis on the limit of this approach. But this is sort of the starting point of this. What I was really interested in was to understand this R minus 3 half and the production of these small bubbles that really matter for gas exchange and C-spread production. So we performed GAB experiments where we released a large cavity. We released a large cavity and then tracked the bubbles in the system. And what we found is that to obtain this R minus or D minus three half, you needed to start with a cavity that was very large. And so if you start with a bubble that's close to the endoscale, then you're not really producing this wide range of bubbles with very small bubbles, you need to start with a very large cavity to generate this R minus 3 half. Generate this R minus three half. So we saw that experimentally, and then we developed a simulation to understand this. And the intuition for us was that we could think of this as a non-local process. And so the very small bubbles in the system are actually produced by the fragmentation of the largest one in the system. And so that's what we're calling non-local production here. The way we understood it was by thinking about the Was by thinking about the rapid breakup of an elongated filament. So you start with a large cavity, it strongly deforms, and it creates very thin filaments that you're seeing here. And then these thin filaments are much smaller than anything that the turbulence can do. And so they actually follow a category of breakup. And so by analyzing our simulation at high Weber number, we found that the time scale of the breakup was indeed The breakup was indeed controlled by the category time of the smallest children. So that's the work that was done by Aguinor. If you look at all the data, so every correct point is one breakup event. It's very scattered. However, if you look at the ensemble average, which are the black points, then you have a very clear picture that emerges. And the time to produce a small bubble is basically given by the Capillary time around this scale. Area time around this scale. So the turbulence is effectively frozen when it's producing these small bubbles. Okay, and this is in a paper that's currently in press in Physical Review Fluids. And it takes some ideas from an earlier paper we did that was published in PINAS, where we looked at the pinch-off of bubbles and we discussed the fact that also in that configuration, once the neck is forming and collapsing, the turbulence is effective. Forming and collapsing, the turbulence is effectively effectively frozen. Okay, so this is like sort of the summary of this process. You start with a large bubble, it deforms over a time scale that's sort of given by the turbulence time scale at the size of the cavity. At some point, it forms an elongated neck, and from there, it's a capillary splitting. And if you take these elements and you construct the population balance equation, then you get the sub-inza-scale scaling that the size distribution follows. That the size distribution follows the size of the bubble to the minus three/half. So, we have now a clear picture of the bubble size distribution under breaking waves with the inertial range in the sense with the R minus 10 third, and then the sub in the range where it's controlled by categories. Okay, so I have the two pieces, right? I have the bubble size distribution, and I have the production of the drops, and so from there I can construct. And so, from there, I can construct my theoretical C-spread production function. And I can do it for every process that I can describe. So, I've told you a few words about the physics of jet drops. You can do similar work on film drops, and so then you can construct sort of all of these curves. I'm running sort of short on time, so I'm going to quickly present the last piece, which is. Present the last piece, which is constraining air entrainment from wave-breaking statistics. And so, this can be done using field data. This was really pioneered by Ken Melville's group in using air framework developed by Owen Phillips. And so, the movie on the left, the picture at the center, shows a breaking wave with the white patch that. The white patch that corresponds at the bubble being entrained, and you can track its velocity. And so you can construct the braking distribution lambda of C, which counts how many braking waves you have traveling at a certain speed. You can collect data and then try to model it, which is what we're doing with Jiarong Wu using wireless approach. The goal is to be able to model from a statistical point of view. Model from a statistical point of view, if we know the wave spectrum, then we can know the breaking statistics. And so, if you take all of these elements and you do some math on it, then you can construct your C-spray generation function incorporating this breaking statistics. And so, without looking too much at the detail here, really the idea to use or to go. To use or to go away with is that you have the series scales I've been talking about. So, in red, you have the breaking statistics, in blue, you have the size distribution of bubbles and the breaking wave. And in green, you have the physics of bursting bubbles individually, right? And if you integrate all of this, you end up with your production function. If you followed my introduction, you can compare to the curves that I was showing at the beginning, and you can explain some of the variation in magnitude. Some of the variation in magnitude for the different sizes. And so, our formulation falls within what's been described, except it's sort of based on our physical understanding and not just on empirical fits. And so all of this can be then implemented in a global model. You have an example here of a snapshot of the production of sea salt using this formulation for a single day. For a single day, as an example, and on the right, the meridional profile, so with latitude in the y-axis, and the amount of sea salt being emitted on the x-axis in our work and compared to previous work, and you can start thinking about the differences in the formulation and its implication on sort of a global constraint for CISO prediction. I'm going to stop here. This is sort of a summary of the various stuff I've been talking about. There is more to be said on these topics, and there are various papers that my group has been publishing over the last few years. And I'm happy to take some questions. Thank Professor Elibe Deke. That's a very fascinating talk. Okay. And we have time for a few questions. And we have time for a few questions before we move into the next speaker. So, questions? We're missing Ruby from the from the from what I recollect from Ray's talk on Monday, he was not getting the same hinge spectrum. Like he was talking about some roll-off range of Eddies on bubble breakup. So, are you aware of race work on this? So, are you aware of Race work on this range of bubble breakup? Do you have any comments on that, Luke? No, I think that's what I tried to say quickly, right? He's been showing that the smaller eddy also contributes to the breakup of the bubbles. And so that sort of changed the time scale of breakup. And it's been showing that with knowledge of the local velocity field, you can sort of have a sort of have a better predictability of the of the breakup uh it's it's not it's um it it doesn't change anything about uh what i said on the capigary breakup and the the the size minus three halves killing that that's really not uh uh really discussed in in what he has been doing uh it sort of uh impact the way you you think about the the larger bubble breakup Verbal breakup. And so that part is sort of like you can think about it differently using his work. The size distribution you get under breaking wave is a transient size distribution. So all of the arguments that we do are more in steady state. So you always have room for improvement. I don't know if my answer is very clear, but I'm good. No, no, no, it's good, it's good. Uh, um, I know that uh it's kind of late for you, and I didn't want to kind of encroach our time into your dinner time. So, thanking again. Uh, hopefully, next time we're going to have see you in person, uh, wherever this conference is going to be. And it was a very exciting and very nice seeing you even virtually. So, this is the first time I'm looking at your work, but I did download that annual review of fluid mechanics paper. That was so exciting to. Mechanics paper that was so exciting to read. I said, you know, you should be giving a talk over here. So, thank you again. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot for the invitation. And I hope you have a great end of the week. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. So our next speaker is Dr. Samir Khana from BP. And Samir, you're giving
