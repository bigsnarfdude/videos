Is somehow a geometric property that's preserved. Okay. And so the way that Gromov proved this is he observed that, you know, even though the scalar curvature is this kind of C2 quantity that depends on derivatives of the metric, the property of having a lower scalar curvature bound can be understood solely in terms of C0 data of the metric. Okay, so if it can be understood only in terms of C0 data of the metric, Only in terms of C0 data of the metric, then it kind of makes sense that it would be preserved under C0 convergence. Okay, and so I think somewhat more recently there has been some interest in using Ricci flow to study these sorts of problems involving scalar curvature bounded below. So I guess this has already been discussed in this conference. But okay, so for example, in 2016, Richard Bamler came up with Richard Bambler came up with an alternative proof of this theorem of Gromov that used Ricci flow. Okay, so I'll say a little bit in a minute about how that works, but first let me just remind you what is the Ricci flow. So the Ricci flow is an evolution equation for Riemannian metrics on a manifold. It's this evolution equation, right? So dg dt is equal to minus two times the Ricci curvature at time t, and then you can prescribe some initial data. Prescribe some initial data. And for me, I put tildes on the Ricci flow because actually, most of the time, I work with a different closely related flow, which is called the Ricci to Turk flow. Okay, so here's the Ricci to Turk flow. What is the point of the Ricci to Turk flow? Well, the idea is that, you know, even if you want to show that you have a short-time smooth solution to the Ricci flow, even for smooth initial data, one thing that you have to contend with is that actually the Ricci flow. To contend with is that actually the Ricci flow equation is not strongly parabolic. You know, you might hope that it would be strongly parabolic because then you could expect a short-time smooth solution from the parabolic theory, but it's not. And so one way to get around this, this is an idea of Duterk, is to first try to solve a closely related equation that is strongly parabolic. And the hope is that if you can solve or come up with a short-time smooth solution to this closely related parabolic, To this closely related parabolic equation, a strongly parabolic equation, then maybe you could pull it back by a family of diffeomorphisms to get a solution to the Ricci flow. Okay, and so the Ricci de Turk flow is that closely related, strongly parabolic equation. Okay, so yes, so this is the Ricci de Turk equation. dt dt is minus two times the ricci curvature again and then there's this extra lead derivative term and you can prescribe some initial data and Some initial data. I mean, of course, the way I've written this down right now, it doesn't look like the Ricci to Turk flow would be any easier to solve than the Ricci flow. But the point is that this extra term is very specific. So this vector field is a time-dependent vector field that's chosen very specifically depending on the solution GT. So it's chosen very carefully to force this equation to be strongly parabolic. Okay. And so since this equation is strongly parabolic, you know, you Strongly parabolic, and you maybe have more hope of finding a short-time solution. And also, it generally tends to be a little better behaved analytically than the Ricci flow. But it's fairly straightforward to check that if you know you have a solution to the Ricci to Turke flow, then you can pull it back by the family of diffeomorphisms generated by this vector field X, and you'll automatically get a solution to the Ricci flow. Okay, so anyway, for me, I tend to work with Ricci. For me, I tend to work with Ricci Deterc flow because it is maybe a little bit easier to work with than Ricci Flow for certain analytic applications. But if you're not a geometric flows person, you can just kind of pretend that Ricci and Ricci to Tertflow are the same for the purposes of this talk. But anyway, I will keep talking about Ricci to Tertflow, and this is the one I'm using. Okay. And so why did I bring up these flows? Well, it's because we were talking about problems involving scalar curvature bounded below. And so these flows are relevant. And so these flows are relevant to problems involving scalar curvature bounded below because uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under these flows. So what I mean is that if your initial data satisfies some uniform lower bound on the scalar curvature, okay, so here kappa naught is a constant, not a function, then as long as the flow is defined, so for all positive times for which either of these flows are defined, These flows are defined, any time slice of the flow will satisfy the same uniform lower scalar curvature bound. Okay, so in other words, the Ricci and Ricci de Turk flows kind of preserve the geometric property that I'm interested in. But then also, by virtue of the fact that the Ricci de Turk flow is strongly parabolic, you might expect that it would improve the problem by smoothing things out of it. Okay, and so that's the idea. What I want to do now is just show you kind of a concrete result that makes more precise this idea that I've been saying that the Reed to Turk flow smooths out non-smooth initial data. Okay, and so this is a result of Cochin Lam, which basically says that if you have a C0 metric that is sufficiently close to Euclidean space, then you can find a solution to the Ricci-Duturk flow that will be smooth for positive times and it will converge uniformly. And it will converge uniformly, like the time slices will converge actually locally uniformly to the C0 initial data. Okay, so I'll read this lemma and then I'll talk about it a little bit more. So the lemma says that there exists some threshold var epsilon less than one and some constant C greater than zero, such that the following is true. So if you have some C0 Riemannian metric G0 on our metric G0 on Rn, that is bar epsilon close to the Euclidean metric in C0. Okay, so you start out with some C0 Riemannian metric that's epsilon close to the Euclidean metric. Then there exists a smooth Ricci de Turk flow that's defined for all positive times with the property that as t goes to zero, the time slices of the Ricci de Turk flow converge locally uniformly to the initial data. To the initial data. Okay. Also, you started out close to the Euclidean metric in C0, and for all positive times, you will remain close to the Euclidean metric in the sense of this X norm, X just meaning like this norm here. Okay, so you'll stay close in L infinity, but actually also you'll get some better control. So you'll get some this kind of local L2 control on the gradient, and then there's another kind of L. And then there's another kind of LP norm of the gradient that I left off here. Okay, and then on top of that, you will also get some derivative estimates. And of course, this blows up as t goes to zero because the initial data is not smooth. Okay. So just to summarize what this is saying is that if you have a small C0 perturbation of Euclidean space, then you can find a smooth solution to the Ricci Deterk flow that starts from that C0. Starts from that C0 perturbation. By the way, I should just mention: so, this is true for perturbations of Euclidean space, but there are versions of this result, for example, due to Miles Simon on perturbations of metrics on manifolds. Okay, so for our purposes today, the result on perturbations of Euclidean space is sufficient, but there are also versions of this on manifolds. Okay. All right. All right. And so, what I wanted to do now was show kind of a toy argument you can do with this lemma in order to get some results about spaces with scalar curvature bounded below. Okay, so what I wanted to do was just prove kind of a baby version of this theorem of Gromov. And this is kind of like a baby version of Bamler's proof. And so what we'll do is just prove a version of this theorem. Prove a version of this theorem of Gromov, where we assume all these Riemannian metrics are just epsilon perturbations of Euclidean space, and we'll assume this lower bound is a constant. Okay. And so we can argue as follows. So we have this sequence of Riemannian metrics. They converge uniformly to some limiting metric. And then we know the scalar curvature of each metric in the sequence is bounded below. And for the purpose. Is bounded below, and for the purposes of this argument, we're assuming it's bounded below by a constant, and then we want to show that the scalar curvature of the limit is also bounded below by that constant. Okay, and so here is what we could do. What we could do is we could run the flow starting from each metric in this sequence, right? And we could also run the flow starting from the limiting metric, okay. Okay. And so then, because of the sort of smoothing effect of the Ricci to Turk flow, it will turn this uniform convergence of the initial data into locally smooth convergence of the time slices for positive times. Okay, so we get improved convergence for positive times. This is for positive times. Okay, and so then we could argue as follows. So we know each metric in our sequence. Know each metric in our sequence satisfies this lower scalar curvature bound. Okay, and then also we know that uniform lower scalar curvature bounds are preserved under Ricci to Turk flow or Ricci flow. Okay, so that means for all positive times, each time slice, the GIT will also satisfy this lower scalar curvature bound. Okay, but then at positive times, we have smooth convergence. So that will tell us that this limiting flow. Tell us that this limiting flow for positive times will have the same lower scalar curvature bound. Okay. And actually, if your initial data is C2, then you can let T go to zero and conclude that this limiting metric, the initial data of the limiting flow, will also satisfy this lower scalar curvature bound. Okay. And so the point was that here we wanted to study this problem involving scalar curvature bounded below, but we had this sort of non-smooth convergence. This sort of non-smooth convergence. And then, when we ran the Ricci to Turk flow, we improved things by getting smooth convergence. Okay. So that is kind of the context for what I wanted to tell you about today. And by the way, this picture also suggests, in my opinion, a kind of natural synthetic notion of lower scalar curvature bounds for metrics that are just C0. Namely, we could say that a C0 metric has not negative scalar curvature or a scalar curvature bound of. Curvature or scalar curvature bounded below by whatever constant in the sense of Ricci flow, if we can find a Ricci detergent flow starting from that C0 metric, such that for positive times, the time slices of the flow have non-negative scalar curvature or have scalar curvature bounded below by whatever constant you like. Okay, and so in this way, we can use Ricci de Turk flow to make sense of non-negative scalar curvature for metrics that are only C0. Okay. Only C0. Okay. And one thing I just wanted to mention this very briefly is that I showed a few years ago now that this definition can be localized. So actually, you can also use Reachy to Turkflow to make sense of what it means for a C0 metric to have non-negative scalar curvature at a point or on an open set. I don't want to say too much about this because I think it's not going to be instructive, but it is kind of lurking in the background of what I'll talk about today. Talk about today. Okay. And so, oh, sorry. I also, okay. I just quickly, since we don't have a lot of time, I wanted to mention some names of people who have been studying Ricci flows coming out of spaces that have various kind of distributional notions of scalar curvature. But maybe we don't have time to say too much about that. All right. So, all of this context where you kind of use the Riti-Deturk flow to smooth out the C0 metrics and then use this to make sense of lower scalar curvature bounds. Make sense of lower scalar curvature bounds. This leads us or leads me to ask whether, you know, can you only play this game for lower scalar curvature bounds, or are there other quantities that we kind of usually associate with lower scalar curvature bounds where we can also play this game? So in particular, are there other quantities that are associated with lower scalar curvature bounds that can be understood solely in terms of C0 data of the metric? And if so, how do these quantities behave? If so, how do these quantities behave under evolution of the metric by RET or BT to Turk flow? Okay, and so of course, one such quantity is the ADM mass. I guess I probably don't need to remind this audience what it is, but I will anyway. So if you have a Riemannian match, sorry, this is a typo. This should say a Riemannian manifold that is diffeomorphic to Rn minus the ball. Okay. The ball. Okay, so phi here is this coordinate chart. And then the ADM mass is defined to be this limit as r goes to infinity of this sort of surface integral over coordinate spheres of radius r. Okay, and so here these coordinates come from this coordinate chart phi in my notation. And then this is the outward unit normal, and this is the surface measure. Okay, so, okay, yes, so this is the AGM map. Okay, yes, so this is the ADM mass. Of course, you know, just because you can compute this surface integral at some radius r, you know, it doesn't automatically follow that this limit is actually well defined. But we know, thanks to the work of Bartnik and Krushchiel, that under certain conditions, this limit is indeed well defined, and also it's independent of choice of coordinate chart. Okay, and so in particular, if the metric in coordinates decays sufficiently. Coordinates decays sufficiently fast to the Euclidean metric. So it decays to the Euclidean metric, like x to the minus tau, where tau is larger than n minus 2 over 2. And if the first and second derivatives, or I guess this can be weakened, but if these derivatives decay sufficiently quickly to zero, and if, in addition, the scalar curvature metric is in L1, then this limit is indeed well-defined, finite, and it's independent. Finite and it's independent of choice of coordinate chart satisfying these two properties. Okay. And so, of course, the reason I brought up the ADM mass and I said it was a quantity associated with a scalar curvature is because of the Riemannian positive mass theorem. Okay, so there have been many proofs of this, and the earliest due to Shane and Yao and Witten. And this says that if you have a smooth Riemannian manifold asymptotically flat, so you have a coordinate chart. So you have a coordinate chart in which you have the decay from this previous theorem of Bartnick and Crushiel. And if the scalar curvature is in L1, then if the scalar curvature is non-negative, the ADM mass is non-negative as well, with equality if and only if the metric is flat. Okay. And so remember, I was talking about the kind of C0 perspective and problems with scalar curvature bounded below involving C0 metrics. Involving C0 metrics. And so it's natural to ask from that context whether you can prove some version of this theorem that is only C0. Okay. And so now I'm just going to highlight all of the parts of this theorem that are not C0, right? So this condition, this decay condition to Euclidean space in coordinates, this still makes sense for C0 metrics. But then this decay on the derivatives doesn't make sense if the metric is only C0. And similarly, Is only C0. And similarly, it's not clear how to make sense, at least to me, of the scalar curvature being in L1 if the metric is only C0. Okay. Now, this condition that the scalar curvature be non-negative, this could be replaced with some weak condition. Like, for instance, for me, we could try to replace this condition with the condition that the scalar curvature be non-negative in the sense of Ricci flow, right? And so then what becomes clear is that if you wanted to prove Is that if you wanted to prove a C0 version of this theorem, you would need some way of making sense of the ADM mass for C0 metrics. Okay. And so if you're someone who studies positive mass theorems, then you know that at least in dimension three, there is a very natural way of doing this because Huskin has introduced this nice notion of the isoparametric mass. Okay. But actually, what I'll talk about today is a kind of different way of making sense of the ADM mass for C0 metrics. DM mass for C0 metrics that I think is also natural. And so, okay, I don't want anyone to feel misled. I'm not asserting that I can prove a C0 version of the positive mass theorem. I'm just saying that if you wanted to prove something like that, you would need to be able to make sense of the ADM mass being non-negative. And so today I'll tell you one way of making sense of the ADM mass for C0 metrics. Okay. And so here is the idea. Here is the idea. I think it's natural. So, the idea is: here, you know, we just integrated over a single coordinate sphere, and then we let the radius go to infinity. But you could just as well integrate over a family of coordinate spheres, you know, maybe weighted by some test function. So, in other words, you could replace this integral over a single coordinate sphere with the average value of the integral over a family of spheres. Okay, so that's Family of spheres. Okay, so that's what I did here. All right, and then of course, you could make some kind of change of variables. And the point is that if you're in a situation where you already know the ADM mass exists, so you already know this limit exists, well, then when you compute this kind of averaged quantity, this will also converge to the ADM mass. Okay, so if you're in a situation where you already know the ADM mass exists, then you could also compute it by averaging these. By averaging these surface integrals. Okay, but now here I have this kind of, I'm integrating over a family of radii, and then for each radius, I have this kind of surface integral, but I could just as easily integrate over an annulus here, right? And so then what that would look like is some integral over an annulus of a test function multiplied onto some expression involving derivatives of a metric. Involving derivatives of the metric. And so then, if my metric is only C0 and I don't want the derivatives on the metric, what I should do is just integrate by parts and put the derivatives onto the test function. Okay. And so here's what you get if you carry that out, right? And so this looks a little bit complicated, but the point is that now the derivative is on the test function and it's not on any terms involving the metric. Okay. And then Metric. Okay. And then since I did an integration by parts, I'm going to pick up some boundary terms. If your test function has compact support, you don't have boundary terms. But unfortunately, I do have to sometimes consider test functions without compact support. So you'll pick up some boundary terms, but I'm not going to write them because for us, they will always be small. Okay. And so we just said that if you already know you're in a situation where the ADM mass exists, so where you Mass exists, so where you know that this limit exists, then this quantity, I guess for lack of a better term, I'll call this the C0 local mass. This C0 local mass will converge to the ADM mass, right, just because of this argument I showed you. Okay, but if we're talking about general C0 metrics, right, the Bartnick and Crucible proof that the ADM mass is well defined depends a lot on the decay of the derivatives of the metric. K of the derivatives of the metric. So if you just want to talk about the ADMS for some C0 metric, it's not actually clear that as you let R go to infinity, this kind of expression will converge to any kind of limit. Okay, and then even if it does, it's not clear whether it would depend on the choice of coordinate chart. And then also you introduce this test function. So then you also have to ask, well, is it going to depend on this test function that you introduced? Okay. That you introduced. Okay, so here are the three questions that I just said. So, first of all, if you only have C0 data for your metric, does this expression converge to a limit? And moreover, does it depend on the choice of test function and the choice of coordinate chart? Okay. And so it turns out the answer is yes, this will always converge to a limit and no, it won't depend on the choice of test function or coordinate chart. But in order to get those answers that we want, In order to get those answers that we want, we have to kind of change the coordinate, or sorry, what am I saying? We have to change the test function a little bit with the scale R. So I'll explain, I guess, closer to the end of the talk, I'll explain why you need to do that. Okay. And so this is the theorem that I was just telling you about that tells you that indeed for C0 initial data, that C0 local mass will converge to a well-defined limit. Okay. To a well-defined limit. Okay, so let me read it to you. So, suppose you have a smooth manifold. By the way, the manifolds always have to be smooth because we need some kind of smooth structure to make sense of positive time slices of the Ricci-Duterte flow being smooth. Okay, but so anyway, we have a smooth manifold and then a C0 metric on that manifold. And let's suppose we have a coordinate chart such that in that coordinate chart, we have this kind of classical C0 decay. See zero decay of the metric to Euclidean space, but we don't assume any decay on the derivatives. Okay, and suppose you have some smooth cutoff function with support compactly contained in the interval from 0.9 to 1.1. Well, then for this given test function, you can find some smooth family of functions that depends on the scale R with the following properties. So, first of all, if your metric is So, first of all, if your metric is C2 and you know that the ADM mass exists, then this limit of the C0 local mass, where you now use this R-dependent test function, this C0 local mass will converge to some limit, and that limit will be equal to the ADM mass. Okay, so it agrees with the usual ADM mass when that exists. But also, if you just have a C0 metric that has non-negative scalar curvature, Non-negative scalar curvature in the sense of Ricci flow on manifold minus compact set, then this limit as r goes to infinity of the C0 local mass at scale r also exists. Okay, so in other words, when the scalar curvature is non-negative, this C0 local mass does indeed converge to a well-defined limit, just for C0 initial data, or sorry, just for C0 metrics. And this limit is either finite or positive. This limit is either finite or positive infinite, and it's independent of choice of a phi that is sort of C0 asymptotically flat. So it's independent of choice of coordinate chart satisfying this decay condition. And it's also independent of choice of test function. Maybe let me unpack this a bit. So here's what I mean when I say this limit is independent of choice of the test function. What I mean is that if you started with two compactly supported smooth functions, this theorem would tell you that. This theorem would tell you there are two corresponding kinds of families of test functions that depend on R. And if you compute this limit using one of those families versus the other, you'll get the same limit. Okay, but somehow, so yeah, so it matters that you change the test function with the scale R, but it somehow doesn't matter what test function you used to initialize these families. Okay, and so obviously what I'm saying is. So, obviously, what I'm saying is that this limit of the C0 local mass is a reasonable C0 analog of the ADM mass because it agrees with the ADM mass when that exists. But also, this limit exists for any C0 metric that is C0 asymptotically flat and has non-negative scalar curvature in the sense of Ricci flow. And this is the sort of condition you would have in any kind of C0 version of the Riemannian positive mass theorem. Okay. Math zero. Okay. One thing you might notice is that here this limit could be infinite. The reason this limit could be infinite is that in the usual Riemannian positive mass theorem, you assume the scalar curvature is in L1. I don't know how to make sense of that for C0 metrics. And so I'm replacing that condition with the condition that the scalar curvature be not negative. And so then this causes their Then, this causes there should be the possibility that this limit will be infinite. Okay, and so why is this theorem true? Well, basically, the reason that this theorem is true follows from some kind of monotonicity result that says that if you compare the C0 local mass at a small radius to the C0 local mass at a larger radius, the mass at the larger radius will always be greater than or equal to the mass at the smaller radius. At the smaller radius, up to some kind of error. Okay, and so then as you let r go to infinity, you know, this quantity should get larger and larger. And so either it will converge to some finite limit or it will go to infinity. But, you know, in either case, it will converge to something. Okay. And so, okay, so let me maybe just state for you that type of monotonicity result. Okay, and so it says the following. Suppose you have a smooth manifold. Suppose you have a smooth manifold and a C0 metric on the manifold, so the same setup. And let's suppose now you have two C0 asymptotically flat coordinate charts. Okay, well, then there exists some scale bar R such that if your metric has non-negative scalar curvature in the sense of Ricci flow, you know, away from a compact set, and you have two smooth non-zero cutoff functions as before, then if you compare this. Then, if you compare the C0 local mass at scale 200R, the C0 local mass at scale R, the C0 local mass at scale 200R will always be greater than or equal to the C0 local mass at scale R up to some small error. And the point is that as R goes to infinity, this error will go to zero. Okay. And moreover, when you do this kind of comparison, it actually doesn't matter. Comparison, it actually doesn't matter if you switch out the C0 asymptotically flat coordinate charts, and it also doesn't matter if you switch out these test functions. Okay. Yes, and so as I explained before, once you have this sort of monotonicity result, then it follows pretty quickly that you're going to converge to some kind of limit. All right, let me make sure I'm saying everything. Sure, I'm saying everything that I wanted to. Okay. So what I want to do now, I think it will be instructive, is to explain a little bit how to prove this theorem. And then I think in the course of explaining how you would prove this theorem, it will become apparent why we need to change these test functions as the scale varies. Okay. And so. Okay, and so here is the idea. So let's just forget about the C0 setting for a minute. And so we'll go back to Bartnick's observation when he was proving the whale, the well-definedness of the ADM mass. And so he observed that if you have some smooth metric, and okay, for the purposes of this argument, let's just assume it's close to Euclidean space. Okay, so if you're in that setting, then you can compute. Then you can compute this expression. Okay, so this is just the surface integral that appears in the usual definition of the ADM mass. And so if you let r go to infinity up to a constant, this would go to the ADM mass. Okay. And so if you compute this surface integral at scale 10r and you compare it to this surface integral at scale r, well, just by the divergence theorem, this difference. Theorem, this difference is going to be bounded below by the integral of the scalar curvature over the annulus from r to 10r, right? And then, you know, you have some correction terms that depend on some derivatives of the metric, okay? And so if you were in the classical setting where you had not just decay of the metric to Euclidean space in C0, but you also had decay of the derivative. Also, had decay of the derivatives of the metric. Well, then these error terms would be bounded by some power of r that looks like this. And so, because of the decay rate tau, this would go to zero as r goes to infinity. So that's good. And so then in addition, if you were in a setting where you knew your scalar curvature were non-negative, well, then you would have a lower bound that looks like zero minus something that goes to zero. And so this would be exactly. To zero. And so this would be exactly the kind of result that we want if we want to prove some kind of monotonicity result. Except, you know, here, instead of using this like C0 averaged quantity, I'm just using the usual quantity from the definition of ADM mass. Okay, so this is the argument of Bartnick. All right. Now, if we're working in the C0 setting, none of this makes any sense, right? We don't have the divergence theorem and we Theorem, and we don't have any kind of control on the derivatives. And so, okay, let me come back to that in a minute. So, what I would like to do instead is instead of doing this argument of Bartnick just with the C0 data where none of this makes sense, what I would like to do is run my C0 metric by the Ricci or Ricci to Turk flow, right? And this will smooth things out. And then I could at least hope to do this kind of argument of Bartnik for positive time slices of the flow. For positive time slices of the flow. Okay, so at least I could get some kind of monotonicity result involving the local masses for positive time slices of the flow. Okay, let's ignore what I wrote down here for a minute and we'll come back to this. Okay, and so if we do this at positive time slices of the flow, now all of this is happening at time t, at time t. Okay, and so here, here, okay, so we will still We will still get some control on the derivatives. So, the initial data, which was the C0 metric, doesn't have any control on the derivatives. But then we know once we run the Ricci to Turk flow, because it's a parabolic equation, we do get some control on the derivatives, and we'll get some control that looks like r to the minus 2 tau over t. And so, what you see here is that in order to kind of get nice estimates, I need to run t for long enough that these terms. Long enough that these terms become controlled. Okay. And actually, it also turns out I don't want to run T for too long because then I will have to think about boundary terms, but we'll come back to that. And then also the hope would be, well, if my C0 metric has non-negative scalar curvature in the sense of Ricci flow, then for positive times, the time slices of the flow should also have non-negative scalar curvature. So this term will be bounded below by zero. So that's fine. And then if I run the flow. And then, if I run the flow for long enough, these t factors will get large. And so, hopefully, these terms should be controlled. Okay. And there's a little bit of subtlety here. That's what these bullet points are talking about, where actually, you know, if you want to do this for a metric on a manifold, then first you have to like glue it into Euclidean space in coordinates and flow in Euclidean space, and this introduces some errors. So actually, the scalar curvature won't be truly non-negative, it will be like almost non-negative. Negative, it will be like almost non-negative. But that's not so important for the purposes of this discussion. Okay, so anyway, here was the idea. We wanted to prove some kind of monotonicity result. And so what we did is instead of proving it directly for the C0 metric, we evolved the C0 metric by a flow. And then we proved the monotonicity result in kind of the classical way for positive time slices of the flow. Okay, and so now we have this monotonicity result. This monotonicity result comparing local masses of positive time slices of the flow, but that's actually not what you want. What you wanted was a monotonicity result about the C0 initial data. Okay, and so then in order to turn your result about the positive time slices into a result about the C0 initial data, you need some kind of lemma that says, well, actually, this C0 local mass is not going to distort too much under the flow. And so, you know, results. Much under the flow. And so, you know, results about this local masses at positive time slices can be translated into results about the C0 initial data. Okay, and so let's ignore that. And so here is the lemma that says this is true. I think in the interest of time, maybe I won't read it. But basically what this is saying is that the C0 local mass at scale R will have bounded distortion up to time almost R. Up to time almost r squared, you have to stop a little bit short, but almost r squared, provided that when you compute this c0 local mass at time t, you are also evolving the test function in time. Okay. And so how do you evolve the test function in time? Well, you can think of it this way. The metric satisfies basically kind of some kind of forward heat equation. And so then to make this distortion be bounded. Distortion be bounded, you should take this test function to correspondingly evolve by some kind of backwards heat equation. And so, this is the backwards evolution that you need to evolve this test function by to make this distortion over time be bounded by something. Okay, and so the point is that because of this decay rate tau, this term on the right will go to zero as r goes to infinity. And so, in particular, earlier when I was talking about how Earlier, when I was talking about how you need to change the test function that you use with the scale R. And what I mean is that, okay, so since you're talking about the C0 metric, that's going to correspond to the time zero slice of the flow. And so you need to compute this mass using the time zero slice of this evolving family of test functions. Okay, and the time zero slice depends on R in the sense. On R, in the sense that, because this is a backwards evolution, I need to prescribe final data rather than initial data. And the final time is going to depend on R. Okay, so sorry, I know I went a little bit fast, but I think maybe I should stop there so we have time for questions. But anyway, I just wanted to maybe briefly summarize. So the idea is that we wanted to prove this result about this kind of averaged C0 mass for a C0 metric. And so what we first had to do was So, what we first had to do was evolve the metric by a flow so we could do the classical argument. And then, to translate any statements about time slices of the flow back down to time zero, we had to prove this kind of distortion estimate. And this was only possible if we also allow this test function to evolve suitably. Okay, that's all I had.
