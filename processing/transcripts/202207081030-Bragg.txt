Thanks, Martin. I wanted to start by thanking the organizers for organizing this conference. I also want to thank Peter for letting me use this chart. So, what I'm going to talk about today is joint work with Max Lieblick. What I wanted to Um what I wanted to uh so I mean this phrasing Murphy's law um was inspired by uh a paper of uh Rodney McKeel who more or less quote kind of the slogan from Robbie's paper, which is something like this: if you have some moduli space, You have some moduli space that comes up naturally in algebraic geometry. So like algebra geometric origin, then unless you have some really good reason To expect otherwise, you should probably expect M to have very complicated behavior, and specifically, you should expect it to probably be singular and singular in sort of as bad a way as it could be. Could be I think I think Rakil attributes this sort of philosophy to Munker. I think it was first articulated in the book of Harrison. I mean, written down in the Book of Harrison, Walt Morrison Curves. Thanks, Grandpa. So specifically, what he did in this paper is formulated some precise property that means how That means having arbitrarily bad singularities, and then prove that a whole list of very specific moduli spaces do indeed have that property. So I guess that sort of like gives a specific, precise sense in which this philosophy is exhibited by some moduli spaces, which I think the messages, they're supposed to seem like pretty natural things. So, like, for example, I think he proves it with the moduli. For example, I think he proves it for the modules space of smooth curves in some fixed projector space and surfaces with ample canonical bundle. So what I want to talk about today is something sort of, I think, an analogous philosophy, and it's also about sort of moduli spaces that occur in algebraic geometry, but it concerns a different way in which they can be complicated. So a different sort of behavior that they can exhibit, and the philosophies. That they can exhibit, and the philosophy is going to be kind of similar. So, this is the Stacky, what I mean by the Stacky-Murphy's law. So again, I'm going to let M, that's going to be a calligraphic M. So, this is going to be a modulite stack. Again, imagining this is some stack that occurred naturally. Imagine this is some stack that occurred naturally as parameterizing some sort of objects with algebra geometric origin. Then, again, unless you have some really good reason to think otherwise, some good a priori reason, unless the same thing, you might expect. And to have arbitrarily bad stacky behavior. Let me say this. This is, let me say another, a sort of behavior that I think of as being. A sort of behavior that I think of as being roughly equivalent to this. Instead of stacky behavior, I might say, let's say n is a coarse moduli space, then m should fail to be fine. In arbitrarily bad ways. Again, absence of a good reason to think otherwise, this might be kind of a default expectation, is my playing my writing up. Okay. So for instance, a good a priori reason would be maybe you knew that the objects you were parametrizing had no automorphism. You're parametrizing have no automorphisms, then you probably expect M to already be fine, so it wouldn't exhibit this. Or maybe you have some bound on the size of the automorphisms, and that would bound the stacking behavior. Okay, so what I want to do today is find, it's explained to you a way of formulating either these things, making some precise property of a stack or a corresponding space, and then Modulize space, and then explain to you my work with Max, which is to try to prove that that property holds for some specific example. So formulate this and prove it holds for some examples. So the examples we But the examples we've proved before, we did it for stack of curves. We did abelian varieties, principally polarized abelian varieties, and a few others. So I want to start by sort of thinking about an example that I think illustrates sort of complicated behavior that I'm trying to think about. So let's say. About. So let's say I'm going to work over Q for this talk, and that's mostly just for convenience and maybe exposition. And let me say that M is a Deline-Mumford stack over Q. And let me say that M has a course space element. So, the example to keep in mind would be M is the modulized stack of curves. I guess I want to mark the right number of points in genus 0 and 1, just to be careful. And then the regular font M is the course module XB. So, what's the difference between these two? I'm thinking about a case like this where they're not isomorphic. Well, this map has some properties. One property is that if you test this map on an algebraically closed field, then this map should be an isomorphism. Or more specifically, More specifically, uh it maps quite isomorphism classes of k-bar points of this thing to uh k-bar points of the course space. This is, I guess, one of the defining features in the sort of the abstract fact theoretic definition of a course moduline space. And it it holds in sort of the motivating examples that predate that definition. Oh, that's uh spy junction. It's a bijection. So you can't see the difference between these two by plugging in algebraically closed fields. But you can if you plug in non-algebraically closed fields. So if you take just a general field, you're still going to map like this, but this map might not be injective and it also might not be strip vector. So here's like an example that might be familiar. I'm going to think about just moduli space of elliptic curves. So here we have M11. The coarse moduli space of this thing, you can The corresponding space of this thing, you can think about concretely using the J invariant. So there's a function here, just A1, remember Q, that sends an elliptic curve to its J invariant. So this is the corresponding space of L11. So now if you look at this map on cue points, this thing right here, this is isomorphism. Isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over Q. It's matched to this thing, which is Q. I have a choice. Is this map injective or surjective? Well, it turns out that this map is surjective. This is a classical path, but if you fix it, You fix any actually in any field, fix any field, and you have a scalar, then there exists an elliptic curve on E over that field. Over that field. Defined over the same field with that J in variant. And so that exactly means that this map is search active. In fact, for any particular current. So this map happens to be surjective in this case, but it is not injective. And this correspo I mean, one way to see that is that you can do sort of a quadratic twists a little bit. Quadratic twists of an optic. So it's not, it's rejective and not injective. So, like, something does sort of, there is some complicated complication in this stack because of this non-inductivity, but Because of this non-inductivity, but it's not as bad as it could be because it's still surjective. And if you go up to genus 2, actually, then both sort of kinds of bad things can happen. It's neither injected nor surjective. And two, I think you can think of this concretely in various ways. One way to think of the core space is Yes, the genus 2 curve is canonically hyperelliptic, branched over P1 at six distinct points, unordered. So I could take sim6 at P1 and remove the big diagonal, and then I need to run out by PGL2. There's no chronic holds. So this is one way of writing down the course space for M2. Space for M2. But this map, it's easy to think. One way of thinking about M2, Roman M2. And then when you evaluate on, for instance, key points, but also pretty much any other points, which is not already composed, this is neither injective nor subposed. How do you see that it's not subjective? Yeah, that's not obvious at all. Yeah, actually, I think I'll tell you a specific way. Yeah, actually I think I'll tell you a specific way of seeing that. The first example I could find in the literature was due to Shimura. I don't remember the second reference. You can write down explicitly a curve that sort of exhibits the non-search activity, which is what Shimura did. But yeah, it's not a, it's a little bit complicated. It's a little bit complicated. Actually, I'll give you construction later in the talk that I think gives a pretty slick way of seeing it. Maybe I should take classically what this terminology that goes, that's sort of the problem that I'm describing. The classical problem here in determining the surjectivity of this map is the question of distinguishing the field of definition and the field of moduli of a curve. So we know that sort of the point of these two things, the points of the core space over an algebraically closed field do exactly correspond to curves. But if you're given some field that's not algebraically closed, so you could start over a non-closed field, go to closure, the estimate. Closure, if you have some value of the course space, then there is a curve over the closure, and you can ask if that curve is actually defined over that field that you started with. The field you started with would be the field of moduli, and you're asking if that is a field of closure. So starting in genus 2, there are curves that are not defined over their field of moduli. There's a ton of papers in the literature about finding curves that are not defined over the field moduli in different situations and with different properties in sort of explicit ways. Okay, so I want to kind of, this is the sort of behavior that I'm referring to when I'm thinking about like, when I said like complicated stacking behavior or the failure of the core space to be fine. It's this these maps like this failing to be injective or surjective. Maps like this failing to be injective or surjective. And it's related to these things about fielded definition and field of moduli. Okay, so now I'm going to try to like quantify a little bit, or put a little more structure on the failure of these things to be injective and surjective. So here's the I guess what I'm trying to say is I want to identify sort of a mechanism that causes these things to fail. That causes these things to fail to be inductive researcher. So here's my mechanism. We're given this morphism here, and it's not an isomorphism, so that means that we should be able to detect that on fibers. So what you can do is you can include the residue field of a point here. So take some point of M and take the inclusion of the residue field and look at the fiber. And actually, I want to take the reduction of the fiber. It might be non-reduced because this path might be ramified. And this, I'm going to give a name, I'm going to call G sub X. And so what, so these like G sub X's are sort of measuring the failure of this map to be an isomorphism. So what properties does G sub X have? Well, the G sub X. So, what properties does g sub x have? Well, g sub x is a delete lumbered stack, and its core space has one point. And then characteristic zero? Yeah, that's one reason. If you're in characteristic P and there's wild ramification, there's a little subtlety here. Here, but I don't think it causes any. I mean, it's a technical and slightly subtle point, but you can sort of make it work. But I'm kind of ignoring. So this stacks with this property, these two properties have a name. This is one way of characterizing a gerb. So a gerb, by which I mean there's a more general notion, so I mean a blame upper gerb over a field. A blame offered derb over a field is a stack of these two properties. So it's a blame offered stack of core space one point. Oh yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah, at least definitely use 'cause I took the reduction. Yeah, I also need to be reduced. So this is sort of, I think this is kind of like it's a stack that's very close to just being a point, and it differs from a point sort of only in a stacky manner. So, and the terms that arise in this way have a name. These are called the resistant. Um, have a name. These are called the residual germs of L. To be a little more precise, that this gerb is the residual gerb of m at the point x. At the point x. This is sort of like a scheme has every point as a residue field, for a stack every point has a residual jerk. And it also has a field attached to it, which is this field spec kx. And I guess I should say you can define all these things intrinsically without using the core space, which I think is an appealing perspective, but I'm not doing it for now. Okay, so the point here is that from this stack, we get a bunch of little gerbs over a A bunch of little gerbs over all these different sort of residue fields. And those are what I'm thinking of as measuring the stacking structure. I want to just say a few words about gerbs. So here's a few facts about them. So basic example of gerbs, of a gerb, or fundamental example, is the gerb BG, where g is, in this case, a tall, finite. In this case, a finite tall group scheme over K. So, like, for instance, a finite group. Eg, its value on a K-scheme S is the rootoid of S torsors, or G torsors over S. There's more gerbs. So, a gerb is split if it has a section. Is split if it has a section, and if it has a section, it actually is isomorphic to Bg. Where G is the automorphism of group of the cycle. Okay, and just one more two more words. Every germ is locally split. If this is a derp, then there's a finitely tall extension. Ascension such that when you pull back this thing, it's split. So gerbs are sort of twisted forms of DG. Those are the fundamental examples, and then all other gerbs are twisted forms of those. And germs are sort of colonological objects, but in a certain sense. So if in the abelian Sorry, in the abelian case, then twisted forms of BG with some rigidification structure are in bijection with, are classified by this cohomology group. In the non-abelian case, there is a In the non-abelian case, there's descriptions that they kind of use non-abelian chromology, so they're a little more complicated. Okay, right, so where have I gotten to? I guess my claim is that the stacking structure or the failure of things to be fine is measured by these residual terms. So, using that, I can phrase or I can state my more precise Murphy's law. So, here's my definition. So here's my definition. Let's fix a field K nod. And let's say M, the lean upward stack over K. I'm going to say that M satisfies Stacky Murphy's law. Maybe Fern's. Fern's stacking Murphy's law if the following comments. If for every finitely generated field extension, k over k0 and every lean mumfront gerb Germ G is isomorphic to a residual germ of at some point. So every possible gerb appears Uh appears in your stack. Every finite group occurs as a stabilizer. Yeah, yeah, so it is as a cordler. You can in particular plug in Eg for your jerk. For your gerb, and then you'll unravel what that means. That means that the corresponding point of the stack would be an object of your stack with automobiles and group exactly G4. So that's a special case of, I mean, if a stack satisfies that, it also has that other function. So here's the theorem that Max kind of proved. The following stacks that are all over this fixed base field satisfy Herke's law. We have a sign of curves. It's the stack of principally polarized abelian varieties. Also, canonically polarized equals for NAD and And I'll stop there, but I think you can probably produce, once you've given, you're given some, you can kind of produce others from them using some techniques. So that's kind of our main result is showing that this does indeed happen in these sort of nice cases. Yeah. Sorry, I have a basic question. So DNA means that it should not have a friend in a hill cover by speed, right? It means it has a tall cover device. It means it has a tall covered bioskeeping. Oh, okay. So, what is the cover bioskeeping in the case of a side? I think you can make one, I think, for instance, by adding some kind of rigidifying structure. Yeah, I guess. It does not require you kind of, I guess. Oh, yeah, yeah. Any other questions? Yeah, I guess one point about this is that, as Martin said, if you have this property, then there's at least objects with automorphism groups for every finite group. So your stack's going to have to be very big for this to have any chance of being true. So, like, I really need the stack of, I need all the MGs for every G. If I just fit to some finite level, I wouldn't have any hope of getting every girl because I wouldn't. Because I wouldn't, I'd have some bound on the size of G script. So every jerk sort of has an underlying abstract discrete finite group, right? If you pass through algebraic closure, where this suddenly has a section, send out to be G, so there's some G involved. And of course we know how it's bound, so there's some rough estimate how large G has to be. So I don't know how huge is the z of all the germs with a given discrete group G. Of all the germs with a given discrete group G. But if I pin down, I give you a discrete group G, can it give me an upper bound for the genus so that all the germs with that discrete group G will occur? Yeah, in principle, yes. For an individual group G, finitely many of them suffice, or do I also have to go all the way up to the point? That's the question. I don't know the answer to that question. I could tell you, if you give me a bound on the, if you give me a specific germ, I can give you a bound. If you give me a specific girb, I can give you a bound based on characteristics of that girb for the genus. But the bound is, it's not just going to involve sort of the size of G, it also involves some arithmetic characteristic of the girb. And the bound is going to be far, far worse than the Hurowitz bound. It might be that maybe, I'm not Uh maybe, yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, I haven't thought about that. It's a good question. No. I mean, I can give you an example where that's. Well, yeah, it's not clear to me from off the top of my head. I think, like, um, like I think that you can't possibly, I think you can show by thinking about M2 that the Hurwitz. So I think about M2, that the Hurwitz bound, sort of there's groups which can be the automorphism group of a genus II curve, but I think not every gerb sort of corresponding to that group can appear in M2. But it does appear in some bigger M. How many gerbs can a kind of particular Mg be finite, or is this infinitely many? No, I think it's infinitely many. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, so I think so, yeah. Wonder if it's realized and certain twists of this are also real. Uh well I I could think of an example where there's infinitely many. Yeah um but I'm not sure if that always happens. Movie groups, of course, are infinite for fields. Yeah, but it seems quite large for that. I mean for instance, every class in a every journal. Every journey corresponding to a class like this appears in M2. That's a fact. So that shows the infinitely many. So let me just sort of like close the loop on my previous example. In M11, this being the J invariant. What are the residual gerbs that appear here? Well, we actually sort of already answered that question. You can look at different J invariants. You can have this residual gerb here, and the surgery that I told you about tells you that there exist sections like this, which correspond to corresponding to a choice of elliptic curve with that J invariant. Elliptic curve with that J invariant. And so that tells you that there's sections here. That tells you that what was G sub lambda? G sub lambda is isomorphic to E ought E lambda, which is either B mu2 or B mu 4 or B mu6, depending on your chain. So those are the residual jerks, well, some of them that show up in M11. Some of them show up in M1, a particular URL split. Alright, so in the last bit of time, I want to give you sort of like plain two constructions that produce gerbs in the moduli stack of curves. The first one is going to be kind of limited in scope, and I think it's. Kind of limited in scope, but I think it's pretty appealing, and I like it. So here's the first one. It's actually this example. So here's the starting point. Let's take a two-torsion raw class of our field. I guess I'm going to switch to working over field K now. Let me let P be associated a Browner-Severi variety, or sorry, a Browner-Severi variety with this class. So like for instance, you could take the non-trivial class here, and you could take this non-select comic. And let me also let G be a juror, UQ juror with class. So I'm going to explain to you a way of realizing G as a residual derve in M2. So the point of this is, so you have a rational curve here, and here is P. A genus 2 curve is canonically a double cover of P. A double cover of P1 branched at six points. So, okay, now we want to kind of reverse that. Given a rational curve and six points, can you find a genius2 curve which is a double cover branch of those points? This is sort of attempting to make a map into the stack of genius2 curves. Okay, and if you think about how do you make a double cover, a branch double cover, you have to pick some. A branch double cover. You have to pick some branch locus, but you need a line bundle whose square is that divisor. This thing, this curve here, he has a line bundle, which I'll call O2. This is the anti-canonical line bundle. There's not an O of 1 on P unless. There's not an O of one on P unless this class vanishes, or unless P is isomorphic to P one. P is one-dimensional. Uh yeah, yeah. Oh, s sorry, I should have said um index of alpha is. Yeah, I really want an index to Brown class, indeed. One-dimensional groups here. So, okay, I can take the third power of this and get an O of six. Power of this and get an O of 6 over P. So now I was sort of attempting to make a double cover. I would take a global section of O of 6. And if I had a square root of O of 6, like an O of 3, then I could make a double cover. I also don't have an O, I have an O of 1 if only if I have an O of 3. What I've just described is the following. So you can look at the jerk of roots of square roots of O of 6. So this is the stack. So this is the stack which parametrizes line levels whose square is above 6. This is a mu2 jerve. And what I, well, one thing you can check is that this is actually isomorphic to this jerve G. Roughly speaking, because this jerve splits if and only if this class is zero, if and only if this key emits an O of 1. And emitting O of 1. And emitting O of 1 is equivalent to emitting an O of 3. And that's when this works. Okay, and then if you fix any section, global section of 6, Jared global section, then you can make a map from here to M2, which sends a line bundle L with isomorphism P to the branch double cover. This is a map from the jerk to the moduli stack of genus 2 curves. And in fact, this realizes G as a residue, a residual germ of G. A residual germ of this stack. So this is like, I've given you kind of the simplest, I think, interesting case of this construction in this context. This produces a bunch of non-trivial gerbs in M2. You can generalize this in a lot of ways. Like, there's nothing particularly special about 6 there. I could have multiplied 2 by any odd number. Two by any odd number. So this makes you, it's like sort of non-trivial gerves in the hyper elliptic locus. You could also generalize this by starting with a higher index Brouwer class and take branched covers of some higher dimensional Brouwer spared variety. And if you want to get things in the modified stack of curves, you can kind of do something similar to that. You can take a complete intersection. Take a complete intersection inside there and do branch covers of this. So it's sort of just a reasonably straightforward generalization of this idea. And what this does for you is you can realize every mu integer. Of some energy. Specifically, it's going to be in the locus of curves that are cyclic covers of complete intersection curves. This is actually the first instruction that we thought about. Sort of only in the context of the Brouwer group. So you can kind of realize every Brouwer class somehow as an obstruction. Brouwer class somehow as an obstruction in the modulus technical curves. So, what I wanted to finish with, or do for the last bit of time, is explain how we approach the general case instead of mu n gerbs, sort of gerbs, arbitrary gerbs, and in particular non-abuelian gerbs, which are Non-abelian terms, which are which I think they're sort of less directly comological, which I'm sort of forced to work more geometrically, which I actually think ended up being quite interesting to me. Okay, so here's kind of the general instruction or method. So I want to start by saying like a I'll write down explicitly a corollary of the main theorem, which is that if you fix a field K and a finite total group scheme V over K, then there exists A curve C over K such that the automorphism group of C where K is exactly G and also C is not defined over any proper subfield. How do you know it's not that this so here let me explain or at least indicate how it follows from the theorem and try to explain how that that property comes about. So let me take uh take the jerk and be E G. Take the derivative BG and say we realized it as a residual derivative here. So now this. And you have a universal curve here. This goes back to this curve, curve C here. And if you pull back here, you get C. So just from having a representable this morphism, it's a representable morphism that induces an isomorphism on inertia. And that's what tells you that the automorphism. And that's what tells you that the automorphism group is exactly G. But then the residual group has an additional property, which is that it's sort of the universal sort of the farthest one down. It's the universal such map to your stack. If you have any, you could have other germs that have a similar map to your stack, but they'll factor through this one. And that's what tells you that it can't be defined over any smaller subfield. Or maybe a different way of saying it. Subfield. Or maybe a different way of saying it is that this thing is the residue field of a point here. So if this curve was defined over any subfield, that would contradict this property. That would mean there's a field imagery. Okay, but actually, I want to just focus on this part right here. So, like a special case of this question. So, like a special case of this question is: how do you make a curve, or in the more general case, we're thinking about making various kinds of varieties or something, with an action by a fixed group or something, or with a fixed automotive symptom. And so here's kind of my general, I mean, okay, that's something that a lot of people have thought about in various contexts and have various methods and so on. And one thing that I want to That I want to, one thing that I came to realize when figuring this stuff out is that if you look at this problem involving these germs from the right perspective, you can actually just kind of, you can really use very similar methods to these classical things, just working over a germ. So here's like first instance of this. Here's kind of like a general meta claim. Geo-equigran geometry. over field K is roughly equivalent to geometry over VG. And how does this correspondence work? Well, okay, if you have like a variety of X over a field, then you're going to map like this on actually a Cartesian diagram. So if you have a variety of a field with an action of g, then you get a map like this. So this is a representable morphism over Vg. And you can go the other way. If you're given some morphism to Vg, you can pull back one universal torsor and get some variety x with respect k, and this map is a g torsor. So in particular, like there's a g-action. This is the correspondence. This is the correspondence in both directions. So, I mean, you know, is this a useful perspective? Well, I think it actually, it's even a necessary perspective for me, because what I want to do is replace BG with a possibly non-split jury. And actually, my meta claim is that, I mean, I think it's pretty common if you have some construction in, say, projective geometry or something. Projective geometry or something over a field, it's pretty typical that you can find like G-equivariant versions. And I think my kind of meta claim is that if you can do that, you can probably actually find a version over an arbitrary jur. And that actually, sometimes that generalization might be kind of the most natural generalization. It's like a slightly larger generalization than just the geography case. So geometry over G is locally. Locally, at least geometry over EG But you have to be kind of a little bit careful about this. And let me explain what this locally kind of exactly means. Explain what this locally kind of exactly means here. So let me say I have my derb like this, I g. It's over some field. And let's say I have a morphism from something y. So I can always find a field extension of this that splits the jury. So maybe it's L. And this would be Y. And this would be YLR. And now this, choosing that splits, so you can look at the section like this. I'm going to call that XL, split this diagrams. Okay, now this thing, this is a section of a gerb, so this thing here is a some torso or some group G. On group G. Okay, so what am I seeing? Well, this Y here, equipping it with this map to G induces the following structure on the base change. When I base change Y to Y L, Y L is the quotient of X L by a G X G. So the beta of this morphism gives you YL as the quotient of this. So y it's a way of realizing y as a twisted form of a very particular thing, which is the quotient of a variety by a group function. But here it's a twisted form in the second, it's like a very twisted sort of package, because even not only does like x might not descend to k, the group might not descend to k. The group might not descend to play. So there's sort of a lot of interesting going on. But so here's kind of the way that I think it's best to look at these things. So here's kind of the goal. The goal is given your germ G, Let me define one more object. Attached to G, there is a certain group. It's a sheaf of groups G. Now this is a sheaf on the girder. And its value on some point of the jerk is the automorphism group at that point. This is what's called the inertia of the chart. So, this is a finite total group scheme over G, but it need not be a group scheme over K. That's sort of one of the subtleties of these things. If it's abelian, it's the fullback of group scheme on K, but in general, it's not. So there's sort of not even, there's no group on K floating around that's relevant. And that's exactly what I was talking about here. But there is a group on the GERB, and I think this is one advantage of the GERBI perspective. One advantage of the Gerby perspective. So here's my goal with this in hand. So you fixed G. Now I want to find a curve, maybe a relative curve, such that the relative automorphism group of this is exactly G. This is now sort of phrased like this. This looks exactly like the sort of more classical question of finding a curve over a field with some fixed automorphism groups. I've now replaced the field with this jerk. And I've replaced the automorphism group with some sheaf of groups on the jerk. And I guess one more remark along these lines. I think this is really where the I think this is really where the perspective of TERPS has a lot of advantages. I think these similar sorts of questions and objects you can find talked about in the literature. But without this language, if you want to talk about what you actually have over K, you're forced to do things like think about, you don't actually have a group over K, you just have some kind of group up to sort of various gluted with various sort of group automorphisms, but it's not actually a group on the whole thing. But it's not actually a group on the whole thing, so it gets very complicated. But if you sort of stick all that complication into your base, then you just are talking about a group. Okay, so once you have this formulation of the problem, then you can actually kind of just mimic a lot of classical work. So you can try to find some paper where people, for instance, like constructed in various situations curves with some prescribed bottom work was improved over a fixed Prescribed bottom work is improved over a fixed field. So there's been a lot of work on this, and actually, I wanted to write down people's names. Specifically, Adam Valentini and Prunin I've thought about this. Is this like related to various forms? This is related to various formulations of some kind of inverse scale law problem and things like this. So, what remains to do is sort of once you have this perspective in hand is take some results like this and just replace the ground field with the gerb and see if you can make it stolen. And so, just to give you a hint of how this starts, the starting method is the following. So, you start with your derivative G. First step, if you're trying to think of how to make a curve, If you're trying to think of how to make a curve with a G-action, one idea you might try is to take a find a free, like a close-to-free g-action on a projective space, and then maybe take like a generic complete intersection. And that would give you a curve with a g-action. You can do the same thing over at a girv. What you do is you start with a vector bundle of a jur. And then you can take its associated projective bundle by doing everything under the jury. And you can take a complete intersection in here. And this, this, if you do this right, this gives you a curve. If you do this right, this gives you a curve that at least has a faithful. Sorry, so the point is, P is basically a scheme that sort of intersections of I of its line buttons. Yeah, I think that's one. Yeah, P, I actually wanted to say paid for here. Yeah, it might not quite be a scheme because there might be some fixed points. So, yeah, yeah, from this you get at least From this, you get at least a curve that's acted on faithfully by the inertia. And then the tricky part is how to refine that to a curve where G is exactly the inertia. And this problem is actually, there's quite a few papers on this problem in the context of just working over a field. And there's some very, I think, very ingenious ways of doing this. I guess, like, in particular, we want a method that should work over like. Particularly, we want a method that should work over any field. That's sort of the hard part. It needs to work over an algebraically closed field, maybe, is a lot easier. We want to work over even a finite field. The next step, and this is kind of the ingenious step that a lot of people have worked on, given this, find, you can actually always find a finite cover such that the automatic. Such that uh such that the automobile group is now exactly this this funny group but but I guess the message is like uh uh you know hopefully I mean if these constructions are sort of sufficiently robust, they should work over they should allow you to replace the round field. Allow you to replace the round field with the jerve and still work. And they actually did what you sort of interpret things the right way. I'll stop there. Thank you. Questions for Dan? The fundamental rule of such a jerk is that just an extension of the government group by the Um this is such a correspondence and then uh this thing is BG if there's a splitting and you have always local splittings because you have a cover but yeah so uh the ultra government action that you get sort of in encapsulates these difficulties that you expressed but there's a group scheme but not really defined in K and Screen, but not really defined like certain type elements and so forth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. Then, yeah. Questions or comments? Okay, let's thank Dana again. So, everyone has safe travels to wet with their family.
