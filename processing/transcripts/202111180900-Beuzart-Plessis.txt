Thank you for the introduction. So it's my pleasure to be speaking on the occasion of Bill Castelman H's birthday. And so I just changed a little bit the title of my talk. So I think it's more appropriate to call it multipliers and quasi-caspital convolution operators. And all of what I'm going to talk about is joint work with YFN Yu, Wei Zhang, and Shen. Feng Yiu, Wei Zhang, and Xin Wenzhu. And I would like also to first apologize because none of what I'm going to talk about is related to the subject of this conference. So there will be no orbital integrals, even less basic functions, and it's more like before endoscopy than beyond. But nonetheless, I would like to say that the subject of this talk is still not completely narrated. Not completely unrelated to the main focus of this conference, since, as you will see, one crucial ingredient we use in our work has been advocated for many years by Bill Kesselman. And so more precisely, here is one possible subtitle for the talk. It's yet another reason to believe that the short space of a real reductive group is useful. And indeed, I think that Bill Castleman has Kesselman has defended the idea that we should use the short space instead of the usual space of test functions all from the beginning. And also, I think that we can trace this idea back at least to his work with Nolan Vallak from the ATs on the smooth fresh globalizations of our shelter models. And I think here the keyword is that they found this. Is that they found this very crucial condition of being of moderate growth? So, okay, but so I will start my talk with something which doesn't use the Schwartz space at all. And more precisely, I'm going to review some work of Linden Schross and Van Kettesch from 2005. It's a very nice paper where they gave, in particular, soft proof of the existence of spherical cush forms in a very large forms in a very large generality. And in particular, they gave a very simple proof of the existence of mass forms. And by soft here I meant that they avoid any delicate analysis of the Eisenstein part of the spectrum. But since their construction is based on a similar idea as ours, I will just review quickly what they do in the case of Evan mass forms. Case of even mass forms, and this is very well explained actually in the introduction to their paper. But let me do it here. So, I will denote by H bar, the usual upper F plane, that here we will realize as a quotient of PGL2 over R by its standard maximal compact subgroup, so the projective orthogonal group, and we let PGL2 of Z act on this upper half plane. So, this is the more or less the usual. Is the more or less the usual action by fractional linear transformations, except that you have to compose these transformations by the complex conjugation when the determinant is minus one. So but working is with PGL2 means that we are really looking at even mass forms. And so with this presentation of the upper half plane, it's more or less obvious that you get an action by right convolution of the algebra of K. Of the algebra of Kb and baryon functions in a PGL2R. I mean, usual test functions. And for this action, we have a spectral decomposition, which takes the following shape. So first you have the Eisenstein part on the right. It's roughly spanned by Eisenstein series. So more precisely, it's a direct integral of a unitary Eisenstein series. Then you have the space of constant functions and the orthogonal complete. Of constant functions, and the orthogonal complement is what we call the Caspi-Low spectrum. And here, this consists in the even mass forms. So, the goal will be to show that this Caspiro spectrum is not identically zero. And to do this, they construct certain operators on L2, which kills all the Eisenstein part and the constant functions, but which are not zero. And therefore, you can conclude from there. So, we already have a very large algebra of operators here. Large algebra of operators here, namely the spherical functions on G. And let's just look at how they act on the Eisencheon series. So there is a very simple formula. I mean, the Eisenchein series are eigenfunctions for these actions with eigen values given by this k art, which is usually called the spherical transform of k. You can write a very explicit integral formula for this transform. And I mean, it's a And I mean, it's a well-known and well-studied transformation from the point of view of real Lie groups. And in particular, we have a kind of Palo Vinus theorem for this transform, which is due to Elgerson for general reductive groups, but in this case, apparently to Martiner and Erin Price. And it says that this spherical transform gives you an isomorphism between the space of spherical test functions on G with the space of even polyvinyl. With the space of even polyviner test functions, even polyviner functions on the complex plane, where I recall that the polyvilinear space here is the image by the Fourier transform of usual test functions on R. Okay, but I mean from this isomorphism you see that there is no chance that you can construct purely using this convolution operator, something that kills the Eisenstein spectrum without killing everything, because then this transform will be zero on the unitary line. Transform will be zero on the unitary line, and if it's not zero on the unitary line being holomorphic, it will be zero everywhere. So, k will be zero. But, uh, okay, so the idea of Linden Tross in Vankatege was to take advantage of the fact that we are in an arithmetic setting, and so we have other kind of operators, namely we have echo operators, and in particular, we have the usual equipment TP, where, and again, we can write exactly how it acts and the essential. act on the ascension series. So on the ascension series with parameter one r plus lambda, it has an eigenvalue which is this p lambda plus p minus lambda. So now we introduce I mean following Nashwson and Katesh, an endomorphism of the space of K-B invariant functions on PGF2R, which is given explicitly in terms of the spherical transform. So more precisely, you multiply this transform by exactly the eigenvalue of Tp on the ason channel. Tp on the as a chain series of parameter lambda. And okay, this is made so that now if you consider this operator APK, which is so you take the composition of Tp with a high convolution by K and minus high convolution by the image by this endomorphism of K, then it will automatically kill the orthogonal of the caspillo spectrum. Okay, this is, I mean, the definition was made so that it is true, and then so we just. made so that it is true and so we just now need to see why this operator is not always zero and okay here is one um i mean it's not a very precise argument but let me give it anyway so you the idea is to look i in the cusp so in the usual fundamental domain and then you can see that i convolutions by uh are they they commute with horizontal translations it's easy to see because horizontal translations so or if you prefer these are rotations they are These are rotations, they are given by left multiplications, but that the usual key operator doesn't, so it's easy to see this on the definition and how it moves masses along the usual fundamental domain. And from this, it's relatively easy to deduce that we can arrange this operator a pk to be non-zero and then you deduce the existence of event mass forms. So this is the basic idea of Linda-Schwarzen van Katesch and actually they went further. Actually, they went further. They constructed many operators on L2 space of locally symmetric varieties of the following form. So, here G is a split and adjoint of a Q, gamma is a congruent subgroup of G of Q, and K infinity is maximal compact subgroup of the aerial points. And then they use this to make some quantitative, to get some quantitative results more precisely. They got from this very low for this locally similar. For these locally symmetric spaces. So, and I would like, I mean, this is a very nice construction. It has very striking applications, but I would like to emphasize two drawbacks that it has when we would like to use this construction for other applications. The first one is that actually the operators they constructed also they are able to detect almost all the caspole. All the cospidal representations, sometimes they automatically kill certain arithmetically interesting automorphic forms. So, and usually they kill what images functorial lifts from smaller groups. So, for example, they will automatically kill a sim2 of a modular form. So, it's problematic when you would like to study caspidal representations in isolation. And another problem. And another problem is that actually also their construction is really based on a spherical polylinear theorem and it assumes that the functions are spherical at their coming and play. Okay, so now the rest of my talk will be to explain how to another construction which is similar and that has solves in some sense these two issues. So now we'll move to the So now we'll move to idelic setting. And so these are the basic notations for the whole talk. So G will be a connected and adaptive group of a Q, denoted as usual by A the A delay of Q. And it will be also convenient to fix once and for all a kind of level. So it's a maximum, sorry, compact open subgroup of G of the finite adults. And I will denote by S the set of path primes. S the set of pad primes, meaning that k decomposes as some compact open subgroup in the places in S, times the product of i per spatial maximal compact subgroup at the places outside s. So now the first main ingredient in the construction of what we call the quasi-gaspied convolution operators is the introduction of some space of convolution operators. And this is where the Schwartz. Operators, and this is where the Schwartz space comes in. So, namely, at the Archimedean place, we will not take the usual space of test functions, but we take what is usually called the Schwartz space, not to be confused with the Arishander Schwartz space, which is much bigger. So, here is a possible definition. So, this is a space of all smooth, I mean, infinitely differentiable functions on G of R, such that for all polynomial differential operator on the G of R. On the G of R, the D of F is bounded. And another way to say this a little bit more concretely is that, so using now invariant differential operators rather than any polynomial differential operator, is that for any x in the enveloping algebra, enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of G, the right derivation of f by x is decaying faster than any negative. Decaying faster than any negative power of a norm. So here the double bars stand for, they stand for some norm on G of R. I don't really want to define what it is. I mean, probably you can figure, imagine what kind of norm it is. But just to give you an idea, I give you an analogy. So with in a, it's not analog to the usual sharp space over the real line, it's rather analog to what we might call the Are analog to what we might call the exponential space. So, namely, the space of smooth functions on R whose all derivatives are decaying faster than any exponential. So, in particular, you see that the Fourier transform of such functions, they extend to holomorphic functions on the whole complex plane. And so this Schwartz space is actually an algebra and a convolution, so relatively easy to see. And this is the space of time. And this is the space of test functions we'll be using at the real place. At the other places, so the finite places, we'll use standard test functions. And so I can now define the global Schwartz space. It's a restricted tensor product of the Archimedean Schwartz space with spaces of Kp B invariant functions on G of QP, where I recall also Kp is the local component of the level we have fixed. So recall that we have fixed a level. Uh, recall that we have fixed a level, and I denote this global flash space by SgA of K. Okay, and here I recall the meaning of this infinite tensor product. Right, so this is the first main ingredient, and the second ingredient is a space of so-called multipliers that will act on the global short space. So, and now I will now define these multipliers and we'll start with the easy one. And we'll start with the easy ones. So the easy ones are at the finite and armified places. So we call that S. I just have a. This is Jace. I have a question about the previous slide. So if you just literally specialize this definition to R, is this what you get? No, no, no, no, yeah. No, this is the exponential short space is what you get when you specialize this definition to the multiplicative group. Multiplicative group and you pull it back to R using the exponential model. Okay, all right. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Okay, so at finite places, as a space of multipliers, so finite and amified places, sorry, we just take the spherical algebra with respect to the hyperspatial maximal compact subgroup, Kp, we have fixed. And so I did not easily by HP, but so it already appeared on the previous slide as in the definition. Slide as in the definition of the global flat space, but here this HP will play a different role, namely, it will act on itself, seen as a space of test functions by convolution. This is how we look at it. And now at the real place, right now we will just define some abstract objects and later we'll see more concrete ones. But let me define the space of multipliers. We can, some space of multipliers. So we'll denote by m infinity of g, this is the space of quantum. Of G, this is the space of continuous endomorphism of the Schwartz space, seen as a B module over itself. So it might seem a bit abstract, but let me maybe just say another way to see this, which is not completely precise. It can be actually identified with a space of invariant distributions in the group, which are rapidly decreasing in some sense. And in particular, this is a space of distribution. This is a space of distributions and it will act by the usual convolution on the short space. And we will see some examples of such multipliers later. Okay, and using these two kind of local multipliers, now we can construct a global space of multipliers that I call as multipliers because we'll remove the bad finite places. And so again, it's a restricted sensor product of the local multiplier spaces. And using this the action. And using the actions they have on the local short spaces, we get the global action by convolution on the global short space. So we are almost able ready to state the main results. So a little bit of extra notation. So I will fix now an irreducible and miscible representation of G of A, which has level K, so meaning that the K invariant vectors there is non zero. In vectors, there is non-zero, and so I need a definition because we will not be able to isolate pi from the Eisenstein spectrum all the time. There is a condition. So, since pi has level k at all the anarmified places, it's unarmified and it has some static parameter by which the local spherical algebra is acting, and we denote this by lambda p of pi. Lambda p of pi, yes, sorry. And we'll say that pi is S cap if there exists an asynchronous series. So I'm being a bit loose here, but it's Eisenhower series. I mean, Asensan series coming from a proper levy, proper parabolic rather of G, of level K again, which has the same SATA K parameter at all the places outside S. And these are precisely the representations will not be able to. The representations will not be able to isolate from the spectrum. So, now here is the main theorem. So, I assume that pi is not S-cap, then the theorem says that there is a multiplier, a global multiplier, depending on pi, such that for every global schwat function of level k, the action, so we using the multiplier, we get a new Schratz test function. So, mu pi convolve with f. Pi convolves with f, it's acting by zero on the orthogonal of the Caspio spectrum, but the action on pi is unchanged. Okay. So a few remarks, maybe. The first one is, okay, what about this condition of being not a scarp? So I mean, it's a very natural condition, but this for Guplag for GLN, it's non-natural caspier representation, it's not a scarf, of course. So it's a result. Is not as carp, of course. So it's a result of Jack and Jalika. And for other groups, it's not true, but for the, I mean, for classical groups, for example, now with the work of Artur, we know more or less, we have some classification of the caspillo representations, which are S-caps. Okay. The second remark is that the proof is, as you will see, is quite. Is as you will see is quite robust and so it allows for many variants. So, for example, rather than isolating one representation, you may want to isolate a cospital data. So, this is also something which is possible with this method. And actually, it has been applied in my recent joint work with Pierre-Henry-Doudois and Michel Didor to prove new cases of the global Gangros-Raset conjecture for unit groups. Conjecture for unital groups. And for this, I refer you to Pierre-Henri's talk yesterday. Okay, so the rest of my talk will be trying to explain ideas that go into the proof of this theorem. And actually, one of the main ingredients that goes into the proof is the construction of sufficiently many multipliers at the Achimedian place, because the previous definition was quite abstract. Now we need to get our hand on some. We need to get our hand on some elements in the space of Archimedean multipliers. But first, I would like to... So we will get to this. It will be a spectral explicit description of certain elements in the Archimedean multipliers. But as a warm-up, let me first recall the spectral description of the periodic multiplier. So just the static exomorphism. From now on, to simply. From now on, to simplify notations, I will assume that G is split. I mean, it makes sense much easier. And I will fix the Borel subgroup. And I will denote by A the torus quotient of B, so it's a universal cartan of G, W the corresponding var group. And so one object which will appear all the time is the dual group. So it's can defined this way. But X star of A is the group of algebraic character of A. Okay, so let me recall. Okay, so let me recall the static isomorphism. So I recall that for every P, we can now identify this dual torus with the group of n-hammified characters of the QP points of A, that I will just denote by A art of P. And this identification is made by sending chi tensor pi s to chi composed with the p-adicol value to the power s. And I also recall, so I'm going to describe the static isomorphism, maybe not in the Atakia isomorphism, maybe not in the usual. I mean, I will first describe the classification of the irreducible and ammified representation and then the description of the spherical equalgebra. So recall that unharmified irreducible representations of GQP, so by this I mean the one having vector fixed by G of Zp, they have a satake parameter which is a W orbit of an W orbit of unarmified characters of A of Qp. And this is, I mean, the relation with the unarmified representation pi p is by the fact that pi p appears in the normalized parabolic conduction of this character inflated to the borel. And using this static parameter, now I can describe very easily the static isomorphism. So there is an isomorphism between the Swei-Colique algebra and the space of regular W. Of regular W invariant functions on AP hat that I write mu maps to mu hat, and it's made so that it describes exactly the action of mu on anonified vectors in enamified derivible representations using the state parameters of an armified representations. Okay, all of this is actually well known to everybody here, but I just would like to write it down so that to make a parallel with Down so that to make a parallel with the description of the multipliers in the Archimedean case. Okay, so now we move to Archimedean multipliers, and so something similar happens here. So namely, we'll be able to describe Archimedean multipliers spectrally because of the following easy property: that if you have an Archimedean multiplier with the previous definition, and pi infinity, an irreducible, amiscible representation of G over R, then you can let act in some way. Then you can let act in some way. It's, I mean, okay, yeah, implicitly, I'm using the Casamanvala globalization just to persist. And using this, you can get an action of mu on pi infinity. And since it's invariant, it will be a color multiple of the identity. And this colour is denoted by mu hat of pi infinity. And then from some abstract nonsense in a functional analysis, you get that this mu hat, which is a function on the Which is a function on the admissible dual of G of R, complexly characterizes mu. And we'll describe multipliers through this spectral transform. And more precisely, so we'll be interested in very particular multipliers. So let me recall that you have Arishennar isomorphism here, which describes the center of the enveloping algebra of the complex point of the algebra of G as again a ring of regular functions. Regular functions, but this time on the Lie algebra of the dual torus, which are W invariant. And that every irreducible admissible representation has an infinitesimal character that using and using this action isomorphism, this infinitesimal character, so I would denote by lambda infinity of pi infinity. You can identify with a W orbit in the G algebra of the dual torus. And actually, we only look at multipliers such with spectral time. Spectral transform only depends on the infinitesimal character of the representations. And this we will call infinitesimal multipliers. Okay, so next slide I will define some sets of infinitesimal characters that we will need to describe our multipliers. And these sets of infinitesimal characters, I decided to call them tubular. Decided to call them tubular neighborhoods of the tempered spectrum because we will see. I think this is a good image of what these are. So, first we look at the tempered dual. So, tempered dual is a set of all isomorphism classes of tempered irreducible representations of G of R. And since we are only interested in the infinitesimal characters, I will denote by inf temp. So, recall that lambda infinity is the map sending a representation to its infinitesimal character. To its infinitesimal character, and so we'll take inf temp to be the set of infinitesimal characters of all the tempered irreducible representations. And so, this is a subset of Lie algebra of the dual Taurus mod W, because we have identified a few simple characters with the elements there. And okay, so we are going to define some particular neighborhoods. Okay, these are not really neighborhoods, but as you will see, but As you will see, but thickening in some sense of this set. But for this, let me recall one characterization of the tempered representation, so which is due to our channel. So representation is tempered if and only if there exists a parabolic subgroup that we can always take to be standard with a Levy quotient M and a torus, I mean split torus quotient am and sigma discrete series of m of r. Together with the unitary harmified character of AM, so which we can identify with a purely imaginary element in the complex dual of the Lie algebra of AM. But this is also naturally a subsphere of the complex dual of Lie of A, which is the same as the Lie algebra of the dual torrent. Such that pi infinity embeds in the Infinity embeds in the normalized parabolic induction of sigma twisted by lambda. And why did I recall this? Because now using this characterization, you can easily define a tubular neighborhood of the tempered old that we denote by G at temp index smaller than C, so it depends on some positive number C. And they are characterized by the same condition. Characterized by the same condition, except that now we can twist by any an armified character of the levy whose real part is bounded by the constant norm and by the constancy. So we need to fix a norm there, but okay. So we allow twisting by non-unitary energy characters, but with real part is controlled in some sense. And so now the tubular neighborhood also gives you. Neighborhood also gives you some set of infinity simple characters in stamp smaller than c so the image of this set of irreducible representation by the map lambda infinity and just okay let me give one example now to illustrate this construction so take g to be sl2 then you can identify the Lie algebra of the so the dual tools with C and W Alter as we see, and w is just acting by multiplication by minus one. And then the infinitesimal character of the temporal representations, it's the image in this quotient of the imaginary line union with the integers. And the distubular neighborhoods or these thickenings, they are given to you by replacing the imaginary line by. Replacing the imaginary line by some vertical band. So, really, it's only a neighborhood of the imaginary line. And you see that, so these integers here, they correspond to non-zero integers, they correspond to infinitesimal characters of the discrete series. You don't do anything at this point. Okay, so they don't really move, you only take some particular neighborhoods of the imaginary line. And in the situation, in general, The situation in general is more or less the same, except that you will have more series, and so you will always take, I mean, extend the infinitesimal characters in the real direction of the series. Okay, I hope it gives some insight on how it looks like in general, but okay, maybe I failed, I don't know. Okay, so. No more. Okay, so and now next slide is the main theorem on our main theorem on Archimedean multipliers. Okay, so it's a construction of Archimedean multipliers. So let nu at be an allomorphic function on the Lie algebra of the dual torus. And we'll impose, so it's holomorphic and we'll impose two further conditions. The first one is that it's W invariant. It's clearly necessary if we want, I mean we want something on the space of infinite symbol characters. Space of infinite symbol characters, after all. And the second condition is a growth condition. So this is a closure condition. It says that for any C, nu hat is bounded by a polynomial on this tubular neighborhood of inf temp. Then there exists an Archimedean multiplier, which is acting on admissible representation pi infinity by multiplication by the value of this new hat at the infinitesimal. This new add at the infinitesimal character of pi infinity. Okay. And this space, I would denote it by m infinity as superscript inf to emphasize that this is a space of infinitesimal multipliers. So only depending on the infinitesimal character. Okay, so I will not talk really about the proof of this theorem, but I would like to put it into context. So first, this is not the first theorem. So first, this is not the first time about constructing multipliers for a real reductive group. So I think the first result in that direction was due to Arthur, who constructed a big algebra of, I mean, for the need of the trace formula, he has constructed a big algebra of multipliers. So let me review very quickly what's Artier multiplier algebra. Artium multiplier algebra. So here, first, Artio is working with comparable, I mean, the Jew space of test functions. And he also has to impose a condition of being finite on both sides by some fixed maximal compact subgroup. And then on this space of K infinity B finite functions, they construct an action of some algebra of multipliers. These are again infinitesimal multipliers, and as functions on the And as functions on the space of infinitesimal characters, it is described as a polylinear space. So, this polylinear space, so more precisely, so I've written here the definition. So, it's the image by the Fourier transform of the space of W invariant compactly supported distribution on the real Lie algebra of A. So, here I'm using the standard notation from Schwarz. So, E prime is not the space of compactly supported distributions. Distributions. So there are some reasons why. I mean, this is some very big multiplier algebra already, but it's not sufficient for a purpose. So there are two reasons for this. The first one is that it only works for k-finite functions, which is a bit prohibiting when you want to apply it to certain comparison of trace formulas where you don't know that the transfer possesses. Where you don't know that the transfer preserves k-finite functions. And the semantic reason is more serious, actually, as I will try to insist on later, is the fact that the Palina functions, I mean, there is explicit descriptions of what these are as automorphic functions. And so there is some condition of growth in vertical bands in the same spirit as the second condition is, but there's also a condition of being bounded by a polynomial. A condition of being bounded by a polynomial in the real direction. And okay, really, for the construction of the quasi-caspital convolution operators, we need to get rid of this condition of being bounded by a polynomial, exponential, so in the real direction. I will explain a little bit later why. Okay, so fortunately for us, there was another multiplier algebra in the literature, which has been constructed by DeLore. And so this time, this is a multiplier algebra acting directly on the Schwartz space. Are acting directly on the Schwartz space, but again, not the Fuchschwatt space, but the subspace of k-finite functions. And so, this can be described very quickly by saying that now this is the image by the Fourier transform of essentially the exponential Schwartz space that I talked about earlier. Actually, you can get something slightly bigger by taking its dual. So, in some sense, it's a space of rapidly decaying distributions. Decaying distributions and again W invariance. So it's more or less what we want. So it's these are you can describe them again as holomorphic functions. So these are holomorphic functions which are of a polynomial growth in vertical strips. So only, meaning that you are only looking at the tubular neighborhood of the unitary principal series here. But this is because of the k-finite conditions here. And if you okay, so. If you okay, so to prove the CRM now without the k-finite conditions, what we need to show, starting from this result of the LORM, is that the action of our algebra of multiplier, which is a sub-algebra of the LOM algebra, extends by continuity to the short space. And this, I will not really say how it works, but let me just say that the argument uses L2. L2 some okay, it uses the Planchal formula of Arichandro to show that it extends to some L2 space, and then some argument using twisting or translation by a finite dimensional representation to do the same thing for some weighted L2 spaces, and then using some standard Sobolev theory, you get the result. Okay, so I still have almost 10 minutes. So, in the remaining time, I would like now to explain using theorem B, the proof of theorem A, because you will see how everything fits together. And okay, so let me recall the statement first. So, we have a irreducible representation of G of A, which is of the fixed level and is not S-cap, so it means that spectrally. S cap, so it means that spectrally is not close to being an Asenstein series. And then there is a global multiplier such that for every Schwarz test function of level k, acting by the multiplier on this test function gives you a convolution operator which kills the caspital spectrum and doesn't change the action of f on the representation pi. Okay, so the idea is a very simple. So the idea is very simple actually. It's just to translate this problem into a problem about function theory and by moving, I mean, translating everything using some space of spectral parameters. So we introduce the space of spectral parameters is this one. So it's the global spectral parameters. It's a product of the space of infinitesimal characters for the real place. Characters for the real place times for all product for all an armified places of the space of SATAK parameters. So it's a very big space. But using this X, you can encode a lot of spectral information about representations. And I will denote by lambda S of pi the apple given by the first. Given by the first the infinitesimal character of pi at infinity and then at all the and ramified places the satake parameters. So it's an element in this space Xs and then we can do the same. I mean for any Eisenchine series of level K they also have an infinitesimal character and set a K parameters at the places outside S and I will denote by X S Eisenstein the As Eisenstein, the set of all spectral parameters of Eisenstein, such Eisenstein series Flever K. Okay, so it's a subset of cotic X of S okay and now the okay so of course we will only work with the mil at infinity will only work with the space of multipliers constructed by CRM B. So I will not buy By itsorem B. So I will denote by M s inf the subspace of multipliers, global multipliers given at the Archimedean place by the infinitesimal multipliers we have constructed. And using the previous transform at the archiminant place, so mu the gives mu at and the set aque transform at all the finite unarmified places. We can look at this space of This space of global multipliers as a space of functions on gotic x of s, so the space of spectral parameters, right? Again, this transform is going to be denoted by mu plus mu at. And now the problem is very easy to state. I mean, what we are looking for is a global multiplier, u pi, global infinitesimal multiplier. Global infinitesimal multiplier whose spectral transform mu pi hat vanishes on the Eisenstein parameters but not on the parameter of pi. And then, I mean, we will get the this is the this is exactly what we're looking for. And how are we going to do this? So, well, one of the main problems, I should say, when you work with number fields is that Number fields is that this Eisenstein series, as is well known, they come into families. You have a countable number of families, but so they are countable, but not finite. So we will need to kill infinitely many families of Eisenstein series. Okay, so Eisenstein series, as I just said, they come into families, and that I would just denote by purely F, one family. So one So, one family consists of the Zenchen series constructed from Gaspidol automorphic representation of some levy. Okay, the statement which is written on the slide is more precise than what I'm saying right now. And then you vary two things. So, first the vector in this caspudo representation, phi, and also the parameter, the twisting parameter lambda, which is an amified character of the Levy. Of the Levy. Okay, this is what I mean by a family. And of course, it's relatively easy to describe what the image of one family looks like. I mean, what's the spectral, the set of spectral parameters of one family looks like, because it's relatively easy to describe the effect of twisting on infinitesimal character and Sazaki parameters. So, more precisely, the image. Precisely, the image, the spectral parameters of one family, is the image of X S, so of a coset for this subgroup of the product of the algebra of the dual group and this local, this product of local torio fenamified characters. So recall that Xs is really this product, except that you have divided everywhere by the action of the valve. So it's not too bad. So it's not too bad. I mean, one family can be, it's very, it's not something completely arbitrary. And now we use one thing. So the fact that by a theorem of our channel, already the infinitesimal character of pi does not appear as the infinitesimal character of one of these family, except for a finite number of families. Feminism, right? And the second thing is that this is something also you can deduce from the Arishandra proof, actually, making it a bit more effective. Is that the infinitesimal characters of the families, they go to infinity in a sufficiently fast way. So they are quite sparse. So they don't glue, I mean, tend to group together. So this is very crucial because this is Because this is the first step of the proof, will be to kill all these families which do not contain the infinitesimal character of pi. And you have infinitely many of them, but they are, I mean, okay, their distribution is not too bad, okay? And for this, we construct just one multiplier at the Archimedean place whose spectral transfer vanishes on the Transform vanishes on the infinitesimal characters of all of these families except the one containing the infinitesimal character of pi, and which does not vanish at the infinitesimal character of pi. And here, so more or less what we need to do is to construct some holomorphic function vanishing at a given infinite set of affine subspaces. So, this is something you can do usually by taking an affinite product, but the problem is that when you take But the problem is that when you take such an infinite product, usually you don't get something which is of order one, meaning that it's not bounded by an exponential. So it's very crucial here that to allow infinitesimal multipliers not to be bounded by an exponential, so to have arbitrary growth in real direction. So this is the point where we cannot use alternate multipliers. Okay. And so now it only remains to separate. To separate pi from the remaining finite families, and then it's not too hard. I mean, okay, so you use functions of this kind. So namely, we will mix now Archimedean and P-adic multipliers. So you look a function on the space of spectral parameters, which so it's kind of you take kind of exponential of the Achaemenid parameters and compare it with the Sataki parameters by. It with the satake parameters by right. Obviously, this is what we want to do to separate the image of such cosetright from any point which is outside of it. This is something we can do at this level, and then we need to take some average of the valve group. So, this is roughly the idea. Okay, so this ends the discussion of theorem A, and now I would like to finish. Now, I would like us to finish with a few questions. Some questions I already asked actually in the previous version of this talk, but since, okay, I didn't make any progress on those, and I would be very interested to know more about those. Let me ask them again. So, all of these questions have to do with the Schwartz space at the real place and Archimedean multipliers. So, the first question is the most obvious one. So the first question is the most obvious one, I think, is that we have constructed some space of infinitesimal multipliers. The question is obviously if we get all of them, can we construct other multipliers only depending on the infinitesimal character? Okay, my guess would be no, but I don't know exactly how this can be proved. Second question is: okay, this is all about multipliers only depending on the infinitesimal character. Of course, you can construct using the center, some other multipliers. Construct using the center, some other multipliers. But are there others? So this question can be, I mean, one thing that would be nice is, for example, for PGL2, you have two families of principal series. They are not completely disjoint because at certain spatial points they share common subquotions, but you would like... But you would like, I mean, some multipliers that is able to separate these two principal series, at least when lambda is in generic position. And I don't think we know for the moment multipliers that do this. And okay, and the last question is going a little bit further even is can we prove a polylinear theorem kind of theorem for the Schwartz space? And okay, I think it would be very nice and then use. I think it would be very nice, and then using this, we would be able to describe the space of all multipliers, I guess. So, okay, let me stop here. I'm already over time. Okay, thank you.
