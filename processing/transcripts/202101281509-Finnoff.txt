From any direction, for example. Well, in an economic setting, these are really problematic because it tells you that policy in these settings, you're going to get where you're going to go regardless of how much you spend. And so it really kind of brings into play like, is policy useful here? And the macroeconomists have spent a lot of time and sweat and pulling hair out thinking about these for macro problems, but we've kind of found the same kind of thing here. We've kind of found the same kind of thing here in these epi systems which include human behavior. In summary, we're going to find how when you include human endogenous human behavior, so you've got, let's say, human or you've got decision rules for people in the model. If you've got these and you bring in these epidemiological characteristics, we're going to find multiple endemic steady states, going to find region, kind of parameter regions, if you will. Kind of parameter regions, if you will, of indeterminacy or instability around these endemic steady states. You have the potential for these what the macro people call self-fulfilling prophecies or sunspot equilibria, namely these areas where, hey, it doesn't matter what you do, you're going to transition to an equilibrium. And it doesn't matter how much you spend, you're still going to get there. And actually, it doesn't matter what you spend, you still get there. And your welfare is kind of invariant. And your welfare is kind of invariant to how much you spend, which is kind of crazy in some of these instances. What we do find, let's say, in general, is that this increased instability or indeterminacies can make the chances of these kind of predictable outcomes for public policy low and the chances for wasted resources high. So, we're going to take a, I'm just going to work in for the for today, I'm just going to work with an SIS model. Work with an SIS model. We considered all sorts of variants of these. We're using discrete time version here, which is really kind of the easiest way to reflect human decision making simultaneously with these compartmental models. It's probably not as elegant mathematically, but it lets you kind of bring in the timing of decisions, I think, let's say, fairly simply. As all of you guys probably know, though, when you work with these discrete models, it's a It's anything seems to be on the table, and you got to be, let's say, quite careful. And what we're going to then do is take the classic SIS model, and we're going to say we're dealing with a fixed population, and we're going to consider the proportional variant of that. So, I'm just going to basically say that we've got a constant population over time. We're going to have people either if they are susceptible or infected. Or infected, making choices of how much they're going to expose themselves. Their choices are going to be these control variables XS and XIN in each period, and they're going to choose these to maximize their expected lifetime utility. So the basic point here is that if you get, or if you remain susceptible, you have a certain, let's say, quality of life that we're tracking. But if you transition to being infected or you get infected, your quality of life goes down. Okay. Okay, and we're going to have you making these decisions in this model in a self-interested way. And again, before last, let's say February, I thought people really were pretty self-interested in these situations. But actually, I don't think that's accurate at this stage. I mean, we've seen lots of people, at least anecdotally, voluntarily, so infected people voluntarily keeping themselves out of Voluntarily keeping themselves out of exposure, staying home, if you will, wearing masks. So, I'm going to say one assumption that I'm going to employ here is it's a very strict assumption, namely that people don't care about the welfare of others. And I think that in a framework like this, you might take my assumption here as a first step, right? And then think of in, let's say, a next iteration would be, well, what happens if people actually are deliberately altruistic? So, what I'm going to really So, what I'm going to really consider here are public policies that kind of force people, even though there is no incentive in my model for them not to expose themselves, who might expose themselves. But I would say that I think that that is a feature of this framework that I'm going to talk about that ought to be extended at this point. In this context, though, the big deal that I'm going to really spend most of my time about is just that an individual's probability of infection. Individual's probability of infection is what we would call endogenous. All right. And that endogeneity, the chance you get infected, depends upon how much you expose yourself, this excess, if you're susceptible, how much the infected peoples are exposing themselves, and the prevalence out there around you, right? So it's definitely a, instead of a fixed parameter, right? We're going to say that this thing, this, this. Say that this thing, this probability of infection, adjusts as conditions change, and a lot and a significant component of that adjustment is human behavior. And that's what we're trying to just bring into the modeling framework. And so these transitions between being susceptible and infected, we're going to take kind of a standard independence of events assumption and say. Assumption and say that people are out there, let's say, exposing themselves this XS on a bunch of independent events, if you will. So we're going to say that there's a per unit exposure transmission rate lambda. And then I'm going to introduce a parameter here, this alpha. And I'm just using it to make the point that this alpha is what I think one could think of where altruism on the behalf of infected people would come in. Of infected people would come in. All right, so if infected people, typically you would say they have no incentive to not expose themselves. At least if they're feeling well enough, they're going to go to the shop, go out and about in society, right? And so typically this alpha would just be, let's say, one. And so our INT, the proportion of people that are infected out there, is that kind of that probability that you match up with an infected person. But if you were able to lower that through, let's say, a public policy. Through, let's say, public policy, or if you were to say people were actually all altruistic, I think this is where it would come in in this model. Again, the main point here, though, is to just say that this probability of infection depends upon how many people or the proportion infected in your economy and the, let's say, a per unit exposure transmission rate, which might be very disease specific, as well as the behaviors of both types of the people in both states. The people in both states. We're going to say that people recover back to being susceptible at rate new here and build a very simple SIS type system. And I just showed you the two, and I'm going to say there's everyone who's born here is born susceptible at rate mu, and they also die at rate mu. So there's no disease-specific deaths here. We have done models this year looking a little bit more at that implication of disease-specific deaths. Specific deaths. It tends to just make this a little bit more complicated. And at this stage, we just kept it fairly clean. The point here, though, is to really be looking at the implications on endemic equilibria, not the eradication equilibrium, which is quite interesting of itself. But at this stage, we're thinking we're likely faced with these diseases that are going to be here on into the future. All right, so a very simple disease system. The only point is, or the only real change is that my problem. One of the only real changes that my probability of infection depends upon people's behavior, and that depends upon the state of nature. Okay. Then I'm going to start thinking about building a behavioral model. And this is going to be what's really important to people like Eli and I, is that we want to say that our agents who are acting in this, in this, and actually many of you, I shouldn't, I'm not criticizing any of you. You guys said the same thing, but there are some rules for behavior and in economics. For behavior, and in economics, the standard is we're going to use optimization to generate a set of behavioral rules. So, we're going to, my top line here is my value function for people in the susceptible state. The second line is for people in the infected state. And the first two terms, this log of S plus H S, that's really the current individual's utility. So, they get some utility from exposure. We're going to say their utility is or their. Their utility is or their satisfaction is declining in the amount of exposure, increases, sorry, not declining, increases at a decreasing rate, and they just have a certain level of quality of life, HS, in that state. All right, so think of that for those first two terms as the, this is where I wish we were in person. I'd be walking around pointing at the board, trying to make this a little bit more obvious. Maybe if you can see my cursor, you can kind of follow me. So we say they. So we say they've got some current benefits from their choices, and they've also got some, we're also going to reflect that the fact that people are making their choices not only for today, but for their welfare in the future. And we're going to discount it at this rate beta and say that they're going to make their decisions today based upon their expectation of the future. And in the future, they can, with one minus p, remain susceptible, or with p, probability. Or with P probability transition to being infected. Very simple kind of two kinds of state, although time-dependent value function. And we have the same thing for infected individuals, except that their transitions are transitioning from being infected back to being susceptible or staying infected. And the fact that their health, their quality of life, this HIN, is presumably lower in the infected state. State. Okay, from this, we get two behavioral rules: one for susceptible individuals, one for infected individuals. The behavioral rule for susceptible individuals is that they come or they try to choose the amount to expose up to the point where their marginal benefits of exposure in the current period, right? This MBTS term is just balanced with their expected marginal costs. Expected marginal costs of that behavior in the future. And what I kind of just put in the, there's way, and by the way, I'm breaking every science regulation for transmitting your information across disciplines here. I understand that, but you guys get details. And so I figured this would at least be the one crowd who might appreciate that. So the point is here is you expose yourself today and you get some immediate satisfaction, but you then face some costs of that. Face some costs of that. And the costs of that are that you are increasing the chance you get infected in the future. And when you increase the chance you get infected in the future, there's a greater chance you lose or you move from being susceptible to being infected. So you're going to have this kind of welfare loss, if you will. So what we find from this is actually, and this is where I'm going to spend most of my time, are these expected future marginal costs of your decisions. Okay? And that's we're going to and That's we're gonna, and that's an interesting, we think, and quite an interesting choice. Now, the in this model where you don't have altruism, then people basically go out and expose themselves, infected people go out and expose themselves with no future cost, right? There is no cost to them of exposing themselves. They only gain satisfaction. So, for us, that would be like a corner solution because there is no future cost. We just expose ourselves as much as possible. All right. Um, uh, All right, um, and so in this setting, where you're saying that individuals are self-interested without care for others, they expose themselves at a maximum kind of rate. I don't think that that is quite accurate for the way people have behaved in this last year, though. And so I think a clear extension would here would be: well, what if their behavior in the infected state actually, of course, it influences the probability susceptible people get infected, and if they were to bring. Infected, and if they were to bring that into account, basically, what you'd have to do is you'd have to have a PT in their expected future evaluator here, right? So they would you'd have to say that they cared about the welfare of other people. And we could bring that in, to be honest. But for now, I'm just going to say that they're self-interested and they just expose themselves at this max at the maximum rate. If you go through the optimization. The optimization procedure here, you get a pretty complicated Euler equation. And I'm just kind of showing you it here because I want you to see is that, hey, these expected future costs for susceptible people depend on how they behave, how the infected people behave, the INT, the current state, and the future state. So this is why these are rational expectation models because we're saying that people have kind of full information into the future. Kind of full information into the future of the dynamics, and there's a lot of two-way feedback, if you will, between these two, between the humans and the natural system. The interesting thing is that because of that probability function, being shaped as all probability functions are, we get a non-convexity in that marginal cost function. And really, it's because at low exposures, you increase your exposure, the probability of getting infected increases fast. But at high exposure, Increases fast. But at high exposure rates, you increase your exposure, the increase in probability is pretty low. So if that increase in probability is low, your expected marginal costs at high exposures are actually low. Anyways, we get a backward bending marginal cost curve here. I'll show you that in a second. I just talked about the two-way feedbacks. Again, just trying to show you that when you drill this thing down, the episystem and the human system are. The episystem and the human system are really what we would call jointly determined. There's two-way feedbacks and they come in at many levels. If you neglect these, or if I, even my assumptions already about this behavior of infected individuals, are probably going to lead to an outcome that may or may not reflect reality or let's say less reflect reality than my toy does already. All right. What I want to now think about in general, there's going to be In general, there's going to be implications on steady states and transition paths. In the steady state, we get an implicit system. And again, this implicit system is not easily separable. You can't, I cannot, even with that fairly simple transmission function, trying to boil this thing down into a simple representation where I've got i n on one side or x on one side and everything else on the right. Side and everything else on the right, and I can think about things clearly isn't possible. And this is in the simplest setting that I could think of to model here. When we have this steady state, this is what that Euler or that behavioral rule really gives us. Okay, so this is the implication of the behavioral rule evaluated at the steady state. That marginal benefit term is the declining curve here in blue. My expected future. Blue. My expected future marginal costs, in this case, it's just expected, or it's just the marginal costs, I guess, the steady state. They increase as you increase exposure at low levels of exposure, cut the marginal benefit curve, but then backward bend down. And they backward bend down because of this probability, this effect on the marginal probability. Now, there's some real implications of this. We would call this the creation. The creation of a non-convict convexity in the decision rule. And for those of you who can remember, principles of micro or macroeconomics, we drew everything with linear demand and supply curves. This would be where you had a non-linear supply curve that backward bended and you'd have two intersections. Don't typically deal with these things. And we don't like these things because they mess with economic incentives. So exposure, that exposure of susceptibles is along this horizontal axis. Susceptibles is along this horizontal axis, marginal benefits, marginal costs on the top. And in between these two, around these two equilibrium points that we have here, where marginal benefits equal marginal costs, we've got what I'm calling behavioral changes. And why I'm trying to explain this to you guys is that while we're interested in those equilibrium points, we're also really interested in what are the incentives if you're off of equilibrium, do you move to that equilibrium? Do you move to that equilibrium? Like, is there a natural economic incentive to come to this point or to move away? Now, listen: so, in this region, region one, here, the marginal benefit curve is higher than the marginal cost curve. So, your marginal benefits from more exposure outweigh your marginal costs. You should increase exposure. You're going to come to this point from the left. However, if you were to be out here in region two, okay, then in this region, your marginal costs This region, your marginal costs are higher than your marginal benefits, and you would reduce your exposure. So you would come back to this point. So this would be, in an economic sense, the economic incentives would be pushing us both directions to this point. Point XH here is what's this high equilibrium point is what's a problem. Because to the left of it, you're going to move away from it, right? And to the right, marginal benefits now are greater than marginal costs. You're going to move to the right of it. To move to the right of it. So it looks to be like unstable, right? Or have the kind of characteristics where you wouldn't come back to that point. Now, this in a static world would be a real issue, but we're talking about a dynamic world here. And actually, if you change X, you're going to change prevalence, and then you're going to bounce back and forward. So when you think about how these choices resonate to when, let's say, the stability of these points. Of these points, and I'm just going to focus on the high equilibrium point here. If, for example, you were to initially be at this H, XH, this point that I'm circling, and you were to, for some reason, lower your degree of exposure, all right? If you lowered that degree of exposure, right, then your prevalence would fall. Prevalence falls, your marginal cost curve would shift. And I've just sketched this. Let's say your marginal cost curve shifts like this. Curve shifts like this. So if you move from this point into this region, this marginal cost curve is shifted. Then in this region, marginal benefits are greater than marginal costs, and you would transition back to this point. Same thing if you were to be off in this direction and your marginal cost and you were to, let's say, have a higher than that equilibrium exposure. Then you're exposing yourself more, prevalence would rise, marginal costs would rise. Okay, and then your marginal costs would be higher than your marginal benefits, and you could see the forces. Could you see the forces? So, the economic incentives here in the dynamic setting could actually point you back towards that equilibrium if you're thinking about allowing for the natural system to respond to the human choices. So, again, you know, I think that for our viewpoint, that's a clear reason of why you'd want to be able to, from an economist standpoint, account for these intertemporal changes in terms of the. Changes in terms of the dynamics of the disease. So, what I want to do is kind of take this framework and say, hey, listen, if you've got this interdependent system where these equilibria and transitions matter and they matter in a two-way feedback setting, what are the implications of policies that are designed to lower the transmission probability or this mixing by infecteds? All right, so just think of, I'm gonna really just try to say, what are the implications of public policies? Of public policies, like we saw this last year, was try to get people to expose themselves less without no price. I'm just going to force people to expose themselves less. And this is going to, we're going to see it leads to changes in these equilibria and the transition paths. Here's what it does. I just did this for lowering lambda from lambda is a 0.05 over on the left to this 0.0. Sorry, so 0.5 to 0.05. These are three different levels. These are three different levels of lambda. And what I want you to see is: so, this is just me going back to two graphs ago with a specified model. For this higher level of transmission, lambda 0.5, I've got the two equilibrium points one and two. For an intermediate level of transmission, so if I had to just, let's say, cut that 0.5 down to 0.15, my potential equilibrium points are 0.3 here and 0.4 in here. And 0.4. And then, if I have a really low transmission, I actually only have one equilibrium here. It's at this point five, and the other one there, there on the corner. So I just wanted you to say that when, or wanted to show you is that when you do lower these lambdas or these transmission probabilities, you get different equilibria, right? Now, what we're interested in is what are their stability characteristics. Now, here I'm going to, this is a graph of the prevalence on the vertical. A graph of the prevalence on the vertical axis for this lambda parameter. Hey, so first things first, in a model without endogenous human behavior, you wouldn't get two endemic equilibria. You'd get a single endemic equilibrium. And so if you think of if you add the human behavior, it's it for these parameters, it splits them in two. Okay, so we would have a bifurcation there. We have this lower equilibrium levels of prevalence associated with that point one at the land. That 0.1 at the lambda of 0.5, or the or this higher equilibrium two here. And both of those, one and two, so and I kind of treated these as my base case, they're both actually saddle path stable. Now, saddle path in a partial, this is a partially controlled system. These are really, for an economist, these are great equilibria because what they say is that you've got a single unique path into an equilibrium. Okay. And these are typically going to converge, let's say, um. Converge, let's say, quite fast, if you will. Now, as I lower that transmission parameter or alpha to the second set of equilibrium conditions, which would be three, equilibrium three and four, my lower equilibrium, which is the one that has associated with low exposures, that actually remains the saddle path stable. But the upper equilibrium, which has lots of prevalence, becomes indeterminate, which again just means no more unique. Which again just means no more unique path. Any path into that, any path will work into that equilibrium point. By the way, if you keep lowering lambda, you can get a max exposure and stable on that upper equilibrium. It doesn't change the lower. But that's prevalence, right? So prevalence, you lower transmission. And by the way, what we see here is when we lower transmission, the prevalence for this lower equilibrium goes down and the prevalence slightly. Go down, and the prevalence slightly actually goes up for this upper equilibrium just because of the scale of me putting the both of them on the graph. Is that that's not too apparent? But the real deal, what's going on here is this, you've getting a change in choices by people. And this, again, these are the susceptible choices. So initially, we were at the equilibria one or two, the lower equilibrium or the upper equilibrium, and then we lowered lambda. When you lower lambda, right, the lower equilibrium. Right, the lower equilibrium number of choices increases, but the upper equilibrium number or not choices, exposure, the degree of exposure really increases a lot. And the key thing I want you to see here is that that what we also have is a change while the lower equilibria stays saddle path, unique path, stable, the upper that upper equilibrium turns into being an indeterminate path. Okay. And Okay, and there's some implications on the contact rate. Now, I got to be really careful with this crew on how I define the contact rate. And in this setting, it's the adequate, so I'm going to define my contact rate as the average number of adequate exposures per person per unit time for the infection to be transmitted. All right, so it's that ratio of P over IN in this model, or that probability of being infected divided by. Of being infected divided by the proportion infected. And what's really key here is that as you lower that transmission parameter, the contact rate at that lower equilibrium outcomes, which remain stable, actually increases. And increased contact rates in this definition are good, right? Because they mean that people can be out there and they can expose themselves more without that, without becoming. Without becoming infected. Lower contact rates are problematic because those are the cases, right, where you don't have to expose yourself very much and you get nailed. And that's what happens at that upper equilibrium with these indeterminate paths. So this upper versus lower equilibrium path or equilibrium deal is problematic. We do see that your value of being at the upper, at the lower equilibrium in either case. equilibrium in either case is higher than the than being at that lower equilibrium so we'd really want to be at that lower that lower equilibrium so lower exposures right lower prevalences and higher equal and and higher values if you will now the question is is how do you ensure yourselves that you're going to be there all right and i don't know i don't know i'm going to talk about that later here first though About that later. Here, first, there are some dynamic implications. If we move from equilibrium one to three, it's a nice smooth convergence. If you moved, so at that, if you move from the lower, if you have people, if you're able to keep people on those lower, around those lower equilibria where their exposures are lower, it's a smooth, easy convergence from that first equilibrium to the second, if you will. Then, however, if you're on the high, so people are out there exposing themselves like crazy, it's a wild ride. It's a tremendous. It's a wild ride. It's a tremendous amount of change in prevalence over time. And even, and you still, you know, you don't actually increase that equilibrium prevalence very much, but it's a wild ride getting from one to the other. A lot of variability, a lot of volatility. Same thing in terms of choices or your exposures, right? If we are able to keep people at this low, these low equilibria, lower exposure, lower exposure equilibria, then nice smooth convergence. However, if they're at that upper Smooth convergence. However, if they're at that upper one, again, it's a wild ride with big changes in exposures over time. Okay. The take-home message here, and this is where I looked at the discounted, basically the expected welfare following paths from one, from either that low or the high situation, is you want the low exposure equilibria. Even though we do have this potential, right, as I said, for. Do you have this potential, right? As I said, for this instability on those high equilibria, it still does improve welfare, but you have big swings in terms of changes in exposures and changes in prevalence over time. However, being at the lower always beats being at that higher. I talk a little bit about the means and the standard deviations, but I'm basically almost out of time. And what I really wanted to kind of talk to you guys about is that, listen, these results. Is that listen? These results are specific to this SIS model with the specification of susceptible behavior and the specification of infected behaviors, right? However, it is clear that just including those behavioral changes and having rationale behind those behavioral changes and reflecting the two-way feedbacks really does change the characteristics of the systems. All right. And so to me, that's one important take-home message. Secondly, Take-home message. Secondly, this potential for multiple endemic equilibrium, where you're considering enacting policies on freely choosing people, right? So what are the implications of putting, of lowering, of, let's say, implementing lockdowns or stay-at-home type policies, right? You've really got to reflect the fact that people are also making decisions on top of that. You might think that you're able to. You might think that you're able to actually really reduce their natural rate of exposure. But even in the low equilibrium case, here, if you lower that transmission probability, people are going to want to. They know the transmission probability, they know the chance they're going to get infected goes down. They're going to expose themselves more. People are smart, right? And this is why in the basically, I haven't talked about it, but in the eradication equilibrium variant of this model, it's always. This model, it's always unstable. Because to get people to reduce their exposures enough to actually eradicate this kind of a disease, you have to have them reduce their exposures by something like over 80%. And you have to have them reduce their exposures until the disease is gone. Because listen, as soon as that probability, as soon as those numbers, as soon as the proportion infected gets really low, no one thinks they're going to get infected. So they're out and about. They expose themselves like crazy. Out and about, they expose themselves like crazy, and again, you know, just reflecting these two kinds of behaviors. All right, then, thirdly, I do think, though, that if you were to account for people's endogenous willingness to care for others into these models, it would bring that back that, it would scale back that impact of behavioral choices, right? Behavioral choices, right? Because as soon as you were to allow for people having a cost of their behavior on other people's welfare, and Eli's written several papers on this, if you were to account for that in people's decision making, then they would have an incentive to reduce their exposure. And if they have an incentive to reduce their exposure, they would just won't, you know, like it's like an extra cost to them of exposing themselves if we were to include that. And that probably is, let's say, a reflection of what we've seen this last year. We've seen this last year. But, all right, and then last thing I'd like to say: you know, in these multiple endemic situations with this, you know, potential for these wild rides that I was just simulating there, the only thing I could think of that you could do to avoid this, because you're not a central planner here. You're not putting people at the low exposure equilibrium, right? You've got to, this is probably the role for education. This is probably the role for education, right? And so, saying, and so, and we see this in certain societies across the globe. Like, people, if I'm thinking of many times being in airports and people from Asia who have dealt with many of these things more recently, they've been wearing masks for 15 years, and especially maybe around us. But these kinds of like, can you encourage people to take these measures so that these quote-unquote exposures or however you want to. Exposures, or however you wanted to measure this, are always, let's say, fairly low. And if you can do that, right, and so you can get those exposures low, then the changes in these equilibria won't be such a wild ride or resources get wasteful because you're actually already at like a transitioning from a good equilibrium to another good equilibrium. I'm just kind of worried about these transitions from bad equilibriums to even worse equilibria, or the even worse equilibria or this wild ride. Equilibria or this wild ride. And in the western United States, you see this chance big time because a lot of people are just refusing, let's say, to extract themselves from society in risky situations. I think I'm at 3.42. Did I go two minutes over? I apologize. Oh, no, you're good. Okay, sorry. Thank you for that great talk. Thank you for that great talk. It looks like there's a couple of questions in the chat. So we can start with Simon asking about discount factor. Yeah, actually, can you hear me, David? I can. I can. Yeah, thanks very much. Towards the end, you talked about pro-sociality, basically, right? But this is a coordination game. And there's an advantage. If I want to. There's an advantage. If I want to see the epidemic reduced, it benefits not only other people, it might benefit me too. So I didn't look like that was in the utility function earlier on. When individuals make a decision, it's sort of instantaneous, not looking to what effect am I going to have on the outbreak. Is that right? No, they see their effect on the outbreak and how that directly affects them. Directly affects them, but they and so they see the full system dynamics, but in this model, but they do not care if their decision increases the chance, say, other people get infected. So, your point about the coordination type problem, they're basically ignoring the spillover of their choices on other people. But again, like I was saying, I think that's Five years ago, I would say that I think that's how most people are. And I don't, I think I'm wrong. I think that I'm staggered by how much people actually voluntarily change their behavior, come in, and Eli's got great data that he's looked at, people's patterns of behavior last year. People instantaneously change their behavior. Now, most of that, it might have been in terms of their own. Most of that, it might have been in terms of their own probability, but it also might have just been. I mean, I know me and everybody I talk to. It's you're thinking about your extended family and friends of family, right? And so your point would be, if I was to do that, I'd have to bring in how my choices affected the value function or the chances other people are transitioning into other states. And discounted. Yeah. Because those benefits, those Because those benefits, those benefits are going to be sometime in the future. Yeah. Yeah. Although, what's interesting with the kind of diseases we're dealing with now, maybe not so far. Right? Because if it's like, at least with these, I mean, this thing's, it's ripping through us, right, really quickly. Maybe, maybe, maybe not so far. But to me, that, how do you bring that in? And then how do you bring in who cares about who? It just makes my About who, it just makes my mind go to mush. Yeah, well, when you do that, you're going to need a heterogeneous model that has at least two political parties. No, I agree. I agree. But for me, what would be interesting and like the key thing here is so all of these, I've, I mean, and you guys have probably all read tons of these papers this year about the optimal, the optimal time of the lockdown policy and the optimal this and the optimal that. Policy and the optimal this and the optimal that. And what they're doing is they're trying to pick basically these optimal transition parameters, right? But they are not reflecting the fact that people are responding themselves. And so whether or not that's going to lead you to more strict or less strict lockdowns in what you should have, but it's certainly going to lead to something that's different than these models that reflect how people actually behave to this and can and also. And also, not only how, but it just means it's a way more complicated problem, I think, than what a lot of people are dealing with. And just so everybody is on the same page, your standard run-of-the-mill economist who's messing with these models is they're really not integrating economics and let's say epidemiology or math biology. They're basically taking a compartmental model and throwing it into an optimization problem. An optimization problem and still acting as though there really aren't people making decisions in that model. And I think your point about the pro-social nature is really being omitted in a lot of these. And if policy is being informed by them, that could be problematic. Thanks very much, Sadia. So it looks like the next question was from Chris. The next question was from Chris. Oh, yeah, just a methodical question about your equation for V sub T and how do individuals compute their future valuations? Do you back calculate or how are they doing that? They are, we're basically giving them complete information and knowledge to all time periods. So it's a recursive system. So we're basically So we're basically saying that they know the link between this period and the next over all periods, and letting them take that into account. So if you've got that kind of two-period recursion and you've always got that two-period recursion, then they're able to trace through the entire consequence of their decision on the future. Does that make sense? Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thanks. So, maybe one more question, Nina. It looks like you brought up a couple of things. Does someone save these chats? Yeah, I've been cutting them down. Good, good, good. Oh, I think I've just been sort of chatting with folks about altruism. So, I think the, I guess, hi. David, thank you for such a lovely talk. I think the things we've been chatting about about altruism, I would argue that perhaps. About altruism, I would argue that perhaps it's because sometimes altruism can be formulated nicely as non-linear, as a non-linear function. And so preventing larger numbers of people from getting infected may actually not be simply the summation of prevented infections. But I think David had already pointed out that picking some nonlinear functions are already tricky when you start with basic economic models. So maybe I. So, maybe I it was less a set of questions and more. Would you care to opine? Yeah, no, I completely um agree with that. And whether you call it altruism or not, I think for me, the key thing would be, do you think people care about other people in ways that my model neglects, right? And if so, then we would want to bring that into the behavioral rule. I don't think we would choose a function, I think we'd want to bring in how we think. How we think that that care of people influences. So, basically, how we could bring into their optimization problem other people's or the effects on other people. And I think this is done in other contexts, you know, quite a lot, but not so much this context. And I can see why from the complexity. But I think, I guess, my main point is that they're already. I guess my main point is that they're already complex. If it's neglecting something that's I mean, Eli is probably going to say, but is it important? I'm sure he wrote that somewhere. But is it important? Well, no, I mean, I was thinking about this why, and I really liked your model. I'm going to jump in here because like I want to. But the no, I really like the model. And I got thinking about this and I sent you a little note about this. But I think the way to build in altruism, and I never thought. In altruism, and I never thought about it until I saw Dave present today: is you basically use something that looks like Fair Schmidt preferences, but only on the capital gains term. And I was like, oh, that's really cool. That's really cool. And as Dave's talking, I'm thinking about this. And Nina, this is where I sort of chimed in is that if the altruism is only operating on the capital gains term, then my question is, does it actually quantitatively qualitate? Certainly it matters quantitatively, but if all Quantitatively, but if all it does is increase the cost of the future, the cost of your infection, would it lead to qualitatively different dynamics? And I don't know, but I'm trying to think through whether or not the altruism is acting only on the capital gains term or if it's also acting on the dividends term in those value functions. So, just quickly, I think one could specify it. I think one could specify it either way. I think, in terms of the simplest way, it would typically be just on the probability, and you take the capital gains as given. That's what you're basically saying. You would influence the chance that they move into those states. However, you could see how those could influence the value of those states. I mean, in this setting, that wouldn't be economic altruism, right? That wouldn't be like a Fair Schmidt preference because the preference should actually account for people's value functions. Yeah. People's value functions, yeah, but right, like that's the i mean, that would be the economic definition of altruism. I don't know, whatever, but if you have people that care about other people's whatever, relative states in nature here, I think you could say, you know, I think your point is, do they see how the derivative would go through the value function or not? And the simplest first way would say, I would say no, but then that you might say, But then you might say that that's not altruism, and you'd have to say that you'd have to account for the fact that not only does it change the probability that they get that capital gains, it also changes what they get in the end, which actually I would think in a recursive system it would take into account. But I don't know. It's interesting. Might be worth looking into, sir. So let's take a break right there for two and a half minutes, and we can pick up the discussion then. So thanks again. Discussion then. So, thanks again. If you have a second, I'll chat with you about this because I got to run. I can't stay for that conversation. Yeah, I'll stay on right now for sure. Um, and Nina, if you want to stay too, that'd be great. But no, I was just thinking while you were doing this, I was trying, because I've been struggling with this for years of how do you get something that looks like altruism into these models and why would anyone care? And I think the question is: there's two issues. One is, do you have enough infectives in your population to matter? So, this has always been a problem with these models. This has always been a problem with these models: is that once you become infected, you should not reduce your contacts at all. Right? You should be like, woohoo! Like, I am, I've paid the sunk cost of getting sick. And that's the corner. That is the corner that I impose, but I'm not sure that's real. No, no, no. Well, I think that I think you need, so I think the thing that I haven't seen done is you don't have ACE, I haven't seen one of these bioeconomic versions of these models with asymptomatics that. With asymptomatics that feel fine and would behave that way if they knew they were sick under a purely selfish objective, right? And people who are just sick and feel like crap and want to stay home, which is how we modeled it, Dave, in the past. Exactly, exactly. But the question always has been here, Nina, you can probably tell us, like, your point is, is this worthwhile? Is this big enough to care about? I have this sneaky suspicion with this, with at least one. With this, with at least what we've seen this last year, yes. But that's altruism from susceptibles over other susceptibles. And so I think from infecteds over. Oh, good point, good point, good point. I get you. I get you. I get you. I get you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, Jim. It could be across anybody. So, so I think also there's a point that you're both skirting around that isn't that isn't implicit yet in what you're saying. I'm sorry, explicit yet in what you're saying, which is you're assuming a single round game. And if what you're doing, Round game. And if what you're doing also is setting expectations for the behavior of what altruism looks like socially in the next round, then failure to, then incorporating both that cost and that dividend into personal expectation is still very self-centered as an alignment of altruism with self-interest in an iterative game. You're assuming a small number of players, right? I mean, like, that's no, actually. Right? I mean, like, that's no, actually. No, because the idea of how people play propagates, right? So, so just imagine a gigantic game right now, and people not staying home is, in fact, not altruistic because it's potentially infecting others. But there's also that potential of in the future aligning with the same idea of behavior and you being the person infected by someone else not staying home. And so if you're And so, if you're incorporating an idea of altruism, you may as well incorporate an idea of understanding of the altruistic behavior. And if you do that, then this gets rid of a lot of the disconnect between what is self-interest and what is altruism. And then the formulation is actually both simpler to calculate around, but also, I think, also more reflective of how people actually deal. The reason we're seeing lots of bad behavior right now is that we also have social norms that allow it, right? There's an in fact a movement saying it's your responsibility to behave badly. Movement saying it's your responsibility to behave badly if you would like to. But if we take that away, if we say, you know, there's no social permission.
