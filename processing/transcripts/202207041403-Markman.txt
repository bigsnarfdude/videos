Okay, I wish I was in beautiful bath. So let me start with defining what are irreducible holomorphic cycletic manifolds. Generalities on irreducible holomorphic simple active manifolds. So an irreducible holomorphic and irreducible holomorphic irreducible here is in a different sense holomorphic symplectic manifold is simply connected compact we are mainly interested in projective case but we will use the formation theory that in a crucial way that goes through a non-algebraic so we consider a simply connected compact Keller Manifold X, such that the global holomorphic two forms on X, the space is one-dimensional spanned by a symplectic form. So it's everywhere non-degenerate, holomorphic to form. And And let me call this one and two an irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold. So it's irreducible in the sense that the space of holomorphic two-form is one-dimensional. If it was higher-dimensional and it was holomorphic symplectic by a theorem of Boville, it will split up to an etal cover as a Cartesian product of such a reduced. Of such irreducible x. So it's a different notion of irreducibility. So such a manifold X is said to be of K3N type if X is the formation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme. This is the Hilbert scheme. Of length and subscripts on the K3 surface. So it's the resolution of the symmetric product of a K3 surface. These are one sequence of examples. The point is that the moduli space of such a Hilbert scheme is one-dimensional higher than that of K-3 surfaces. So the general such X is not. So, the general such X is not the Hilbert scheme of any K3 surface. Now, there are other examples constructed out of Tori, and there are two examples due to O'Grady. So, much of what I'll say will work for every reducible holomorphic syplectric manifold. But the last thing I'll say works only for K3M type. So, and I'm working now on the Gelaz-Kuhmer type, which are constructed out of a billion surfaces. Out of a billion surfaces. Now, let's see what I want to see next. Yeah, so definition: let X be a compact Keller manifold a class alpha in the rationale. In the rational cohomology of X is said to be analytic if alpha belongs to the subling subalgebra Over Q generated by churn classes of coherent complex coherent analytic sheaves. So, this could be the structure sheaf of an analytic sub-variety, or it could be a holomorphic vector bundle. Holomorphic vector bundle of the x. And so this is the definition of analytic and remark. Oops, if X is projective, so you see chunk classes are defining the chowing by a Gotham Rick. So if X is projective, then analytic is the same as algebraic. So, if we can all um and there is one more thing that I need to remind you. Um, so this is a fact that x be two n-dimensional, it's a these manifolds, reducible homomorphic simple manifolds are simple, two even dimensional. Are even dimensional because they are symplectic. So two m-dimensional irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifold, then there exists a unique symmetric integral bilinear pairing. Nondegenerate and primitive, so indivisible pairing, it's called the Bovil-Bogomolo-Fujiki pairing on the second cohomology, integral second cohomology of X, and it's characterized by. And it's characterized by that if you take two classes, this is for any class in the second integral cohomology, if you pair it with itself with respect to this Boguil-Bogomolo pairing and take the nth power, then this is some positive rational constant C called the Fuji. constant c called the Fujiki constant times the the integral over x of the the 2nth power of alpha x is real fourn-dimensional and so this polynomial on um degree 2n polynomial on the second cohomology of x is actually actually has an nth root which is a symmetric bilinear pairing and it plays a crucial role in the in the theory um Theory. And for example, the first thing that shows me its importance is Gerbitsky's Dolly's theorem. Just a second. It says that this Hodge structure on H2 almost determines X up to X up to by rational class. So let x and y be irreducible information equivalent. So I won't write it because it will be, it will follow from another thing that they'll say. Irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds and f from the second cohomology of x to the second cohomology of y with into Y with integer coefficients be a parallel transport operator. That means that there exists some family over a connected base and two points and a path between them such that the two fibers over the two points are X and Y and parallel transport in the Gauss. And parallel transport in the Gauss-Mani local system for second cohomologies along this path will induce F. That's what parallel transport mean. But we also assume that F is a parallel transport operator and a hodgeomorphism. It's necessarily an isometry with respect to the Bovil-Bogomolo-Fujiki pairing because it's parallel transport operator and this is a topological invariant. This is a topological invariant, so it's in preserves under Tale transport. So we also assume it's a Hodge isomorphism. Then the theorem says that X and Y are bimeromorphic. In fact, more is true. So then there exists exists this. This uses results of Hubert in the product of X and Y. So, you know, if X and Y were K3 surfaces, then F is up to composing with reflections by minus two curves. It's the graph of an isomorphism. In higher dimension, similar holds, there exists in a product and analytic cycle. Analytic cycle, I'll call it T of Q dimension equal to the dimension of X, which is also the dimension of Y, the deformation equivalent. Such one of each, one of the irreducible component irreducible components is the graph of a Is the graph of a biomoromorphic map? And if you look, if you take consider the correspondence induced by Z on cohomology, so you know. On cohomology, so you know, pullback from X, Ka product with the class of Z and the Gissing map to the cohomology of Y. This, sorry, let me change it to 2 is F. So F is induced by an analytic cycle, so F is analytic. So the Bitski storage theorem implies that the bits. Verbitsky's Torelli theorem implies that any parallel transport operator, which is a Hodge isometry, it's necessary as an isometry, is so Hodge isometries, which are parallel transport operators are analytic. That follows from Verbitsky's toilet. Yes. I just have a quick question. You're in the middle of a sentence, I can wait. Go ahead. Okay. Can you comment on what? Okay, can you comment on why two is the right number there for the cohomology? So one reason is you'll see that more is true. I'm going to rephrase, first I'll state the main theorem, then I'll rephrase it in a way that too is less central. But the point is that it behaves like It behaves like H2 is a naturally in has a natural pairing. So H2 with this pairing is a very rich invariant. That's what it says. But you'll see. I think that I'll indirectly answer your question. Thank you. So let me state. I think I can almost state the main tool. So, so I'm sorry. So, the question is: When Shafarevich and Piateski Shapiro proved the famous Torilitum for K-3 surfaces, then in the International Congress for Mathematicians, Shafarevich asked the question, what happens if you have X and Y K surfaces? What happens if you have a rational Hodgeometry? So Hodge Zeometry of the rational second cohomologies, is it necessarily algebraic when X and Y are conjecture? And this was answered by Mukai. I'll get to the I'll get to the history in a second once I state the theorem. So, section two would be the main statement of the main theorem, but I need a few definitions. So, first definition. First, I need to define the shifted degree. So, say X and Y are two n-dimensional. Two n-dimensional. They could be compact Keller now, but so one. So, first, I want to define the shifted degree. So, this is something commonly used. You must have seen it. Maybe I'll just see. So, HK, the shifted degree K cohomology shifted by 2n, this is the dimension. By 2n, this is the dimension, is simply defined to be H2n plus K. So, and this is the shift. So, middle cohomology, which is H2N, has shifted degree zero and two. And two homomorphism, let's say f from the cohomology of x rational coefficient to the cohomology of y is degree reversing. This is what I define. If F takes the shifted cohomology of degree K to the shifted cohomology into the shifted cohomology of degree minus K. So this will play a central role. And so now I can state the main theorem. Main theorem. It's the only result here, but I'll state a stronger version of this theorem answering your question. Was it Max? Okay. Thank you for recognizing that voice. Let X and Y be irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds of K3 and type. And F from H2 rational coefficients now to H2YQ and Hodgeometry. Then there exists There exists an analytic correspondence F tilde from the total cohomology of X to the total cohomology of Y, such that one of the two Of the following holes, there are two cases. So, the first is F tilde. Oh, by the way, analytic correspondence means that there is a class in the cohomology of the product such that we can consider it as a. As a correspondence, it induces this linear homomorphism. So, F tilde is degree-preserving and restricts to H2 as F So, you see, I'm stating in the theorem that it's analytic, so F is analytic as a consequence. And the second case is that F tilde is degree reversing and F is a scalar multiple. Color multiple of the composition. So it's the following composition. You go from H2 X and you cup product with the second churn class of X to the power n minus one. So if So, if X and Y are K3 surfaces, N is one, and you're not doing in this step anything, but you're going to X to the cohomology of degree 4N. So did I say that they are two dimensional? Yeah, of K-they and type, so they're two-dimensional minus two. Oops. And now F tilde is degree reversing, so you go to H2O. Reversing, so you go to h2 of y, and the statement is this: this composition is a scalar multiple of f. So, in particular, f is analytic. And if one of x or y is projective, then the other is projective, and f would be actually algebraic. So, that's the main theorem. The rest of the class, of the class, of the lecture, I'll try to, I'll explain it, but I'm going to restate it in another language that explain where this F tilde comes from. But first, let me remark about the history. So, history of this when n equal one. When n equal one, this is. One when n equals one, this is the case of k-trist surfaces. So um, so Mukai in 1987, 84 proved it in the case where x is projective and the Picard number of x is at least 11. And then we cool in using just a Using just lattice theoretic arguments in 87. Again, X is projective and a Picard, it's enough that it's at least five. And then my former student, Buskin, in 2015 proved it in general for all K3 surfaces, Kerala K3 surfaces, so not necessarily algebraic. And in 2017, Hui Brecht proved it in the case where X is projective with no restriction on the Picard number. So it has a long history. It's this solution to the Shafarevich conjecture. Okay, so. Okay, so now I'm going to restate restatement of the main theorem. Let's see, in terms of so there are new words here, terms of the Loemcha. Loewemka Lunz Lebitski equivariance of Wijemkai transforms. So it will take us a while to restate it, but this is a tutorial on extremely important new results of Talman on equivalences of the art categories of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. So here it is. So, first, what is the LLV lattice? So, the LLV lattice is not a lattice, it's a rational vector space that admits a lattice structure that I will ignore. So, the rational, so it's a LLV lattice of an irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifold. its symplectic manifold x is so first as a vector space it's the only it's if x is a k3 it's just a mukai lattice so it's the total cohomology of x i'll use it with rational coefficient but in general it will be will we are adding two classes to h2 so this is the Now, here, alpha and beta are isotropic. So, I'm giving a bilinear pairing here, symmetric. Isotropic. They are orthogonal to H2. I won't write it. And the pairing, restrict to H2 as the BDF pairing. So that's the rational LLV lattice, so just a vector space. Now, the point is that the co-mod, well, there are a lot of this lattice is extremely important. So the next definition is the LLV algebra. Lorcha Lonsborobitski. Lonzo Bitski algebra this algebra of again of this did you say what alpha paired with beta is sorry maybe you said it depended here no it's just uh symbols uh but if it's a lattice we need to pair alpha with beta yeah yeah yeah alpha beta is a minus one thank you okay thanks yeah yes uh the the element The LLV algebra is a sub-algebra of the endomorphism of the cohomology ring of X with rational coefficients generated by all SL2 triples. And now I'm going to define what are SL2 triple E, H and F now H. F now H is the grading operator. It's fixed, depends on your next acting on the subspace of shifted degree K by K, multiplication by K. Uh, k multiplication by k. So it's a degree operator, degrading operator. And now E is E lambda, where lambda is a class in H2X and it's non-isotropic and the F is the Is the unique, it exists if because alpha is non-isotropic, it's not devious, but it's not hard. The unique element endomorphism of this vector space, the total cohomology, satisfying the SL2 relations. So F, just a second, so H. Just a second. So H it has degree minus two and E F is H. By the way, this is independent of F, but H E is, sorry, it's minus 2F. HE is 2e because E is coupled with a class of degree 2, so E has degree 2 as an endomorphism. So these are the SO2 relations. Now you let Relations now, you let gamma vary and you get a collection of SL2 triples. These are the SL2 triples appearing in the Lipschitz hard lips theorem if lambda is an ample class or a Kerler class. And you take the algebra generated by all these SL2 sub-algebras, and this is the LLV algebra. And Verbitsky proved a theorem. There exists a canonical graded isomorphism from the orthogonal algebra of the LLV lattice. Of the LLV lattice to the LLV algebra. And now what does graded mean? So we have a here we have H, the grading operator. And here we have H tilde. H tilde is the grading operator. So Graining operator. So let me just mention this has a degree minus two. This is we define degree zero. And this is degree two, like as if it was the cohomology of a K3. And H tilde acts on each graded summon by multiplication by its degree. And the statement is that this is this isomorphism, I'll call it maybe raw, maps H tilde to A. maps H tilde to H and that's Valbitski's theorem and now I can state Teilman's recent theorem so this theorem put it in the mid 90s theorem or early 90s theorem this is recent two or three years ago Tileman so he observed that let X and Y be he generalized this result of Mukai He generalized this result of Mukai. Mukai observed that the equivalences of the R categories act on the total cohomology as azometries, or the Mukai lattice as a dormitories. Talman says let X and Y be irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds and phi from the derived category of projective from the derived bounded derived category of X of coherent sheaves to the derived category. Achieves to the drive category of Y and equivalence. As Max taught us this morning, it has a Fourier Mukai kernel with Fourier Mukai kernel. Let's call it P, so it would be in the derived category of X cost Y and set phi. Phi, lowercase phi, to be we will take, we will take the chan character of the Fourier Mokai kernel and normalize it by the square root of the tod class of the product. And we consider it as a correspondence. So this goes from the cohomology of X to the cohomology of Y. Then, let me see. Okay, good. So, then the following holds. So, one, the first Talmud's main observation is the following. You have the LLV algebras of X and Y, and phi conjugates one to the other. So, if you take the LLV algebra of X and you compose it with phi. And you compose it with phi and yes, sorry, maybe phi inverse. It keeps and compose it with phi, this would be the LLV algebra of y. This is crucial. This is a beautiful observation. This has a, it follows that if you have an irreducible representation of the LLV algebra with multiplicity, Of the LLD algebra with multiplicity one in the cohomology of x and y, which is natural, then phi must take it to itself and so to the corresponding ones. So, or maybe I'll say first, there exists, this is related to exit, this is due to Verbitsky. There exists a Talman normalizing. There exists a Exists a let's see a functorial isomorphisms isomorphism of graded LLV algebra modules and psi sub x and it goes from okay so it goes from the sub algebra of the cohomology of x generated by H The cohomology of X generated by H2. I'll write it as SH, but this is the sub-algebra generated by H2. And this is a isomorphism. It has a grading coming from H, the grading of the cohomology. And this is, you take the ant symmetric product of the LLV lattice. Lattice, but you don't take the whole thing, you take an irreducible sub-modules of the LLV algebra. So, this is the subspace spanned by nth powers of isotopic classes. It's a well-known It's a well-known irreducible sub-representation of the symmetric representation of a lattice. And so this is an isomorphism. There is a grading from the from the induced by the grading of the LLV lattice. And three, this is no, okay, so this is this is yes. Can you say what you mean by the this composition in part one? This composition in part one on the left-hand side? It means element by element, it will take an element of the LLV algebra of x, which is inside the endomorphism of the whole cohomology, to an element of the LLV algebra of y. Okay? So the statement is that if you have an element, if you have an element f that's tilde here. tilde here then then phi inverse composed with f tilde composed with phi will belong to here okay this is an equivariance you see once you have this then you can regard you can regard the LLV algebra of X as acting Is acting on both the cohomology of x and y, and then phi is equivalent with respect to this Lie algebra module structure. That's why I call it LLV equivalence. And three is the following. There exists a so first of all, phi, this is a consequence of one. Phi takes this irreducible submodel that appears with multiplicity one. This is a sub-module for the LLV algebra precisely onto the corresponding irreducible sub-module of Y. It follows from part one. And now this is crucial. Maybe I'll write it in a different color. There exists a unique Unique. I'll need to add a comment here. Isometry, Hodge isometry H tilde phi would be a functor from the from the LLV lattice of X to the LLV lattice of Y. Y such that the following commutes so the point, so we have the following diagram, the following commutes. So you have the the the starboard generated The stabrick generated by, is that what I want to take? Yes. And then you have psi x to the symmetric, the nth symmetric power of the LLV lattice of x. And you have the corresponding one for y. And now we know that phi maps one to the other. One to the other, and what Talmud tells us is that, in fact, this, once you conjugate it by this psi, it's induced by an isometry of the LLV lattice. So, the action of derived equivalences on the total cohomology factors in some sense. Factors in some sense, at least it's restriction to the subject by H2 by an isometry of the LLV lattice. So this is commutative, and by the way, sorry, to the power n. So this is as I should say, sorry, the anthemetric power of this. And now you see that if n is even, then you are losing. So, this is unique up to sign if n is even. But it doesn't matter for us. Okay, so we have this H tilde. So, this is a partial answer to Max's question. You see that we almost got to H2. The LB lattice is just a little bit more information. Just a little bit more information than H2, and I'm going to now go to H2. But this is what Telemann gives us: that the action or the homological action of derived equivalences is hugely restricted. It is in some sense coming from this isometry of the LLV lattice. Let me give an example. This is important for us. Suppose. Suppose X and Y are K3 Phi P is a Fourier Mukai kernel. So the integral transform is an equivalence. This is part of the assumption. Such that I'm assuming two very restrictive things. One, the rank of P is, let's call it R, is positive. And two, the first churn class of P is zero. So actually, I know only one example. For example, X is equal to Y. Both are K3s. Both are K3s, and P is the structural shift of the diagonal. The ideal shift of the diagonal. So that's an example. But we will tinker with this in a second. Then let's see what happens to the LLB lattice, which is just the Mukai lattice now. Then, so we have an induced action. Induced action on the LLV lattice, which is the Macai lattice now. Phi, what does phi do to the element 0, 0, 1 in, this is in h tilde of x. Now we can work with integers. Oops. So you see, this is the Mukai vector of the skyscraper shift of a point. Of a point where the Mukai vector of a sheaf is just the churn character of a sheaf normalized by the squared of the toad class. So this is going to be the Mukai vector of the image of the skyscraper sheaf. But the image under the equivalence is just the restriction of the kernel to X cross Y. Cross y. And so the Mukai vector of this will be our rank. The first joint class will be zero because we assume that p has first joint class zero and some element s. But you see, this is isotropic. This vector is isotropic. And phi is an isometry, so this is isotropic. Isometry. So this is isotropic. But this implies that S is zero. So we conclude that phi of zero zero one is R zero zero. Now, what about phi inverse? Phi inverse is associated to, maybe I'll say first. Maybe I'll say first five, yeah, is associated to the Fourier Mukai kernel. You take the dual of P and shift by two and regard it as the integral transform in the reverse direction. And again, it has rank R and degree zero. And it's first change as zero. So phi inverse again takes zero zero one for the same reason to R zero zero. So So phi takes one zero zero, which is this class divided by r to zero zero one over r so pi is degree reversing. Because you see, remember 0, 0, 1, beta has degree minus 2, alpha is degree 2. So it interchanges alpha and beta. And it must send also the degree 0 subspace, which is the subspace orthogonal to both alpha and beta, to the subspace orthogonal to alpha and beta in Y, so to H2 of Y. So it agrees the same degree 0 to degree 0, so it's degree reversing. This is the crucial observation. It appeared already. Crucial observation. It appeared already in Buskin's thesis. And the point is that using Teilerman result, you can prove it also in higher dimensions as a similar, well, we'll see. So is this somehow saying that if you have one of these equivalences, a point object, I mean, a point on one side has to either go to something that's sort of supported at dimension zero or is full support and it can't be anything in between. So a point V. So, a point since the Fourier Mukai kernel is higher rank, a point goes to something of rank R, the same rank. But what I'm saying is that, in fact, the degree zero component of the Mukai vector is zero. And so it really interchanges the degrees. So, definition, I want to do it. So, now I can restate. Can restate, it will take a little more, but I can restate the main theorem in a language of groupoids. So, you see, if you consider derived equivalences, they form a groupoid. If they are derived auto equivalence, you get a group, but in general, you can compose them all only if the target is equal to the domain. And similarly, parallel transport operators form a group point if you if there are it's there. Groupoid. If you, if there are a parallel transport operator from X to itself, then you get monodromy group. But in general, you have the parallel transport group point. What I'm going to introduce is a group point consisting of both, because we want to get as many hodesometries as possible. So let G be the goopoid whose objects are the same as the G. Whose objects are irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. Morphisms in home from X to Y, if X and Y are not deformation equivalent, this would be empty, but if they are the form they are But if they are deformation equivalent, then this is defined compositions. So I'm giving a go point by providing generators. Compositions of two types of isomorphism phi from the total. Phi from the total cohomology of X to the total cohomology of Y. So type 1 would be what we get from the Torelli's theorem. So phi is a parallel transport operator. So in fact, it's defined on the Z. And a hodgeomorphism. So we know by the Torrelli theorem that phi is analytic. All morphism here will be induced by analytic correspondence two. Now this is going to be a mouthful, but the previous example motivates it. previous example motivates it so phi is going to be induced by a correspondence this correspondence on x across y will have a vector bundle p so it will be the churn character of p just as an example now i'm going to we want the first churn class to be zero so i'm going to normalize it i'll take minus I'll take minus its churn class, divided by its length, and I'll multiply by the churn character of the fractional line bundle that kills the first churn class of P times the square root, whoops, the square root of the third class of x cross y. I regard it as a correspondence, so it goes from the chromology of x. Goes from the cohomology of X to the cohomology of Y. Now, what do we assume about P? Oh, by the way, I'll call this cap of P. Now, cap of P is a natural characteristic class of the projective bundle. So, where P is locally free. So, it's a So it's a a possibly twisted coherent sheaf. So it's a twisted vector bundle. And so if you can ask what do you mean by chair and character of P if P is twisted? The point is the kappa of P is well defined even if P is twisted. And coherent chief. Coherent chief, but I need to say in a weaker sense, or one way of saying it is that P induces a derived equivalence of categories of twisted shifts, but I'll say it in a weaker sense. So, this twisted sheaf, so such that, sorry, this is a mouthful, but that's what it takes, such that the triple X. The triple x, y, and the projectivization of p, this projective bundle is at the formation of a triple x naught, y naught, the projectivization of p naught, and now where p naught is an untwisted untwisted a vector bundle on x naught cross y naught which is the Fourier kernel of an equivalence so that's a um that's I'm sorry that's what it takes this is a it it it's a natural good It's a natural group point in this context. And now, so again, remark that all morphism are induced by analytic correspondence. This correspondence is analytic into. This correspondence is an analytic correspondence. So if X and Y are projective, these morphisms in this coupoid are algebraic. And okay, definition let G Let G tilde. So we want to send these to Hodges dominant of H2, but we can't do it yet. What does Teilman give us? So it gives us that you have a function from this to the following group point. Let G tilde be the group point. How am I doing time? Okay. Whose objects are whose objects are again and and homorphism in in this will be isomothes of the L V lattice this need to be hojesometries. Need to be whole gezometries and so Talman theorem implies that we have a functor H tilde. You know, he sent he sends a You know, it sends an equivalence to a Hodge isometry of the LLB lattices. So, similarly, it generalizes to this groupoid, and you get that it sends phi to an isometry of the rational L V lattices. So, we have a functor from our groupoid to the groupoid of whose amorphisms are isometric, hoge isometries of the this is not. This is not nice. So we can send a morphism in our group or to a hogesometer of the LLV lattice. But now the example that I presented suggests, it generalizes to this, to the example that I suggested previously. Now you see this P doesn't have first-churn class zero, but we have a normalization that killed the first child class. That killed the first germ class. And this, it follows that this phi is degree reversing. It's amazing. But once you, these correspondences in two are degree reversing. So this is a crucial lemma. So a lemma if phi in the morphism in our main group point is degree reverse. Is degree reverse is of type two. So it's associated to a normalized Fourier Mukai kernel of positive rank. Then H tilde of phi is degree reversing. But you see, but the point is, so point is so so is phi because by Verbitsky's theorem the the the the grading operator of the LLV lattice is sent by by Verbitsky's map to the LLV algebra to the grading operator of the cohomology ring so if phi under if H tilde of phi under commute with the grading operator so is phi so phi is degree reversing this is rather remarkable that This is rather remarkable that we don't know how the art equivalents act on the cohomology, but this tells you that there is a normalization that is degree reversing. This is crucial. I have four more minutes. So the corollary, if this is degree reversing, so sorry, so corollary, we get We get a functor H tilde naught, I'll call it, from our groupoid to another groupoid, Hodge. And here, objects are irreducible homomorphic symplectic manifolds, and HOM in this is what we are looking for. Is what we are looking for as Hodge isometries from H2 of X. So this is an answer to Max questions. And we have a functor by restricting this. You see, F in our group point was either degree reversing or degree preserving. So either way, it's restricts to H. It restricts to H2, the degree zero summand of the LLD lattice as a whole geoisometry from H2 to H2. And we get, and so the theorem one restated is that, so I'm going to now, since I'm running out of time, you can now define the full subgroup points whose objects are of K3N type. Of KVN type, and then you get also a functor, and then the theorem too is that this functor is full. That means that it's a subjective homorphism. And now I'm I'm And now, since I'm running out of time, let me briefly say what are the new examples that we need. So the example are as follows. What morphism can I construct in our group, this G? So let S be a K3 such that the Picard of S. Such that the Picard of S is cyclic generated by an ample plus H and write H as 2RS. It's an even lattice where R is an S are positive. And we'll assume that R is at least 2. And let M be the moduli space of H stable sheaves of rank R, first joint class H. First joint class H and the third Mokai element in the Mokai vector S. Then you see that this is an isotopic vector by construction. And so the dimension is always the self-intersection plus two. So M is a K3 surface. Over M cross S, we have a universal bundle. So over the nth Cartesian product of M, cause the nth Cartesian product of S, we have a vector bundle, which is the exterior tensor product of U and And this is a naturally linearized linearized with respect to the symmetric group action of permuting the factors. So we get, and in fact, it induces the Cartesian exterior product of so this is the Fourier Mukai kernel of an equal The Fourier Mukai kernel of an equivalence of derived categories from Mn to Sn. Now it's equivariant because this opu Freemuka kernel is linearized. Maybe I'll write it here. Phi I'm I'm almost done. This is the I'm almost done. This is the key point. And now you see, we have the Bridge and King Reed derived equivalence of derived categories between the equivalent derived category of the Cartesian product and the derived category of the Hilbert scheme of S. And we have the inverse from the derived category of the Hilbert scheme of N and if you calculate And if you calculate, this is induced by a Fuyemukai Kermel, which I'll call it U bracket N, where this is a vector bundle of rank R to the N times N factorial. And so this is an example of something in our GooPoid that will give us a degree reversing. Degree reversing isomorphism. And then rational hodgeometry, which is not an integral hodgeometry on H2. What I want to say is that now the so there is a whole theory this is hyper holomorphic. It deforms with X, no, M and with the product of the Hilbert scheme diagonally over the moduli space, the whole moduli space. Moduli space of irreducible holomorphic syplectic manifolds of K3 and type. By projecting to one of the factors, you'll get every, you cannot deform it independently. The deformation needs to be compatible with the hog isometry induced. Once this is achieved, you can deform the pair, the triple. Pair the triple. So MN SN and this kernel deform everywhere. And this gives you enough generators for the group point to prove that our functor is full. And I'm done. I'm two minutes over time. I apologize for this. Thank you very much for your attention. Any other questions for y'all? I don't think I quite understood where the algebraicity of the correspondence on the total cohomology is coming from. Is that coming from somehow the role that the 45 kernel is playing? My kernel is playing. I didn't understand the question. Which algebra? You mean the LLV algebra? How are you getting the fact that the correspondence on the total cohomology is algebraic? Oh, because in my groupoid, in the definition of the groupoid, you see, either it's of this type. It's of this type, and by the theoretical to really theorem, the way I stated it, it's analytic. Okay, this is type one. In type two, this is algebraic. Even if it's twisted, this is algebraic. The way you prove it is you take the tensor product, you have the twisted shift P, you take. P you take its of rank r you take its r tensor product and you tensor it with its determinant twisted line bundle. The inverse of the determinant. This object is untwisted because you normalize it by the inverse of the determinant to kill the bower class. And so this is a coherent. Is a coherent vector bundle untwisted and it has churn character. Now take the rth root of this with the leading coefficient r, this would be the kappa class. So the kappa class is an rth root of an analytic class. It's the way we define it, it's in the ring generated by chunk classes of coherent analytic sheaves. Does that answer your question? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Okay, go ahead. Are there other questions for y'all? Let's thank him one more time, then. Thank you for your attention.
