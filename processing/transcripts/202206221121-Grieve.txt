Interesting ideas and recent results that sort of combine state-of-the-art techniques for rational points, state-of-the-art techniques for case stability, and ideas in toric geometry. And sort of when you mix them all together, it turns out that you can deduce instances of lawyers being conjectured. So I want to sort of describe sort of part of how that story works, as well as report on some other sort of interesting recent developments as well. Recent developments as well. So, just as some sort of context and motivation, so Diophantine arithmetic geometry, so there's sort of several points of departure, but for my purposes, I'm going to I'm going to appeal to the viewpoint of David McKinnon that complexity of rational points is measured on rational curves. And so, a picture that he's written on this board that he banned before is sort of something like this, where the idea is that you have a rational point, and the idea is to find a curve of best approximation that passes through it. And on the other hand, when we look at, you know, say birational geometry, so here the idea is. So here the idea is that rational curves make things more complicated. And so it's sort of understanding these interruptions which makes these questions challenging and interesting. This question is challenging and interesting. So what I want to talk about today is, so first comments about the subspace theorem. And the reason I want to start with the subspace theorem is. And the reason that I want to start with the subspace theorem is because it's sort of responsible for the advantage approximation technique, which I alluded to in the introduction. So then I want to talk about general Diphantine arithmetic inequalities. And so here, this is really the work of Min Rue and Paul Moise. And then finally, sort of the main conjecture and connections to case stability. And here the really important thing is the value of criteria of Vegeta and also work of me and others. Okay. So for the subspace theorem, sort of the general sort of setup is sort of conventions as in As in a text of Bobbier and Goebbels. So fix a number field so S finite set of places and so for all Places in S if we want to fix a collection of linearly independent linear forms. And so then what we want to do is we want to fix epsilon. What we want to do is we want to fix epsilon, we want to understand the nature of certain multiplicative Eiffelian inequalities. And we want to look for solutions outside of finite union of Crawford linear subspaces. So subspace theorem. So I'm given f block bigger than zero. bigger than zero, the set of points in projective space so set of with the property that the following in a polynomial is true. So, this lies in a finite unit or substance. Okay. So this is the sort of starting point that makes the sort of whole machine work. But I want to also mention briefly the parametric formulation, because one thing I want to sort of get at today is sort of what's really interesting in this story is the nature of this tiganti exceptional set. So a finite union of Bucker linear subject. Finite union of proper linear subspaces, and the extent to which one can study it, and the extent to which it sort of changes when one goes between various equivalent formulations of the subspace theorem. So as one example, so recall the parametric formulation. That involves twisted heights. So the twisted height they look at as follows. So Multiple questions. And I have to tell you what the Q is, and I have to tell you what the C is, and so I'll do that in a minute. So here, two is a number bigger than one. 2 is a number bigger than 1. The C V I's are real numbers. And the condition is that we sum to 0, I n 0 to n for fixed place. And so, as you mentioned, there's equivalent correlations of the subspace. Equivalent correlations of the subspace theorem, and it turns out that due to work of Egaris and Fretian, Shirlique, that the subspace theorem follows from the parametric subspace theorem. So the theorem Everest and she'll agree that the parametric Subspace theorem implies the inequalities of Albaltius and Whistle, and from that one can also deduce a subspace theorem. And as I said, some sort of remarks. So, give me some recent observations. So, this circle of ideas admits a logarithmic formulation. For linear series. And then when you do that, it's interesting to study the linear scattering of the Diphantine exceptional. Oh, the diagram. And so writing the twisted height function in this form, I think, should be suggestive about how one would start to formulate twisted height, logarithmic formulation of twisted height function, and then let the sort of local wave function. Machine to allow for one to establish basically these implications for linear series. And so that's an important progression of ideas that progress has been made making the arithmetic general theorem and these Diffantee results that I'll put emphasis on for that. So I just wanted to sort of mention this. More recent uh observations um as well today. Okay. So some guiding questions for the subspace theorem, as I've mentioned before, the nature of the Diphantine exceptional sets, optimal parametric type inequalities for points of bounded degree, and so this is something I'll say a little bit more about today as well. And then again, Diphantian arithmetic inequality. Different arithmetic inequalities for linear systems and properly intersecting divisors. And so, this is really the theorem of Rue and Boitho, which I'll explain today. So, okay. So maybe I should say now sort of what is the setup for general digital metabolologies. And so this was described briefly already this morning, and so I'll just make a few bit more sort of extensions to that. So let X be projective variety over a number field. And so let Let D be Cartet divisor on X and perhaps define over a finite extension of it. And And so I'll assume that x is geometrically integral. And so we can consider the proximity function, depending on our fixed set of places, and also our choice of Our choice of model wave functions. And so, as Hector mentioned this morning, one way of thinking about the local wave functions is that they record minus the log the addict distance to the device, right? So that's a a very important intuitive picture about what's going on with About what's going on with the local base function. And so the logarithmic k function for very ample L on X is described. As the sum over all places, and you take the max of the coordinate functions log the absolute value of the coordinates. And so for general line bundles, Um first write M as a difference of angle line bundles. And there should be emphasis that there's sort of a lot sort of that's actually That there's sort of a lot that's actually going on when we sort of talk about writing the height functions and sort of the coordinates. Like, I haven't really said anything at all about how important a particular coordinate representation of a point in projective space can actually be in obtaining sort of these arithmetic inequalities. And so, but in either case, I mean, of course, the height function is well defined independent of the choice of projective representation because of the product formula. Formula. Okay, so now I'm in a position where I can state the Rue Voigta arithmetic general theorem, and then I want to give a few comments about how the proof works because there's a lot of important steps involved. So let D one to DQ be non-zero effective Cartier divisors on X and assume They intersect properly and let L be a big line level on X so then So there exists constants beta i bigger than zero such that for all epsilon bigger than zero following Dipantian inequality, sum from i equals one to q, beta i proximity function x di is less than 1 plus epsilon the height plus the constant term is valid for all x in a Zarsky open substack. Where's a sort of speaking property zero speaking property seriously closed subset? Okay. So I formulated the general theorem, and now I want to make several And now, I want to make several remarks about it before sketching some of the details for the proof. And for sort of a more detailed short description of the proof, I refer to one of my recent papers about this theorem where I also give an extension for points of bounded degree, assuming a second main theorem for points of bounded degree. Points of boundary group. So the first, sort of some remarks, is that the constants beta i may be described as the product orders of the material. Of management. And so, what I mean by that is that you can look at the following quantity. So you're going to take the integral from 0 to infinity. This is the volume of L minus T times di, the volume of L. Fundamental DT. And so this is gives, so this gives sort of the link to say quaric geometry, the theory of Newton-Apunkov bodies, and the Duceberg Hackson metric. And so this was significant in making progress towards this third point that I mentioned at the start of the talk about how the ideas in case stability allow for the arithmetic general theorem to be used to deduce instant ways in conjecture. The second comment that I want to make is about the Diphantine exception set. So the The Dalophantian exceptional set, which I've written, I guess, by W here, can be described as W is a union of, say, the same thing. is a union of say z which is we'll describe in a minute union the the base locus of L union the support of the union of these divisors di and where Z is contained in a finite Finite union of proper linear sections of X with respect to the complete linear series that's determined by L. Okay. So So, this description of the Nipantine exceptional set helps to give some more motivation with what I was talking about earlier about when we start to go through how one can deduce the subspace theorem starting from the parametric inequalities. Because you get sort of, when you sort of go through those implications, it's interesting that, again, sort of the nature of the Dagrantian exceptional set changes under that. And as some further sort of motivation to what I As some further sort of motivation to what I mentioned briefly in the problem session yesterday was Schmidt's article about the approximation set. And part of what goes on there is the possibility that the Nipantian exceptional set is somehow independent of epsilon, is sort of one of the main sort of motivational considerations behind that. So I'll say a little bit more about what the approximation set is in a minute. But what I do want to mention briefly is it's Briefly, is sort of what are some steps involved in the Rube void zero. So, comments about So comments about truth of the Euler theorem. Okay, so there's several steps. And so one involves the concept Of birational twister in the sense of Shapurov and Boita. Another Another key point is a refinement of the filtration construction. And so this builds On work of Forbaja, Zanier Atisier, Levin, and others. And so, briefly, the idea is to study. Study the orders of vanishing along each of these divisors, the eye, sort of simultaneously. And it's here where the assumption of intersect property gets used in a brutal way. So briefly, the idea is to estimate Estimate orders of ban machine of sections of, say, tens of powers of L for L very large along Each of the DI simultaneously. And as I mentioned, so this so the assumption intersects properly Gets used by a concavity, so the property of the filtration constraint. And so this was noted by Atisier and refined. End and refined by Rue and Puerto. And so then the final sort of punchline is ultimately the arithmetic general theorem follows by a filtration instruction. Okay, so this is sort of a broad overview about what the steps are. And for a direct argument with these steps, With these steps, you can look at it in one of my recent articles on this topic. Okay, so now I want to mention just sort of one observation, recent observation as an application of the arithmetic general theorem. And that's sort of what I hinted at briefly yesterday in the problems of, oh, and I only have about 10 minutes left, so I'll have to pick up the pace a little bit. Tastes a little bit. So, okay, so there is one sort of observation. So there is building on ideas of trade there is Is a concept of say subspace topology on a set of rational points with respect to these linear sections of the complete linear series. And this is used. Is used to define an approximation set depending on the input data. And this is compact. And this is compact. And the compactness can be deduced from the arithmetic general theorem. But defining inequalities, as I mentioned yesterday, briefly, that seems to be more challenging. It's still very interesting. As I said, sort of part of the idea, underlying motivation for this sort of kind of questions, is this possibility to. Questions is this possibility about independence of epsilon on the 19 exceptional set. Okay, so now I want to report very briefly on the connection to Voyage's main conjecture and some ideas of case stability with the small amount of time that I have left. So, okay, so the main conjecture. So Hector stated a form of the conjecture for the truncated counting. Of the conjecture for the truncated counting function this morning. So maybe I'll just mention the Boyce's say height inequalities for the proximity functioning. So the prediction is that the following Um the following inequalities are true for, say, d strict normal crossing and maybe x non-singular and x outside of those feed. And so an important example to keep in mind, especially for what I wanted to talk about, is the Schmidt subspace theorem. So example one. So example one is so X is the N and D And D union of hyperplanes and general position. And the um so then the latest um I hate to write. And inequalities come to those of better valuable subspaces. So now I'm going to fast forward a little bit to the value of criteria face ability. And so this is due to Regeta, building on work with Li and Li and Zhu and others, a Q faunal variety not caseable. K stable if and only if the following inequality that's expressed in terms of discrepancy and asymptotic orders of enemies is valid for at least At least one prime advisor defined over some finite extension. But this number is okay. Okay, so the punchline then becomes what happens to this inequality in case that we're in a situation of what's called canonical singularities. So um But a consequence of this. So when X when the final variety has canonical singularities and is not It's stable. Then this asymptotic order of vanishing is at least one, or at least one prime by three. And so this leads to instances of the main conductor. Okay, and so now I think I'm basically out of time, but one other sort of extension to this idea that. Another sort of extension to this idea that I wanted to mention was that, so what this result suggests is that one should be able to say more about the manner in which the discrepancies or singularities arise in these kinds of approximation kinds of questions. And so, what I mean by sort of an extension to this idea Circle of ideas involves a concept of arithmetic, say case stability for polarized projective varieties. And so the condition is so the condition of, I'll just write down this last definition, the condition of not arithmetic k stable. It looks as follows. So it's a summation involving the log discrepancies. So here I'm also going to respect to a boundary advisor. And I want to assume KLT. Okay. So the condition looks like this. And what happens is that there's what I call the stabilizing Roth constants, and these EVs are a collection. Of prime divisors. Okay, and so then the punchline is that when you're in this situation, then there's one can obtain the Roth type inequalities for logarithmic approximation constants, expanding on sort of the Roth, the microphone can type through. They can type through. And so I formulated this as a natural sort of extension to sort of, again, this observation about the fact that phenomenal singularities allow one to deduce instances of the main conjecture for unstable funnel varieties. And so this definition is natural from what's called the delta invariant of case value. So I should probably stop there as I'm going to do that. Other questions, I guess? Do you have control on the DIY sort of mean that appears in the criterion of certain case study? No, not really at all. And that's sort of part of the value of the criteria. I mean, this is a really important result. And can you explicitly get your hands on destabilizing files? Splitly get your hands on destabilizing advisors, and that's challenging. So does this idea have any sort of application to effectively use providers? Is that any theorems where if you punch out enough divisors, you get white miss of rational points? I mean, so what I'm doing here is I'm applying the very sort of state-of-the-art theorems in the Penguin approximation and case stability of deducing instances of ways in a conjecture. This is the way it's made conjecture. And so, as Hector just asked, do we really, aside from Trinity subspace theorem, which is something we can sort of check directly, can we really get our hands on these destabilizing divisors? And so that's like a topic that we want to address to sort of understand sort of concrete ways destabilizing devices. So if I knew sort of detailed results like that, effectively, and things like that, then I would be able to say more about applications than the application. Okay, all right, then let's thank our maker and obviously use it today and then go start. Enjoy your free office.
