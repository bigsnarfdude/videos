So, this tertiary cell wall is remarkable that it develops tension due to a specific construction that I would not go into. And in general, the whole architecture of a plant is arranged like a present hema structure with tense cables at the periphery. So, if we look at the pattern, we see that tertiary. That tertiary cell wall is deposited in fibers at the periphery, but we also see another thing: there is a cavity coming up, a rather pronounced one, and the development of tertiary cell wall and fluorine fibers roughly coincide with the emergence of cavity in the middle of the stem. So, altogether, we have at the top part of the plant, we have three different patterns at the very beginning, then after. Beginning, then after cambium is initiated, and then when tertiary cell wall is induced. The formation of cavity seems to be an active process. If we trace its appearance in the region around snap point or at the same height of a plant at the cost of plant development, we see that it starts by the splitting of middle lamella between parameters. Of middle lamella between parenthema-like cells of the peace, and then all the joints into one big cavity. We evaluated the proportions of various tissues in flag stem in different places in the course of plant development. So you see that if you take the You see that if you take the total, of course, please note that the scales are different, but I want to show you the dynamics. There is definitely some parallelism in the total area of tertiary cell wall on the cross-section and the area of cavity. As distinct from that, for instance, the secondary cell area is increasing more or less monotonously towards the Stern base and the area of fluency part being flowing in the flex is the primary tissue is more or less constant through all the development. So together with that, we can also compare stem anatomy in various genotypes and see that if we compare fiber flags, linseed, and wild species, we would see again some parallelism in the extent of fiber flux. In the extent of fiber development and the cavity expressiveness. So, the question is: are tertiary cell wall deposition and cavity formation related to each other? If they are, this can be a quite interesting situation that would help to understand the involvement of mechanical stimulus in pattern development in real stem. In real stem, and means that there is a mechanism for radial signal transduction between outer and inner tissues. In order to approach all that, we tried to check mechanical properties of the tissues. We tried some modeling and finally, we still not quite understand these very questions. I'm getting out. Very questions. I'm getting out of time, so I just put them once again. And these are the real, let's say, questions coming from the ongoing project. So the question, one is what are the mechanical factors that induce tertiary cell wall deposition at specific points of a stem? Some bending moments, some, I don't know. Anyhow, this is the first question. This is the first question. And the second question: can we relate the formation of different tissues within the same stem, the remote tissues, from a mechanical point of view? And if yes, how can we do that? My colleagues, and thanks for your attention. I can come back to some question, question, question, question. Okay. But needy piercing languages of course. Okay. Thank you for introducing this very fascinating system of the flags. I was just wondering, your question now, your conclusion is always that it needs to be a mechanical factor which induces that tertiary cell wall formation. Would it be possible that it might be some other spatial signaling which is inducing this, like a morphogen gradient? Like a morphogen gradient or some signaling genes which get on at a certain point. Why is it for me? It's not clear. Why is it that it's necessarily a mechanical feedback that is inducing another mechanical change in property? Do you hear me now? Okay, so this is the question that always comes up in Always comes up in studying developmental processes, and usually people think of some oxygen transport or some signaling, specific concentrations of commons coming together right at this very position and so on and so on. But all that still has to be introduced by some things, it still has to have some origin. And it is now the idea of, let's say, plant hormones or cytoskeleton. Or cytoskeleton are all grouped together around tension of cell wall or plasma membrane. And especially in the cases when we have mechanical tissues, mechanical processes, the development of tissues that have mechanical impact. They should be related to some mechanical factors. Otherwise, this doesn't have. Otherwise, this doesn't have sense. Sorry, I don't hear you. Sorry, I don't hear you. It was good at the beginning, but not now. Hello. Three testing. Do you hear me now touch on it? Do you hear me now, Tachana? Yes, yes, now it's good. Yes, okay. So, um, thank you for the answer. So, so it's not at all that I'm advocating that it should be amorphogen. I was just wondering if it is then a mechanical feedback, is there experimental evidence that by changing maybe the mechanical load during growth, you can get that transition at a different point? So, can you actually show then that? Well, we tried a couple of things, the load like Couple of things. The load, like such, like in the case of campium, we don't see its effect. We tried also, let's say, putting the wind on one side so that there would be a bending of the stem at one of the directions. And they gave, we don't see the influence on the position of snap point, on the position of the induction of tertiary cell wall. Okay, thank you so. Okay, thank you so much. I think hello, thank you very much. I just want to go a little bit in deep on this question, or maybe in deep, just go a step further. So instead of changing the mechanics, is there any scaling rule? I mean, if you have different plants with different sizes, maybe you could get a difference. I don't really have no precise idea, but in between diffusion from the In between diffusion from the apex, for instance, or just the mechanics of this. So, have you maybe a variety of sizes or so we can elaborate on this? So, first, I showed you the results on different flags genotypes. And we see that the expression of fiber development is related to the expression of cavity. This is one of the stories. So, from the other hand, the plant develop. Hand, the plant analysis of plants at different stages of development, like when they are 30 centimeters, 50 centimeters, 70 centimeters, they still have the same pattern. I mean, the top part of the plant still has the very similar pattern of everything. So this is again that there is there is some There is some organizing factor that more or less makes the pattern. But for instance, if you have a plant which two times longer, is the point of change or creation of this wall and so on, is that still the same size or something like a fraction of the overall size or whatever? I mean, is there scaling low? It is still the same size because the plant grows by apical meristance. Grows by apical meristem, it increases the length of its apical part, and the downward part of the stem is already formed and it is already full of fibers with tertiary cell wall and doesn't need the additional and that cannot make additional initiation of them. It can only deposit additional layers of tertiary cell wall. So again, the plants The plants of different height have rather similar story of the top of the plant. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Tatiana. I'm afraid that in the interest of time, we need to move on. So keep your questions for the break. Our next speaker will be of, I have no idea where you need to go, I think here. Our next speaker, while Our next speaker, while he is setting up, I'm going to introduce him. It's Christophe Godin. Introduced himself earlier, but just to give a bit more input on his background, he's currently heading a team called Mosaic at the ENS in Lyon. And Mosaic stands, at least in French, for morphogenesis, simulation, and analysis in silico. And his main research interest has been for many years to do competition. Many years to do computational modeling of plant morphogenesis from cells all the way to whole plants and whole bodies. And he will be leading our first working session, so extended session for an hour now, starting in a few seconds, where he's going to demonstrate how, or practice with us probably, how by altering gene regulatory networks, you can make fractal. Regulatory network: You can make fractal forms emerge from Meristem behavior by just figuring out the details, and then it will be with us in a second. Maybe a note for all the in-house speakers or infinite speakers to read their equipment before the session. For the session always so we should be welcome. So, the in-house speakers, we're going to be opening up our Zoom on our laptop and then projecting from our own laptop, right? Yeah, over here. That's that's the plan. Either that or running your is it possible just to beam your pres to project your presentation and have the camera? Representation of having cameras. The easiest is to string either from the laptop on the desk or if you want to cut your laptop, then you need to log it. You're a group to do recording. Recording in progress. I was going to say that. I think you can get started. Okay. It takes a bit of time to log in in Zoom, actually. We should prepare this before. Yeah. Can you hear me? It's okay. Can you hear me? It's okay. I do. Yeah, okay. Well, I would like to thank you first, Anya. Actually, she, when we discussed this summer, she encouraged me to present this work that we did with François Parcy. It was like one year ago that we published this work. And actually, it's the first time that we'll present this work in front of the sort of planned community. The session will be. The session will be organized in two parts. The first part will be a presentation, let's say a formal presentation about the work that has been carried out. And the second part will be about the different questions that we may have as a follow-up of this work. And I have two broad categories. First category related to biology, how to go forward in the work that was carried out. That was carried out. And the second set of questions will be related to modeling. And you'll see that I'm going to show you a number of models during the presentation that are at different scales. And the question is, where are we going with all this? So as you okay, as you know, nature is able to provide a number of very remarkable shapes, such as. Very remarkable shapes, such as this one, and actually, the broccoli Romanesco, the curd that you see on the picture, is one of the more conspicuous and the more fascinating one. And one of the reasons for this seems that it takes time to switch because it is reminiscent of fractal shapes that you can find both from computer Constructions, but also you can find in nature, like in the coastline of certain countries or in animals and vegetables. Okay, so when we started to study this question, there is a bit of lag. I'm so sorry because when I'm changing all the screens are not changing at the same time, it's a bit confusing. So which one is actually the one that people see? Well, here, but the line, what? The line, what you see on the is what they see, what they see, okay. Yeah, it must grow only Q that matters what you see over here. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, so when we started to discuss with François Parcy, we wanted to understand what are the genetic determinants that are behind potentially the construction of such shapes and what are the developmental rules that would lead to this. Developmental rules that would lead to these structures. But instead of focusing on this one, we started to be a bit more modest and go to the more simple shapes like cauliflowers, standard cauliflower. And this is for four reasons. The first one, it's more simple. Second one, it's in the same cultivar group as the Romanesco. The third reason is that the cultivar. Is that the cauliflower is also a fractal and it's less visible, but actually, if you look at the different spirals that you see on the curd, then you see that there are one to the left, the other to the right, and the fractal pattern appears from the repetition of these spiral food scales. Okay. The cultivated cauliflower, and this is the third. Colifer, and this is the third reason, is actually the result from the transformation of an inflorescence. And this was obtained by a long history of domestication. And the ancestral plant probably resembled this wild cabbage. And this cabbage belongs to the family of Brassicaceae, which is a huge family. And actually, in the same family, we have our lab preferred lab plant, Arabidopsis. Preferred lab plant, Arabidopsis tagliana. And what was shown 30 years ago is that it is possible to make two mutations in this plant, and you obtain a phenotype that resemble the curds that you find in the common cauliflowers. And this was a very good starting point because this was giving keys in order to enter the genetics of the cauliflower. So the question was. So the question was summarized as this one. What are how these simple mutations in the colifera, how they can produce in terms of development, how they can produce such curves.
