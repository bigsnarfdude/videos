Thanks a lot for the invitation. This is definitely one of the most exotic conference venues I have ever been to. So, the topic that I'm going to present today is a joint work, ongoing, very much ongoing, joint work with Ela Mizaldi Ludmila Kamenova. Ludmila Kamenova and Lisa Marquan. And I have to admit that this project also started. Sorry? Yes, thank you. Yeah, I should admit that this project started only three weeks ago, also in a Bundes conference. Also, in a BUNS conference, a BUNS workshop, which we all attended online, so we had a beautiful time talking to each other. So, I'm giving this talk with a lot of apprehension as well as excitement because the results are fairly new. So, it could be that I'm missing a lot of references, or maybe something is obvious, or something is wrong. Please don't hesitate to point those things out. This is so new to me that I'm still getting used. To me, that I'm still getting used to the terminologies and the technicalities of things in this area. So, as announced, I will talk about the density of Lagrangian vibrations. So, in order to state the statements, let me start by recalling some basic facts. So, given a lattice lambda z of signature. Lambda z of signature three something else then define d lambda to be set of all rays in the projectivized this projective space such that so the lattice comes with some non-degenerate quadratic form non-designate quadratic form whose signature is three star. So I want to say that q omega is zero and q omega omega bar is positive. So this is the standard definition of period domain. Sometimes people take it with a quotient by a finite index subgroup of the orthogonal group. So I'm taking it like this. This is also isomorphic to just for references. References. This is positive-oriented real planes in lambda tensor. Okay, so where do we see these things in practice? This is fact number one. So consider a hypercolor manifold. Hypercaler manifold X, then it's H2, we have seen multiple times, comes with a quadratic form known as the Bobi-Bogomolov quadratic form. And this lattice has signature three second very number of x minus three. So it's exactly this setup. So, it's exactly this setup. And we would like to take this lattice abstractly and consider the hypercalors with markings. That's the standard practice. So, then if I consider a family, let's say x to s over some base. X to s over some base, then there exists a period map. Let me move on to the next board, which goes from the base to this D lambda and it sends a point T in the base to the H20. H20, which is for hyperkala generated by a non-degenerate symplectic form. So that's the map. Sorry, X, H20 of the fiber over T. Okay. Yeah, so this obviously satisfies the properties that defines the period domain, namely the square is zero and omega times omega bar is positive. Positive. And third thing I wanted to say: that an example of such a base is the unobstructed deformation space associated to a hypercalera, and there's a universal family. And we can define the period map again. Okay, another terminology I need to fix is inside. Need to fix is inside these this period domain, I will look at certain hyperplanes. So given alpha, then that has at C alpha perp, this is defined to be all period points such that Q of alpha, sigma is zero. Is zero, which in a geometric setup is saying that this alpha, so every for every period point here, this alpha is perpendicular to H20, which means it's also perpendicular to H02, which means it's an H11 class. So along every point here, the hypercaler has alpha in the H11 class. Okay, so. So, with these notations out of the way, let me state some known density results. The most famous one being let F a family over, let's say of Of hypergler that's non-isotrivia, and by that I mean not every point gets mapped to the same period point, so that the image in the period domain is at least positive dimensional. Over some for simplicity, let's take simply connected base. Yes. Then there are these loci's denoted, it's called Note Left Loci. These are set of all points T in S such that X T has the card rank. Picard rank at least or strictly greater than minimal Picard rank in the family. Yeah, so let's say let's denote this by row zero. Okay, so the statement is that if I look at these points inside S, then this is density. Okay, so this result is usually attributed to people who come from Shimura varieties, to Close El and Ulmo, and in general to Green, Uguiso, and Vostan. Yeah, there's another notation I forgot to introduce, so let me, before erasing, let me do that already. So I have to do, I also consider alpha intersected with S, which will be. With S, which will be set up a point T in S, such that its period, yeah, alpha, comma, its period is zero. Yeah, so it's just the pre-image of this hyperplane in S. Okay. Yeah? Is there a question? Sorry. Sorry. Oh. Okay. In fact, something stronger is known. So, namely for any i in a positive number, I can look at n l Look at n l row zero plus i, so this will be set of all points in s such that Picard rank of xt is precisely rho zero plus i. So this is also dense in i in s so these loci are very interesting. For example, these have been used to study codar dimension. Study codar dimensions of modularized space of hyperchaela, etc. The bigger drink It could be up till 20, right? So I think N20 is also densiness. Rho zero is the minimum picard rank in the family. So I think rho zero plus i can be at most 20. Maybe that's difficult. Aha, I see. Okay, so maybe this is this I should say in the So maybe this is this size should stay in the deformation of X. Is that? Okay. Okay, then let me. Okay. Maybe this is not correctly stated. Okay. Okay. So what we are interested in is Is a very specific NLOSI, namely, so now let's look at for just for K3 surfaces. Then the statement is that elliptic K3 surfaces Are dense in the moduli of K3 surfaces. So, this is usually the reference that I could find is Barth Vandeman Peters Complex Surfaces book. Not sure whose result this is originally. But what this is saying for K3 surfaces. What this is saying for K3 surfaces is that, okay, so just a quick reminder: elliptic K3 surfaces means that we already seen it multiple times. It means that there's a map from out of the K3 surfaces to P1, such that the fibers are elliptic. So for K3 surfaces, this is equivalent to saying that a set of all lambda parp such that lambda is in The K3 lattice and lambda squared is zero is dense in d lambda. Okay, so of course the question is what happens for hypercalors and they are this equivalent is conjectural if I put an F here here is If I put an f here, here it's automatically nf in this class. So again, we look at the specific no-telefshette's loci for hypercader. So here we have two different results. Again, I'm shaky about the attributions. Shakeable attributions. So D1 will be a set of all hypercaler admitting Lagrangian vibration with respect to a fixed class alpha Alpha is dense in alpha perf. And I want to say that this is a result of Kamenova, Verbitsky, and also Matsushita. So, here, obviously. So, here obviously, the statement, corresponding statement for pre-a domain is also true, except you don't get it for free. So, let me just write it down for the sake of completeness, that again, lambda perf such that lambda is in is an integral point and lambda square is zero. This is then The lambda. Okay. Okay. So what we wanted to do is this kind of statements, but for any family of hypercala. So let me state the theorem. And you can tell me if this is obvious or it's not correct. It's been only three weeks. So. So, here the first statement is that similar to the Noether-Lefschetz locus, we consider a family non-isotrivial. Over a simply connected base. Then we look at the loci T in S such that P T is in alpha perp for some alpha squared zero and alpha and lambda z. This is dense. Dense in F. And I should say that the proof of this statement follows very similarly to the Notel-Leshette statement. I'll come to it in a second, but let me state the second one. So this is saying something about the period domain. So we wanted to figure out what about actual Lagrangian vibrations. And of course, we don't have. And of course, we don't have SYZ at our disposal, so we need to assume it. So, if we assume SYZ one vector, which basically says that the set of, I mean, if okay, I'm not going to write it, it says that if you have a square zero algebraic class in H2, then H2, then sorry, in H11, then there you have a birational model which admits an actual Lagrangian vibration. Okay, so assume it's quite a convector and also assume that dimension of S is at least two, then what we have is Set of out t in s such that xt admits a hypercaler, a Lagrangian vibration This is dense in S so. So let me maybe quickly sketch the proofs. Okay, so A, as I said, the proof goes very similarly as the Noital Lefset, and it's by no means a very easy proof. But the main statement that they use is that, so you have a family, and then you look at, and it's over the simply connected base. And it's over the simply connected base. So the H2 can be trivialized. So you consider the Hodge bundle, which we know by H11. This is the set of all t comma lambda such that alpha is in H11 XT comma c. So obviously this is inside H2XC and xc tens times s we just saw a very similar argument in claire's talk what you do here is that you look at a projection to h2 of xc and then we continue here um where's the thank you Yeah, so then Vassar shows that there exists a lambda in H11 such that let me call this map Psi maybe so is a Psi is a submersion at lambda. So, what we show is that one can take one can choose this lambda to be in H11Q, which I will define to be set of all. define to be set of all t comma lambda in h11 such that the square is zero so this is basically the way the lambda is found is that it shouldn't be in the kernel of some linear map and we have a quadratic equation so there should be something on the quadric which doesn't intersect this linear kernel that's basically the idea okay so why The idea, okay. So once we have, so then this implies that h11q2q, which is again defined to be lambda such that lambda squared is zero inside h2 xc. So this is a submartian. But q is a non-degenerate indefinite form, which means it has real solution. means it has real solution that means qr uh q q is dense in q r and this implies the result because having a submargin at lambda implies that this map is open so i can pull back the dense points okay so that follows really closely So that follows really closely the Neutral Lipschitz proof for part B, which is about so this was period domain. Now we want to talk about actual Lagrangian vibrations. So let me maybe sketch it by drawing a picture so that it shows why we need dimension at least two. So let's say this is S and I. And I already know from part A that there's all of these alpha perfs, right? So let's take a point in here, T. I can, so either alpha is already nash, then we win, because SYZ will tell tell us that there's an actual Lagrangian vibration, and Matsushita will tell us that it's open and dense inside alpha purple, okay? dens inside alpha purple. Okay. So if alpha is nef, SYZ implies alpha induces an actual Lagrangian vibration. And then Matsushita. So if you have if you have gotten hold of this line bundle, Matsushita basically produces by pushing forward this line. By pushing forward this sign bundle to the base, and he produces a projective bundle, which on an open set gives you Lagrangian base of the Lagrangian vibration. So Matsushita implies that, so alpha parp reg, which is the locus of regular Lagrangian vibrations. Alpha perforate. Alpha perp rig inside alpha perp is open and dense. So these two together gives us what we want when alpha is nef. So if it's not nef, that's when it's the yeah, so here already we are using that s dimension at least two because otherwise it could be that alpha perpet intersects s. That alpha perfect intersects S in exactly one point, and then we can't get dense subset inside alpha perfect. So, if alpha is not an F, then we move it in the birational scalar cone. First, maybe we need to do some reflection along exceptional divisors and then move it in the birational chambers to find something. find something that let me denote by tau alpha such that tau alpha squared is zero and tau alpha is actually nav on some x prime okay so here i have x and here i have tau alpha perp which i have i have well in the original family i don't have x prime but Don't have x prime, but then comes Huybridge's result, which says that these kind of points are non-separated in the moduli. So I can, on an open set, replace x by x prime, and x prime has this has an actual Lagrangian vibration. So, what stops short is that for every alpha that we found in every every alpha that we found in part a we can replace it with tau alpha such that tau alpha perp has a dense set of uh um thanks for the line okay so uh part a implies alpha perf union of all alpha squared zero alpha perf integrated with s is dense in s and And what we are saying is that this implies union of alpha squared, tau alpha squared equals zero. Tau alpha per intersected with S is a dense in S. But then Matsushita tells us that tau alpha perf regular intersected with S is open and dense. Dense in the alpha perp intersected with S. So these two facts together implies that the locus of actual Lagrangian vibration is densiness. Okay, so this is this is the upshot of our discussion of Of pretty intense discussion of about two weeks. And there are some questions that we don't know how to approach. So maybe I can post them here that we're thinking about currently. So first of all, the statement that I couldn't write down, the stratification of Notel-Lefshitz loci, we were wondering if the set of T in S such that In S, such that X T has exactly, let's say, two Lagrangian vibrations. What can we say about this loci? So, this is one question. And then the second one is that, of course, we used SY. Of course, we used SYZ here, and then the natural question will be: if we don't use SYZ, is there a statement which will give sort of an evidence towards SYZ? So the statement we would like to see is that set of all alpha perp such that alpha squared is zero, alpha is an integral class, and alpha is nef. Sorry, I want to look at it as points in S. So let me, okay, hold on. So T in alpha perp intersected with S. So I want to say that this loci is this, if SYZ is true according to Matsutoshita, it should be open and Be open and dense in alpha perp intersected with SYZ plus Matsu Shadow. What we would like to see is without SYZ whether this is true. For all known examples of hyperkiller, of course, we know that SYZ is true, if I'm not mistaken. At least for KGN types, that's the. At least for K3N type, that's the case. And that indicates that this kind of statement should be true. And there should be an argument using maybe just lattice theory or some Shimura variety technique. So that's what we want to aim for next. That was my talk. I think I finished quite early.
