For being here, you know, on behalf of the five of us: Scott, Patrick, Francesca, and Marguerite. We're so happy everyone made it. This has been just a delight. So I thought I'd give myself the last talk on the conference because it's kind of a graveyard shift. Tomorrow we have in Storefield, if you're not traveling, we'd love to get together and think about next steps, possible future conferences, possible proposals, collaborations. Proposals, collaborations that might be emerging, etc. But this is the last talk. So I retitled my talk Toward Spectrum because we're not completely there, but you know, I think we've some really cool progress, as I'll show you. Now, what's been obsessing me over the past few years is this idea that, you know, classically, many people have exploited shape in all sorts of creative ways. The beautiful trenches that Francesca and Sean were making, these egg cart. Making these egg cartons that Dan was showing us, using shape to control the ordering of materials. But I kind of want to reverse that, and I want the order to instead control the shape. That is my obsession. I'll just very quickly show you why this kind of thing is a problem or challenging. And that is that, you know, we can take a very simple problem, minimizing the length of a loop at constant area. And when we try to do that, we're like a very basic disk. To do that with like a very basic discretization, we can immediately see the kinds of problems that emerge. Namely, if we start from a bad solution, the numerical representation here, a mesh of some sort, has been kind of all bunched together and messed up. And this is not only sort of aesthetically bad, but I'll show you some of the problems as well. But we do that very slow. The reason for this is that if we look at the thing we're trying This is that if we look at the thing we're trying to minimize, that is the loop length, and we start perturbing different vertices, we can see there's actually a null space of this function. I can take any vertex in my loop and I can move it tangentially, and it doesn't change the overall value. That means that we have degrees of freedom in our problem that are not being constrained by the problem as we propose it. And this is one source of all the problems. One thing that we can do. One thing that we can do is to regularize the problem by incorporating some additional information. So, one possibility is to say, oh, I want to have the elements be of equal length. But oh my goodness, then things converge. It all looks very nice. We get a nice solution at the end. And one of the great things is that by doing this, not only do we get a better solution, we also get a solution a lot faster. The convergence is improved. Is improved. And sometimes, if we don't even regularize it, we actually don't converge on any uncorrect solution at all. We just get stuck somewhere off in the landscape. So that's sort of like a hand-waving, but kind of toy introduction to why these problems are so challenging if we allow shapes to vary. This sort of strategy of regularizing these problems, you know. These problems, you know, it turns out that you can do it in lots of other places. And so the 3D version of that problem, it works just as well. And again, you can see the convergence is improved. Now, the kind of thing I've just shown you, which is what I call a direct optimization method, where we take the problem, we discretize it, and then we directly try to optimize it, I would say it's actually fallen out of favor for quite a long time. Some of you who are physicists, Some of you who are physicists may be familiar with a piece of software called Surface Evolver, which is something that finds minimal surfaces, a very powerful and cool program. You can see some of the wonderful things. The problem is that these direct optimization methods historically have tended to require a lot of manual intervention, and I know it's rather difficult to automate. The kind of regularization methods we've brought in have actually Brought in have actually largely helped us overcome this. You can do what Dan was showing and do a phase field method. That's also an excellent method. There's a wealth of literature on how to do these methods well. There's a third technique that we didn't hear about called the level set method. That's where you represent the shape as the level set, the contour lines of a scalar function, and then you have to kind of solve on an enlarged dimensionality to do that. Dimensionality to do that. Each of these have their strengths and weaknesses. The level set methods are very good in that they can handle topological change very naturally, but it's a little hard. You have to do a lot more work than you would need to. And actually setting these up can be quite a problem, actually. They're not that easy to form. The phase field methods, I think, are actually quite straightforward to set up. The problem is resolving things like sharp corners. The problem is resolving things like sharp corners can be very challenging. I've already talked about some of the disadvantages. As you'll see from some of the things we're seeing, direct optimization actually, we can recover features like cusps kind of very naturally. So that was sort of a picture of shape optimization. So really sort of the class of problems that we're trying to solve is sort of minimizing arbitrary functionals with respect to, you know, if we have some domain, we We have some domain. Some fields may live on the domain. I'll show you some examples of that in a moment. We want to minimize these functionals, not just with respect to the fields, as we might classically, but also with respect to shoes. That's what we're doing. And we've created an environment to do that, that I called Morpho, being inspired by the metamorphoses of Ovid. So let me show a non-liquid crystal problem just to kick things off because it's so fun. This is a little bit like one that I use. Is this a little bit like one that I use for my sort of Morpho 101? And that is like this beautiful paper by the Menin group at UMass Amherst. They had a filament that they had constrained to the surface of a soap bubble. As they extended the filament, they found that initially the filament would want to lie along a geodesic, a line of longitude. This is minimizing its curvature energy subject. Its curvature energy subject to being constrained in the sphere. But as we extend the object, we find there is a certain length, a certain critical point. We can either extend this object or actually alternatively shrink the bubble. So they shrink the bubble, but you can make it whatever. As you shrink the bubble, you find that actually there's a sort of critical point where it curls up and you get a coiling transition. So that's kind of nice, right? Which group was this? This is the Mennon group at UMassF. This is the Menon group at UMass Analysis. Can I access it to David Overt? I didn't use. I think they weren't together. Okay. Yeah. Okay. In any case, it's a beautiful paper. You can set this up in Morpho very easily. We're minimizing bending, press gravity, subject to a length constraint and a local line on the sphere constraint. We do that and set it going. It's a saddle point problem, so right. It's a saddle point problem, so running a little bit of jiggle, so that we jump off the saddle point as soon as we get to the transition. But oh my god, look at it. We coiled up really nicely. Right, I said a few lines of Morpho, a really easy problem to set up, but I think kind of a fun one and illustrative of why we might want to do this. Does Morpho do the shadows too? Yeah, this is all, but everything that you see in this talk was made with Morpho. Now, because Randy talked about helicopters, I was just like, oh, I should throw this in too. I was just like, oh, I should throw this in too. There's a very interesting structure in the endoplasmic reticulum that was discovered in 2013. It used to be thought, so the endoplasmic reticulum is made of double bilayers of lipid membrane. And there's sort of an interior and an exterior, sort of an interior part of the double bilayer is not connected to the cytoplasm, the exterior is. It was previously thought if you take Previously thought, if you take an electron micrograph, you can see these little joins between double bilayer layers, they're little holes. It was previously thought that these were catenoidal windows through which things could transport. But Terasaki and Co. in 2013 showed that they were not catenoidal windows, but in fact, like the helicoidal ramp of a parking garage. And so, in fact, your endoplasmic reticulum is actually. Endoplasmic reticulum is actually kind of continuously connected. There's some very nice analytical work that's been done by Greg Huber and co. sort of trying to show sort of showing approximate minimizers. But one of the things that we've recently just been doing with the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub is showing that you can actually get these from minimizing a health work energy, in fact. And so you can actually find that they're minimizing the health work energy. So I just threw that because I think it was so much fun. So I just threw that because I thought it was so much fun, but Randy mentioned helicoids. So here's a place in biology within all of us where there are billions of helicoids. And in fact, they're important because transport through a continuously connected set of layers is very different from going through a bunch of windows. So there's probably biological significance too. I don't have to tell you that liquid crystals form tactoids. This is one of the oldest kind of things that people have known about liquid crystals. Have known about crystals. Rather beautiful, they are too. I guess I should mention that there's been a whole bunch of papers on tactoids, some of them are truly beautiful. You can get all kinds of morphologies if you start playing around with parameters like the surface tension, the anchoring strength, and the elasticity. They're particularly, you know, I think this was, I can't remember, I think this might have been viral particles. I can't remember, I think those might have been viral particles, I forget. There are different platforms for them that you can also do them with the chromatic liquid crystals as well, form a wealth of tactoid shapes. So, this is the optimization problem we have to solve for a tactoid. We need the pneumatic elasticity, we need an anchoring term, and an isotropic surface tension. We're going to constrain the overall amount of stuff, which is going to legal an area or volume constraint, and we're going to have a normal. Constraint, and we're going to have a normalization constraint on a directive. We're not required to, and I'll show you examples later where we don't use the directive formulation, but it's actually okay for this problem because we're not going to have defects inside the domain value. So if we do that using Morpho, this is kind of like a cartoon of it operating, kind of just the first few levels of refinement. You can see we're doing adaptive refinement. We can see that we're doing the regularization. If you remember, Al. If you remember Allison Ravage's talk a little earlier in the week showing these exquisite moving mesh methods that she's developed, you know, in many ways, this resembles a moving mesh method. I was excited to hear some of her heuristic indicator functions. Here we're just using the free energy itself as an indicator to move around the mesh points, and we converge on a solution as we go. That was a two-day That was a 2D thing to just kind of give you a sense of what's going on. These are 3D results. So, as we change the isotropic part of the surface tension and the anchoring part of the surface tension, we capture a whole bunch of morphologies from spherical to kind of these sort of spindle-shaped bodies. And the director is either rather ignoring the structures or conforming, you know. Structures or conforming, you know, it's sort of anchored reasonably well to the shape. Both of these are possible. I asked a small question. In this simulation, you also have inserted the elasticity? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Elasticity, everything is. This is sort of one of the nice things actually is that we can do all of these things with really no approximation. So we even have anisotropic elasticity as well. So all of this is working. So all of this is working rather nicely. And we see one of these bhujums that we've heard from down. So we can also start thinking about things like, okay, well, what if the tactoid could be deformed by an electric field? And a very beautiful paper from, I don't remember the guy, Metzala, and in fact, Julia Yeoman's group, using their hydrodynamics code, looked at, you know, if you take some of these tactoids, they're chitin tactoids, They're chitin tectoids, and you apply an electric field, they elongate, and elongate, and elongate, and do all sorts of wonderful things. You have to turn the field on and then you turn the field off. It's a fixed electric field here. People have done kind of, I would say the prior modeling has been very much an analytical, some really wonderful work from Paul Vanderskoot's group in particular. Paul Vanderskoot's group, in particular, over the years, kind of using various ANSAT shapes. The Lattice-Boltzmann code that I think I'm sure Pyli is very familiar with this code actually does a very nice job of predicting the elongation of the titoids. Noting that the fixed grid has difficulty recovering sharp features, and actually, they're not solving for the electric field here. One really interesting Interesting implication of this paper that we're not capturing is that the hydrodynamics actually might be very important for this particular process. And so we're not going to try to do the hydrodynamics, but it's worth kind of noting that. And a very nice example. So I'm going to kind of instead try to solve for a tactoid as a function of applied field without approximations. And I'm going to do this by co-minimizing the tactoid. The taptoid shape problem that I showed you earlier together with also solving Maxwell's equations and kind of making that happen. So now we have, you know, we now are in one of these situations where we don't just have one field, we have our director, we also have a scalar potential for the electric potential. Everything is being done with quite low order elements and that's something that is sort of the firm that we're working on, but it's probably worth noting. You know, it's probably worth noting it. And if I take the shape and crank up the field, you can see I actually do get this kind of lovely delongation, you know. That ends up then going on, this particular solution then goes on stable. So there's a lot more to do here, but kind of it's illustrative of the fact that you can certainly capture the initial bit quite nicely. Initial bit quite nicely. Outside of the title, you're only modeling the electric fuel? Yeah, exactly. So that's another thing that we're very good at: that you know, different bits of the simulation can have just completely different physics, in fact, you know. What do you mean, unstable? Do you mean the mesh it generates or something else that? I mean, when I get a solution, I'm at a saddle point. As I calculate the KKT matrix and get its indices and. What's that sorry? That's because of the electric. What's that sorry? That's because the electric field. Yeah, exactly. Correct. Yes. Yes, it has that structure. And so I can graph the aspect. You can see that we're some fairly modest changes, but it's kind of nice. So, you know, we're building towards semantics. Next up, colosterics. So there is some gorgeous work here showed that you get all sorts of rich structures that can occur if you put a colosteric on a on a sphere. Colosteric on a sphere. So let's go back to the morpho, and it's actually pretty easy. You can just add in the preferred wave vector. And I had a wonderful pair of undergrads who worked on this that were writing up the paper now. Let me just kind of show you some of their results relatively quickly. The kind of structures we're actually getting out of these are very different from the tactoids we observe. I'll show you, we recover those in a little bit. We get kind of all sorts of weird shapes that emerge. Kind of all sorts of weird shapes that emerge from the colosteric. That's what one of them looks like. And what we're going to do is we're going to kind of take the wave vector, we're going to start with a regular pneumatic and slowly crank it up and see what kind of solutions we get. We're not doing anything like deflation here, which is something we might like to do in the future to kind of really understand the solution space. But, you know, so we'll start with, and I'm just showing the mesh, I'm not showing. With, and I'm just showing the mesh, I'm not showing the director. But you can see what qualitatively I start with the regular tactoid shape. At some pitch, I get like a disk again, and that turns out to be a very favorable structure. And then as I crank up the pitch, I get all sorts of other solutions as well. Are you enforcing planner anchoring here? Yeah, we're weakly enforcing planner anchoring. Yeah, so there's a, so yeah, we can do tangential, we can do the We can do perpendicular angling just as easily, but here we looked at the planar case. And the solution set really is sort of the three main minimizers that we get that are the ground state within a certain wave vector regime. If the cholesterol pitch is, sorry, if the wave vector is rather low, we're just back in the original tactoid solution. If we wind it up a bit, If we wind it up a bit, it actually turns out that there's a regime where just going back to the disk is more favorable than having the deformed solution. Energy, you know, the surface tension wants it to be a disk, and suddenly the colosteric is actually very happy to be a disk. It forms a really nice structure that's compatible. But once I go beyond that, I'm trying to fit in more kind of more rotation inside the domain. I get like this totally new morphology. Yeah. I think I missed something. Morphology. I think I missed something. Is this a 3D director and a 2D microphone? 3D director on a 2D mesh. Yeah. We have 3D director and a 3D mesh as well, but I didn't want to show it because I want to get to the studies. So 3D director, 2D mesh. Okay. And so yeah, we can do this kind of thing. We can do the continuation part in Q and see how the solutions change. This is sort of an undergrad plot, so apologies, it's a bit hard to read, but you know. And some bits and hard and read, but you know, I think it was really impressive that Doc was doing that. So, you know, you can solve quite a lot of other things. So, you know, Nigel and his postdoc, Nigel, they've gone to bed by now. But nonetheless, I hope that when you watch this tomorrow morning, Nigel, that I'll sort of put this, we were easily able to set this problem up. They're quite interested in trying it. You don't have to use directors, you can use two tensors, you can do those in 2D and 3D as well. And 3D is one of the four. So, ending with smectics. You know, I think it's become very clear from it, if you weren't already familiar with all of these, we have a wealth of possibilities to try to model. And some of those are, you know, some of them I wasn't actually fully familiar with. There are many others, but I pulled out three that I think are really interesting. So, Apollin's model that we saw yesterday, and I had Model that we saw yesterday, and I hadn't seen it until yesterday, involved a scalar field phi, Qij. And the basic idea is to couple grad phi to Qij. So you're promoting layering, but you're also kind of trying to direct the layers in some way. Jingmin and our group's idea was to couple the Hessian of S to Q and then have Landau expansions for S and Q. For SQ to promote the right pieces. Tyler has a really exciting approach to kind of avoid some of the separation of these objects by having a one coherent object that I think is really cool. And yeah, and indeed, all three of these are in various degrees, you know, for some of these methods we have rather good discretizations, for others those are still emerging. For others, those are still emerging. Some of these have obvious advantages, others may or may not capture the physics actually or the topology quite correctly. But nonetheless, all of them I think are very interesting. One, I think, I wanted to get Jingmin's working in Morpho, and we're nearly there, but as Patrick alluded to, the high order of the element is a bit kind of the barrier. That's what we're sort of working on. That's what we're sort of working on. So I was very excited that yesterday I learned about Apollo's energy functional, which only is first order in grading. Only one derivative needed. So I was like, okay, can I do this? By tomorrow. And so I did. What I did is shamelessly stole Apala's slide from the recording. Here's her slide, just to remind you of what everything, what Apala was telling us was, you know, she has this term, this coupling gratified a Q. Term is coupling grad phi to Q. She's promoting layers of this thing. She has a lambda expansion to get Q to do what it should. She has an elasticity term to utilize that. And she also has an anchoring term. So I put all of those things in the morpho. And, you know, you get, without the shape optimization, you get, you know, this is sort of a visualization. This is like cosine phi, you know, so. Sine phi, you know, so that you're seeing the layers rather than kind of just the scalar field. But you're getting kind of something that looks decently plausible. It's certainly a minimizer. I didn't check it was stable. And if you then minimize on shape as well, you can, and so as you crank down the isotropic part of the surface tension, we're indeed seeing kind of a departure from circular solutions. Circular solutions going to elongated ones. The point here is not to say, oh my god, I've done this problem well, but the fact that I could see a free energy yesterday and then have it working by today, I think, is pretty great. There's a lot more to do to explore the solution space of this situation. I think it would be wonderful to be able to do Jean Min's beautiful energy Tyler's beautiful energy. I think all of these are possible. I think all of these are possible within our framework. One of the things that we focused a lot on is what is the bulk functional. One thing that I still think is a little mysterious, and I would love people to think about and maybe get answers at some point, is the anchoring functional for smetics, I think, is still rather, you know, all three of us, I think, rather casually use kind of some like, you know, quadratic. Some quadratic model. I don't think any of us claimed that it was, all of us did so for pragmatic rather than other reasons. I think now that we all have these great models, maybe we can start to think about what that should be. So to summarize and kind of finish so that we can all go for dinner on time, you know, I've shown you kind of three liquid crystal problems that we can solve in our framework. We can do pneumatic tactile and electric yields. This is Tactiloids and electric yields. This is kind of a cool problem because it's got two bits of physics that we're doing simultaneously. I've showed you colosteric tactile that have just a really rich interplay of order and shape. We're working on that now. And I've showed you something that literally I did in a day, you know, because it turned out it was just obvious how to do it. I hope to show you some stuff with Jingmins, but I think that's pretty close. I think that's pretty close. We've shown you spectix and deformable boundaries take one, which is hopefully kind of a nice complement to the excellent work that Dan was showing earlier. So none of this would have been possible without my research group. I want to just note that the undergrads who did the colosteric are here. Anka has been working on optimization strategies. I didn't talk much about the optimization algorithms we're using, but she's been working on developing new ones. Chaitanya and Daddy are very Chaitanya and Danny and various postdocs have been working on applying more photolots to different systems. So they're amazing too. And of course, we should thank the NSF for the grant that they so generously gave us. So if you want to try it yourself, you can get it off our GitHub. It's open source, pretty easy to learn, and very suitable, you know, very suitable for introducing all sorts of people to this exciting world. And with that, I will say thank you to. With that, I will say thank you to everybody. And we may not have time for questions, but happy to feel any and certainly happy to talk about afterwards. So, thank you so much. Actually, I think there are a few minutes for questions. It's not really a question, but it's a comment about your last point about the functionality of the ongoing, which is necessary. But for me, it's not clear what it should be because I don't know what is your opinion, but I think Hapidiba Bra has a reason to be correct. Yeah, yeah. I agree. And a very simple thought experiment that is not my idea, but other people have sort of made it is that if you have your, if I think Dejen himself makes it in his book, right? If you have a set of library books, then you tip them over, you create voids, which obviously have to happen in the tropics. Which obviously have to have an entropic cost, right? So, like, you know, it's, you know, so how do we capture it? What's the right approach? The wonderful thing about finite elements, of course, is that the most general boundary condition kind of emerges for free. You know, when you do your calculus of variations, you're absolutely forced to engage in this. You know, they pop out, and you could be like, oh, well, are any of those terms significant? So, in fact, if we have a theory, we can. If we have a theory, we can figure out what the most general boundary condition is, and if we can interpret it. Sometimes I wonder if what happens really impact is it depends probably on the system. But I wonder if sometimes there is not a small multiplayer close to the system. Which is easier for the spectral, awesome. Um in response to I think it was Hyla's question, I was complaining about how hard and impossible it would be to try and minimize simultaneously a lipid crystal direct Q tensor field as well as the positions of many colloidal occlusions. Does that become dramatically easier in your system? Yes. So in fact, I didn't show an example of it, but what we do is we basically have a mesh with holes in it. And then we impose what And then we impose what I would call like a rigid body constraints on the inclusion. And then, yes, they can move around to their heart's desire, find each other. So, yeah, that's the kind of thing we can actually do very easily. All the while, the regularization, just sewing the mesh together and making it happy as it devolves. So, I have a lovely example with two like colloidal particles finding the magic chaining angle. Finding the magic chaining angle is going to go together. That would be extremely explicit. Yeah, and so that's fixing them in place, running more of them, letting them move. Those are degrees of freedom. And all we have to do is enforce rigidity on the inclusion, you know, so that they don't kind of want it. But we can absolutely, I can try to set one up so you can see how. They're minimized together. So it's not that what what we do, which is like. That what we do, which is like minimize move one colour, like minimize. No, they all go together. It's that way very similar to what Allison was talking about, but without the hydrodynamic interpretation. Yeah, I wanted to de-emphasize that because the goal is to do better, right? And so, what we're doing here is a projected gradient percent method. Yeah. You know, Morpho really is like a giant calculator for forces. It can calculate the generalized forces with respect to field degrees of freedom, the generalized forces with respect to shape degrees of freedom. Then all of that is put into a projected radiant percent. What Anker is developing is an SQP method. So I guess for that, you need second derivatives. We're using the FGS. So figuring out what Yeah. So figuring out what the right combo is to do that, but we could produce it like invertebrates. How do you do the automatic differentiation? You can do automatic differentiation. How do you do it? We use automatic differentiation. Okay, but so in the Morco interpreter or something, does it build a graph of the expression for the well it can do actually, yeah. I mean you could do you could do it because you can just use the algebra of uh I just use the algebra of differentiation, I would say. Did you handle your automated differentiation or did you use a package? I handled the package. For the cholesterol tactoids, I'm very interested. And I'm wondering if when you're seeing the disc like shape or spherical shape if the anchoring is violet. If the anchoring is violet? Yes. Ah, for the disk shape? Yeah. I didn't see that. Okay. But I didn't look closely at the solutions near the transition. The angry is definitely doing weird stuff at this point. Right, and so we haven't really fully experimented. I wouldn't say we've here I'm just looking in Q. There's quite there's a couple of parameters about anchoring and surface tension that we could look in. So there might be a regime where that's happening actually. We can totally. Yeah. And yours? I also was wondering about the factoids. So a lot of people use factoids to measure, for example, ratio between elastic constants. Do you get a good match with the experimental value of the ratio between elastic constants? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Reasonable, reasonable, yeah. I think to the extent that these are fully characterized, the big the big the big The big problem is always the anchoring and the isotropic surface tension, right? So it's sort of in reality, if you do all of those, but actually you don't necessarily, you can try to measure X post factor. So the point is that when we do the right things, like changing the elastic anisotropy, we do indeed see things like elongation and so forth. So I would say really. I would say reasonable agreement. Yeah, less functional, but you have the less flow. Instead of a blob floating in isotropic space, could you have an interface to see that changes shape? Absolutely. In fact, actually, if you look at the PRL on spontaneous topography that I didn't talk about here, we actually have an example of exactly that. Like a free boundary that is above a film. Above a film. Do you even do Nigel's droplets running into it? You could do reconstruction. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Although reconnecting, you'd have to take care, because it's not easy to reconnect. You don't have to, yeah, that's an issue. This is not a great, you know, this is not, that's really where those phase field ones, I think they can do that really well. Cool. Okay, thanks. Happy to field all questions afterwards. Just come say hi, you know, and very. Was just come say hi, you know, and try and say hi.
