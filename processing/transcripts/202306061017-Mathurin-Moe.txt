Yes, I can hear you. Good morning. How are you? Good morning. Sorry, we're starting a bit late. Organization. I just need to open up the Thank you, Steve. Like laptop here to be allowed. It's pretty streamlined, so not important. Okay, would you be able to let me know if I have okay? Now, did you want to share your screen, Martha? Yeah, yeah, that's what I wanted to see if I could do that. So give me a second. Sure, you can. You can start and then. Um yeah, did you already share it? No, I haven't. Okay, yeah, of course. Just give me one problem. Just want to make sure you could see my screen. The 2211 paper has all that best written paper, I can think, but it's uh much because it's all at all there. Can you see my screen okay? Yeah, it looks great. Thank you. That looks great. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. I have two videos, Siri, that I want to try to make sure they are working. Is it okay if I try to play them? Yeah, it's okay. Okay. And you can tell me if you can hear it okay, right? Yeah, I can hear you loud. Okay, right? Yeah, I can hear you loud and clear. I can see your screen. I can see your animations. I can hear the music. Yeah. Perfect. I just had to make sure that it was all. Yeah, it looks fantastic. I think it'll be great. And right. And we're, as I said, we're running a little bit behind schedule. The lunch is supposed to be at 11:30, but if you need to go a few minutes over, that's perfectly fine. Over, and that's perfectly fine. I didn't want it to have your presentation and whatever else you have in mind for one and a half hours, but it's kind of a little bit regimented, so we couldn't move the coffee break too much. So we settled for one hour or 15 minutes. But yeah, whatever. Okay, totally fine. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Thank you for introducing you. It'll probably take two minutes. No problem. Take care. I'm just getting myself organized. So, not to worry. Myself organized, so not to work. I will get the people back in like in five minutes. Yeah, that's excellent. Thank you so much.    I use the Well, yes, I can mention it. I think it's not now. Okay. But we can look at another. Yeah, it's user humans. There's nothing. There's a copyright back from PhD. There is like a couple of items. Yeah. I'm gonna sharing. Oh, I just got an award, but I had it last time. Maybe a very simple stair. It's just that it's just that. I will be able to speak. There is this discussion section, so if there's more people to say, yeah.    Is that you have that thing? That's kind of the same thing. Just wait for a few more seconds and All right, we slowly get started. Now, as I mentioned yesterday, right from the point where we wanted to do this conference and the proposal and things like that, it was a function. It was a function decision on our part, and I speak for my fellow organizers as well, to try to have an equity, diversity, and inclusion section or two in this meeting. Well, the reasons are, I don't need to go into that. We are all aware, like we're part of the physics community, theoretical community, and management community, but also part of the broader community in which EDI is. In which EDI is a real thing, it plays a role, and we are all kind of part of it in one way or another, especially those who are from PDI user groups. And we wanted to make this like everybody else tries to do something, this workshop as inclusive a space as we possibly could. Of course, we didn't reach our goal. We didn't reach our goal, we never reached our goal, but we keep trying, right? And it was definitely part of the back of the mind. So, as part of this, it's my great pleasure of welcoming and introducing Martha Mafiri Mo. And Martha, first, I'd like to express my deep gratitude and thank you for being here. It's much appreciated. So, I don't want to take too much of Martha's time. Too much of Martha's time, but let me just introduce Martha very quickly. Briefly, Martha is the Vice Provost, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, or EDI, at the University of Lethbridge. That's where I'm from. Martha was born and raised in St. Lucia, West Indies. Martha holds a BA degree from the Universitad Central de Las Villas, Cuba, a Master of Education in Educational Psychology. Master of Education in Educational Psychology from the University of Regina, and is a doctoral candidate in curriculum and instruction. Marta's experience consists of 10 years in banking and finance and eight years in international education within post-secondary over five years in human resource development. Previous roles include manager of talent development at the Public Service Commission, Government of Saskatchewan. Government of Saskatchewan, Associate Director of Study Abroad and Mobility at UR International at the University of Regina. Marta's work in international education has afforded her the possibility to participate in several educational forums all over the world. So Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, Norway, Mexico, Germany, Italy, and the United States. She is the recipient of the 2016 University of Of the 2016 University of Regina's President Award for Service Excellence. She's a skilled facilitator, values-based leader who advocates for equitable and inclusive workplaces for all. She's a wonderful colleague at Beth Bridge and is very keen on developing learning opportunities that create an environment where all students, no matter from whatever background, race, gender, gender expression, neurodiversity, or Gender expression, neurodiversity, or ethnic background feel represented in their learning space. Here in her free time, she enjoys cooking, reading, and traveling with her partner, Jed. So, Martha, and that's a brief biography. So, Martha, thank you very much. Without further ado, the floor is all yours. And please, thank you. Thank you so much, Surya, and good morning to everyone. I'm very excited to be here with you. Just want to make sure you can hear me clearly and then. Make sure you can hear me clearly and then there is no feedback. Thumbs up, yeah. Excellent. So, what I try to do today to make the presentation as interactive as possible is I've used the software called Mentimeter. So, if you see this barcode or you see this, go to mentimeter.com and enter the code. It will allow you to follow the presentation along on your phone and it will allow you to interact with some of the slides that we're going to speak through today. Surya, I thank you for honoring me, for giving me. I thank you for honoring me, for giving me the opportunity for speaking with you today. But I also want to position my Blackfoot name I was given by Elder Francis First Charger, which is Akasamotu, the one who'd arrived a long time ago. So when I do a lot of my work in EDI, I think it's really important that you understand the land upon which I'm going to be speaking to you today. And I want you to know I have the deep respect and honor of working and living on this land. Of working and living on this land. And I acknowledge the Sitsikasadapi people's connections to the traditional lands. I am in southern Alberta. I'm on Treaty 7 territory and the importance of working and learning from our Blackfoot Confederacy and the lands upon which we get to work, learn, and live. So what I'm going to do today is going to be, I normally call it a 10,000 level overview of what equity work is really about in post-secondary institutions. About in post-secondary institutions. Now, it's not going to be everything, I'm not going to cover everything today, but my really goal is to create for you what I call a wind of interpretation about why this work is super important in a post-secondary context. So to help me and help me think through and unpack the context that I want to speak with you today, I want to position three big intentions, unpack what representation. Unpack what representation in the science, technology, and engineering and mathematics fields looks like. We'll define some key concepts because I know there's a lot of misinformation and polarization about what these concepts are and what they're not. I'm going to explain to you the dynamics of power and privilege and how it shows up in our everyday spaces and places that we navigate. I'm going to set the context, explain to you how did we get here because I think a lot of times. We get here? Because I think a lot of times we just say we have to do this EDI work, but there is never really an explanation about what are the steps or the things that have happened to get us to this context. I'll talk a little bit about the legislative framework. And if you allow me for one moment, I'm going to try to reimagine the university that is inclusive and welcoming for all spaces. So I'm going to start with a very quote that is really deep to the essence of what Is really deep to the essence of what I do and my work. And it's a quote from James Baldwin, which says that the paradox of education is precisely this, that as one becomes to become conscious, one becomes to examine the society in which they are being educated. So my challenge to you today is to allow yourself a little bit to disrupt your thinking, to take a pause, step back, and give yourself that space and place to read. Give yourself that space and place to reimagine and rethink what the possibilities could be for universities. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to position some definitions, as I said. I'm going to really problematize what is EDI within the academic spaces, because I'm sure you are all aware of the very polarization that is going on regarding EDI and decolonization, indigenization. And I'm going to try to give you some practical approaches. Try to give you some practical approaches that can help you and all of us make physics in your case more inclusive and more equitable and inclusive for all. So, I know you've probably been listening to a lot of theories and physics. I'm not a physicist. I'm a psychologist by background. So, I'm just going to indulge me. This is what we like to do. I'm going to show you this image, and I want you for a quick second to think about what is it that you see. Because, what I'm going to like that, someone says they saw. I like that. Someone says they saw a tree. Anything else pops up for you? Monkey, a man. Lion. A lion? Uh-huh. Monkey. A monkey, a gorilla, and a lion. Excellent. Birds. Birds, yes. So did somebody say fish? Yes. Excellent. Okay. Usually what we when you're trying to do. Usually, when you're trying to do equity work, we're simply trying to tell you that there are multiple layers to what you're looking at. So, even if we are all looking at the same image, we all have a different interpretation of what that image is. And it will be based on what our experience is, what the backpack of knowledge we come into this space is. So, what I want you to think about today is what is the lens of analysis that you are going to bring into your places. Are you going to bring into your places and spaces to allow you to take a second look or gain a different perspective? So my first question, is there an EDI issue in physics? And I want you to let me know what you think. Maybe I think there isn't. Maybe there is, but do you think there is? Wow. Or if you think not sure? Okay. Okay. I'm going to wait to see the numbers go up a little bit again. Yes. Okay. So the majority of you in this room and online think that there is an EDI issue within physics. Nobody said no, which is really good. At least that's okay. But somebody said, I'm unsure. I'm not sure. So what I'm going to try to do today. So, what I'm going to try to do today is to help the one who is unsure, but also give the ones who know that there is an issue more information and more resources to speak to it in a more fulsome way. So according to Statistics Canada, in 2010, women accounted for 60% in biological sciences, 58% in general sciences and integrated sciences, 19% in Sciences, 19% in engineering, and 16% in computer science and sciences. So if you look at the numbers, we show that there is not as many women within the natural sciences. But it gets even more complicated when we actually layer on other dimensions of diversity. And I'll explain that to you a little more as we progress. MacLean's put out a calculation to show women who graduate. To show women who graduated from the STEM programs and people who graduated from non-STEM programs, when we look at their career progression into the workplaces, you see that 41% of men are in within the science technology graduates, and the numbers go down as we get into engineering, math, and computer sciences, and of the Canadians working in other STEM fields. So, when someone says to you that there is no issue with There is no issue with representation within the natural sciences, or in this case, in physics, mathematics, engineering, etc., the reality shows us that there is a serious issue in retaining not only gender diverse people, but also racialized, indigenous, and black bodies within the natural sciences. So if I were to ask you, what does equity, diversity, and inclusion mean to you? And inclusion means to you, and why? I'm curious to see what answers you would come up with. So, feel free to put it through so we could see what your thoughts are. What do you think equity, diversity, and inclusion really mean? Anybody? Any thoughts? And you could use the app and just put it in and it will just populate on the screen so you could see it. Justice, equal opportunity. Anything else? Anything else? I know this is hard stuff we're going to talk about today. Visibility, acknowledging bias. Fairness, access and accessibility. Okay, responsibility. Okay. Okay, space for everyone. Okay, space for everyone now. When we are actually doing this work, the whole premise of equity work is really about justice. We want to make sure that there is a just outcome that is feasible, accessible, and fair for all. That's really what you're working towards. We all want equal access. We all want to make sure that we have the supports and the opportunities. But ultimately, what we really want. Ultimately, what we really want is justice. So, when we think about the concepts of diversity, diversity refers to all the ways you are uniquely different. And it's not only based on diversity dimensions, it's also about experience, background, expertise, diversity of thought and experience. And when we think of equity, equity really is about fairness of treatment, access, and opportunity for advancement. For advancement. And when we think of the concept of inclusion, it's really: do you have access to make decisions that impact your well-being, your trajectory, or your sense of wholeness? So it's really about having a voice and having power to make decisions. Now, the other definition I'm going to position today is a definition that Shabal came with, which defines racism as system. As systems and structures that exercise power over one group of people based on skin color, implicit or explicit sets of beliefs or biases, erroneous assumptions, and action based on an ideology of racial superiority. So, when the concept is further stripped away, it is broken down in what we call personal-mediated racial discrimination. So, personal biases, prejudices. Biases, prejudices against things and people and places that are different to you. We talk about institutional racism when we talk about cultural racism over exclusionary practices that push to the peripheries specific identities or experiences or voices. And when we think of structural racism, we really think about the structures, the policies, the processes and systems that intentionally or unintentionally. That intentionally or unintentionally excludes diverse experiences from the overall discourse. Now, you will ask me, well, Martha, why do you have to talk about racism when we talk about equity work? If we don't talk about racism in equity work, we've actually missed the point. If we understand that race as a social construct originated from Originated from the work, and I'm sure most of you probably know about Carl Linnaeus's work, where he created a classification of the Homo sapien race. And what he did was he created these four categories of how human beings are positioned. And he called them the Europeans, Alibas, the Americas, the Asiatic, or the Asian, and the Africanist. So with these classifications, These classifications of the Homo sapient race, which was a classification created, racism was built on a premise of which race was superior or better than the other. And the manifestation or the actions or the exclusionary practices is what leads to what we call racialization and the positioning of races that are different as others. That are different as others. So, when you're thinking about equity work, you really are examining how do your diversity dimension. And I love to use the analogy of the iceberg because most of the time, what you see walks into the door is diversity. And people could tell you, I don't see color or I don't see difference. When you do, when you say that, you negate the essence of who the individual is. But what I'm going to push you today to think. But what I'm going to push you today to think about is that we are not one thing. There are multiplicity of elements that make up who we are as a people. So Martin Sen always says that we don't have one identity. We navigate multiplicity of identities. And it could be based on race, gender, age, heritage, learning style, talents, family status, perspective, location, beliefs, a whole plethora of elements. Whole plethora of elements that make up who we are. But what is interesting, and when the process of racialization happens, is when we are put within positions or the circle of power, those identities either put us closer to the center or further away to the peripheries. So if you were to look on the opposite side, you will see I've put together what I call the circle of power, and it shows you, depending on your And it shows you, depending on your citizenship, the language, the culture you come from, if you are cisgendered, straight, whatever, you fall within a particular spectrum of the circle of power. And when you fall within those circle of power, this impacts how you are positioned as competent or not, while you get promoted or you don't get promoted, what gets published or doesn't get published. Don't get published. And I'm not trying to trivialize this, but I'm trying to explain to you the dynamic of what is happening when different identities are intersecting within a particular white spaces. So a lot of you've heard this concept, intersectionality. We have to look at this from an intersectional lens. All it's simply saying to us is that when you navigate diversity dimensions, they intersect and at times. They intersect and at times create various systems of depression, discrimination, and oppression. So, when we are making decisions, when we are selecting, when we are determining particular things, we must be always consciously aware of how those diversity dimensions are intersecting and if it is impacting our abilities to make particular decisions or not. So, my work in EDI. So, my work in EDI is really based on an anti-racism lens, and it's really about an intentional examination of inequities due to social relations of power that looks at transforming systems, structures, policies that reproduce systemic discrimination and marginalization or what we call make it put you on the margins. Okay, does anyone have any questions or comments thus far? I'm moving really quickly because I really want. I'm moving really quickly because I really want you to have time to ask me questions. You're really quiet. So I guess, okay, I'm going to move forward. So what equity work is really trying to do is to let us understand we cannot focus on one element over the other. We have to look at these elements from an intersection. So we cannot have diversity without having equity and without having inclusion. And without having inclusion, because ultimately, what we want to create is an authentic sense of belonging, and that's why justice is really an important piece of why this work matters. So when we say belonging, we mean that it fully engages the full potential of the individual so that they can thrive, they can feel seen, and they could be valued in a meaningful way within the spaces and places that they navigate. They navigate. The biggest challenges a lot of us face as institutions and public-private sector is that we focus on diversity. I've hired a diversity candidate, we're good. But we never think about this candidate is walking with a multiplicity of identities and layers and experience and a backpack of experiences that will get positioned or not in a particular way within the spaces. So it's not about bringing them in, it's about them in, it's about bringing them in, ensuring that the safe, the space is safe for them to do well and thrive, that they can grow and get promoted, but also that we can retain them in a meaningful way. So you will ask me, Martha, yes, now what? You told us all about these things. Why now? What I will tell you is this work on EDI, EDIB, which I use a lot of. EDIB, which I use a lot, or decolonization and anti-racism has always been there. But what happened in 2020 was with the death of George Floyd, it pushed really to the center the urgency of attending to these issues. I think we could no longer unsee what people have always been talking about since the civil rights movement, the Me Too movement, the women's suffragist movement, that there The women's suffragist movement, that there are inequities within our system. Our lenses and our starting points are not all the same. So the pandemic also showed us that racialized indigenous communities were highly impacted because of access to medication and good doctors and because of just where they were positioned. And then we saw the resurgence of the Me Too movement, the Black Lives Movement, and unfortunately, the discovery of several. The discovery of several unmarked graves in Canada, which is part of our history that we really have to own if we are truly going to make real actions towards reconciliation. So additionally, and I know sometimes this might be a difficult conversation, but despite Canada being positioned as very multicultural and very welcoming, with its policies, etc., people Policies, etc., people living in Canada are not always treated equally. Indigenous people, for example, and those designated as visible minorities, and I will tell you personally, I do not like the term visible minorities. I think it should be racialized or black or brown bodies, feel less safe than the rest of the population and, in some cases, are overrepresented within the justice systems. When we look at pay, pay around a visit for visible. Pay around for visible minority is 30% lower in a similar sized workforce as compared to their white colleagues or counterparts. Similarly, underrepresented groups are at a greater risk of physical and mental health outcomes due to structural and institutional racism. So remember before I talked about when there is a culture of exclusionary practices or when there are systems and policies that exclude particular groups, it is that there Particular groups, it is that there is a physical and a mental toll on individuals who are from Black, Indigenous, and Brown bodies. So, I'm going to show you really quickly a short video that explains to you what I mean that we don't all start from the same starting point. Our experiences intentionally, unintentionally positions us in particular places. And I promise you, I would bring this back to the context of physics, but I think. The context of physics, but I think it's important that you understand the backstory of where this has come from and why this is such an important moment for us here in academic institutions. So, hopefully, the video works and you could hear the sound well. Some people are born into families where they have to walk miles just to get water. All I have to do is turn on a faucet. That's privilege. If you have ever tried to change your speech, if you were embarrassed about your clothes or house, if you would never think twice about calling the police or in trouble. I think privilege is when some people have some things and other people don't have things. I feel privilege is something that you don't even really have control over. I think it'd be silly for me to say I don't have a fair amount. I think it'd be silly for me to say I don't have a fair amount of privilege considering the country I live in and the job I get to do and the college I was allowed to go to. I suppose being a white male will help me end up somewhere towards the front, but I'll take a few steps back from being gay. I don't think I'll make it to the front. I think I'll maybe be in the middle. That's just the gut feeling I have. If your parents work nights and weekends to support your family, take one step back. If you can show affection for your romantic partner in public, Your romantic partner in public without fear of ridicule or violence, take one step forward. If you were embarrassed about your clothes or house while growing up, take one step back. If you have ever been diagnosed as having a physical or mental illness or disability, take one step back. If you have ever been bullied or made fun of based on something you can't change, take one step back. If you get time off for your religious holidays, take one step forward. If you came from a supportive family environment, if you can see a doctor when Environment. If you can see a doctor whenever you feel the need, if you are able to move through the world without fear, if you got loans for your education, there were more than 50 books in your house right now. So these are your final positions. I think it felt kind of strange for everyone. It's a hard thing to discuss or even. Hard thing to discuss or even reflect on. It was very awkward. I think when you can represent it so visually like this and so immediately, it definitely takes on a new form. I think we were like all joking around in the beginning. I was pretty lighthearted and as soon as the questions started coming in, the mood shifted immediately and we all kind of, it was just silent. Just looking back and seeing like a bunch of people behind you is not a good feeling. It's like weird how you want to like hold on to explaining a certain privilege. Like oh, but that's not actually me, because like Like, oh, but that's not actually me, because, like, I had to work really hard for that. So it's weird to take a step forward when you feel like you're taking a step forward with someone else, but you wear a lot of the baggage of how those things are hard. It was like more emotional than I thought it would be. It reminded me of when they talk about slavery in high school and you feel like angry for a few days, but then you just realize like this is how it is. For me, it was kind of frustrating almost to look back and see how. Almost to look back and see how much further some people were behind me, and realizing that you know, a lot of that stuff, no amount of hard work or even legislation can make up that gap. It's interesting being an Asian American because you kind of, you're not really sure where you fall on the spectrum of privilege. I know that for me, one of the reasons I ended up so far back was that there are questions around safety as an African-American, as a woman, as a gay woman. There are just so many different ways that I don't. There are just so many different ways that I don't feel safe. I feel like I just learned to be grateful for what you have. You know, we're in such a huge society where it's always complaining about what you don't have. It just shows you that for some families, like each family, you're meant to do better. My grandparents did good, my parents did good, and I'll do even better. I do think if you're not like aware of privilege, you should do this exercise, but it's more complicated. So, any thoughts, comments? Probably not. You're so quiet. Okay, so when we are doing this work, what we're simply saying is we want to create a meaningful space of engagement, and we call it an ethical space. And we call it an ethical space of engagement. So that no matter where you come from, your background, experience, expertise, you are valued for the knowledge that you bring into the space. We want to make sure we're creating high performing, productive, engaged citizens, faculty, staff, students. We want to make sure that we understand that when you have a diversity of perspective, it's more financially impactful. But it's also about creating psychological. But it's also about creating psychological safety and inclusive spaces for all. So, in your case in physics where there is an underrepresentation issue, you want to make sure when you're bringing in or you're graduating students from very diverse backgrounds, they feel safe and want to be in that space, but they want to know that their voices will be respected and valued, you know, and that they will be able to enhance and grow the scholarship as well. It's about how do we enhance our decision-making. How do we enhance our decision-making processes? So, when we're evaluating for salary, tenure, and promotion, what is that inclusive lens of evaluation that we're going to bring to the conversation? How we're going to build innovation and creativity. But most importantly, you want to make sure that we are well, we are healthy and we are well in the space. Now, I know academic spaces are highly competitive. You want the most excellent scholar. It's all about that. But I think right now, All about that, but I think right now, what COVID has showed us is that the world can stop and change in a second, and we have to be very versatile. We have to be very open to thinking and rethinking and reimagining things in a very different way. Some of the things I've heard or the pushback I've heard is that, are you asking me, Martha, to lower the standard of how do we get a PhD or how do you? We get a PhD, or how do you what do you decide should be published or not? I'm not saying that because I think inclusive spaces are places of excellence. All I'm simply saying is to make sure that we are taking a pause and ensuring that we are giving opportunities to deserving scholars and students and faculty, no matter what their background or expertise is. That's all I'm saying. So I'm not asking you to lower the standard. To lower the standard, which is the consistent thing I've heard, I'm saying to take a different evaluative and inclusive lens to ensure that you're not missing anything by taking a second look. So what is the legislative framework that informs some of this work that we do? And I'm going to tell you, this is just one element of what we need to do. It's not the only thing that we need to do. We have our Canadian Charter of Rights, the Human Rights Code. Charter of Rights, the Human Rights Code, and the Employment Equity Act that allows and provides these legislative and protected grounds to ensure that we don't get discriminated against because of our religion or our background or ethnicity or our socioeconomic status. These are the things that ensure that we have access and opportunity. Now, I'm sure most of you have been watching what's going on down south without the affirmative action cases and stuff that are happening, but it's And stuff that are happening, but it's this is not work that can only be done by one person. It has to be a huge culture shift. And when you're thinking about a culture shift or looking for a fair and just society, that comes with a lot of tensions and also comes with a lot of fear. Because you're telling me to change what I've always known for something that I'm not really sure I understand, but I feel Understand, but I feel it may erase my experience. That is the perception. But it's not about erasing anyone's experiences, it's about rebuilding what we call the table or the systems in a different way that is inclusive of all experiences. And that is scary and that takes work. So universities as universities, we have to, as universities, acknowledge that we Acknowledge that we are colonial structures, the whole premise of how the institutions were created. We have a settler colonial past, we have been built on slavery, classism, the civil rights movement, and indentured servitude have been key moments in history that has informed and shaped some of the approaches that we have taken within our institutions. There's been discriminatory and exclusionary immigration practices, the upsurge of neuralism ideologies. Of neuralism ideologies, and also what we're seeing right now is increasing white nationalist and polarizing ideologies. But what I will tell you is these are necessary moments of tension that we have to go through to come out to create that new space and that new environment that we want to create. But what I will tell you is that power is always. That power is always at the center of EDI issues. If I were to quote Foucault, who says that power is productive, it determines and legitimizes various regimes of truth. Who we considered as competent, how do we define competent? How do we define who is a good scholar, who is a good research, who's a good physicist? These are things that are really centered around power and who holds the power to make those decisions. Those decisions. So, if what I would say to you right now is a lot of universities right now are some of them are stuck in the compliance phases of like, I have the risk people check the box. I'm good. But I think universities are moving through I call the continuum and it's an inclusion maturity module that Deloitte uses a lot. And we are right now in a transition point, which is tense, polarizing, uncomfortable, and Polarizing, uncomfortable, and scary. And really true work for EDI requires every single one of you in this room, every single one of us in our campuses, every single one of us in our society, because the ultimate goal is to moving towards an inclusive space for a better future for ourselves and for the generations that come after us. So here's what you will see happening in those. Will see happening in those spaces. People will say there's no issue. There'll be a lot of decontextualization. People will say, I don't see color. There is a lot of tolerism. There is polarization, binary polarization, the right versus the left. But what we have to be able to figure out is how do we navigate the muddy, inambiguous middle, which is the hardest place to be, where we can understand both sides, but also. Can understand both sides, but ultimately we need a third path forward if we are truly going to make this a better space and place. So, my challenge to you today is that we are all on this journey together. And what we are really trying to achieve is what I call a transformation of our institutions, of our spaces, of our disciplines, to create a more just and a more fair society for every single person, no matter where they come from. Person, no matter where they come from, their background, or the experiences that they bring into those spaces. So, this is just like a little bit of a chart that explains the emotional roller coaster that people are going through when they're navigating equity work. It's like, well, I don't see a problem. There's no problem here. And people are like, oh, maybe there is a problem. Maybe I have to get a little more curious about it. Someone's not sure where to start or what to do to make it effective. Do to make it effective, or how they can generate more change in a meaningful way. So, my challenge to you is today is to do the work. You really have to do the work to learn and engage and unlearn things about yourself, but also about what is it that's going to transform the landscape within our discipline. My question would always be: Do you want to change anything in your discipline? Is there deep issues? Is there deep issues? Because the majority of you at the beginning said we have an underrepresentation issue. So you know that there are issues. So, what are we going to do in a meaningful, sustainable way to achieve those changes? So, I'm going to give you, I'm going to show you one last video, I promised my last video, that really pulls this all together so you understand when I talk about why are we doing this? Why does it matter? And what each and every Does it matter, and what each and every one of us can do to make this a better space and place for each and every one of us? So, please cross the work. Yes, it is.       So, any thoughts, comments? Can I say a few things? Yes, I can hear you. So, um, so yeah, I mean, I have some, so I'm a guy, and uh, but I had I have some experience helping one of my students, former students, and some another friend of mine, a female friend of mine, uh, deal with some sexual harassment/slash assault sort of, you know, issues in In an institution where I used to work. And to be honest, it was just one of the most frustrating and depressing experience of my whole life. And they could did a lot of gender washing afterwards because, and one of the things that they used a lot, which is something they used the excuse of keeping. Of keeping things confidential. So basically, the way that the whole investigation was being done was just completely wrong. They were bullying the victim, but the victim could not complain to other senior members of the institution because she was being told by the institution that. That this has to be confidential and she has to always go through the channel. So she could not talk about her own experience, you know, because the institution folks kept telling her that, you know, although she did not like sign any NDAs or anything, so and when you know, some it kind of became public. Some it kind of became public. Um, there was a lot of pushback, and it was there was a lot of gender-washing at that point by the institution to show that, in fact, the head of the institution went to every committee meetings, he dropped in without, say, without making any, without any warning. So he would hijack meetings and then read for an hour. Read for an hour and a half out of a pre-written script, you know, justifying why the institute had done what it did, you know, why they were in the right and how they had hired the best human rights lawyer. In the end, you know, the whole thing went against the girl and they decided that she was being delusional, that she didn't experience any sexual assault. didn't experience any sexual assault, but that she actually had been delusional. But it was very interesting because the report that was produced by this lawyer that the institution had hired was a secret report that was never made public, that was never shared with the student whose life it determined. And she was essentially then thrown out of the institution. The institution and basically, ever since then, it's been like five years or so. Ever since then, she has been like, you know, like a billiard ball going from one institution to another institution. And what I found in my experience is that female theoretical physicists, even they did not want to get involved in this because they knew the institution and the director of the institution how powerful he is, and that he has a reputation of being almost. Of being always getting what he wants. So I approached a lot of the female faculty members, senior members in the theoretical physics community, and they turned me down. They didn't help me. They did not turn me down luckily, but they found ways to get around it. And even now, I'm trying to help this former student of mine who is, you talk about intersectionality. You talk about intersectionality, she has basically she checks all the boxes, right? She's, and in the end, you know, it's always, I find that there are very few people in the high, in the hierarchy, in the top hierarchy of therapical physics, who actually are sympathetic to somebody who had actually been victimized. Anyone who, I was not a feminist, to be honest. I never. To be honest, I never thought about feminism, but helping the student of mind, you know, I saw, you know, I saw in front of my own eyes what women complain about. You know, it was for me, it was a life-changing experience. So, you know, sorry, I'm just venting here. That's okay. But I just don't think that theoretical physicists, we are in general committed. General committed, and there's a lot of gender washing, there's a lot of the money that we get. The same institution did festivals with images of female theoretical physicists, while they would mistreat other female members of the institution, my colleagues and stuff like that. And so, what I'm trying to say. So, what I can say is that, and so if I, you know, I have been pretty blunt about speaking out. I talk to anyone who would listen to me without, but you know, but there's this fear that if you speak out about this, that you're not going to get your next job. They're going to say, oh, he's a troublemaker. Don't take him because he, you know, or people of the committee who are sitting on the committee, they feel. Are sitting on the committee, they'll they feel awkward because you know, I am one of those people who's a troublemaker, and so a lot of people. But if you had more people like who would speak out, maybe this would change. But the power structure, I think there needs to be legal pressure from the government, like real legal pressure, you know, and some really effective involvement because the way. Um, the way because I can tell you this institution that I'm talking about they found a way to deal with this. I know of three cases that they dealt with where all the women basically had to leave. One was a cleaner. You know, she was sexually assaulted by a student. And then she, because she was not officially part of the institution, because she was hired through some other company, you know, because that's how they, she, she. That she could not come back to work. And the other one was a student, the one that I was talking about. And after that, she was a staff member. And she was actually, she claimed to be harassed by a senior member of the institution. And, you know, and she was let go. And after that, she complained. And they have a standard lawyer that they get to. And they all need the institution. So, what I'm trying to say is that they have a very good reputation, but there are a lot of skeletons there. Sorry for indirect. No, no, no, no. I don't think I've been doing this work for a long time and I'm not surprised by your comment, which is sad. And that's why I said to you at the very beginning is that this is a Is this a cultural and organizational shift? Like, because, and that's why it's really important. If you know, at the very beginning, I position power is always at the center of these issues. If you, if your leaders, your senior leaders don't see this as an institutional, and I'll talk a little bit about that, an institutional value, a priority, then when someone comes to say this is happening to you, they're going to gaslight you and. To you, they're going to gaslight you and say it's in your mind. And that's what is happening a lot, especially in academic spaces that are very traditional. And I don't mean to, I'm going to say this, I'm a psychologist, so please forgive me as physicists, but very traditional areas like science and physics and math, very traditional, very structured, very black and white, very rigid conservative systems. It's really hard for you to take. Really hard for you to take a step to the side to say: have we intentionally alienated specific voices from this conversation? And have we allowed a culture that makes women vulnerable or Indigenous people vulnerable in this culture? So for example, when I talked earlier about the Me Too movement, if you do some research, you would notice there are some high profile cases. Profile cases that actually had to end up in the public discourse, the public domain, that said sexual harassment and discrimination is a real thing. It's not an imagined thing. It's a real thing. And sometimes when there is a power dynamic supervisor, student, tenured faculty, non-tenured faculty, junior faculty, senior faculty, there are tensions that come with that. I need to get a tenured track. I need to get a 10 year-track position. I need to be productive. I don't want to jeopardize my opportunity. People sometimes are abused and they do not report it because of the fear of all the stigma that goes with it. That is why every single one of us should be part of this conversation. Do you want your space to be a safe space for everybody? Is a question I'm going to ask. And I'm going to do a call to action to the group at the end. Action to the group at the end. So I don't think you're venting. I think for you, I could hear the frustration in your voice of what you've tried to do to help. And just every single moment, you keep hitting a wall. You need to find a senior leader. I don't know where you're going to, but I don't know your institution, who is going to be your champion and sponsor to say, this is not what we aspire to be as an institution. But I will tell you that that will come with. You that that will come with a lot of internal tensions and challenges, polarization as well. But I like to say, get into get into good trouble because it's the only way we change a system that is working perfectly, actually, not broken, working perfectly. So, what I offered to you today is: here are some things you need to be thinking about. How is your hiring purposes inclusive? Are you? Are you creating pathways and avenues to bring in diversity of talent? Do you have this as an institutional priority and value that you live and embody in the way you work, the way you teach, research, and your service? Right now, the tri-agencies, so the national bodies are telling us if you want to get funding, we need to see you do this authentically and fully embed this within your research process. How do we evaluate for salary tenure? Evaluate for salary, salary, tenure, and promotion? How do we find champions? And it has to be one, it has to be a multiplicity at all levels of the institution. How are you building those champions who are going to say, I hear you, and I heard you, and I'm going to look into this? And what we need to learn as organizations and institutions is about trauma-informed support. So, when there is a serious case of harassment, discrimination, you have to take Discrimination: you have to take care of the victim, and you do have to take care of the complainant. Your priority in this equation, which is an imbalance, is the victim. The victim has to be protected. And we do this here for if it's a student, we have to make certain on-campus changes, schedules, stuff to make sure that the person is safe until the investigation is done. I'm not sure how well your investigation doesn't sound it was done very well, but I don't know, but usually the investigation. Know, but usually the investigation does have to be confidential to the degree where there is no interference with the process. Right? So, but if you don't have an anti-racism policy and you don't have an EDI framework or governance process, you won't have the legs to stand on to address these issues. So, remember that the system is working perfectly. The system is working perfectly. You know, Audrey Lloyd said that the master's tools will never destroy the master's house. We need to reimagine our universities. We need to challenge these conservative colonial structures of whiteness. We have to. We have to show that there are a diversity of perspectives and ideologies and epistemologies that build and grow scholarship knowledge and research. We really have to challenge those. And it's not about being a troublemaker. And it's not about being a troublemaker, it's asking curious questions. Is this the only way we could be? So I want you to think about, is there a question? Sorry? No? Okay. I want you to think about what are some tangible ways you can make physics more equitable? What can you do? Because sometimes I think we think it should be the EDI officer's responsibility. Responsibility. And I say, no, I challenge that. I say, yes, they can give you the guidance, strategic coordination, the capacity building, but I think every single one of us has a responsibility to make our spaces and places better. Don't you want to be in a healthier, safer environment? Don't you want to be able to thrive and grow your research in a meaningful way? I know you get ranked and evaluated for productivity and publication and production. Activity and publication and produce and produce. But what if all of us decide we want to reimagine that system and challenge that? Is that a possibility we can imagine? So I've said a lot of stuff to you today. And honestly, my goal today was simply to push you to think and give you a window of interpretation that to reflect the diversity within our communities we serve both internally and externally, we have to be intentional and focus on authenticity. Intentional and focus on authentic inclusion belonging. Don't just say that I've hired 20 Indigenous scholars, so we're good. They need to feel that their ceremony, their space, their identity is respected and valued in the space and place. This is not a one-person job. This is a collective responsibility. But it's really about ensuring that we can bring innovation and high performance and creativity into our spaces. But most importantly, it's But most importantly, it's really about psychological safety. And to achieve psychological safety, there must be trust. And that's going to be the hardest. How do you manage the tensions that are coming and that are growing? Because people are tired of being tired. And they want a space that they can actually feel valued, feel seen for the work and expertise. For the work and expertise that they bring to the conversation. So, I'm going to close with a quote from one of my favorite authors, Tony Morrison, and it says: If you are free, you need to free somebody else. And if you have some power, your job is to empower somebody else. So, in my role, I use my role as an avenue to build a pathway, to empower, to challenge, because there might be things that I could say. There might be things that I could say that you may not be able to see. So that's how I see my role: facilitating the disruption and the opportunity that we need to reimagine the university we want that is inclusive and safe for every single one of us. And with that, I will stop and to give you time to ask me questions. I realize you have four minutes. I'm sorry, Suri, I realize I only have four minutes. Thank you, Martha. Thank you, First Bury. It was wonderful. Okay, so I'm going to stop to see if there's any questions or more than a few years worth of things to think about. So it's a it's a really, really, really, it's very, very, you know, really good topic and what you said. So I'd open up the floor for questions. Please go ahead. And if, you know, if this topic is a little bit, you know, outside, you know, you're Outside, you know, your theoretical physics, and that was again part of the discussion that we wanted to have. You have to start somewhere, right? And as I said, right, like the goal is far off and steps are made, like progress is made a little bit step. So I thank everyone for your patience and being here. So yeah, it's not me talking. So please ask for that. I think you're starting. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Nancy. I just wanted to one comment. wanted to one commend yourself and your frustration as well because i think it's important to have allies all around and the fact that you're raising your voice right or that you're sharing your seat at the table trying to advocate for this student i think it's important and i hope that more of your colleagues follow that example that you have right i personally i don't think if the eyes like a battle that you're gonna go The eye is like a battle that you're gonna go and fight alone. But I think it's what can we all do a little bit, right? Like holding space or making space for the people that we see that sometimes it's hard to bring to the table or the people that don't get invited to the table. So I think it's more attainable that sometimes it seems, but it's just what can you do? Maybe, like, you know, invite the person who always it's not too long to be like, hey, you want to join us? What are you doing this weekend? But I think. But I think, like, I hope that there's more allies in your institution and all around. I bet that. Both of them. Even better. But I hope with that institution, right, that they learn that. And good for you for also trying to support this team. I think that's it. That's an excellent comment because it takes a lot of courage to speak up when you're the only voice in the room that says, I don't think this is okay. So there needs to need to be, I agree. There needs to need to be. I agree with you. Was it Nancy who said? I think I got Nancy. I agree with you that it has to, you need allies, but you need advocates. And I think the issue with the word ally is the biggest, the best ally is the one who speaks up for you when you're not in the room. That's what matters. You know, it's not just the person that said, oh, I'm an ally and I wear a t-shirt that says, you know, I support. You know, I support, you know, women, International Women's Day. It's about showing up at the moment it matters the most. And that's a vulnerable space to be in. But at the end of the day, if more of us continuously do this, that's the only way we're going to actually make a change in the system. That's working perfectly well. And I know that I say that with, you might say, why is she saying that? It's completely true. The system hasn't been built for certain identities. It's just been built for a specific identity. For a specific identity, and unfortunately, they exclude some of us from that. So let's just reimagine what that system expand it and open it so we can feel that we have a space in there. Yeah, I just have a small comment. So yeah, so one consequence of these confidentiality agreements that you were mentioning is that I think a lot of people in our field aren't aware that these things are happening. I think it's good you're talking about it because I think. Talking about it because I think maybe that's one of the problems is that a lot of people in Acts will just say, I don't see any yeah. So, maybe to turn this into a question, is there some way in the context of these confidentiality agreements that like we can still be aware for other people, for everyone in the field that this is happening? Now, depending on Now, depending on like some institutions will do a non-disclosure agreement, and if you sign the agreement, it locks you from sharing some of your experiences. However, what I'm seeing is there's some news research coming around and saying, are these NDAs hurting and perpetuating the problem? So I think that I will see that conversation truly evolve. But I also say one of the things that I don't know. Also, say one of the things that I don't know this institution that you were speaking to previously, but there needs to be a trauma-informed lens, you protect the victim. Your job is to protect and keep the victim safe. But there are laws that says we have, we call it a prima facie, where we have to make sure both parties get an opportunity to defend their position. But if there are clear power dynamics, Are clear power dynamics? The responsibility is to protect the more vulnerable person in the conversations. If it's a student, you have to protect the student, even though the student may be sometimes at fault or like whatever. But the fact is we have to take a trauma-informed lens where we make sure they're safe, they're in a space mentally, physically, but they're safe. We do not put them in compromising situations with a respondent. Like you have to manage this process. To manage its process intricately. It's not a just bring in an investigator, investigate, and write a report. There are big pieces and steps to this. So I understand the confidentiality piece, but I think that we're going to see some challenges and some evolution in that space. Don't know what it's going to look like because there are some legal implications there, but I think we will see that shifting a little bit. I didn't answer your question, but I'm just telling you, this is where it's happening right now. That's it. Was there another question? Sorry, did I miss it? I thought I saw it. Okay. All right. And you don't have to have questions. I'm the ones stepping in between you and Lunch. So if you don't have a question, that's okay. I could come back to what Terra was saying. There was no NDA in the case that I was talking about. Was talking about. There was no NDA, and the student was not saying she was not violating any confidentiality of the investigation. She was not saying she was not sharing what was being said to the investigator. What she was not happy about is the way that the institution was handling her protecting her, supporting her. Supporting her. And even that was being labeled confidential, and they were stopping her from speaking out. And the reason why I spoke out in a very public gathering was precisely what Claire was talking about, so that other people could know, so that there could be, I saw it as a public health issue, that so that other people could know about this. And going forward, if somebody else were doing the same. Forward, if somebody else were in the same situation, they could make an informed decision about whether they want that institution give power to that institution to investigate their case or not, or whether they want to pursue some other outside, you know, legal or police action. And they have a right to. They totally do. So, Mike, may I ask you a question? Was there a formal harassment, gender sexual violence policy at that institution? Violence policy at that institution with a clear process? That's interesting because there wasn't, but it was published right after she complained, and it was basically a laughable three-page document that was sent out by HR just a few days after my students kind of went up position. That's really interesting. That's really interesting because, right. That's really interesting because right now, the government of Alberta has mandated that all post-secondary institutions have a gender-based sexual violence policy that fully explains the process. And it is based on a, it's actually written from a duty of care or trauma-informed support. But the change is you can actually do an anonymous reporting of an incident that Incident that the university gets because if the university has knowledge and has done nothing about it, that's really problematic for us as well. So it's because I'm trying to figure out why this was handled this way. And I was like, did they have a policy? I figured you didn't have a policy because if there was a policy, then she would be, she or they would have been very clear about their rights and the responsibilities of the institution to the victim. Because that's what your policy. So a three-page policy, no, I. So a three-page policy, no, I don't know what school you're from, but I'm not a three-page policy does not cover all the parameters of gender-based. So I'm just going to put that apart. Okay. So yeah, so I think that's all the time we have. So Mark, I just wanted to mention that EDI is becoming more and more part of every endeavor in academics, and that's the future, in my opinion. But I'm not aware of too many conferences where there are actually TA sessions. There are actual DTA sessions, and I'm sure there are a few. So, I'm just saying that we might be one of the few ones of first. So, thank you for helping us with that. You have a great day, and it will be fun. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Goodbye, everybody. Right, so we meet at one o'clock, as usual, our backlog for the next second. So, thanks everyone for your patient. Yeah, we have About the generating window. Yeah, I did went on a little bit. I said that you can make it like that.  Yeah, I asked the Yeah, I think I need to say it. So it was uh designed the solar streeter the daniter okay the brains okay that's all and he's a very very powerful guy and that's uh that's what you said that it's like endpoints where it she's not I like that also. So you want to protect the institutions. They don't want to official lectures. There was a there was some sort of serve. But actually, that's not how you do it. I mean, because he's the top of the food chain, you should not be the person conducting the meeting because then people will be scared to speak. Scared to speak exactly. So, you know, I have gotten permission from the student that I that said, my perspective is a poor person. So I mean, I think that's a good thing. I'm a microphone. And then the sports gave me the microphone. In fact, almost threatened me. He posts off his real face. He is a very well-managed facade, right? Sorry to share. So you sent anything for the one else. You sent me something. Okay, okay. So Okay, okay, so I think it's actually that one. Yeah, I thought Barry sent them in, but I also looked up yesterday, but I had the idea. But you sent away in Lindsay, right? I sent them out to Lindsay, and in Europe, we said that, oh, I'm going to send this examination. Ah, but then it was all done, I think. So, so, so I'll be damned if I'm mistaken. I'm pretty sure it all went through whenever. I'm pretty sure it all went through whenever. I'm like 100% sure. But in case anything needs to be done, I do. Perfect. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. I did it. And then I thought the last part that Daddy sent to him, that part, maybe I'm not coming to it. But the first part that I spoke on it behind, like I nominated you, and I and it was not, I didn't speak to myself, I guess.
