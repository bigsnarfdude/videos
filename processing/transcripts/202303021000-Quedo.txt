I'm happy to introduce the speakers for the second lecture of the day. We have Adriela Tega and Agas Peno from Uni and University of China. Thank you for inviting me. Thank you for inviting us for this beautiful congress. So today we are going to speak about a joint work that we kind of just finished, we hope that we just finished it. But okay, oh sorry. So the motivation for our problem is what we are gonna call is a two-inch problem. So given as both quartic surface Given as both partic surface in V3 and an automorphism G of the surface, Gizatulling asked: Is that true that this automorphism of the surface can always be written as a restriction of a cremonal transformation of the three of the ambient space? And why do we think this question is interesting somewhat? Somehow, why do we care? Why do we care? So, there is this famous theorem due to Matsumuta, Maunski, and Chunk that states that given a smooth hypersurface of degree D in K plus 1, except for the cases of a smooth participace in P3 and a curving curve in P2, we have that every automorphism of the hypersurface. Of the hypersurface is a restriction of an automorphism of Pn plus 1. And the other case that constitutes an exception in case of a curving curve in B2, we have that although not every automorphism is a restriction of the curve, is a restriction of an automorphism of the avian space, it's at least in fact. It's at least, in fact, a restriction of a birational transformation of P2. So maybe it's quite natural we ask ourselves if the other exceptional case behave in the same way. So the first one to really think about this problem was Ogizu, and he actually constructed an example in order to answer the Answer the first question of Gizatouli. Yes, he actually constructed a smooth particle surface in P3 such that its automorphism group is equal to zero. And in fact, the non-trivial automorphism of this surface is a restriction of a birational transformation of P3. So, but Ogizu wanted to understand better this question. Better this question. So, we know that it's not always true, but which cases it can be true. So, he constructed another example. In this case, he constructed a smooth quartet surface such that its automorphism group is a free product of three involutions. And in this case, every automorphism of the surface is in fact Is in fact derived from a birational transformation of P3 under any embedding. So, okay, now we have the second example and we can try to understand somehow what is special about this example. So, in this case, the automorphism group is generated by finite order automorphisms. So, Ogizu asked, Ogizu asked, in the case, is every automorphism of finite order of any smooth partic surface, EP3, in fact induced by Permonal transformation of the ambient space. So this is the question that we want to answer today, that we wanted to answer in our paper. And I'm going to give you a spoiler right now. The answer is no. The answer is no. So, in fact, our result was a construction of an example of a smooth particle surface with picture number two, such that the automorphism group in this case is the dihedral infinity, so it can also be written as a free product of two involutions. And in this case, no element of the automorphism group. The automorphism group is derived from chromology formation under any embedding. So, as everybody here knows, smooth quartic surface in P3 are examples of K3 surface. I'm gonna now maybe say some obvious things for the audience. Recall just some results of certain services that were important to us in the construction of our example. In the construction of our example, and also recall some definitions in order to establish some notation. So, we are algebraic geometers, and so for us, when we think about the K3 surface, we think about a smooth, projected, algebraic surface with regularity equals to zero and trivial canonical divisor. Also, we know that there are. We know that there are two important lattice, the second group of comohology of Rezee with the cut product, and the Picard lattice, the Picard group with the intersection 4. So for Aki 3 surface, we know that the Picard lattice has signature 1, whole minus 1, when whole is the bigger number. And also that the converse is true, that giving an even lattice of signature true 1, whole minus 1. Of sine true 1, ho minus 1, when ho is less than 11, we know that there exists a K-B surface with this lattice. So I'm going to define the transcendental lattice of a K3 that are the orthogonal lattice that become group in A2SZ. Also, we can define the discriminant. Define the discriminant group of the PKR lattice and the transcendental lattice as the quotient of their dual lattice by themselves. And also, an important result of lattice theory states that there is a natural isomorphism between the discriminant lattice of the sorry, the discriminant group of the PCR lattice and the discriminant group of the transcendental lattice. Group of the intercept of lattice. So, the idea of our work was to study automorphisms of a certain K3, but in fact we did it by studying isometries of the Picard lattice. And okay, we can do that because of two famous theorems of lattice theory and K3. The first one that states that when we have two That when we have two isometries of the peaker lattice and an isometry of the trisendoto lattice, and they both coincide under the discriminant group, we can glue these isometries to obtain an isometry of the second group of common hology over Z. And also, the famous global plurality theorem that states that given an isometry of the second group of Of the second group of comology that preserves the empo column and that preserves the space, the space of the one-dimensional space of two forms. Actually, that its complexification preserves the space of two forms. Then we can there is a unique automorphism of the surface that corresponds to this isometry that corresponds to this isometry. That corresponds to diseaseometry. So, the idea of the construction of our example was to follow this strategy that Ogizu did in his first example. So, he actually used this result that was very important to us that states that given a smooth quartic K3. Quartic K3, we have that an element of infinite order of their surface cannot be a restriction of an automorphism of P3. And also, if we assume that S contains no curves of degree less than 16, except for the ones that are complete intersections of the surface with hyper surfaces of the three, then any automorphism. Then, any automorphism of the surface cannot be a restriction of an element of this set here, the birational transformations of P3 minus the automorphism of P3. So maybe what can I say about this theorem in a very easy way? We have two cases. So given an automorphism of the surface, if it has Of the surface, if it has infinite order and this condition here is satisfied, we know that it can come from a cremonal group at all. But if it's a finite order automorphism, if it comes from a cremonal, it has to come from an automorphism of P3. Of course, if this condition here is satisfied. So, first So first what me and Daniela did was to understand how this condition here of every curve of degree less than 16 of the surface, a complete intersection of the surface with a hypersurface. How we can see that See that this condition translates to a condition over the lattice. So we focus ourselves on a case where the surface has picker number two. And so we thought, so okay, we just got a smooth quartic K3 with the intersection matrix given by an even By an even lattice, a general even lattice. We called R minus the determinant of this matrix here. And we suppose that S does not admit zero or minus two divisors. And also that this R here is bigger than 235. And so we have that the condition. And so we have that the condition that Ogizu established is satisfied in this case and we have that no element of the group of automorphism of the surface is derived from this set here, the birational transformations of P3 minus the automorphism of P3 under any embedding. Okay, so now let us give you the proof of the idea of the blue. Well first we construct the surface, the smooth quad surface in the tree, with picker number two where each picker lattice contains no non-trivial elements with set intersection zero or minus two. For that we consider this We consider this lattice with rank 2 for the intersection for n given by this matrix here for n greater than 7. And this lattice is an even lattice signature 1, so there is a K surface. But well, a K surface to spherical lattice is isomorphic to this lattice, but in principle it's just a In principle, it's just a cake of surface. To see that this condition happens, we look at the minus the streaming of the lattice. And the lattice contains elements with safe intersection zero. R is square naught and since in our case R is this number here, R number is a square number, so the lattice contains no elements with intersections in well, except the trivial element and And an element has said intersection minus two if only this very question have integral solutions. And wait, we don't know if this equation has no integral solution for every n greater than seven, but we Greater than seven, but we know that that happened for m between eight and twenty, so actually that such surface exists. Okay, and using these two, well, using this property and using that this element here, this Lineband.h has semi-intersection 4. By a result of seignonet, we have that it is a very amplified bundle. So it induces an embedding of S in between. So our surface is in fact a particle. Okay, since the Since the minus is criminal is bigger to 225 and this is the reason to any B bigger, greater than 7, and the surface contains nodules with less than 16, except the complete intersection. We can prove that the automorphism. We can prove that the automorphism group is the infinity dihedral group, where we know that it has this also this representation. We can write this as this free product and this scientific product. And to prove that, we use a theorem given by Galusi, Lombardo and Peters that says that the optimal system will pop up. The morphism of our surface is either z or d infinity. So to see that it actually is the infinity, we just need to find an optimorphism of finite order, actually of order two. Well, we find these three optimorphisms, G, tau, and sigma, where G is this composition here. G has infinite orbits. Here because infinite order and tau and sigma are evolution of the surface. So now let me tell you how we can find these odomorphisms. By T, we know how the isometries of the epic lattice that are induced by automorphism of the surface look like Look like isometries induced by automorphisms of infinite order have this form, and isometries induced by automorphisms of finite order have this form, where in both cases this pair alpha k is an integral solution of this quadratic equation. But the solutions of this quadratic equation are well understood because we can obtain because we can obtain them from solutions of this pellet and the solution of this pell equation are well understood so using this information sorry we construct for isometric G star tau star and sigma star where And sequestar where this has this form and these two are evolution has this form. And we construct them such that this property is satisfied and such that they act as the identity for minus identity in the in the in the discriminant group and this is to this is because with that condition we can extend them to an isometry of the lattice H2 and then we verify that they preserve the ankle cone to apply the global theorem and we obtain this the automorphism. This the automorphism screen. But to verify that this condition happens, we use this lemma that says that an isometry of the Picard lattice acts as plus or minus the identity in the discriminant group if only if this matrix here is an integer matrix. Okay, so we have this. We have these three automorphisms, and actually, we look for this isometry in such a way that the automorphism G is the generator of the maximal copy of C inside the automorphism G, which implies that these two automorphisms, tau and sigma, are the generators of the Are the generators of the automorphism group for this representation? Okay, so as Anna mentioned before, if sigma is induced by a premonitan transformation, that parational map must be a regular map. So that means that the isometry G star. The isometric Q star preserves the element H, the element that induces the impairment. But elements in the pica lattice that are preserved by the isometric G star have say intersection 2 lambda squared where lambda is an integral. So since H. So since H have segment intersection form, sigma star don't preserve H, so sigma is not induced by a Cremona transformation. And in the same way, we can prove that tau is not induced by a Cremona transformation. And since they are the generators, we can prove the same for every non trivial automorphism of the source. Of the sources. And well, that was all. Thank you.
