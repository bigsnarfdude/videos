Okay, welcome. So next talk will be by Shiori Matsui about weaker relicity breaking with embedded. Yes. So first of all, let me thank the organizers for giving me an opportunity to give a talk at this very interesting workshop at this very nice place. I really enjoyed it. And today I'm going to talk about weak eroticity breaking induced by a little bit of space for competitions. Bit of space for computations and some possibility to embed integrity into a several server space. So, this is a kind of kind of different mechanism to produce partial ethnographic modulus from partial ethicality, which is already explained by Tedelika and Fay. So, this talk is based on the global relation work with Hoshung. Professor Joshua Katsura in the University of Tokyo, Piero Paletza with a postdoc in Vivulian University, Parashi Poshuga in Guda Besh University, I guess, and now Totsuji again in the University of Project. So the Hilbert space fragmentation for solo is rather a mathematical aspect of the Hilbert space as the Hamiltonians, but actually the topic is very much related to summarization, which To solarization, which is the finally observed physical phenomena in our real life. So, okay, so Kedlika already gave the perfect explanation of the concept of submutations, but let me first make an agreement on the definition of submutation, because people use it different kinds of definitions of summit. So, here I want to define the submutation as a realization to the equilibrium state, which is Equilibrium state, which is characterized by a macroscopic value, by the four display properties. The first one is any macroscopic barrier must take a constant value of the equilibrium state, and especially any macroscopic current must take a volume zero. And the second one is the different equilibrium state must be distinguished by only a few macroscopic variables. Here I say a few in the sense that the number of macroscopic variables. That's the number of macroscopic variables which distinguish the different equilibrium states must stay finite with some. Third wise, most of the microstate with energy E cannot be distinguished from the equilibrium state by macroscopic volume. So from this third properties, it seems like to be obvious that every physical system does some wise. But actually, this is not so obvious for the activated equipment system. System. Suppose we have the initial state, which is given by the superposition of the energy eigenstate in a small interval of energy, which we call the energy shape. And then compute the expectation value of arbitrary observable. And then we get this quantum state at time t, and then we get this diagonal turbine. And of diagonal turbulence, which produces oscillation by time. Fitch produces oscillation by time. So, in this sense, at the level of arbitrary observables, we never observe summarizations. So, does this mean the quantum mechanics fail to explain summarizations? Of course, the answer is no. So, quantum mechanics does not disagree with the summarization phenomena. The point is that we live in the macroscopic world in which only these macroscopic variables are responsible. So, indeed, if we only focus on the macroscopic barriers, we can show that any kind of translationally involved quantum system rags to the diagonal ensembles as long as the initial state is given by the superposition of many enough energy states. And this diagonal ensemble, in principle, depends on the choice of the initial state because it contains the information of the initial state. Contains the information of the initial state. But in most cases, this is equivalent to some equilibrium state, which is given by nickel-cardonical ensembles, according to the eigenstate summarization hypothesis. Here we already see in order to observe the summarizations, we need a certain kind of ergodicity in the little bit space because we need to prepare the initial state as a superposition of many energy eigens. Against. And indeed, if the quantum state violates the logoticity in the humid speech, we observe a certain kind of non-samolizing phenomena. A typical example is observed for the quantum integral system. The quantum integral system is often, okay, there is no clear definitions, but people often define the quantum integral systems as the ecosystem of the Young-Bax equation. And this Yamax equations guarantees the decomposition of many body scatterings into a sequence of two-body scatterings, and moreover, the result obtained by this many body scattering does not depend on the way of the difficulty. Yamax equations guarantee these two properties. And by using these Yamax equations, we can produce infinitely many concept quantities in the thermal limit, which Thermal limit, it strictly restricts the relaxation penalty. So, for this reason, we will never observe some relation for the quantum integral system. Instead, the integral system relaxes to the generalized Gibbs ensemble, which includes infinitely many consumptive quantities. So, in this sense, the generalized Gibbs ensemble is very much different from the normal generalization of the random ensembles, because the number of consumptive quantities included in TGA rated Included in DGA rate it as a system size increase. So, our question is: apart from quantum interval with systems, whether there exists a quantum system which violates the ego-to-scale interference space. This was already introduced in the first talk of today, actually. So, actually there are so many examples of this kind of quantum system. Example of this type of quantum system and they are constructed in the concept of quantum manybody scarves. These models usually have Hamiltonians with the block diagonal structure consisting of a relatively small invariant subspace and large thermal subspace. So the generic initial state reaches the thermal equilibrium, but if we prepare the initial state in such a way that Prepare the initial state in such a way that large enough overlap with this small subspace, then we never observe submitation. Because this small invariant subspace is completely isolated, dynamically isolated from this summer space. And it is very interesting that in many cases, in this small sub-space, eki straight symmetry emerges, and then this small sub-space consists. And then, this small subspace consists of the solvable energy eigenstate, which makes this model to be partially solvable. This is a very interesting property. The famous example is a spring 1x1 chain. So, this is a non-integral model because this is spin-1 chain, but this is partially slowable in the sub-space constructed on the top of the trivial energy eigenstate, which is given by all upspin state or all down state by uplink Q plus operator. Q plus operator, which is written by here. And this Q plus operator is, okay, so I didn't write explicit expressions. This is something like this particle regression operator on the top of the trivial energy list. And this extra dynamical symmetry merges only in this outer space. And this makes this model to be partially solvable. So in this way, we observe the equally space energy spectrum in this solvable. Energy spectrum in this solvent subspace. And then, if we start from the initial state as a superposition of the energy eigenstate in this sub-space, and then we get process interflations, which means the system never somewhat. But this is only for certain operators, right? It depends on the operator if you have persistent fascination. Operator A, I mean, depending on A, there may be also A's of which you have. Oh, do you mean by oscillations? You also taking the thermodynamic limit or not? No, depends. We always have equally spaced energy. The question is: if you're considering the system at finite lengths of the chain of finite n, or if you set n to infinity. You said n to infinity? I think it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Well, if you said do the thermodynamic limit first, then there are many examples where you have, say, relaxation, for instance, in the exact players. We'll talk about such a subject in the afternoon, and this is also experimentally approved. If you started with a special subspace, it's a finite subspace. Yeah, that was my question. That means it depends on the operation. And that that means it depends on the operator A, right? Okay, this this is this is not actually a finite subspace, this is infinite subspace, but the ratio of uh with uh the sub entirely with the space becomes negatively small in the summer. This runs. So you say it doesn't depend on A, but on the substance. On the stages that you can do. And also it's no matter if you take the thermal element limit first or not? Maybe before taking the summon element. Before taking some limits, otherwise, I don't know. Okay, so I don't know if in reality it is possible to take the initial state of this subspace, because in the summer limited it is very small. But there it could be, so well, you can just follow this calculation. This is a very simple calculation, just uh the calculation for undergraduate students, for instance. For undergraduate students, for instance. So you can easily observe the emergence of partial tense oscillation. Also, any other question? Okay. When you spot this subspace and you write partially solvable, does it mean in terms of something else? No. No. No, it's not solvable by any reasons. For instance, we say referral model, but it's a It's a very fermium model, but it's a solvable model. And okay, so this is solvable because of the t-shirt algebraic regression. This is much simpler than Victorian solvable. But would you call aka T-chain solvable? Partially solvable. It's partially solvable. Okay, because there is a similar kind of subspace which makes to be solvable, but not because of the different reasons for Okay, so this is one example. And the other model which makes Fiji breaks the embodised field with the space is a model with field with the space fragmentations. So this model is very much different from the previous example because even generic initial state never waits. It's someone equated. Never reaches someone equations because Hilbert space is fragmented into exponentially many invariant subspaces. So each of these subspaces are dynamically disconnected. And this fragmentation is brought by Hidden Mollocross Quantity. And the aim of this talk is to explain the mechanism which brings these Hilbert space fragmentations by explicitly by showing the concrete example of the hidden non-local. Of the hidden non-local. Of course, that's the quantity. The first model, first example, which you go to filibate speech fragmentation, is the JJ model. This is a fermion model with 2s plus 1 species. The double occupation is probable, so the local heat of the space is found by 2s plus 2 state, which can be mapped to the spin s plus 1 spin channel. So this model has the concept of the quantity, which is the particle number of each species. So it means the particle number of each species never changed by these Hamiltonians. But of course, this is a local conserved quantity which is not responsible for the emergence of Hilbert space fragmentations. So what is the hidden non-local conserved quantities? So actually, they are encoded in the dynamics. So we need to Dynamics. So we need to check how this Hamiltonian produces a dynamics. So if we carefully look at these Hamiltonians, then we notice that these interactions changes and shifts the position of each family, but never exchanges the different species. So in this sense, the configuration of the species is conserved under these dynamics. So the configuration of So, the configuration of species is a hidden quantity of this model, and the Hilbert space is fragmented according to the configuration of species. So, this is the first example of Hilbert space fragmentation. A similar mechanism can be observed in a very simple model, which has been already introduced in 1995. So, this is a spin S, a spin change, which is non-developed actually. Which is non-develop, actually. So, if we carefully look at these interactions, we notice that the interaction only changes the neighboring configuration without changing the number of each species. So, for instance, if we apply the Samiltonian to this state, then it just exchanges the position of neighboring species. So, this means a set of species is a huge. A set of species is a Hilocero quantitative model. So the Hilovitch space is fragmented into the invariant subspaces, each of which is labeled by a set of species. And interestingly, this model is actually partially solvable. The model itself is non-integrable, but if we restrict the action of this Hamiltonian in the subspace, which is given by two species, then it acts as xx zmo. acts as XXZ model with the anisotropy depending on the choice of two species. So there are several finite but several integral subspaces which acts as exact C model, in which this Hamiltonian acts as exact C model, but in total this Hamiltonian is non-integral. In this sense this model is partially solvable. Okay? Okay so this is the simplest one. Okay, this is a simple. So if you have questions, please let me know. That of species is basically the equation of this. Is it like a number? It is labeled by spin of the spin state. So like we count the spin space, spin two, spin one at a different space. So it's like the number of where it should be different. Yeah, so so the this uh this happens for okay, this uh spin with uh spin with uh larger than one. So this never occurs for spin or half motor on the previous slide, the blocks to reach. You mean so integrality? So you you you I I sorry I I didn't get to your question. No, I will ask you later. So write the Hamiltonian blocks form. Yes. Each block will be associated with the same. Yes, kind of because we don't have any local conserved quantities in each subspace. So, this is simply labeled by, okay, in this case, a set of species, which is very non-local. So, I'm not sure how to assign quantum numbers in this case. But this is a point. Okay, so more interesting but more complicated. More interesting but more complicated example can be observed in XXC model. So, this is actual integral models in the sense that there exists R matrix which solve the above equations. So, first I want to divide the three local states into two groups. The group A consisting of the states 0 and 2 and the group B consisting only of 1. So, this is spin 1. Okay, so this model could be in place by spin S model but for simplicity I want to For simplicity, I want to focus on the screen like this. And then if we look at the interactions, we notice that these interactions exchanges any state in group A and group B, but never exchanges the state in the same group. So in this sense, the partial configurations consisting of zero and two never changes. Of 0 and 2 never changes by the interactions, which we call the irreducible strings. Okay, so this is a very complicated notion, so I want to show one example. For instance, if we apply this Hamiltonian to this state, and then this exchanges the position of 1 and 0, and 2 and 1, but never exchanges the position of 0 and 2. Well, 0 and 0, 2 and 2 in this case. This doesn't make confusion in this model. Doesn't compute in this model, at least at this stage. So the partial configuration which is observed by neglecting all ones completely brought under dynamics. So in this case, the reducible string is given by 0 to 0. So the little bit of space is fragmented into subspace, each of which is labeled by the reducible tree. And surprisingly, this model acts as. Surprisingly, this model acts as a case dream with the same isotropy in every invariant subspace, which makes this model to be integral. Now, I want to add the perturbations which violate the integral but keep us integral in our selected subspace. So, we found two different kinds of perturbations which make this possible. The first one is the healer bit space fragmentation. one is the Hilary space fragmentation, non-violating perturbation, and the other one is Hilarive space fragmentation, violating perturbation. Here we have four parameters which is denoted by alpha, alpha climb, gamma, gamma climb and we need to choose alpha and gammas properly in such a way that in order to keep the integral in our target space. If our target space is the So if our target space is the fully polarized subspace which is specified by the division strings 0000 or 2222 blah blah blah blah and then we need to choose alpha and gamma to be zero in order to make these two perturbations act as zero in this subspace. We still have alpha plane and gamma plane terms, but they act as zero in this subspace because there is no adjacent in this subspace. So In this subspace, so they act as during the subspace. Of course, these two terms act as non-during the other subspaces, so this violates the blobility of the whole entire Hamiltonian. And especially this gamma term mixes all the other subspaces, which violates the Hilbert space fragmentation. So, with these two perturbations, we obtain big fragmentation with the 1021. Of course, by a Of course, by letting this gamma term to zero, we covered kilogram space fragmentation, which is a strong fragmentation, strongly fragmented model. On the other hand, our target space is our domain in the subspace, which is specified by Z2, Z2, or 2,002, Zero Bravo Bra. And then we need to send R prime and gamma prime to be zero in order to make these two perturbations act as. Perturbation acts as zero in this sub-space. So the other terms, the alpha terminals and the gamma terms, act as zero in this alternating sub-space because there is no adjacent, no sequence of zeros to it in the subspace. Of course, this acts as non-zero in the other subspaces, and then this destroys the development in the entire system. And especially this garment mixes all other subspaces, so we again get to. Subspaces, so we again get weakly fragmented model. By setting this gamma to zero, we recovered Hilbert space fragmentations, but without integrity for the whole system, but keeping the partial integrability in this alternating substance. So you s how do you see that you're destroying integrability? Conceivable, but uh are you testing it numerically or what are you? Very or what are you? Uh okay for this model we have uh checked the energy level statistics. But for this model actually energy level statistics tells nothing because we already have healthy space fragmentations which by the way we can get some distribution. So, okay, but at least for this model we touch. Okay, so this project Okay, so this project is actually very non-previous because this is expressed by the magic product of presentations, which is most related to the JavaScript. So the results of the strings, this alternating residual strings have the unit two, so we use the two-dimensional relay space. So if we want to project onto the kilobit onto the server space which is specified by the relay space change with long unit, we can just replace. Longer unit, we can just replace this matrix product expressions with the auxiliary space with larger dimensions. For instance, if we want the relationship between 002, 002, and blah, blah, blah, then we can use the projectors with the three-dimensional objects. So in this way, we can embed the development in arbitrarily selected subspace, if transform. And indeed, if we want to keep the developability in If we want to keep the devotee in this subspace with three period three index strings, we can just add this kind of three-body interactions to violate the other integer of the other subspace. So we need a medium-length interaction to violate integrality of the other space apart from the longer reduced stream. So now I explained the Hilo-Bita space and the mechanisms which brings the Hilabeta space fragmentation based on the problem partial configuration. But of course this is not all of the mechanisms which brings the Hilaba space fragmentation. The further example of the other mechanism can be observed in the dipole-conservative model, which was already explained in the first talk. Which was already explained in the first talk, which is very nice because I didn't write down any detail. So, this is the model, which is actually one non-integral model, but with total magnetization and like ball moment as conservable quantities. But these are the local conservative quantities, but it's a hidden conservative quantities. Actually, if we look at the distributonians, we notice that there is no pro partial populations. Partial configurations in this case. And instead, the hidden consumption quantity is given by the charge configuration of the defects after mapping this spin configuration into the configuration of arrows and the defect which is denoted by this black. So each of the defects shows up in the sequence of zeros and twos by neglecting all ones. So here you see the second one. All ones. So here you see zero, because here we have the defect, and here we have again defect, and here we have again defect. So each of the defects picture is a charge plus or minus, and this charge configuration is completely processed on the dynamics. So there should be the space that is fragmented according to the charging configuration with effect. So I said that this type of conserving model is no integral model, but this is a partially integral model in the subspace, which is given by a state with no defect. Actually this state firstly this state is equivalent to the alternating uh uh subspace. Subspace of the existing chains, although the mechanism of the field-based space fragmentation for these two models is completely different. But we still have the same individual sub-space for these two models accidentally. And what I want to do is to add the third wave shot which violates the Hilarator space fragmentations by keeping the probability in this alternating subspace. This is realized by adding this. This is realized by adding these two perturbations. Person fit violates the conservation of total magnetization, so this violates the charge configuration the conservation of charge configuration of the defect. And indeed, with these two terms, we observe the weakness distributions for the energy nebula statistics. But even after adding these two perturbations, we still observe certain similar isolated Certainly isolated small environment subspaces from the others. And this implies, this indicates there still remains a hidden possible quantities for this model, even after adding these two propositions. And we don't identify this yet. So this is the first example. And the other example is observed in the 4D to XX3 model. The FOD to XXT model actually is a spin one half integral model. And they solved this model with coordinate petty answers. I don't know whether there is this algebraic type of petty answers for this model, but the interaction is almost like xy spin chance, but this interaction for it adjacent up spins without. In order to look for the hidden conserved quantities, it is useful. Concept quantities, it is useful to work on the dual lattice systems, which is realized by bond site transformations, by mapping the polar spin to up spins on the bond and antipolar spins to its down spins on the bond. Then we get to this hemitroni. And these interactions, so under these interactions, I selected down spins, which I didn't notice by. Down spins, which are denoted by one here, cannot move the diagonal because until it meets, it scatters with a sequence of the down spins. So only the isolated down spins cannot move, but if it meets with the sequence of down spins, then it can break. So the little bit of space fragmentation is brought by the broad positions of the isolated tungsten. Of the isolated downspins in the sense. This marked model. So now we have this integral model and we want to violate the Hillibitor space fragmentation of these models by keeping the integral of the in a certain subspace. So we added these two perturbations. So the heliability space fragmentation of And helio space fragmentation occurs according to the position of the isolated down spins, so the idea is to make these isolated down spins shift by the perturbation. And this is possible by these two perturbations, but these two perturbations shift only the isolated down spins, which means the integrality in the subspace without any isolated down spins is still existing. And moreover, it seems like one of these perturbations is not enough to violate the heli-based space fragmentations in the entire Hilbert space, because the first one preserves the number of blocks and downspins with automatic and the second one preserves the number of consecutive downspins. And with these two perturbations, a little bit of space fragmentation is Space fragmentation is broken. And then we indeed get recognized distributions for energy level statistics. We also computed the entanglement entropy for this proton model. And we identified most of the states with small entanglement entropies to be in the integral subspace. So, this is almost all about the mechanism we found software. Found software which brings the heroic speech fragmentation. So, this is these models are all about mechanism of the heroic speech fragmentation. But I want to show several applications of the model with helium-specific fragmentation. The first one is open quantum system with solo-boggled eigenmods. So, I want to consider the Linear Bergman situation. I want to consider the Linear Bergman staggeration, which is the most general, completely positive, and first-preserving one, and there's an assumption of Malcoffium initial state. So, this is written by this equation. The first one is the time evolution by Hamiltonian, and the second one is time evolution by the splitter. We set the x-axis spin tier on the bulk, and set the boundary spades at the end of the sprint chance, fit in such a way that. Fit in such a way that the up spins and down spins come into the system from the both sides. And then, the time evaluation within the mass equations can be written by the non-Emission Hamiltonians by mapping the density matrix to the vectors in the double Hilbert space. Okay, so this is just uh this is just a transpose of And this is just a transpose of the product. And then this non-Erimitial Hamiltonian is just given by the spin gem on the ring with the double the length of the original mark. Because we have double the huge space. So what is there? Okay, so we have the exact same interaction for the bulk, which is internal. Which is interlowable and a little bit space-fragmented. And at the edges, we have the non-Eermesian coupling interactions corresponding to the interaction with the boundary dissipators. And interestingly, these coupling interactions can be regarded as a relevant perturbation to the XC-spin gens in the alternating sub-space. The reason is the following. The coupling interaction is given by the The coupling interactions is given by these expressions. So these two terms act at zero in the alternating subspecies, which we already know. And the other terms act as the imaginary boundary magnetic field of the c-spin chain, which is actually integral of boundary conditions. This means ecosystem gens coupled to the boundary spair in this objecting subspace is described by two decoupled integral. Decoupled integrable x-axis spin chains with fewer marginally boundary magnetic field. So, in this sense, this output quadrature spin chain is partially solvable. Indeed, if we do numerics, the spectrum of 2D coupled XXC spin gem is superior imaginary binary magnetic field is a subset of the spectrum of the full radiance, including one. Including one steady state out of the generalized steady state of the Fourier building. So, this is the first application. And the second application is absorbed in the quantum circuit. This was already introduced by many people, but this is a kind of discretization will really be resumed in such a way that the one-time step is described by. One-time step is described by immutable propagator. Now it is known that this unitary propagator is very at local estimated by Brickmark circuit, which consists of two layers of unitary transformations for the near-signable intermarketing case. And it has been found that if this unitary gate is written by our check matrix which solves the MAX equations, this brick works out. This break-work circuit is integral in the sense that the unitary propagator is expressed by the transform matrices. So, this I don't know very much about actually. And what we want to do is to construct a partial solvable quantum circuit. Okay, so I want to construct a quantum circuit for our partial solvable Hamiltonians, which consists of integrable part and integrability breaking uh perturbation terms. Breaking perturbation terms. But here we have to be very careful because these two Hamiltonians are usually non-commuting. So there are essentially two ways to construct the Greek Mark circuit for this model. The first one is to put both of these two local terms in the same exponential, and the other one is to put each of these two local interactions in the separate exponential. In order to make the corresponding In order to make the first one in Britain circuit to be partially solvable, we need to take the second procedure. So the one unitary propagator, the total propagator for this model should be given by the four layer of unitary transformations, two of which comes from the integral part, and two of which comes from the integral deep breaking perturbation. And we know that. Right, and we know that for integrated part we can replace everything with a check matrix like this, and we don't know about this, but if we refix the Hamiltonian in the solvable cyber space, then this perturbation acts as zero, which means the corresponding quantum gets a class identity. And then this is nothing but interglobal quantum circuits. So in this way, we can construct interglobal quantum, a partially solvable interglobal circuit. Okay, so this is the summary of my talk. So we showed the mechanism in which Reinhardt theorem with specific fragmentation with the concrete example of non-local hedon concept quantities. But we don't identify all of the hidden conservative quantities even for the model which I showed here and this we want to leave as the future work. As the future work. And actually, we didn't succeed to embed non-newband conserving integral models like XYZ models in a non-trivial subspace, like alternative subspace. So this is another feature. And in my talk, I also showed several applications of the model with a Hilbert specific mutations. And now I'm interested in the technological nature of this model with Hilbert Specification. It is actually I'm going back a bit. Actually, I'm going back a bit while the joint work is Tom Spelling, University of Enovo. Thank you for listening. I think we have some time for discussion. I have a question. So, you showed that I'm in the target question on the other presentation. Where it wasn't really alright, then I see that. Yeah, okay, so ecosystem models we know that this fragmentation mechanism completely. Yeah, yeah, so but for the whole conserving models, okay, we don't know what is the concrete mechanism which brings here to specific fragmentation. Space fragmentation. So we know that this charge configuration is frozen by its dynamics, but maybe there exists the other combination of perturbations. It produces another kind of quantities. We don't know. Do you know how many sectors you have or the exponential? It i in this this one, this is a perturbable and this is before porridge. Before prohibition. So there's like a big second. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, it's anyway exponential with system size. I didn't count it. I'm not sure whether it's easy to count this. Is there some structure in the path? Well, naively there's like there are three. Naively there are three sub-sectors there, but in that top the bottom right-hand plot, the turn not that one, not this one, the top one. No, not that you know stick to the right, the bottom right figure. One right, bottom right, yeah. Is there an internal structure in those bubbles if there's some white space? Is it self somewhere? Yeah, like factors or something. Yeah, you know, the mapping between Spincher and typon on this configuration is already very complicated, and then we add this kind of three buttons. This kind of three-body perturbation phase is square with some three-body interaction. Fish is very, very complicated. So I don't know. But you don't have any independent expectation. I need more time. Sorry. Those which were the values of Kappa did you choose? It is uh 0.789. I don't know why. To nine. I don't know why. So, my colleague later chose because I guess the spending of these sectors depends on the parameter. Yeah, it should be so. But the person who plotted this stuff chosen cap and capacity at the same values. I don't know why. Maybe I should ask you. Yeah, but actually, yeah, yeah, so there was a very private accident. A very private accuser for many persons, so we didn't have enough time. Gio, what are you most interested in? Are you interested in models that are non-imotic, or are you interested in these non-ikiotic models where the subspaces allow you to do some exact calculation and in the end you want to obtain a solution? Yeah, from this energy level statistics, we already Statistics, we already make sure that this remained isolated subspace is very small, like the finite maybe, very small compared to the other entire Hilbert space. But we are still interested in what is the Hilo Hosam quantities for this part. Maybe this is not really exist. I don't know. What are your next goals? Next goals. Many, many models. Yeah, there are many things we can do for this. Okay, so I'm more interested in the parsed mechanisms. So this model we already discussed. And I'm also interested in in that topological part of the this model. So okay, this is uh the mechanism is more clear and we can do many things for this model. And we can do many things for this model. I have a particular question about this model. I see before or after, where you took the little A from the set capital A and little B from the set capital B, and capital B had only one element. I mean, can you generalize that? Yes, of course. For arbitrary many elements in A and B and it's still integral, but it's way too far. Yes, yeah, there you go. They already exist. Actually, we can embed the SM3 type screen chains by setting three, four, five groups, like ABC, ABCD, ABCD, E. And you refer to Marsalan in the 90s, right? Yes, it's called AM model, I think. So uh it's a history probably I would imagine that I I mean I remember those things from long ago. Those things from long ago? Okay, so there you go. But people didn't study the hidden associated algebra content group, so we didn't know what is the algebra behind this model, which makes to apply with another method very difficult. I think it was in Canada actually. At Malta. Does anybody know him or remember? Yeah, he was a postdoc with me as a genuine back in Malay Benny all family. Yes. But then I think he didn't get a job and he ended up last I heard of him he was moving Adam to become an assistant admin. He did a number of interesting moves in the 90s. Okay, I don't see any further questions, so yeah, let's enter your room again.
