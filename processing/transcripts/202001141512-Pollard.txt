You'll see how that ha uh comes out. I've talked a lot about this with Rob DeCanto and Richard Alley, and that's why they're on the authorists. So in this talk, I'm going to address three reasons why structural failure might not, hopefully will not occur as grounding lines retreat into central. Into the central West Antarctic ice sheet in the future and in past major ice retreat events. When they get to the central region, they'll encounter one or two kilometer depth of bathymetry. And as we'll see in the next slide or two, one might expect cliff failure at the ground line. And here's the three main reasons why I think it could be prevented. Ice shelves will buttress it. Ice shelves will buttress it, or the materialized sheet strength itself will just be strong enough to hold up these large columns. And if that doesn't work, then melange might fill up the whole basin and produce enough backstress. So I'm going to talk about each one of those in turn in the three parts of the talk. Part A will be most of the talk. I'll just briefly get to part B and C near the end. So, part A, ice shelves. Ice shells. And the way we put this into the model is really I'm following basis and Walker, which goes back much further in the literature, as Jeremy alluded to, with the vertical integrated force balance on a free-floating ice shelf. And for simplicity, just these equations apply to 1D nolateral variations. No lateral variations. And from the very basic stress equations up there, you can quickly derive, as people did decades ago, Weird Minton, I think, that the longitudinal stress deviation, the average, the vertical bar of underline is meant to be the vertical average value, at the grounding line here, has to balance the difference in the net hydrostatic. Hydrostatic force that's pushing the ice shell through the different directions, the ice column and the water column here. And then you can put in a simple corrections for crevassing and a buttressing effect if there actually is a force buttressing holding the ice shelf back. That enters into theta, which I'm going to describe in the next slide. And then following basis and walking. And following basis of Walker, which actually from Jeremy's talk, I think I should also acknowledge the paper that you mentioned by Weirdman, going back there in 74, well, whenever it was, that you can equate this vertically averaged longitudinal stress, which equals the difference in the two total stresses, with the yield stress. Of course, you can compare it directly because this is what's reported in lab experiments. Reported in lab experiments that try to measure the yield strength of ice and just use this calculated from the model over here and compare it to the yield stress and get a good idea if the ice will fail, if the learning line will fail or not. And one other point is in this simple analysis in 1D, it applies equally to a cliff or an unbuttressed ice shelf. So you can apply it to either case. It doesn't matter how long the ice shelf is. It doesn't matter how long the eye shelf is to a good approximation. Okay, so I need to just describe one more aspect of how we do this in the model, which is how we determine this buttressing factor, which we call theta. But first et al. in a paper recently computed it just the same way. Computed it just the same way, and they have one minus that R number, K, which is the one minus the ratio of the actual stress on the normal to the grounding line divided by what it would be with an unbuttressed ice shelf. So, to get the at any general orientation, which at the grounding line is normal to the grounding line, you just rotate stresses to the normal to that. To the normal to that, and divide by what it would be if there was no buttressing at all. And that's this ratio, which they plotted for modern Antarctica. And we do the same thing in our model, except we call the parameter theta, which is one minus theirs. So our parameter is zero if there's a lot of buttressing, and one if it's freely floating with no extras. And yeah. I'm just trying to understand. This definition seems to require you to be at the grounding line, but you say that you've got it everywhere. Thank you. So in our model, we only need it at the ground line, but we could compute it anywhere by just computing the normal force, not anything to do with the grounding line orientation, but just perpendicular to the flow. You just arbitrarily sit. Arbitrarily, well, sick. It's really just a diagnostic piece of our model here to compare with what they did. And they did a, what they did actually was look at all, at every point, they looked at all directions and sorted the one with the maximum value of buttressing. And I just did it in the flow direction, perpendicular to the flow. But it's just diagnostic, and to show that it sort of agrees with that picture. But in our model, Picture, but in our model, as I'm going to show in the couple of slides, we really only needed the grounding line. I think in their supplementary material they even did look at this, your definition, right? Yeah, yeah, and it does not change that much. Looking at the duration of the velocity or looking at the maximum. Yeah, you and you it's mentioned in the supplementary. It's reasonable to look at normal to the flow. Also the flow. I just looked at that last night. That's how I know. I know that. Okay, so now, so I'm actually going to look at this and apply it in one particular simulation with one particular model. But I'm really doing it just as an example. The message of this talk is, as I'm going to show, suggests that people look at this sort of thing in what are really better models than ours, higher resolution. Higher resolution, higher order simulations of future high shift retreat. But just to show you an example, this is what we did in our model. We ran the model with a typical scenario that we run into the future with RCP 8.5 climate. And note that we don't have any of these mechanisms that we've recently put into Kanto and Paul Art to do with hydrofracturing and cliff failing. To do with hyperfracturing and cliff failure. So there's nothing going on to destroy the ice shelf. So we do get ice shelves like other models, and we get similar results to other models. In a few hundred years, it's retreated substantially into the West Antarctic basin, and it's encountering one to two kilometer granimas. And notice these still ice shells here, right? They still exist as the ice is retreating. As the ice is retreating. And even though they're not reaching any pinning points to provide backstress, there's still potentially backstress from the lateral stresses and feeling the whole shape of the basin and confining the flow so it's not just flowing straight out in straight lines to the ocean. So the question is: are they providing vaporous enough? And so, oh, and so, yeah, I'm going to look. So, oh, and so yeah, I'm going to look at two times, 400 years into the future and then 500 years into the future. And I plotted three quantities at the grounding lines, but you can barely see it, so I just zoomed in on the Amton Sea region. And now you can see the quantities of the granular line. It's reaching about 400 years, about one kilometer of deep bathymetry. The theta, one minus the buttressing ratio, isn't particularly, it's still showing that there's quite a lot of buttressing. It's not nearly one, it's closer to zero. So there's a lot of buttressing. And then I plotted the longitudinal stress deviator vertically average, computed from that equation I showed on the second slide here. Here. It doesn't, the values are pretty low, less than about 0.5 megabars. These are sort of funny numbers because at first I just normalized it by rho Ig. I thought that would, I had a reason for doing that. But then I thought it was just simpler and clearer just to show the megapascals. Very quickly, it's not vertically averaged, it's vertically integrated. That's why you have to have a lot of money. This is vertically averaged. No, if you have pressure, hydrostatic pressure on the other side, it is vertically integrated, meaning the stress itself is vertically integrated. Yes, that's correct. But not vertically averaged, meaning you did not divide by age. So there is age in that expression. So I have divided by age. I have divided by H. So here's the H that you're talking about. Okay. But the the the um this is the uh on the after uh 0.5 blah blah blah line the top line. The top line. Yeah, and move further right, there is h squared. Yeah, that's right. But it cancels. So I've just divided, I'm going from here to here, I just divide by this h. So there's an h squared here, but there's an h here. So it says an h squared here, but there's an h here. So they, yeah. Right, so that's, so oh yeah, and one, and from Jeremy's paper, I know just from laboratory experiments, generally it's not one particular number, but an order of one megapascal is what you, or a half or one, you start to think that you'll exceed the yield stress of ice and you'll have failure. So that's a 400 years into the future. I just sort of said this already. Just sort of said this already: that these values are indicating you probably won't get much failure at the ground line at this time. But at 500 years, it's a bit more dangerous, dire. A lot of these values of theta are close to one or close to them, and a lot of the average longitudinal stress deviators are. Stress deviated far nearly or agree exceeding one megapascal. So, can you remind us, is there an ice shelf attached here? And you're just looking at the buttressing at the grounding line? Yes. Okay. Yes, the ice shelf is. That's okay. Yeah, we're looking at the ice shelf. It's like this. Okay. Yeah. That's where the podcasting is coming from. Yeah, yeah. That's right. And so. That's when I said these values are indicating you as likely get quite a lot of failure of the column of ice, structural failure at the grounding line in a lot of these places. So I just call it causer concern. But this is just one model. And the main point of this talk is really just to suggest and request, I guess, that when people do these simulations and they're And they're, I don't know, I know five. There's a lot of really good models being applied to this scenario. And with the ground lines, we're treating it over here into the future. Probably a couple of you are on those papers with other models, higher order, higher resolution in mind. You could just look at the properties of the granular line and deduce the longitudinal stress deviator and compare it to the material strength, whatever you think that is. Strength, whatever you think that is for failure. And that's really my main point of the talk. But I'm going to keep talking because, you know, I have loss. I have other things to say. And one is, just to remind me, I keep saying BedMap2, but I'm going to update to BedMachine at the earliest possible opportunity. And one other thing I'm going to say is a digression here. Sort of a digression here, just sort of to for full disclosure, that this definition of theta that I described in the model, I've only recently put that into the model. And before that, for a long time in our work, we just used a very simple, one-dimensional version of that. And we knew it was crude and not rigorous, but we kept using it, hoping it would be exact enough. Well, I mean, it wouldn't be too bad. I mean, it wouldn't be too bad. And so recently we went to the new one and we did tests and compared results of the model using the old and new definitions of theta. And it makes a big difference in simple glacial tests like MISMIT Plus, which is an 80-kilometer-wide idealized glacier with a pronounced 2D shape of grounding line. It significantly slows the response of the model to their repository. Model to the Aripos perturbations, which actually bring it much more better into line with the other higher order models in that test. But it doesn't make hardly any difference to the large-scale simulations that we do typically running Antarctica in the future. With the old and the new, the biggest change is just a few percent, and that's the total global mean sea level equivalent, the ice volume. mean sea level equivalent, the ice volume melting into the future for up to year 2500. And that's presumably due to the fact that the bulk of the retreating Antarctic is more or less 1D. It's not into confined shapes of basins. It's more or less obeying this. But now we're going to do the more rigorous definition from now on. Definition from now on. Okay, so that's part A. Part B is: I'm just going to have one slide on this. What is the material at high strength? There's been a couple of papers almost recently. Clerk and Brent's the second author on this one. And a similar, equivalent one is Parisekadal, applying models that go beyond basis and walker. That go beyond basis and walk and beyond the specifical vertical integration, and looking at the actual vertical variations of stresses at the grounding lines. And actually, at cases, at cliffs, a much more sophisticated and robust models in principle. And it's not the main point of the talk, mainly because I'm really I'm really unknowledgeable. It's not my area of knowledge at all: fractures and what determines the yield strength of ice. But I have talked about it with people at Penn State, mainly Richard Alley, who does know a lot about this. And so this is just reporting what he's telling me, one slide, to do with this issue. And the paper by Clookenell raised some significant points. Click and I'll raise some significant points. This is what I just alluded to: that the vertically average analysis of bases in Walker might be significantly simplified, and you really should look at the variations of the failure modes as you go down into the column. But the main difference, apparent difference between these papers is really just simply Is really just simply the properties of ice that they use and apply their analysis to in most of these papers. So Flirk and Al assume relatively undamaged, relatively new ice, small, still small, very small grain sizes, no prior damage. And they find that that, and in a laboratory, that's known to be strong ice, you know, in laboratory tests. And they can support 500 meters subaerial cliffs. Meters subaerial cliffs with that. But if you assume ice properties where it's much more damaged, pre-existing fractures and the grain sizes have grown to centimeters, then that's weaker and you can only support 100 to 200 meter close. And actually both models give the pretty much these same results if you apply these um if they both g uh test on these both different um type properties of ice. Properties of ice. And so Richard sent me information that he said I could show here. And this is, so his point is that the latter, really fractured and weaker ice, is much more likely to be encountered in reality in most places of the ice shelf, including the middle of the West Antarctic ice sheet. And one reason for that is that it's Reason for that is that it's observed ubiquitously that, especially in deep ice cores, that a lot of them contain regions of this fractured and damaged and weaker ice. And he referred to this really, what I thought was really interesting set of papers which talk about the size effect, which goes back to Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo, which is basically just expressing the idea that a chain is only as strong. Chain is only as strong as its weakest link. And people talked about that since the 1500s, the size effect. But here, it just, of course, means the columns of ice that groundwinds encounter are very likely to contain some region of coarse grade ice in the column. Okay. Dave, can I ask a question about that? Yeah. So, okay, so even if you admit the possibility So, even if you admit the possibility that you have heavily fractured ice and then this lowers the threshold to 1 to 200 meter cliffs, the secondary point, I think, from the Clerk paper, which I'm curious about, is about the time scale on which you produce those cliffs, right? And, you know, so the result being that even for one to two hundred meter cliffs, you would have to produce them on a time scale of order a day or less in order to get the sort of stresses that would produce the structural failure. That would produce the structural failure that you're talking about. So I know what you're talking about, and Brent can chime in totally at any time. And that's meant to be this point. If you have a fast increase of stress, a few hours or less, then it greatly increases the chance of the cliff will fail. The cliff will fail. But these results that I talked about with different types of ice are all assuming the slow regime, where there isn't, it's in the viscous regime where the application of stress is long. So that's my answer. Yeah, let's go to what we're trying to illustrate in the top left here, and you pointed out well on the slide, is sort of the key answer. Well, on the slide is sort of the key uncertainty is effectively what the damage to the pre-existing flaw size is. And that's that's as simple as that's the failure threshold. In this case, different assumptions than the pair sector. But what we'll show here in some minute and other figures that basically those two results will converge whenever we plug in the same material property. So the question becomes, I guess, kind of the key point. Point or an interesting question then is right up top in Richard's bid on that the latter is more likely for the middle of a way drastic retreat and sort of I guess fleshing that idea out a little bit more. Propagated up the street. Okay. I'll just move on to finish, which I could do because I met parts pretty quickly. I'm part pretty quickly, less than five minutes. Three minutes. I will go through this really quickly. People have suggested that melange can help to buttress Antarctic Arizona retreats. It does so in the Great Greenland fjords. We used the continuum mechanics model because we had to for large scales, as Joe just said, it's infeasible to do that. It's infeasible to do that with discrete particle models for longer periods. We put this model together based on SSA equations, very ad hoc modifications to represent Monage and Monage shelves, which I can talk about at the break or something, what we actually did. It's very crude and ad hoc. We calibrated it against Greenland Jakobscharin observed conditions, basically, velocities and Velocities and things is down the fjord, 80-60 kilometers along it. And we more or less tuned these three uncertain parameters to give reasonable results, not crazy results with an order of magnitude changing one direction or another. Kilometers thick ice or meters thick ice, removing a common sphere for so we use these best fit parameters and we applied it to Greenland. And we applied it to Greenland, and we did one of our typical future fast retreats. Without melange, ground line retreats. With melange, you've got the colored areas with melange, but it makes virtually no difference. And that's because presumably, this melange, unlike Greenland, is just spreading out with no buttressing effect into the wide southern ocean. Southern Ocean not clogging up any fiat or anything, just flowing out. So that's the result in this model, but it really is crude. Those things we did in the SSA equations are just simple and not justifiable in principle. And if we could connect somehow in future with discrete particle models, maybe emulate them or something to apply for these longer time scales, that might be a direction to go. And that's my summary slide. That's my summary slide. I'll just let you read that. This is what I've said about these three mechanisms that might protect it. None of them look very prevent running line failure. None of them seem very capable of doing it. And one final PS, that's one more mechanism that could help, which didn't really fit into the talk, but it's just that the isostatic rebound of the bedrock will be coming up as the ice retreat. Coming up as the ice retreats, and it could potentially shallow granuline depths. And recently, it's been found that this could happen very fast, 100-year timescales, not thousand-year, but only in this weak michael zone, in the coastal regions and baymen. And it's still back to a thousand-year time, so it's in the middle place where we're concerned about. And that's it. And that's it. I suppose we take a few questions and then break their coffee. Okay. So my question, so one of the things that's come up in discussing this with other people, the melange type idea with other people, has been that the types of icebergs that often break off in That often break off in Antarctica are big ones that can ground and sort of create local, effectively, almost like new ice shelves in terms of really blocking any sort of material exit. Exactly. So obviously this model wouldn't include that. Yeah, and it's probably very difficult to model. I know that's true from an own system model point of view. Yep, yep. Yes. So yes, to all that. So yes, to all that. And actually, if I, I didn't see it, but if I run this model coupled with the melange, it gives little bits of melange coming off the Ross and the Waddell, which unrealistically, there is a demonstration parameterization for the large tabular in here. It just seems like a... It could be a mitigating factor, but we don't have a model for it, basically, right? Well, this GFDL the systems model trying to put in Model of trying to put in distributions of iceberg sizes. Yeah, that's right. But you know, the account burger bits, the maximum size goes to three kilometers. And there is a farm distribution, meaning the majority of icebergs are smaller size than three kilometers. There is an effort to put fabulous icebergs, and we are working on that. There is a recent paper by a long-term in TJROSHINS on icebergs. In TGROSIN's on idealized simulation. You remove it, so you know idealized better than I do. So that's the level. So was your PS there? Maybe I missed it, but the implication is that if there's rebound at the grounding line, you could basically make the cliff much higher very quickly. No, it would make the symmetry shallower. Shallower. So, and if you, there's an assumption in all of this that the ground line is always a flotation, which is an assumption. So, it would mean the cliff would be shallower. If the ground line, yeah, you don't get one, if it rebounds, so you don't get one, if the whole bedroom trench came down, then you don't have the big stretch line anymore. But this is just it's hard to do 3D earth models. It's expensive and so this is just beginning to be modeled. So this is just beginning to be modeled. It's not really. Yeah. I mean, this is a negative feedback that's known and been simulated before in general for granuline retreat. That the bed coming up slows the granuline retreat into retrograde slopes. Any other quick questions? If not, let's thank all the speakers. So just before we have coffee, after the coffee break, we have time for discussion. And I thought it might be useful just to get very quick ideas about what people would like to discuss and sort of broad topics. I sense that there may be quite a lot of interest in a bit more discussion on some of these issues we just heard about. Is that true or not? Okay. So my question from earlier also about basically sort of as ice sheet models go into earth system models, how do ice sheet modelers get what they need out of ocean modeling communities and atmosphere modeling communities? That would be something I would think would be interesting. Okay. We're really done talking about the capping though. Nobody.
