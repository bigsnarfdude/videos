Good. Okay, you see my presentation now? Yes, you do. Presentation book. Excellent. Okay, so I want to talk about the coupling of neurology and traces in data simulation systems. And since I know quite a lot of you at this meeting, I thought I'd let you know that I actually retired last year and July 1st, but I'm back. And I'm just working a few hours a week, though. And how long that's going to continue, I don't know. So what I'm working on. Don't know. So, what I'm working on now, though, is basically what I've been doing last few years, which is focused on the state estimation of CO2 with our operational global weather forecast model. And so right now I'm doing a 3D VAR. And if this project is continued into the future, of course, we would also assimilate methane, move to a 4D system, probably, and focus on. And focus on flux estimation, whether coupled or not. So, in this talk, I'm actually going to go back upscale to the global model and the global domain. But there is a regional version of a model that was developed by Juni Wing Ting, and he's your next speaker. But he's going to be talking about the CO2 flux inversion that he's developed. Do you see something on the screen that says stop sharing or something? Or something? Am I supposed to do something? Oh, yeah. You should be able to just hide it. Okay. Okay, great. Thanks. Love it. Okay, so my plan is to talk about a theme that's kind of gone through my work for the past few years, and that's coupling of meteorology and tracers. And we look at that coupling first in the forecast model, and then ink patients for flux inversions, and then talk a little bit about the psychology. Flux invergence, and then talk a little bit about what's happening in the 3D bar assimilation context. Okay, so first, let's talk about the forecast model. I'm interested in CO2. If we look at the carbon cycle, it's really a coupled land-ocean-atmosphere system. And we're really interested in exchanges of carbon between the reservoirs, so between the land and the atmosphere, and the ocean and the atmosphere, and the land and the ocean. The ocean. So, really, if you want to do data simulation problems, your Earth system model should be able to represent these exchanges. So, for example, if you have a land surface model, then you really should have a trusted biospheric model embedded in that, which could then provide you your biospheric plastics to the atmospheric model. And similarly, you should probably have an ocean-embedded dynamical ocean model with an embedded With an embedded biogeochemical model, we can provide geotherfluxes to the atmosphere from the ocean. But what I'm going to talk about is a coupling actually between carbon and the weather, so basically only within the atmospheric model. So we can illustrate just a forward simulation with such a system as follows. And you've already seen examples of this in previous talks. But just to show you my But just to show you my schematic, so we have some initial time, and we have our meteorological analysis. And everything I do is behind real time, so this is not happening. We just read it in an analysis field. And we have some initial CO2 distribution, and we integrate in time and have some forecast here. In our case, it's 24 hours. And then during that time, you provide your fluxes of CO2. Of CO2 from the surface, representing biospheric, ocean, anthropogenic, and biomass-burdened fluxes. And then when you go to your next 24 hours, you refresh, bring in a new neurological analysis, but you don't change your CO2. It just continues along like this. And this is the kind of basically forward model framework that you've seen and exists in these models and also in the models that were just. These models, and also in the models that were just presented as well in this talk. In this session, I mean, but there can be differences. So, for example, we use a 24-hour update, and some of these models will not. They will do 12 or something else. And as you also heard, some of the models have these online flux models for the biosphere and ocean. In our case, we don't. So these are fixed and they're not changing. And they're not changing, they're not cultural. So we just read them in from the NOAA carbon tracker system and experiment. The product depends on what figure I'm showing you. And similarly, the initial conditions coming from the NOAA carbon tracker system. So the coupled forecasting system consists of equations for meteorology, which are not written out in detail, but correspond to momentum, terminating down the equation of state, plus the species. Equation of state, plus the species continuity equation for mixing ratio, where the mixing ratio is the mass of the species divided by the mass of the moisture, typically. So our continuity equation looks like this, local tendency. We have our induction by the wind field, so meteorology here. We have our vertical diffusion term, so bandular model bandula information here, and also in the And also in the moist air density here. And then we have all our sources and sinks. And they could be emissions, dry deposition, wet deposition, photochemistry, gas particle friction, etc. And these terms may depend on temperature or reaction rates, may depend on valular processes, etc. Now I have experience only with CO2, so we don't have any of these terms actually. You have only the emission where uptake can be Where uptake can be considered a negative emission. Now, on top of the equations, you may have other properties that you want, and specifically for greenhouse gases, we want our model to be able to conserve tracer mass. In addition, for greenhouse gases, CO2, we prefer to define our mixing ratio with respect to dry air because that's in fact what the observations measure. So here, So here we have the mass of the species divided by the mass of dry air, which is basically mass of moist air minus the mass of the hydrometers, which is primarily the water vapor here in this term. So even though we have a tracer, there's a lot of coupling with the neutral logical variables in this, and this became very, very clear to us when we tried to make our weather forecast model conserve mass. So here's an example of all the hoops we had to jump through to get. We had to jump through to get that to happen. So, this is an example of one time step in our weather forecast model. So, we come along at the beginning of the time step, we do our dynamical step, and because of the numerics and other reasons, I think that I'm not entirely sure of, we do not conserve the dry air mass. And that's our grid point forecast model. We also have a spectral climate model. It does not conserve mass. I'm not aware of any of them that. I'm not aware of anyone that conserves the dry air mass. So we have to apply a fixer to this. Otherwise, if you run long enough, you have serious loss of air mass. Then you come along and you induct your tracer. And our semulate branches and induction scheme, well known not to conserve mass, so some artificial fixer is applied after that to conserve the global tracer mass. Then you do your physics step. So you come along and you do So you come along and you do your boundary layer physics, send your traces through the deep convection shell, et cetera. So your water vapor distribution has changed. So your dry air mass has changed. So now you have to redefine your tracer for this change. On top of that, once the water vapor distribution has changed, the impact of that change in mass should affect your surface pressure. And this is an error in the Moll equation. Is an error in the mall equations that was figured out only a few years ago. Because if you don't do that, you're not going to be able to conserve your dryer mass. So, again, dryer masses change, you need to redefine your tracer. And you come along and you do your chemistry, and we have CO2, so we don't do anything. And then you have emissions. And our emissions are mass going into the bottom layer of the model. And we need to convert that to a mixing ratio. So we need information again from the meteorology, surface pressure, and Meteorology, surface pressure, and moisture. So, for a simple tracer, it's actually fairly coupled if you consider all of the numerics. Now, changing topics a little bit, what I want to talk about is we do data simulation here, so we know that our analysis, these meteorological analyses, have uncertainties. They're not perfect. So, what is the impact of that imperfection on our CO2? Imperfection on our CO2 field, specifically the spatial scales that we can solve on the CO2 field. So here let's consider a reference simulation. And we're going to repeat that simulation, except after the first 24 hours here, we never update our meteorological analysis. So that means we know this is like a climate cycle. So our meteorology is going to drift from the true one here. One here and due to predictability limits. And I'm not showing you here, but we are able to see that loss of predictability also in the CO2 state within a few days in the mid-troposphere. But interestingly, we see increased predictability near the surface, and that's because in these experiments, I keep exactly the same fluxes in the tube. And also increased predictability as you go into the lower stratosphere because of the lower. Stratosphere because of the longer time scale of motions of the atmosphere there. So, this experiment is going to be an upper bound for us because we have no information about our meteorology here. And we're going to use that to compare it to the more realistic experiment where we actually have information about our meteorology, but it's not perfect. So, we perturb our same reference analysis by a realization of our analysis error. And then what we can do is compute the difference or the departure of this CO2 trajectory from this one. And the experiments start in January 1st, and we're going to look at this difference, and we're going to look at it in spectral space to get some spectra or spatial scales. So we're going to compute those spectra, and we're going to average over this whole month. So, six months later, this is July, and we're going to average. And we're going to average also over 12 model levels. So this spectrum is for the lower troposphere, the mid-troposphere, upper troposphere, and lower stratosphere. Now the blue curve is the spectrum of the CO2 state itself, averaged in the same way. And what you see is that the spectrum is peaked at very large scales, low wave numbers. And that makes sense because CO2 is a pretty smooth deal. Pretty smooth deal. Now, the black curve is what happens in our climate case, that we never use any meteorology outside of the initial state. And this is the spectrum of the error that you get with respect to the reference. And what you see is that the error is below the spectrum of the state itself for some wave numbers. And this is interesting because this is six months after the initial, after the simulation started. After the simulation started, so there's some predictability at a very, very large scale six months later, and that's not too surprising for people who work in the carbon cycle because in our experiment we kept our fluxes the same. So there's some predictability coming from these surface fluxes on the very, very large scale. However, as you go up into the atmosphere, you can see that you start to lose even that. And maybe you have only the largest wave numbers that become predictable. Waymarkets that become predictable. And what's more interesting is the case when you have your imperfect meteorology, you get this red spectrum here. And first of all, you notice that it's lower than the black one where we had zero updated meteorology. And of course, that's good. That means you're updating your meteorology has improved your CO2 feel. But you notice that this difference is diminishing as you go to smaller scale. As you go to smaller scales. And at some point, this red curve crosses the blue one. So the error becomes as large as the stake itself for some spatial scales. And this crossover point moves to larger and larger spatial scales as you go up and down the scale. So that means all of these wave numbers really, we don't have any information about CO2 on these spatial scales simply because we perturbed our meteorology. Our meteorology. So specifically, there's a spatial scale below which scale 2 is not resolved due to analysis uncertainty. Now, this is in a global model. You can repeat this, these experiments, in a limited area domain. That just gets way more complicated. But that was done by Jim Woon Kim. So what does that mean? And this is what I think the implications are. So imagine in a flux inversion problem, you have some prior flux estimate, and you have Flux estimate, and you have some trajectory of your transport, and you have some prediction which you can compare to an observation, get an innovation, and through your inverse modeling, you want to project that mismatch into an update on your flux. Now, the trajectory for the windfield is not certain, so really it could have gone somewhere else, and your mismatch could have been somewhere else. Mismatch could have been somewhere else. So that means that where you would infer the fluxes could be different as well. And so the larger this uncertainty spatially because of the in the CO2 field, then the larger the spatial uncertainty in your prior flux estimate. And you can go a little bit further as well, and instead of just looking at the change in the CO2 trajectory, Change in the CO2 trajectory due to uncertain meteorology, you can ask yourself: well, how does that compare to the change I see from two different fluxes, specifically from your prior flux and from your posterior flux. So that's what we did here. And in this case, our posterior fluxes are coming from the GOS-CAN system. And this was done by Dylan Jones's group. And the black and the blue curves use the GeosCam 40-bar retrieved fluxes and integrated with the GeosCam model in black and with the GEN model in blue. And for this measure, the difference field that you see in CO2, it's a full 4D field. But it's hard to study all of that, so we want a simple scalar measure. And you can do something like a float will mean. A global mean, but the problem is if you look at something like a global mean, like if you look at CO2, for example, you have a flux perturbation or CO2 perturbation near the surface, that perturbation is going to be transported up and downstream and mixed throughout atmospheric mixing, atmospheric turbulence. And at some point, it becomes indistinguishable from the background. And that time scale is about three months to reach the. Reach the lower troposphere and be diffused. So, if you wanted to see the impact of that perturbation, then you would see it in very tiny amounts in a measure such as a global mean or zonal mean. But if we want to look at something on smaller time scales, we should look at some kind of measure of variability. So, that's what we choose to do, is we're going to look at the zonal standard deviation, which reflects zonal asymmetries in this. So many asymmetries in this difference field. And we take the global mean of that, so we get a scalar again. And this is two years of the simulation here. So the black and blue curves, as I said, were the CO2 difference you get between integrating with a posterior prior flux for two different models with GOSAT prior posteriors. And the red is when you take the same GS-CAM system and Consistent and get updated fluxes using in-situ observations. And what's interesting here are these dashed curves, and that's simply running our gen model with perturbed uterology and look at that difference in CO2 fuel. And what you see is that when you assimilate the difference you see in CO2 from the posterior and prior dosat case, GOSAT case, you see that the CO2 difference is large compared to the uncertainty in CO2 due to the uncertainty in the meteorology. For most of the year, except during boreal winter, where the satellite has moved, you don't get as many observations in the northern hemisphere. But if you look at the same experiment, but with the in situ fluxes, this difference that you get in the CO2 field This difference that you get in the CO2 field exceeds the uncertainty due to the meteorology only in boreal summer. And if you go higher into the atmosphere, you'll see a different picture as well. So that's kind of interesting. And one more interesting thing I wanted to show you and get feedback on is what happens when we start assimilating CO2. So you know what all of this is. The only thing to note All of this is. The only thing to note is that our state factor is CO2 state only, so no other species and no meteorology at this point. So we're assimilating for one month, six hour state cycle, and we're assimilating at the moment only the in-situ observations. So we're going to look at the global mass at CO2, and this is what we see. And this is from our model. Is from our model, and this is what we expect because we specified our fluxes, we know what we're putting in, and you see this departure here. And of course, we expect that for two reasons. One, because our global dryer mass changes, constantly changing whenever a new meteorological analysis is being surveyed. So we see an apparent change in our CO2 mass. But also, because we're assimilating CO2 observations. Because we're assimilating CO2 observations and directly perturbing the maps. So, what's interesting to ask is how much is attributed to each of these mechanisms. So, first of all, if you look at just the case when we don't assimilate CO2, we have some meteorological forecast. We come along and we have some forecast surface pressure. At the very same moment in time, we have an analysis, surface pressure. Surface pressure, and they're not the same. So if you basically, what's going to happen, our CO2 mixing ratio, in the case where we don't assimilate CO2, we keep it the same across here, but our surface pressure has changed. So we're going to see an apparent change in our CO2 mass. And we don't want to see that. It's small, but we don't want to see it. So what we can do is add a tiny little perk. Add a tiny little perturbation, which we compute, and we make it a globally uniform constant, which will account for this change in the surface pressure or the dry air mass across this boundary and allow us then to see the CO2 evolution without seeing these perturbations. And when we do that, this is what we get. Oh, sorry. One other thing to point out. Oh, sorry. One other thing to point out is I explained it in the case when we don't have analysis increments. We can also extend for the case when we do have analysis increments. And that's what is applied here. So this was our original curve in red. And once we apply our scheme to remove that change in the surface pressure that we don't want to see being at the mid-CV, we get the blue curve here. And this is our expected mass. So now what we're left with here is this difference is. With here, if this difference is what we are seeing due to our analysis increments, and you notice that it starts off small and gets bigger with time. But this difference here between the red and the blue, that's because of the adjustment that we made to account for the change in dry air mass. And you see that initially, that actually difference is bigger, what we see from the analysis increments, and after one month. Syncrements and after one month it gets smaller, but it's certainly not negligible. And what does the dry air mass look like in our model? Well, here's a picture during January. And just for reference, in the atmosphere, the global dry air mass is roughly 5, plus or minus 0.0005 times 10 to the 18 kilograms. This y-axis here is 0.0007, and the ticks are 0.0007. And the ticks are.0001. So, as far as our model is concerned, it's still effectively conserving our dryer mass. But when we account for that here, kind of interesting, can look at things in a different way. So, basically, what I'm showing you are a bunch of diagnostics that I found kind of interesting that can reveal the spatial scales of CO2 uncertainty due to uncertainty. Spatial scales of CO2 uncertainty due to uncertain meteorology. And we also looked at the implications of that for flux inversions. And also compared the change in CO2 state due to fluxes versus due to uncertain meteorology. And we also looked at the global mass evolution in a 3D bar system where we assimilate CO2 data. And the question is, is this an interesting diagnostograph parameter? Am I the only one who finds this kind of interesting? I don't know to do with it, what it means. So that's why I wanted to present here. So that's why I wanted to present here to get some feedback. And I'm sorry I can't be there in person, but there's a little bit of time for discussion here, I hope. But if anyone has any further thoughts beyond the discussion, I'm available all week and I'd love to talk to people. And I heard you guys have rooms down there. So just email me or if you can arrange to actually have a chat. Since I can't be there for the copy books and the meets and stuff, it's okay. And I'll just show you that. And I'll just show you that if you want, there are references. Thanks, Rena. Yes, thank you. Great timing. We do have time for questions. There are any questions, comments for Seroja? Epic comment. Hi, Sergia. So we do now conserve dry air mass tracer. Dry air masks? Tracer Mass is a different story. So you said that you didn't know if anyone can surf dry air mask. We do, but not Tracer Mass. Yeah, but I think TM5 also. TM5. No, I'm sorry. Brad, are you an inherently conserving mass? Because I know these guys, you're GL5 guys, that Lynn, you know, with their finite volume model, I don't know if they're claiming the exact different surface or not. Or are they applying adjustments? Or are they applying adjustments? Because if you look at the paper by the Tech Pax group, that's your group, right? Yeah. Yes, yeah. So they had to do a bunch of things. Now, what they did, they did have to apply, well, they fixed a term, a missing term in the copywriting equation. And maybe with that, then you can save in here if the conserves. I'm not sure. But anyway, you do. Okay. Well, it's a good point. Well, it's a good point. You know, we apply a fixer and TM5 applies a fixer. I'm very curious how much the fixer actually affects transport. Yeah, so TM5 is not, TM5 does apply mass fixers. What we do is we read in mass fluxes that are already adjusted to conserve global mass, but that's an offline model. In the UMS, otherwise known as FB3, otherwise known as MSF. Otherwise known as FB3, otherwise known as the NOAA GFS, that model, you can show that it conserves dry air mass because it keeps track of all the moisture variables. And I've proven this to myself. But I don't know if you were here for my talk yesterday, Sarosha, but my problem is that the physics does not conserve mass. And so a lot of work needs to be done in there. I think that's the situation with the model I'm trying to use. I think that's what I showed in my slide as well. When I broke down the time step, I think what you're saying is that dynamic step was conserving the dry air mass. Yes. And the adjustment. Yeah, then when you get to the physics, not only do we have to adjust it because the moisture has changed, we also have to, well, we might have to develop adjustments to account for the fact that mass is not conserved in the physics. Is not conserved in the physics scheme themselves. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Any other questions or opponents for Saroja? Is anything on the moment? Let's start next to you again. Okay, our last speaker before the coffee break is June 10th.
