So, what I thought I will talk about in the next 25 to 30 minutes is about left-brain breaking. And before I start, it's important to acknowledge those that have actually done the work. I'm going to talk about two projects: one set of projects in the nematode worm and one project in the quail. And I'm showing you here the people that have. Showing you here the people that were involved in the COIL work. So, Adrian, Jonas, Julia. And all of what I'm talking about is a long-standing collaboration with Frank Julicher from the neighboring institute. So here's a movie of zebrafish, development, early development zebrafish, about six hours. And I'm showing this movie because it's gorgeous. It's from Jan Huskin when he was still here in Dresden. And if we see movies, And if we see movies like this, at least I ask myself: there's something happening here in living matter that gives rise to structure formation that is unlike any other structure forming process that we know of in inanimate matter. And in the, you know, in this was perhaps, you know, sorry, I'm getting stuck here. You know, So, what are the mechanisms by which these systems are self-organized? And I'm going to read you a question, a sentence that was phrased very succinctly by Avan Schlinger exactly 80 years ago in his lecture series that he turned into a book that is called What is Life? So, living matter is likely to involve other laws of physics hitherto unknown, which, once revealed, will form just an integral part of science as the former. As the former. So I think it's those other laws of physics that we're looking for. And without an understanding of what happens at the mesoscale in living systems, we're going to have a hard time unraveling morphogenesis and other biological phenomena. So this is really 80 years ahead of its time, but I think this is a good motivation to research on active matter systems. And we've been Matter systems. And we've been studying living systems. I told you two systems I'll tell you about. We combine theory and experiment. And the first system I'll tell you about is the nematode worm. And if we look at the one-celled embryo, here you can see the actinizing cell surface. So, what you're seeing here is actin filaments in red of filament bundles, probably some of them. Some of them and myosin motor proteins in green. This is a paradigmatic system to study active matter. The myosin motor proteins consume a fuel. They exert forces at the molecular scale, which turn to stresses at meso scales that give rise to deformations and flow. I hope you can see this movie. I hope it's playing all right, but one thing to take from it is that there's a slow flow that proceeds from the right towards the left. So these are. So, these are actin filaments and misery motor proteins in a living cell, and they're contributing to the morphogenetic process. Of course, you know, we've heard about active matter physics. I'll just give you a definition here. Basically, materials that are driven out of equilibrium at molecular scales. And of course, what is active matter theory, if you active matter physics, what does the approach give us? Well, it gives us. Give us well, it gives us the systematic way in identifying relevant mesoscale state variables, for example, from conservation laws and broken symmetries, and in particular, their local relationships that need to be obeyed. So I think this is what we're looking for, of course, at meetings like this and in biology. You know, what is the mesoscale description? And I'm just trying to make the point here that at least active matter can help in providing. Active matter can help in providing a physical description that's grounded in physics at the mesoscale. So let's look at the systems that let me spend a couple of minutes on introducing the system. So you've seen the worm, you've seen the surface of the embryos, the embryos are actually inside the mother here. So Samaphrodite. Here's again the same surface before. We were looking at a kind of a zoomed-in view over here. So here you see. So, here you see the flow, and now the before this was just a couple of seconds. Now, this movie is a couple of minutes long. So, these flows arise by myosin forced generation, and they arise in what is effectively a fluid. Of course, there's filaments and there's elastic energy that can be stored in these filaments, but on the minute time scale, there's lots of turnover. So, all the filaments are replaced with new ones within just about a minute. So, that means that at About a minute. So that means that at mesoscale on times larger than approximately a minute, this is a fluid-like material. It's a 2D fluid because it's large in extent, but thin in height, just about 100 nanometers. So we've been studying exactly this material for many years, and we've looked at three types of force-generating processes at the mesoscale. Generation of active tension, which drives slows, as you've just seen. The generation of anisotropic, so and we're Of anisotropic, so and we've characterized the force balance that underlies actimizing cortical flow. We've looked at how filaments, of course, the cortex is built out of actin filaments. The filaments can align with respect to each other. This can give virus to rings, and rings can contract preferentially in the direction of alignment as compared to the orthogonal one. So, we've looked at the formation of rings, and there's a particular ring here that is only formed by shear flow in the cortex. By shear flow in the cortex. That's quite interesting and important. And finally, and this is what I'll tell, what I'll spend the rest of the talk about: the actomizing cortex can set itself into rotatory motion. You can see that here with always the same-handedness. So there's chiral phenomena, and these contribute to left-right symmetry breaking. So this is what I'll focus on for the rest of today. This is interesting also from a fluid mechanic point of view, because typically what we do in fluid, you know, if you open a fluid mechanic textbooks, you The fluid mechanic textbooks, you provide coarse-grained descriptions of force balances in fluids. You don't consider torque balances between volume elements, you coarse-grained instead to smaller volume elements, and then you capture angular momentum by vorticity in the flow field. But this is no longer possible if you've got molecular processes that generate active torques, or more precisely, if you've got active torque dipoles. These, if properly aligned, symmetry needs to be. Uh, aligned symmetry needs to be broken. These are also at the meso-scale, these are typically surface phenomena, as they often are with chiral processes. This can drive, this can give rise to rotatory motion. So, in biology, in morphogenesis, this is interesting because, in the end, we are symmetric at the mesoscale. You know, the body plan, looking from the outside at least, is. You know, is bilaterally symmetric, but that's only on the outside. If you start to look inside, of course, the heart's always on the left side, the organs are placed in left-right asymmetric fashions. And of course, which means that if we look at a mirror image on the outside, you know, not much changes if you perform a mirroring operation, but on the inside, there are changes upon, you know, when you look in the mirror. So this begs the question: how is the left-right body axis established? What are the mechanisms by which this left-right body axis is chosen? And of course, this is particularly interesting because the third body axis is a little different from the first two. So the first body axis can be just spontaneously chosen. The head-to-tail, anterior, posterior axis in the nematode worm. This happens at the one cell stage. Happens at the one cell stage. Then the second body axis just needs to be orthogonal to the first one. Again, this can be symmetric, this can be spontaneously chosen as long as it's orthogonal. In the worm, I'll show you this in a couple of minutes. This is the second cell divisions that give rise to a dorsal ventrally asymmetric cell cell arrangement. And now you've got a plane. You've got a plane set up by these two axes. Two axes. And with the left-right body axis, you're going to have to make a choice. Where do you put the heart? You put it on this side or on this side. And of course, the remarkable question that has gotten physicists and biologists interested in this problem for decades, obviously, is how does this happen in a consistent way? What are the mechanisms that help us choose the body access? Essentially, you know, one in a thousand can be wrong. You know, there are acetos and people can grow up with the heart on the right side. And this is not a medical condition. The 90-year-old can go to the doctor and then the doctor can check for the heartbeat. And then the doctor says, well, you shouldn't be here because I can't hear anything. And then he checks on the other side and it's all fine. So this is really a symmetry breaking event. And everything downstream will then happen according to it. And if it's flipped, it's It's not a pathology. So that's the question really: how do we make this choice in a consistent manner? And this requires a chiral activity. Perhaps you're aware of the famous Louis-Wolpert F molecule, a chiral molecule, something that is responsible for transforming some chiral object that is at the molecular scale or something. Is you know at the molecular scale or some parallel activity at the molecular scale that is somehow scaled up to the meso scale in order to help make this choice in a consistent manner. And what I'm going to tell you is that it's actimized in talk generation, perhaps, at least in some systems. So how does it work in mouse? How does it probably work in us? Well, it's the cilia in a structure called ventral node. Cells have cilia, cilia are chiral objects and they can undergo a chiral object. Are chiral objects and they can undergo a chiral beat. They're tilted in a particular, you know, you know, they have a chiral beat. They're tilted in the anterior posterior direction. And that, you know, somehow that together, I'm not going to go into detail, because the cilia are tilted, this gives rise to a left-right asymmetric flow of morphogens, which then gives rise to left-right asymmetric patterning. So, but that's not the end of the story. So, but that's not the end of the story. You know, this work with the Cilia started a little bit more than 20 years ago, and everyone, or at least some, thought that was perhaps the end of the line. But in the last 20 years, we've realized that there's multiple ways of breaking left-right symmetry during development. The organs break left-right symmetry themselves. The gut is wound around the body cavity in a chiral fashion. And many, perhaps, some, perhaps, you know, if not many of these probably rely on other. Of these probably rely on other types of symmetry-breaking events, and maybe some of these are related to actomycin. And in particular, I'm going to tell you that nematode worms and birds, they do it differently. They don't involve cilia. So let's start with the worm. Again, back to the actomycin corticolaya of the one cell stage C. elegans embryo. And what we could show is that the left-right body axis in the end comes about by torque generation. comes about by torque generation in this structure. But let me first take you through how the body axis are established in the worm. So the one cell embryo that I showed you before is called P0. If we're now looking from the right, you know, there's an asymmetric cell division. There's a larger cell on one side, there's a smaller cell on the other side. And this sets up the major, the head-to-tail body axis. And in fact, there are talks that rotatory flows associated. Flows associated with this first cell division. I didn't really show you. I'll show you some more later, some more visible examples. But this is at the one cell stage. The second body axis is not yet established. So obviously, this is not involved in choosing the left-right body axis. So here are these flows prior to the first cell division. And they're mostly on-axis from tail to head, if you wish, but maybe you can. Uh, tail to head, if you wish, but maybe you can see there's a slight chiral component. In particular, it's always the same direction. We can do genetic changes, um, so there's a slight chiral component which can be greatly exaggerated, for example, by playing with row A activity. So, now this flow is hyperchiral again, always the same-handedness. If you look from the so we're looking at a surface of a one-cell embryo, I should say this is about 50 microns long. This is Microns long. This is really an egg-like structure. And if you look from the future tail, if you look from this tip, you know, it's always counterclockwise rotation. So how does this rotation come about? Well, it comes from active. So these movements come from active tension and active torque generation. So there's an angular momentum exchange with the substrate, with the cell membrane, and/or the cell inside. And this gives rise. And this gives rise to rotatory movement or a torque generated by each surface element. And if you've got all the surface elements generating equal amounts of torques, then of course you're not going to rotate. But if there's an active torque density gradient along a particular direction, then the torques at these lines, at these blue lines, there's a stronger downward. You know, so the surface element to the left exerts a stronger torque than a surface element on the right, and that is going to give rise to a flow that's orthogonal to the active torque gradient. That's the point I'm trying to make here. So that's exactly what we see. We have an active torque density gradient along the head-to-tail axis, and this is going to give rise to flows orthogonal to this torque gradient. This can be captured in an active fluid. Fluid, active chiral fluid descriptions where we can look at where the myosin is and we can quantitatively relate the myosin distribution along the head-to-tail axis with the flow fields with the X component along the axis and the Y component in blue in the Y direction, the chiral component. So, and maybe the last point I'd like to make here is that there's two molecules involved. Is that there's two molecules involved in active torque generation? This is both foreign and myosin, and Rho A controls both formin and myosin, which is why we see exaggerated chiral flows under Rho A perturbations. But these are things we're still investigating how exactly molecularly active talk, what the molecular model is of how active talks are generated. Perhaps it involves patches of rho A is what the point I want to make here. Patches of rho A is what the point I want to make here. Okay, so this is the one cell stage. Now, if we move on to the next cell, so I'm going to taking you through the lineage here a little bit. So, this is P0 that divides into AB cell on the, you know, on the anterior, the head region. The P1 cell, these then divide again. So, this is also germline soma differentiation. So, the AB cell is the daughter cell. The AB cell is the daughter cell of all the somatic tissue, and the P1 cell is basically the germline precursor. So, this is germline somo differentiation at the one cell stage. And this arrangement now breaks dorsal ventral, you know, sets up the second body axis. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to rotate the view and we're going to look from dorsal. Okay. And then from dorsal, you see these two cells here. One will divide like this, the other will divide like this, AB anterior, AB posterior. This AB anterior, AB posterior. At this stage, now we've got the plane set up, but we haven't made the left-right body access choice. And this choice, and this is known for 30 years, is made by a shift of these two cell doublets. So these two cell doublets undergo about a 20-degree shift, and that gives rise to a left-right asymmetric cell cell contact pattern. Cell cell contact pattern. These two cells touch, and this cell and this cell doesn't touch. And this is then somehow amplified by non-confidential wind signaling, amongst others. And this is basically the left-right symmetry breaking event, this 20-degree skew of these cell doublets. And what we could show is that the skew is driven by actimize and torque generation. When we play with actimize and torque generation, we play with the skew. We play with the skew. And the way that we think that this works is that this is a doublet that's counter-rotating as the cell divides. And, you know, if you're counter-spinning, like a segue on below, there's the EMS cell above, there's the vitellin membrane. The vitellin membrane has little friction. Below, there's significant friction with the other cells inside this rigid eggshell. This is going to give rise to a rotation. Rise to a rotation to exactly the skew of the two-spelled doublets. All right. With this, maybe the last thing I'd say is, you know, we're still investigating these consequences because, quite remarkably, you know, we see these counter-rotating flows during various cell divisions, but there's a perfect agreement with the body act. Sorry, with the perfect. That's perfect. So, all the whole AB lineage, all the somatic tissue counter-rotates during cell divisions, while all the germline precursor, this germline P1 precursor lineage does not counter rotate during cell divisions. So, this is under tight development control. So, we're still trying to understand the consequences of these. It's just a point I wanted to make. Okay, Doke, in the last couple of minutes, let me switch to Bert. Let me switch to birds, to the topic of quails, because, and I should say this is a collaboration with Jerome Groller at Pasteur. How do birds break left-right symmetry? Well, they don't use cilia. They also probably use an actimoisin-based system. But before we get there, let me tell you. So, what you're looking at is now the development, early development of quail. A quail is similar to chick. A quality similar to chick. And you're seeing thousands of cells. There's a flow that forms a structure that's known as the primitive streak. This happens on the yolk surface. If you remember your Sunday egg, you've got the egg yolk, and the embryo develops on the inside of the yolk, essentially for much of early development in a quasi-to-duty type of way. In a quasi-2D type of way. So, this is 2D, almost 2D development of structures, at least for some part. So, left-right symmetry is broken at the tip of this primitive streak that forms. This tip of the streak is called Henson's node. And as the node retracts, there is a prominent rotation of the whole tissue around that node. I'm showing it here. I'm showing it here at higher magnification. So here's the streak, here's the node. And I hope you can see that there's a rotation of that tissue. I'm going to play that movie again. There's a kind of a kink structure that forms of that tissue. So again, here's the streak. Here's the node. And the movie flashes kind of when the node rotation starts. That gives rise to a kind of a kink shape of this. Of this streak. So here are flow fields that perhaps illustrate. You know, you can see there's a tissue rotation here. Maybe we can even identify the point around which it rotates. So the question we've been asking ourselves is how does this tissue rotation come about? Perhaps before I go there, this rotation then gives rise to a left-right asymmetric gene expression, in particular in terms of sonic head shock. In terms of sonic headshock. And this is what then sets off a cascade to solidify this local broken, sorry, this symmetry breaking choice. So how does a tissue rotation come about? Is it locally driven? Is it globally driven? And what's the role of the node? And I'm just going to give you a little bit of a vignette of where we are with this project. We started by just measuring flow fields. Measuring flow fields and decomposing these flow fields into left-right symmetric and left-right anti-symmetric components. So, here's the average flow field in the frame of reference with the node. So, you could see that the node retracts. So, we're just going to move to the local frame of reference, to a local frame of reference co-moving with the node. You can see that mainly this flows into the streak. I'm showing you this over time. You know, and time zero is onset of node retraction. Zero is onset of node retraction. And if we now look at it, you know, at around the time when the node retracts, we can decompose this flow field into a left-right symmetric flow field and a left-right anti-symmetric flow field. And you can see, in particular, in the left-right anti-symmetric flow field, the speeds are, you know, the velocity scale is changed by a factor of 10. So there's huge flows, but there is a prominent rotation, and as you could see also in the movie, I hope before. Also in the movie, I hope before. So, how does this left-right anti-Symmetric metric component of the flow field come about? How do streak and node orchestrate these flows? To address this, we looked at, we, you know, this is work by a shared PhD student between Frank and myself, Jonas. We devised a physical model where we looked at boundary effects in what you might call track physics. So, we looked, we investigated. We investigated flows within a 2D fluid film, you know, within a complicated 1D boundary. So we took a circular boundary around the node, but then we made this boundary more complicated by following the streak and the node. Okay, so the boundary that we're investigating is exactly this: round the node, up and round up the streak, around the node, and back down. And the idea And the idea is: so, the question that we could ask: can we account for the flows in this 2D tissue, in this effectively 2D fluid-like tissue, just from the boundary flows, just from the flow velocities at the boundaries. So, I'm going to give you a 1D example of how we investigate this, but just keep in mind that this is a 2D problem and we treat it as 2D. And we treat it as 2D. So let's look along that line with these two boundaries. There's a boundary velocity here, there's a boundary velocity here, the inner side at the streak. And these are the boundary velocities. And the question is, can we account for the fluid flows inside given the measured fluid flows at the boundary? And we pursue this in the same active matter description we use for the actinomizing cortex, a simple active matter fluid description with active. With active tension gradients driving tissue flows against viscous dissipation and frictional losses, there's a substrate. So there's active tension. If there's active tension gradients, these red arrows, then you're going to, you know, this is going to generate flows or local contributions to the flow field. And this all happens in contact with the substrate. So that sets, you know, viscosity and friction. Sets, you know, viscosity and friction set a length scale. So, the question really is: if we can account, can we account for flows in the tissue from the boundaries? Can we do this in the context of a passive fluid? Or do we need active contributions? Are there active tensions and active torque gradients inside this tissue? Or is everything boundary-driven? That's really the question that we're asking. Is this effective? The question that we're asking: Is this effectively a passive fluid that's driven by the boundary, or is this fluid, you know, our fluid flows mainly generated inside the tissue? So, does it really behave as a passive fluid film? So, to now answer this question, we measured the boundary fluid, we measured the flow velocities around this complicated, around this complex boundary, and then just calculated the expected flow given the boundary flows. And then here I'm plotting. And then here I'm plotting you the residual to the measured flow field inside the tissue film. And you can see here that for the symmetric, for the left-right symmetric flow field, the residuals are very small. So we can account for tissue flow in the plane by the boundary flows. And in fact, the same is true for the anti-symmetric flow field. So the calculated flow field and the measured one. So, the calculated flow field and the measured one greatly, the residuals are very small, they are very similar. In fact, if we don't take this complex boundary inside, but only try to relate the tissue flow that arises from the circular boundary, but not the primitive streak and the node, then we do not capture this rotation around the node. And the residuals are, in fact, you know, this is not a good agreement. You know, this is not a good agreement. The residuals are large, in particular, in that rotating node region close to the node. So, the API blast behaves as a passive fluid film. Left-right symmetry is broken at the boundaries. And now, in the last couple of minutes, let me just give you our summary of how we think that these flows come about, how these rotations and torques come about. Well, since everything's boundary-driven, we can just read off boundary tensions and boundary torque densities. Boundary torque densities. So, you know, we can integrate up the forces and the torques around the node. So, this is essentially the torque that is driving tissue flow close to the node, is generated at the node is the statement that we're making. And finally, the last question: how are the torques generated at the node? Well, if you think about this, you're going to have to exert, inject angular momentum into Angular momentum into the epiglast. And to do this, you need to generate torque against something against a substrate. Well, this is a double-layered epithelium. There's quite a dense structure. There's also lots of collagen. You know, there's an invagination that comes about at the streak. So we were wondering if the torque is really generated across the node and in particular would require a contact to the underlying hyperblast. So how to test this? Well, is to scrape off. So, how to test this? Well, is to scrape off, to remove that tissue at the bottom. Then, these node rotations should cease, should no longer exist. And, you know, the torques, you can't generate a count. So basically, the question is, is this torque that drives epiblast rotation around the node, is it generated across the node in the Z direction, if you wish? So, here, this is a bit of a crazy experiment, but this is the power of chick and quail. You can do Do significant perturbations. Here's an unscraped control. You see the epiblast, you see the underlying hypoblast. It's making a mesenchyme in between. We can scrape all of this off. It's a tricky experiment that Adrian did. And then here again, I'm showing you the consequence. First, the unscraped control. You see this tissue rotation that gives rise to a kink. A scraped embryo, we don't see rotations in 10 out of 16 embryos. In 10 out of 16 embryos. I hope you can agree with me that there's significantly reduced chiral flow if we scrape off the underlying hypoblast. After about two hours, it depends on when you do it. I won't go into details. You know, two, three hours of this tissue will regrow and then the talks and the rotations will re-emerge. But for a time window of two to three hours, there's reduced chiral tissue flow. This is quantified here. So it doesn't go to zero. This is tricky. Is it doesn't go to zero. This is tricky experiments, but the scraping leads to a significant decrease in the cumulative rotation around the node. And in fact, we can recover this by adding an artificial substrate. We can take the vitellin membrane from another embryo and put it on instead of this tissue, and this does rescue. Okay, so that's quite interesting. It's a little more clearer when we measure this kink angle just by eye manually. By eye manually. So, this kink angle is the product of the rotation, as we presume, and it's you know, this angle is about 140 degrees, and it goes much closer to 180 when we remove the underlying tissue. Okay, so that's it. Here's the summary. Left-right symmetry breaking in quails is driven by local torque generation at the node. And for this, the node might need, or probably needs to be connected with the hyperblasp. Probably needs to be connected with the hypoplasm to generate a thyroid tissue flow. So, this is what I talked about. If there's one thing perhaps to remember is that left-right asymmetric structure formation in biology can be captured in the framework of active chiral fluids. You know, maybe all of this in light of this initial statement. And with this, I'll stop. This, I'll stop.
