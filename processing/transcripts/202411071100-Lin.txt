Organizer opportunity for me to talk here. Before my talk, I would like to also advertise one of the program in Belfast next summer. It's supported by the Newton Institute based in Cambridge. And we are going to run one month's program in Belfast next summer. There were going to be a summary course and also a week of conference. And more details are going to be announced very shortly. That's all this is the title of the program and the date. It's next summer in 2025. There are many speakers. There are many speakers here, but many of you are literally all of you are welcome if you like just to join. Thank you. Okay, so back to my talk. I'm going to talk about semi-Katan sub-algebras, about the twistful coexistence algebra. And I know the Katan sub-algebra has been mentioned a lot, it's the main theme of this conference. And my aim of this talk is basically going to show you first we can this kind of generation that we can talk about the category. That we can talk about the catalog sub-algebra of the blue point, which do not necessarily be effective. That's the aim. And that's a joint work with Tristan Weiss and Miss Clark and Catherine McColl. I know everybody knows that. I will just quickly show that so that I can do the comparison of my own statement. So that was the classical Katampe in CISA algebra, and then I, instead of And then I, instead of C and B, I use A and B. So A will stay in the beta sister algebra, and B will be the sub-algebra, the Katana sub-algebra sitting inside this C-star algebra. And then we know the definition among that is the base regularity and base and MASA and also have the original part of the definition. They also have the approximation identity, and the conditional expectation is the phase format. Okay, just jump it. Jump it. And then a C from my title, I'm going to talk about twist Buco AC star dra. And I know this notion has been talked a lot in the conference as well. But I just also want to quickly remind what this twist GoPoise has been defined. And then I'm going to give our notion of the twist coupon and then refer to some of the work that has been done by the colleague here. So I will talk, yeah, I will use this notation sigma, which is how. This notation sigma, which is a house of topological group point, and then we call it a group point have a t-action or the circle is unit circle is acting on this group point sigma. If there is a free continuous action from the unit circle, satisfy the following condition. And then what we mean by a twist simply is just a continuous open group homomorphism from this sigma onto the good point tree we start with. Okay, and then as I said, And then, as I say, this sigma is a T group point, and then the original group point I start with, this capital G will be a locally compact power of a capital group point. And then, moreover, when we say this, either I denote by this Q or I just simply call the sigma itself this trace over G, basically satisfy the following transitivity property, at least just here, of the fiber term. Of the fiber. And so that's our way of defining a place. And actually, this is equivalent to most of the leader chair, the definition of a leader chair. And then, so I think in many of the talks, I think David's talk also talk about the twist satisfies the central condition. That exactly the first item. Once we have such a twist, then they did a good point isomorphism from the unit circle across the unit space to the pre-image of unit circle. Chill the pre-image of medium space through this twist cube, I must satisfy this central condition. And secondly, it was mentioned by a paper by Kristen, Anna, and Marina Ostrat, and then Maria about this map in a proper map simply means that the image of compact side is compact. And then from our definition, actually, this properness of the map can be shown to be proved quite. Automatic can be proved quite easily. So, in the sense, at least being a proper map is automatic. And then, moreover, as you can see originally, I start with a Google IG which is locally compact and house of. However, once we define twist in that way, then the sigma is automatically be locally compact as well. So, in the sense, yeah, the com local compactness of the twist uh this bigger of yeah, this quotient uh group point is automatically be locally compared. is automatically be locally compared. And then again, another quick slide just recap what a twist Google sees to enter. And then first we know that yes, basically we just collect those T covariant functions defined on the sigma, the Google Sigma. And then this usual notation will denote the continuous function defined on sigma which with compass port and then we can make it into a start algebra simply. Can make it into a start algebra simply by define the convolution and the involution in the standard way, encoding the twist. So once we have a twist from sigma to g, then we can look into those sections from g to sigma. Then once we have these sections, we can actually use this section to rewrite the convolutional product of the CC of sigma G. And then once we take a closure of this convolutional Closure of these continuous functions support on sigma, then this gives rise to reduced twist group policy star algebra. I just show this slide again, as I said, for the comparison of our coming definition. So if I reformulate what my first slide has been written, then basically yes, I do have this button pair A and B. A is Sisa algebra, B is MASA sitting side A, and then satisfy the following condition. We know that. Inside the other condition, we know that B is answered as I just say. Second condition is the regularity, simply means that I look into the C-star normalizer, which is the C-star normalizer, which the span of it is dense in the C-star algebra A. Moreover, we do have this phase of confusion explanation from the C-star algebra A to B. And what we are going to do, the way we talk about this semi-cartan, basically we would like to relax some of those conditions. And namely, we are going to We are going to look into the sub-algebra just need to be abelian, they need to be maximum. That's one condition we would like to relax. Secondly, we would also relax. The conditional expectation needs to be phased, so basically we look into the conditional expectation from the cistern A onto the cistern B and satisfy one weaker condition redolent phasefulness. That's our idea. And that was just prepared, as I say. Originally, the result. Originally, the result by Raynon with the second convalibility of the one without second convalibility is that whenever you have a twist over effective locally compared household delta group point, then when you look at the twist group point C star algebra with the C0 function defined on the mean space, then this is the cartan pair. Moreover, whenever you have a carton pair, whenever you have a Katan pair, basically can be uniquely determined by a GoPoid, locally compact host of effective gocoil and a twist. And then that's the result we like to aim for even when we try to relax what means by a cut down subject. Basically, the reason I highlight this effectiveness is simply we want to see whether once we reformulate or weaken We formulate or weaken the assumptions of this Kartan sub-algebra, we can have a similar result for general locally compared to Kotaku point without being effective. That was our aim. So let me give a definition what our semi-Katang sub-algebra means. So now let A be a cis algebra and then we just pick up a subset I denote by this capital N from my cis algebra A and what we do C-star A. And what we did, I can talk about this N being a catan semi-group if the following conditions satisfy. First of all, we ask this N to be a sub-semi-group of the original C-star. Moreover, the dense, have a dense span we simply just recap the regularity by replacing the original C-star normalizer. So you can see the first item is mimicking the original regality. Secondly, I just looking, if I define my list B being the C-star generated by all the positive elements from my N, then this gives rise to a commutative sub-semigroup of N. Of course, let's be a commutative sub-algebra settings, that will be the cistern algebra A itself. And the third condition, we have a conditional displayation from the cistern algebra A onto the cis algebra B. Onto the system algebra B, and now we don't ask the conditional intensity, you should need to be faceful. However, we ask that whenever I apply element from my system, you can feel this like the normalizer, but not the usual system normalizer, but I will still verbally call it normalizer. So if I apply my conditional expansion, the element of the normalizer, and then multiply it with the joint of it, then this should sit inside this ability of subject. Once those concepts are Once those conditions are satisfied, then I call this sub-algebra B being a semi-catalyst sub-algebra of the original sister algebra A. Do you know if the relative commutant of B is a beyond? Do you know if the relative commutant of B is a beyond? Yes. And then what we show solely are some easy operation after we have defined that. First of all, yeah, so I. First of all, yeah, so actually the original definition from about the Katang pair and the Katang sub-Agebra is a property of the first mentioned identity and then Munkush has been shown Mukuchi redundant composition. And similar for our case, whenever we have this semi-partner sub-algebra B, it also contains the approximation unit for the largest six algebra. The argument just follows from the paper down by the run through the Down by the round from the Sara here. So we just follow the exact same argument, we can show that the semi-cut and sub-algebra also has an approximation of units for the largest system algebra. Secondly, our normalizer, the normalizer we just defined, is indeed sitting inside the usual system normalizer. So that is really a smaller collection of the normalizer, if you want. Okay? So that is the collation. And then I'm just going to And then I'm just going to show that quickly so that I can use it for the next slide. And what we can do is also, we can actually pick up or fix a sequence of non-zero polynomial with the zero constant term and converge to one uniformly of a compact subset without zero. Then this actually gives us the right approximation identity and the lab approximation identity to any C-star algebraic element. And the reason I give that here just because that is easy. Well, that is a Is easy. Well, that is a useful property which helps us to do a lot of computation and understand some of the property of the group we are going to compute, we are going to construct it. And then another proposition is that now if we just still pick up the original carton pair, so A and B, this is just a standard usual catan pair. This means this catan sub algebra of the C-starge. This Katan sub algebra of the sister algebra A, then if we take the original Katan pair and forget about the explanation B phase though, then actually if we just look at the original system normalizer, this indeed form a catan semi-group. So in the sense, if you just work with original cartan pair, it does cover, in a sense, this does set aside the condition we have for the semi-catang sub-algebra. And yeah, so basically. Now, our argument to say that the definition we have given rise is indeed weak original Katang sub-algebra. And then basically, the only difference is that if you compare all the definition we have with the original Katang sub-algebra, with our semi-Katan sub-algebra, the major difference is that we have this condition about the conditional explanation, need to satisfy when I apply it to normalize the time. To the normalizer times the joint of normalizer need to sit inside this abelian sub-algebra. So that's the only condition which is not in the Cartan sub-algebra definition. Okay, and we usually call this the stable property for the distribution. And that can be actually checked quite easily. So that was the argument to show that whenever we pick up any system normalizer, then we really check what is the image of the partition display. The additional distillation times the john of it is indeed sitting inside the villiancy starge. And then, yeah, this also the other way to claim that our dimension is a bit weaker than the original Katan sub algebra. So basically this classical example, if we just take a group, and then which is just a screen group contain all the integers. Calculate both the integers. And of course, we know, as it's mentioned, from David's talk as well, when you look into the C-star, the reduced C-star algebra of Z, then that is just the continuous function of defined of the unit circle. And then in that case, we can see easily now we can pick up this subset, which is just a union, of all the scalar multiplication of the polymers at k, k is any integers, that gives rise to a Catan semi-group, satisfy our definition. By our definition. Moreover, if I look into the sized algebra generated by the positive element of 1n, then this is just the scalar multiplier of the constant y function. And then moreover, we can also define an expedition just in a very standard way. This phi is just a state of the unit functional unit circle. Then whenever we have all these notation here, it does give rise to a semi-Katan sub-algebra. Semi-Katan sub-algebra according to our definition. However, it's also mentioned in David's talk that, of course, this sub-algebra B, which is not the masa, I think in David's slide, he called this Z kata, which is not the maximum obedient sub-algebra, it's a billion, but not maximum. And on the other hand, of course, we all know that set of integers, this school boy, which is not effective. This school boy, which is not effective. So, of course, we know that the correspondence cannot be cut down. And actually, from this basic example, we can generalize quite a few examples, but I will skip that. So, what we actually show is that now, if we start with a cis algebra, this cut does contain the catan semi-group n, and then once we have that n, we can, of course, look into the We can of course look into the semi-catane sub-algebra B, which is just a C-star algebra generated by the positive element from N. And then if we also have one, if we also have a stable explanation, the stableness is exactly the condition I just mentioned a few minutes ago. And in that case, we actually can find the isomorphism from the original C-star algebra A to a twist group of C-star algebra I denote by this capital C here, which is just a clue. Capital C here, which is just a closure of all the continuous functions defined as a complex support on sigma, we can build such an isomorphism. And then moreover, when my conditional representation not only being stable, it is more of a phase for actually listed Google Existence algebra, just the reduced Google Cister algebra. The reason here I write just simply as a closure of this CCOC. As a closure of this CC of sigma g simply because in the Reynolds result, basically you want to look into whether if you start with a carton pair, whether this catan pair can be realized as a twist, a good point C sub algebra in a reduced sense. And then the sub-algebra will be C C of G naught. And the way how we can achieve essentially, we can work, we can look into not just a reduced group of C sub algebra, even the full group of C. Cis algebra, even the full group of CIS algebra, or any, I mean, you take a completion of CC of sigma G in any other C-star node, you can come up with different cis algebra. And then we can still apply the same construction and get this isomorphism result. So that was the reason I state the result in this way rather than just write directly as a completion of CCLC lung. Okay, I need to be quick. So I'm just going to show a few steps. So basically, back to the results. step so basically back to the result of course if I claim I can find such isomorphism that I do need to see how I can come up with a Google EG and I also need to say how can I come up with my twist sigma and also how this isomorphism can be built. Okay so everything is really by construction. I'm going to talk about this very quickly. So now the group oil of germs have been mentioned a lot in this conference as well, but our approach to build up a group oil is instead of using google germs Instead of using group point of germs, we try to build up good point by using the ultrafilter. And then, yeah, so that's our approach. And so, basically, what is this good point? G, we just, yeah, we start we start with this normalizer and anyway, so we just pick up or look into the collection of outra filter in our normalizer, and then we associate with the knowledge which generated by this particular collection, and then once we have the And then, once we have yeah, once we define a collection like that with the ultra filter and with this particular topology, we can indeed show that within this topology, the good point we construct is indeed how to. And then the unit space of this group is basically just the union, whatever we look into this new which is recontained element from the obedience up. Sorry, I'm just trying to move fast, so let's. Sorry, I'm just trying to move fast so that I don't run over time. And then, secondly, once we have the Google IG, then of course the next step, the natural next step, is to look into how the twist can be built. And then again, the very standard construction is that we usually try to build up a twist by looking at the boot point, we have just constructed and taking some kind of potion. Yeah, that's exactly the method we are going to proceed. So now, what do we do? So now, what do we do? Whenever we pick up element from the group I have just constructed, then of course this auto filter contains element from the normalizer. And then that way we can define what means by two elements of the normalizer, they are equivalent. So this equivalent relation defined in a certain way, this is basically coming from no B is a Belian sister algebra, and then we know that whenever we That whenever we try to look into the maximum ideal, then actually the maximum ideal is just correspondence to the outshot filter we have. Okay, so let's read the reason. My notation here basically just means that this complement is just give rise to a maximum ideal of the cisagra, then I can look into the characteristic function associated to this maximum ideal. And then we can use this state. And then we can use this state to define an equivalent relation between two normal glycerin states. And we can check that this relation is indeed equivalent relation. And then we use the equivalent class coming from this equivalent relation to define our twist. And then there's also a lot of check needs to be done, but basically, once we define such a relation and then make sure that it's a good relation, we come up with. This equivalent relation, we come up with this class, then we can show that with this topology given by this sub-basis, that that is another topological good point. And then moreover, we can also show that this good point is again a house of good point, and then we can identify what will be the unit space of this particular good point. And moreover, we can also show that not only this come up with a good point, this good point does satisfy the twist condition I have. Satisfy the twist condition I have just given a few slides ago. So that's how we know that we can really construct a bullpoint, which is household and neota. We can also construct a twist over the original bullpoint GI star base. Okay, that will be my last slide. And eventually we just need to see how this isomorphism can be built. Please formula look a bit scary, but it's actually very similar to quite a close approach. We just need to adapt to our language. But anyway, let's give rise. But then we have a C-star algebra element, and I can associate with this A-hat. And then this A-hat, depending on which other element A you pick up, if I pick up element from the Boolean sub-algebra, then if I map it into the head of it, then this actually gives rise a continuous function with vanished infinity of my twist, which is sigma. And then basically, Sigma and then basically this map is just a C-size homorphism. And although this class looks a bit complicated, but basically this just indicates that V hat was sitting inside G0 of G0. This is just a continuous function, vanish infinity at the unit space. So let's recover the Reynolds result when you look into the sub-algebra. And then secondly, now if I just looking, generally if I just pick up any normalizer again sent it by this headmap, then this By this head map, then this actually gives rise to a semi-group normalized, as I said, originally normalized, it's just a semi-group. So that's the best we can get. The head map does give rise to a semi-group homomorphism. And I guess what is more important is the last bit. Now, if I look really, if I really pick up any element from the Windows system algebra, and then we do can come up with this head map, which I With this head map, which I just defined here, and with the J map given by Reynolds, and this indeed given as the isomorphism of the original cis algebra we started with, and to the twist group point cis algebra defined through the twist sigma and the household delta group point G. And as I said, again, the reason I did not like that, just basically, this means that you can really take the closure with respect to any C-star norm, which will recover whatever you. Could you recover whatever reduced group for CIS algebra or full twist group or sys algebra? So, in a sense, if now we ask moreover, the conditional expansion is phaseful, then this indeed gives rise a style morphism from the sister algebra A to the reduced twist coupon sister algebra. So, that's my talk. Thank you.
