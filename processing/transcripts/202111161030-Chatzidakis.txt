Thank you very much, and thank you for inviting me here. So, as is written here, it's joint work with Udi Hushovsky. It's not that new, actually. It dates from 2012. And in a particular, I mean, so the final result is very much inspired by a Inspired by a result of George Willis on locally on totally disconnected locally compact groups. And actually, our results in characteristic zero would be the direct consequence of these results. But in characteristic P, things are a bit more delicate. I mean, although the final result is, I mean, the proof, the strategy of the proof is exactly the same. Okay. Okay, so let me first tell you a few things about difference fields. So, for me, a difference field is a commutative field with a distinct endomorphism denoted by sigma. And if sigma is until you call it inverse. So, in general, so typical example we have seen, right? You take a variety, you take an undermined. Variety, you take an endomorphism of the variety, then so let's say everything is defined over a field into k, then you look at the function field of the variety k of v, and then phi is going to be use and homomorphism of that field. Okay? Now the problem is that it's a problem, but uh usually Uh, usually the ponderomorphism is not. I mean, that difference field is not going to be inversive. If you want to go to the inversive closure, which is unique up to isomorphism, well, you will end up with a field which is infinitely generated over k. So, for example, my endomorphism is sigma x equals x squared, right? So, if I look at Right, so if I look at k of x, where we find an antique of the k of x, I want to know what has mapped to the answer x. Okay, so I gave some examples, but everybody knows these examples. So, well, here is some notation and About the colour group, and I'm interested in finally generating the difference field extension of my difference field K, which I probably really impose to be algebraic, to be an inversive. And so let me introduce some notation. You have k of A sigma, generated by A sigma of A sigma square of A and so on and so on. sigma square of a and so on and so on you can look at the field generated by a sigma inverse of a sigma minus two of a and so in other words the difference field corresponding to the to the automorphism sigma inverse and finally you can get the inverse equations sigma plus or minus uh okay another bit of uh Another bit of notation. I'm defining new k available B or new available B to denote the degree of the extension K of AB over K of B. One can think of it in the case of traditional zero, one can really think of it as a multiplicity. So, what is my So, what is my problem? Our problem was the following. You see, so we want to sort of define an invariant of that extension. So, the first thing we can do is to associate to the scale of a sigma k what's called the limit. Okay, so from now on, I'm assuming that the difference field generated. Assuming that the difference field generated by A over K has finite transcendency. So this means that after some point, the transforms of A become algebraic over the previous ones in K. So without loss of generality, one can assume, we can say that sigma of A is already algebraic over K of A, you know, replacing A by some A sigma of A and so on. And anyway, what you can do is then. What you can do is then look at what's called the limit degree of the k, and which is the minimum degree of the field extension obtained by adjoining c bar n plus 1 of a to k of a etc sigma n of a. All right, so you see that let's say if sigma v satisfies the polynomial f of a sigma v. f of a sigma v equals 0 of a certain degree in the variable sigma v. When you go to the next stage, you know that sigma square of a is going to satisfy the transform by sigma of that wholly number. Okay, so it would satisfy f sigma of sigma of a sigma square of might however satisfy something else, something more. So in fact, once this degree is finite, it can only It's finite, it can only decrease. Okay, we are dealing with a finite number, it decreases, so it stops from some point and it stops, and that's that point where it stops is called the limit. You get the limit degree. Similarly, you have the notion of inverse limit degree. So instead of looking at sigma, you look at sigma inverse. Same thing. There is a definition when your field k is not inversive, which takes K is not inversive, which takes care of that, and you first shift everything and then you go back. Okay, so the point is that you see, because you have okay, an endomorphism of the field is always injective, so that you know if something, if you have some f of a which is equal to zero, you apply sigma, it's also going to be equal to zero, okay? Sigma of f of a is going to be equal to zero, and that comes that looks like f sigma of sigma v. like F sigma of sigma v. Okay? So, right, so these are some invariants. And so one should note that this is really only dependent on, well I guess maybe it's on the next slide, it only really only depends on the extension k of a sigma over k. All right? Because what's Because what's happening is that if you take a set of generators of that field, right, a set of generators with a different field, well, they will appear in one of the K of V, sigma of V, etc., sigma n of A. Okay? And so therefore the degree of the variable. Okay, so it's really an invariant of that extension. Variant of that extension, and moreover, it has the nice property of being multiplicative in power. So the limit degree of AB over K is the limit degree of A over K times the limit degree of B over K over And one other important thing is that the quotient of the limit degree by the inverse limit degree. By the inverse limit degree, it is then an invariant of the extension here of sigma angel field average. In other words, if you take a B, which is A, which is generated with B A over pay, it will have the same, I mean, this quotient will be the same. Good. Good. In fact, this quotient is even, yeah, it's really a nice quotient. All right. So here was, I guess, was a proof of the last statement. So you look at some B, in fact you notice that you can work over the inversive closure of sigma. Of k of a sigma, and you compute something. You compute that if you algebraic over k of a sigma, then your limit degree and your inverse limit degree are equal. Okay, so that's that's why. Okay, so let me go on. So, what does it mean that you have that the limit degree is equal to Degree is equal to the degree of the field generated by sigma of A over K of A. This exactly means that if you look at the field K of A sigma and K of A sigma inverse, they are going to be linearly disjoint over K of A. Why is that the case? Because the fact that Because the fact that degree of sigma square of A over K of A sigma A is equal to the degree of sigma square over K of sigma A. This exactly means that K of A sigma of A and K of sigma of A sigma square of A are linearly disjoint over K of sigma of A. So by induction, you get that thing. So you have those two fields there and they are Those two fields there, and they are linearly disjoint over their intersection. We know whether you apply sigma v, we need sigma on one, sigma on one hand, with the right-hand side, and sigma inverse on the left hand side. The other thing it has is that, in fact, you can do that not just over k of a, but over any segment of z. Okay, and so, in other words, if you have i. words if you have i less than j less than k then the multiplicity of sigma j of a over sigma i of a and sigma k of a is the same as if you had added all the things to the left of sigma i of a and all the things to the right of sigma k all right because of this linearity shortness uh Condition. Okay, so these are just basic facts about limit degree and all these multiplicity things. And I guess we are interested in the following number, which is what we call the distance degree. So for it to make sense, you need to assume that sigma of l is algebraic over k of n. All right, so it's necessary when you were dealing with something which With something which generates a difference field of finite transcendence degree, you replace A by some basic number, et cetera. Okay, so you are looking at the distant degree and you define it as the limit when n goes to infinity of the degree extension of sigma angle of a over p of n. Of a over p of a look at one over okay, so in good cases, let's think for a system sigma of x equals x squared, right? So the you well, no, okay, let's start with example. Sorry. Sigma of x equals, you look at the equation, sigma of x squared is equal to x. All right? So the limit degree is equal to two. Degree is equal to two, right? So when you iterate it sigma, so you get that sigma of sigma of x squared equals x. So sigma square of x to the fourth is equal to x. So you Is equal to x. So you see that when you start closing under sigma, you get the tower of extension, each of the degree two over the preceding one, and actually they and since you know my inverse lives inside the x, we don't so in that case you see that my distance degree, well, it's going to be exactly two. All right? Exactly two. Right? Because, well, two, two times two, two times two, etc. There are, however, some cases where this does not happen. And really, what's going to happen is that you see, if it is equal, this really means that for every n we have sigma of a, sigma, etc., sigma square of a sigma. sigma square of a sigma n minus 1 of a they belong to the field generated by a and sigma n of a okay we know that they're algebraic of all it belong to it okay and right then you can show that well this is an invariant of the extension but it's not multiplicated in time the best you can do is that Is that when there is a parenthesis missing here? Is that it's sub-multiplicative or over-multiplicative, but anyway, you can find an inequality. And this inequality is sometimes tricked. I'm not sure. I give an example somewhere. I don't know if it's now. Yes, it's now. So, first case, A translate K, and we have C round B squared. And we have some probability squared will be q. So the limit degree of a over k is its distance degree and it's going to be 2. And the inverse limit degree, which is the same thing as red for signal inverse, is going to be sorry. Inverse distance degree. Okay, now A transcendental over K sigma of A square becomes. sigma of a square equals a square plus one. So the limit degree is two, right? How about the distance degree? Where does the two go? Is it sigma of a squared equals a squared plus one? Yeah. So it's this does the limit This does the limit degrees too. We agree? I mean, sigma v is going to be a degree two extension of scale, no? I mean, sigma v is equal to square root of s squared plus one. So that's limited. This does degree. This does degree is the degree. Distance degree is the nth root of the multiplicity of sigma n of a over t or k of a. But remember it's it's just an invariant actually of the algebraic closure of k of a sigma over okay. So do you see something which might not have limit degree one and it If you look at a square, k of a square is stable under sigma, right? So its limit degree is going to be one. And of course, its distance degree is going to be one. Okay. I mean, you can see it also. I mean, if you look at sigma n of a square, it's going to satisfy. Of a square, it's going to satisfy something like it's going to be square root of a square plus n, or something like that, right? Okay, so I mean, it's an extension of degree two. They are all extensions of degree two. They are linearly disjoint over k of a, right? But they have degree two. So the n's root of two, when n goes to infinity, that goes to one. So these are examples. So this example and right and I guess there is another example that I'm going to show it later where really you see that it's not modulating. So it's basically that kind of trick in all the steps. Okay. So we are in, we want to In we want to try to prove something, okay? We want to prove that it exists, first of all. I mean, this is what kind of number is it? Is it a rational number? Is it a what is it? Okay. It turns out that it's an integer, that it's a divisor of the integer. That's one of the divisions. So let me show you how it goes. So So, as I told you, so we are, we reduced to the case where sigma of A is algebraic, and its multiplicity of a P of A is exactly the linear. The main lemma is that, so we're interested to know that the degree of the extension obtained by adjining signal A to the field K of A. A to the field K of A sigma L of A. All right? So if it belongs to it, it's one. Doesn't belong to it, it's going to be finite, but less than or equal to the degree of L. So you notice that actually, you notice fairly well that easily that isn't crazy. Let me see if I had a proof of it or not. You had a proof of it or not. Why is it? Remember, we use now we use the fact that this fact that I had mentioned, which is that if you have, remember when J was between I and K, then the multiplicity of sigma j of A of A over of A over K of sigma I of A sigma k of A was the same as if you added six to the left of I added to the left of the right of K. So in other words mu of sigma of A over A sigma L of A is going to be equal to the multiplicity of sigma of A over A sigma L of A sigma L plus one. by sigma a plus one because of this linear districtness and the latter is less than or equal to the multiplicity of sigma by over a sigma i plus one all right so that's why it's increasing however because it's bounded by limit degree of labor k it's going to stabilize at some point all right so back so we look at l0 which So we look at L0, which is the first place where it starts stabilizing, and it stabilizes at number, so it stabilizes at L0 for the number L. And we define some constant, which is basically what's the multiplicity of sigma of A, etc. sigma 0 minus 1 of A over A sigma L 0 of A. And then we show that this will. But this will so, in other words, when I have j greater than or equal to L0, when you look at the multiplicity of L over sigma minus J of A and sigma L of A, something to the left of that interval and minus L zero plus L zero. Okay, I get something. I get something which does not depend on J and L. All right? So it's a constant. And in fact, when you start looking what it tells you, it tells you that the distance degree of A over K is going to be the limit degree of A over K divided by F. M being the sub. M being the sub of all these things. So let's see. I think there is a proof of this. It's not difficult, it's small computations, you know, it's just flight. So, I mean, it's basically you use the fact that the multiplicity is multiplicative in power, and you do all kinds of computations. You use, so here, you see, what did I do? I looked at I looked at what's happening between zero and A. So I'm looking at sigma of A, et cetera, sigma n minus one of A over A sigma n of A. And I get that, well, again, using this linear disjointness, that it's the multiplicity of sigma i of A over sigma i minus one of a, sigma i. I minus one of the c m of a. In other words, I might just. And then using the hypothesis, you're going to transform it into the ones where the maximum is attained and the one where the maximum is not attained. And in fact, you are going to get that it's m to the n minus n zero times. You get something similar going. Get something similar going in the other direction, but then finally you do your stuff and you get what's here. Okay, so these are basic computation. You know, once you know that the result is true, they are easy to do. Yes? Could you show this on your example of sigma of a squared is a squared plus one? If not, if it's too confident. Okay, I'm sure I can, but you know, I'm only two. No, no, no, no, then we'll do it later. Ah, this is the interesting. You're gonna be charged for that. I'm not alluding to that. I don't know why they would put the pen that doesn't work with a board. It's okay. Just go on. Please, you see what's happening. Okay, so let's look at so sigma of a square equals a square plus one, right? So look, so what is, as I said, sigma square and a square, I mean, sigma square, there is going to be a square root of A is going to be a square root of a squared plus two. So the multiplicity of square root of a plus one could be the field generated by k of a plus two. The square root of a plus two is two and the statement. So in fact, what you're going to get is that the distance degree is going to be one, which is what we which is what we understood so i mean you can compute what's happening is that then you can compute directly what's available it's the multiplicity of the left thing which is going to divide the multiplicity okay so good Okay, so good. You see, what's happening is that when you look at this, right, so you get, when you express what it is, it's going to be limit degree of a over k over n to the n. And then something that doesn't grow with n, you see. So when you take the earth root, it's going to be the earth root on the left. Okay, so here is the main theorem. And I should tell you that indeed, I mean, we had it when the distance degree was one, we knew how to do it. So distance degree being one, this is actually equivalent to the fact that the multiplicity of C minus A. Of C19 on A over P of A is bounded. Okay. But right. But so the general case, it's a bit more involved. And the point is that, so you have, so sigma rays in my assumption is that sigma v is in K of H, that the multiplicity of sigma v over A over K of A is the limit of K of the over. And I'm saying that there is a C in the difference field generated by K of A such that A is algebraic over K of C. So in other words, A and C are equal algebraic, right? And the limit degree of C is okay is the distance degree, the limit distance degree of C over K. All right. So in other words, All right, so in other words, whereas I had, you know, in the case of A, I had that maybe if I looked at K of A, sigma L of A, then there would be some fuzz with the sigma of A, sigma square of A, etc. They would be algebraic over that field. Here it's going to flatten down. All right. So here's the proof. So remember, we had this N0, right? Which was basically when things started to stabilize, right? And I'm looking at the algebraic locus V of the top of A over K of sigma I of A, where the absolute value of I is greater than or equal to L C. I is greater than or equal to LC. Okay, so in other words, over two things. Good. So what's the algebraic? It's A is a, when you look at the contributes of A, it's defined by a certain number of equations, right, which are going to tell you how A is algebraic over that field, right? So it's an algebraic set, and as algebraic set, And as algebraic set, it has a unique field of definition, which is finitely generated subfield of k of sigma i o of that field, okay, of that big field. So I'm going to take, well, I call little k's root of definition. Okay, so it's going to in particular to be finite, I mean. In particular, to be finitely, I mean, maybe it does not contain big K, but it's certainly contained in something finitely generated for big K. So what do we know? We know that by the main lemma, right, we know that the multiplicity of A, J of min of sigma to the minus J of A sigma to the L of J does not change as long as As long as J and L, I'm writing them to L C. In other words, that film, letter K, is going to contain in each of those fields. All right? So it's contained in the intersection. So it's contained in F. But I assure you that it's okay. We don't know any keyboard. So, certainly we have that similar vegetable set. I'm sorry, I have a it's it's obvious, but I just don't see it now. Isn't each of those fields in the intersection move to another field in the intersection under signal? Yes, that's right. Each of those fields, sorry, of course, thank you. Each of those fields, right, is going to contain something which satisfies, I mean, it will contain a minus J right. I mean, here there will be a minus. I mean, here there will be a minus j, I mean, yes, a minus j which is less than or equal to L zero, and here there is going to be an L which is greater than or equal to L zero. That's the point. You see? All these fields could contain the field of that form. That's what I'm saying. Each of these fields in this intersection. Right? So therefore, little k is containing f, but you also. Is containing f but you also notice that this f is stable under sigma and sigma inverse. So, in other words, sigma of k is containing f and in fact sigma of k is continuing. That might be false. What I wrote there. Sigma of k contains in k, that's not clear. It's not clear, but sigma of k is continuing. Sorry, it's false. So we take a finite topple which generates K for the data, and you then work out that this little C is going to belong to the field generated over K by sigma minus L of C, sigma L of C for a real greater than real field. And some more work, you get that in fact, this C is what you This is what you got to expect. Okay. Right. Okay, good. It's that. That's the theorem. Well, okay, so this is a little more work, right? It's certain number of lines of equations, right? I mean, computations like I did before. It's not particularly hard. I mean, once you know that it works, it's not particularly hard. It's not particularly hard, but to find them, it's annoying. I guess I was doing it here. I guess I was giving the proof here, but yeah. So here is my example. So you see, I'm going to finish quite soon, but we will have a break before things start. So we have character percent close of characteristic zero. Again, we have a generic solution of sigma v square equals z square plus one. We saw that the distance between that one was volume, right? And then we take a solution of sigma b plus z. So now the limit degree of b over k of a sigma is of course it's one. However, if you look at the so we know that the limit degree of A B over K is two, because at the bottom it was two. The limit degree of A is two, right? But when you look at what's happening, you You want to see what's happening when you look at A, B, sigma L of A, sigma L of B, and you want to look at the degree of that over K of AB. What does it look like? It turns out that it actually has the group degree. Okay, right, and so that. And so that therefore you get that the distance degree is minus two. So I might be off by the power of two, but I mean, it's you see, the thing is that sigma of b equals b plus a, right? So you get that sigma l minus sigma sigma l of b minus b is going to be sigma sigma l of a. Sigma L of A, you see, well, maybe not sigma L of A, but A plus sigma square of A, or something like this. Okay, so anyway, something nice. And when you compute things, you get quadratic extensions which are innerly disjoint. Okay, what else? Can I tell you? Can I tell you? There are some properties which are sort of obvious. So, the first property is that: so you suppose that B and D are equal to brake over K. And so the following are equivalent. The limit degree of D over K is equal to the distance degree. And the limit degree of T over K is the smallest value of a limit degree. Of the limit degree of B over K for a thing, which is like the width of A over K. That's not of obvious, right? You cannot get small. That's for sure. That's okay. And moreover, if we have this linear disjoint assumption, in other words, if the linear, the limit degree of D over K is equal to the multiplicity of sigma d over d, then By d by d, then you also have these conditions c and d, which are that sigma of d is in the field generated by dx minus d, or d and or that it is in the field generated by minus l. So these are sort of other, well, I guess the C sort. I guess the C is sort of obvious. Well, the equivalence between C and D is shown by induction. I mean, it's not very hard, it's just computational. Okay. And there is another set of things. And right, so that you can actually get. actually get um you see we have this uh c i mean maybe here i should say k of c sigma plus or minus one right instead of just k of c sigma but anyway you look at the conjugates of a over this nice k of c sigma and you encode it by a certain topple and then in fact it is okay all right All right, so basically, what it's saying is that the failure to have the good distance degree is just because you are natural, it's just due to something atrophic. But as soon as you do it, you get it explained. The distance degree with respect to the automorphism sigma to the n is just going to be the distance degree. Degree of Audience. And I guess, you know, if two guys are okay, then it's going to be still okay. And you have other properties like this. Okay. So this is well. And finally, the other. And finally, the other thing I wanted to mention is that if by any chance your A was a generic of some group, so some group, some subgroup of the multiplicative group, which was defined by your set of difference equations, like for instance, I don't know, sigma x squared equals x cubed inside the multiplicative group, or I don't know, other things, and so you have g. And so you have geometric group. I assume that my age is connected with the sigma topology, meaning that if you look at the ideal, the sigma ideal of difference polynomial which vanish on that thing, then it should be fine. Absolutely fine. And I guess what's happening is that, so if you take an A, which is That, so if you take an A, which is a generic of that group, then you want to know that the C, which is going to be associated with it, also there's a group, and that's what we show. In other words, there is another different subgroup H prime, maybe not of G of U, maybe of some other group, of some other group, a different subgroup H prime of some G prime of U. And the morphism from H to H prime with finite kernel such that if A is a generic of H then the limit degree of F of A is going to be the distance degree right so in other words if you had a group law on on the difference on difference variety of each Difference variety of each A is a generic, you would have a good flow on the difference variety of each C is a generic. Okay, and defined by quantifying. Okay, so I think that's all.
