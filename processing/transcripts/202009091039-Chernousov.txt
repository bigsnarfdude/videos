Okay, it's my pleasure to introduce the next speaker, Vladimir Chenosev. He'll speak on the Titz-Weiss and Nasser-Titz conjectures. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you so much. I'm very happy to. I'm very happy to participate in this event. This event was supposed to be a physical workshop in Bonn, and it was supposed to be to celebrate Andrei's 60th birthday. So before I start my lecture, I want to say a few words about Andrei and me. I know him for 45 years already. So first time we met in 1975. At that time, I was At that time, I was an undergraduate student, a third-year undergraduate student at Minsk University, and Andrei was first-year undergraduate student. During full term, both of us took a course on linear groups given by Platona. If I remember correctly, this was not a Lenin course. It was a course about research results of Platona from algebraic groups. Of on algebraic groups, and I had a difficult time to follow these lectures. But it was amazing to see that Andre was well prepared and he easily followed these lectures. He absorbed material. It was amazing. And since then, I've never met in my life first year undergraduate students who would be able to do research immediately. Since then, we took a couple more courses given by Platona, but most importantly, we Importantly, we participated in voting seminars on different topics. After graduation, both of us became students under supervision of Platonov, and since then, we shared for many, many years the same office at the Institute of Mathematics. It was a very great, exciting time, and I'm really happy that I I fed Andrei in the same office. It was very easy to talk about mathematics to him. He was approachable, and it was a great time. So before I start, I want to wish Andrei a happy birthday and all the best. So at the end of the 70s and 80s, the hot topic in Minsk was Knezarty's problem. So everyone Program. So everyone wanted to contribute something. I was a student, certainly, I was not able to do anything. And now I'm happy that I can say a few words about new cases of this problem. So my talk is like I try to push back time back for 45 years. So unfortunately, you cannot do it in reality, but I will try. But I will try. So let me first share my screen with you. I want to go to my whiteboard. So, I hope you can see my whiteboard. Is it so? Yes, we can. Okay, so. Okay, so uh just another conjecture. It's uh joint work with uh also audio mi pianzola and also independently the main results were approved by HaCor just not to forget to mention so it was done independently at the same time so let me start from a briefly at Nezepti's problem So we start from algebraic group G over an arbitrary ruffial K and say simple, absolutely simple, simply connected and isotropic. So then we may consider inside K points of group G a subgroup G. A subgroup generated by k points of important elements. So generated by k points of unipotent radicals of parabolic subgroups. So, it's easy to check that this is in fact a normal subgroup, and one can consider the quotient group, which is called the white hip group of G over K. Oh my god, so it's called white hip group, and the problem is when this group is trivial. So, why people are interested in this question? And the reason is that GK plus has a B and P structure. And hence, by famous theorem of T's, this group is projectively simple. Projectively simple means that if you factorize modulo at center, you have a simple abstract group. In particular, if the white hat group is trivial, The white hat group is trivial, then the group of k-points of g is projectively simple, and this fact is very useful in arithmetic theory of algebraic groups. For instance, this is one of the ingredients for congruent subgroup problems. This is favorite topic of Andrei in the 80s. So, in general, it's very difficult to compute this group, and just saying that. And just saying that you consider k-points of unipotent radicals, generate a subgroup, it says nothing. I don't know how to deal with this object. I'm sorry, there is a question in the chat. In the chat, you know, can you ask for verbally? Because I don't want to go to your Zoom window. Right now, I'm Why is that? I can read the question. So, the question is: should it be parabolic subgroups instead of unipotent subgroups? Oh, yeah, parabolic subgroups, certainly. Thank you. Parabolic subgroups. So, let's consider one example, a great example. You take a division algebra. You take a division algebra over K. Then you may consider matrices over G. You want isotropic, so N is at least two, and you consider elements with norm one. And this is our group G. So in this case, the white hill group was computed. Group was computed explicitly, and the answer is the following. White head group is this, the following quotient. You consider elements with norm one and D and you factorize a modular, the commutator subgroup. This is what people call SK1. And yesterday, Nivedita talked about. Yesterday, New Vedita talked about properties of this group, and so the question for this group is reduced whether SK1 is trivial or not. The answer is no. In general, this group is non-trivial, and Nivi Dita described properties of this group yesterday over different kinds of fields. And people who contributed a great into this program was Platono, who first constructed. Platonov, who first constructed counterexample, then his student, a former student Janchevsky, investigated outer forms of type A, then Janchewski Manasterne did something for type D. So for classical groups, the picture is more or less clear nowadays. There is only one great problem which is still open, and this is Susilian conjecture. Let me remind you. Conjecture, let me remind you of this conjecture. Firstly, in conjecture, assume D as above, division algebra and assume index is p square, index is yeah. G over k is I want index to be. I want index to be p square, so it will be p squared to the square, correct? Then there exists a field extension of k such that sk1d is non-trivial. So it's very nice conjecture and it's still open. So now in my talk, I want to consider exception. To consider exceptional groups, and I believe that for most of the exceptional groups, the white hair group is trivial. And to be able to talk about exceptional groups, let me relate the white hair group with the notion of R equivalence. This is the most important tool available when you deal with Available when you deal with a wider group. Say gay. What is F in this conjecture? That conjecture there exists a field extension F of K such that SK1 is non-trivial. D over F. Thank you. So only trivial ones. Assume you are getting Assume you are giving an algebraic variety and assume it has k points. Take two points A and B in X we say that A and B are elementary are equivalent elementary are equivalent. are equivalent if there exists a rational map f from a fine line to x sorry again i mean is there any condition on k because i mean for global and local fields we know skill one is trivial right yes it's trivial over k but uh the uh the conjecture there are field extensions not finite field extensions Ah, not finite, don't you? Not finite, yeah. So we say that two points A and B are elementary are equivalent if there exists rational maps which connect these two points. A and B. Connect means it's defined at zero and it's defined at one and you have this condition. You have this condition. This elementary R equivalence generates an equivalence relation which is called R equivalence R equivalence and the set of R equivalence classes usually is denoted in this way. Assume in addition X is an algebraic group, it has multiplication. Then on the set of equivalence classes, Equivalence classes, there is a natural group structure, group structure, and this group is called the group of equivalence classes. R equivalence classes. You can compute more precisely as follows. We may consider all elements which is R equivalent to one. G is R equivalent to one. This is a normal subgroup in GK, and the quotient group is precisely the group of R equivalence classes. So, this group is closely related to the White Hill group, and firstly. Related to the white hill group. And first, let me remind you the theorem due to Vostokiansky. Yesterday, Nividita mentioned another result. Oh, Primala mentioned some results of Vostkrisiansky, but today I want to mention another one. Vost-Krisiansky. So if G is a group of elements with reduced norm one in matrix algebra. Algebra over some skew shield, then the white field group of this group is precisely isomorphic to the group of IQLance classes. So let me remind you that this is SK1D. So after this result, people started to believe that this is true in general. To believe that this is true in general, case, but it was open for many, many years until Philippe G came with a beautiful proof that this is true in general. Philippe G. So let G be as above, simple, simply connected, isotropic over the ground field K, then. Then the white-hill group of this group G is precisely the group of I equivalence classes. So this result opens the door for attacking Knezerti's problem for groups of exceptional types. So let me now switch a little bit to another conjecture, which is also closely related to Knezert's conjecture, and this is Tits-Weiss conjecture. Now we need the notion of an Albert algebra. So, everyone knows the famous Words. Let me remind you: what is the Dublin process? You may start from a FLK, then you may construct a quadratic extension. If you have a parameter, you can construct a quadratic extension. Then, you can construct quaternion algebra. And then, if you apply one small. And then, if you apply once more doubling, you may end up with actonian algebra. This is a process, doubling process for p equals 2. There is something similar for p equals 3. So, you may start from a few k, then you may consider cubic extension. Then, if you apply once again, you may get A get a central simple algebra of degree three central simple algebra of degree three and if you apply next once you have an Albert algebra it has the following characterization this is a central simple exceptional Jordan algebra Exceptional Jordan algebra. Exceptional Jordan algebra and it has dimension 27. So this is algebra. It has multiplication. Multiplication is commutative but highly non-associated. And to be Jordan implies that it satisfies the Pollank relation. If you multiply elements x and y in this order, you have something like that. I hope I am correct. So let me give one example of Albert algebra. It's called Fest Gets construction. There is a second one. So let's start from a central simple algebra of degree three. Over field K, then you may consider the vector space three copies of D. This is a vector space, and on this vector space, you introduce the following multiplication. The formula is difficult to remember for me, it's To remember for me, it's not easy, but people who are doing Jordan business say that this is very natural multiplication. So it will be triple of elements in D. Let me show you the first component. The first component will be the following: A0, B0. This is multiplication in D. Then you take A1. Then you take A1 B2 tilde. I will tell you what tilde means: B2, A1, tilde. And there are two more components. And tilde is the following operation in D. So this is 1 over 2 trace in D A minus A. I assume characteristic is not to here, and characteristic 2 and 3. Characteristic 2 and 3, the description is more difficult. So there is some formula. What is most important, Albert algebra comes with a norm map. There is a norm map which is homogeneous cubic form. And in this example, it's given as follows. ABC goes to the reduced norm of A. Plus alpha, you need some more parameter alpha and k additional parameter than alpha enter b reduced norm d plus alpha inverse reduced norm of c and minus trace ABC. So, this is a homogeneous cubic form, and this form allows to introduce the following group, which people in Jordan business called structure group of A. Structure group of A. So, this is the group of linear transformation of A. We view A as a vector space, you may consider linear maps, and this linear map. This linear maps preserves cubic form octoscalar. Norm of V is some scalar mu X norm of A. Oh, sorry, it's here must be norm. Norm you apply x to a you have n element in Albert algebra and you have this identity and this is true for all elements A in A and scalar depends only on transformation X. So clearly this is algebraic group and it has the following structure as an algebraic group. It contains a central torus G. Central torus Gm scalar multiplication. If you consider the derived subgroup of A's, this is commutator subgroup. Let me call this is G. This is strongly in a form of type 6. Type 6, simple, simply connected. simple simply connected and the structure group of A is an almost direct product of central toros Gm and this is a group of type P6. Simple, simply connected, intersection of these two O subgroups is at center and so this is an analog of the following group G L T G L T we don't need a T G L Meet okay G L is an almost direct product of scalar matrices and S L M so this is precisely analog of the situation so now I can state the this wise conjecture and before stating we need the notion of your operators in notion of u operators in a u operators so let's take an element a in a and we may consider the fallen linear map of a into itself given by formula u a applied to x it will be two you multiply on the left You multiply on the left a and then again a and minus a square multiplied by x. So it's easy to check that this is map lives in the structure group of a and k points. So they are called your operators. And the conjecture due to Jetson voice Jetson-Wise claims that the subgroup generated by K-points of the central torous and U operators generate K points of the structure group of A. So, Thyssen-Wise came to this conjecture while studying spherical buildings attached to isotropic groups, and it looks like. And it looks like they came in a natural way. But for me, this conjecture is also very natural. And I look at this conjecture at the Vostricansky result, Vostriciansky theorem. This is analog of Vostkrisansky theorem and let me explain why I consider this. Explain why I consider this conjecture as a lock of Waskristianski's theorem. So, when you try to describe the group of i equivalence classes, you need to produce a bunch of trivial elements. Let's look what we have. Central elements, multiplication by k are clearly are trivial. These are trivial elements. So, what about UA? I claim that. A. I claim that UA also is a trivial elements by trivial reason. You have A inside you have element A, you have identity, Albert algebra has identity, you may connect by a fine line, you may connect these two vectors by a fine line, and if you consider your operator Operator related to A t, it has specialization. When you take t equals zero, you have u iterator one, and this is identity map inside of structure group. And if you take specialization one, you have ua. So really, we see that your operators are trivial elements. So you have a bunch of trivial elements. Have a bunch of trivial elements, and so the conjecture of Mesar Ts can be viewed as follows. The subgroup generated by a k star and u operators, it sits in the set of a trivial elements and the conjecture claims that they coincide. And moreover, by some lucky circumstances, the group of I equivalence claims. The group of equivalence classes must be trivial. So, this is the conjecture in the way I see it. Okay, so now let me state two results, theorem A, and I want to relate this conjecture with the Knezartitz conjecture. So, let's consider G. G a simple simply connected group with the following two indices. So we consider the following diagrams. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So you have eight. So this is the group of the absolute rank eight, relative rank two, and anisotropy. The C anisotropic kernel is E678, or you may consider E7, similar picture. This is a group of type E7, relative rank one, anisotropic kernel 78, E6. And then the white-headed group of this group is trivial. This is a new case. Trivial. This is a new case in this conjecture. And theorem B titsweiss conjecture holds. Teethweiss conjecture holds. So these two results are closely related to each other, and there is a theorem due to one. Is a theorem due to vice which claims the following: theorem A implies theorem B. So to prove this two results, what you need to prove Nazert's conjecture for groups of such a shape, like in serum A. A. If you look at this picture and with the use of Philippe G result, you will realize immediately that what you need, you need to prove that the group of equivalence classes of group G under consideration is trivial. And using simple computations, you may see immediately that this is the See immediately that this is the group of e-equivalence classes of the structure group of A. And you need to prove that the group of e-equivalence classes is trivial. What is A? A is the following. You have anisotropic kernel E6. Every such group appears, as I explained about, as a derived subgroup of the structural group. To this E6, you can attach Albert algebra. six you can attach albert algebra a and you have consider you have to consider structural group and what you need you need to prove that the group of r equivalence classes of structure group is trivial let me give you some indication a sketch how we proceed do you need more do you need both groups and theorem a or just one oh Or just one? They have the same anisotropic kernel. And so the group of y-equivalence classes are the same in both cases. You see, anisotropic kernel is six in both cases. So we're talking clearly now about Albert algebra attached to this anisotropic kernel and about structural group. Thank you. Okay, so what we need to Okay, so what we need, we need the description of sub-algebras in A. Our proof is geometric and we just investigate the natural action of the structure group on A. By definition, structure group acts on A elements in structure groups are linear transformation, and what we do, we study a We study stabilizers of different sub-algebras in A. So, from the Jordan series, it is known that every sub-algebra has the following shape. So, first of all, may assume we are in anisotropic situation. Otherwise, everything is trivial. Anisotropic means A is division algebra. And then, sub-algebras have the following shape. Algebra has the following shape. It's either cubic field extension, cubic field extension, or nine-dimensional sub-algebra, which is denoted B plus sigma. And this is the following sub-algebra. We consider a cubic division algebra, cubic central simple algebra. Cubic central simple algebra over quadratic extension of K equipped with a unitary involution sigma, we consider Hermitian subspace. It's nine-dimensional subalgebra, and you introduce a new multiplication giving by formula 1 over 2 AB plus BA, and this is Hermitian subalgebra, and this is X. algebra and this is exactly b sigma plus so then what you need you need to you need to study stabilizers of this subalgebras so what we want we want to study stabilizers in a of sub-algebras And we want to say something about rationality of such sub-algebras. So, the main idea is the following. So, what you do, you do the following. Take any element in the structure group G so So, you have Albert algebra, you have identity map, and then you apply G to identity map. You have some element A. Given such element A, one would like to do the following. One would like to find our trivial element A. H such that when you apply H, you go back to one. If you manage to find such an element, then you have to consider only elements which stabilizes one and stabilize of one is a group of type F4. So you reduce your situation to a smaller group. Situation to a smaller group, and you may study a similar question of other equivalence classes for a form. To find H, such H, if you do some tricks, you need to do the following. You need to do the following. Assume you are giving in A two cubic field extension. Field extensions such that as fields they are the same. So then you generate sub-algebra in A and as I said before you can relate a cubic central simple algebra of degree 3 unitarian values and what And what you need, you need in the stabilizer of this subalgebra, you need to find a trivial element, a trivial element that's what you want, which takes L one into L two. So this is analog of uh Skolomotor's theorem, but uh you need to control the property to be R trivial. Property to be out trivial. So, with this purpose, what you do, you may consider structure group of B and you have the following exact sequence. You have the following exact sequence. We consider connected component in structure group of A, you consider the stabilizers of B sigma. There is a natural restriction map. It tends Restriction map, it turns out it's surjective on the closure, and the kernel is a stabilizer pointwise. Stabilizer pointwise, it's usually denoted in the literature in this way. And what you need to prove, what you want to prove that this is a trivial group, and by the way, you need to take Connected components, what you prove that this is a rational group, in particular a trivial. You want to prove that this is a rational variety, and what is more importantly, you want to construct a section, rational section. And with the use of these results, what you have, you prove that the stabilized You prove that the stabilizer of B-sequence structure group is rational group. It's rational and particular at trivial. So this is one part of the proof which allows us to go back to A. So again, remember. So again, remember, we wanted to find an element, a trivial element, such that you go back to one. And what I explained, we do such an element do exist. And after that, you are reduced to groups of type A4, and there are some matrix involved and And there are some more tricks involved, and with the use of some tricks, eventually we are able to show that the group of R trivial, the group of R equivalence for the structure group is trivial. I don't have much time to explain all these tricks, but I try to explain the To explain the geometric nature of our proof, so what we do, we just study stabilizers and to construct sections, you need a gala describe galaxymology of all these guys gadget. So, what you need, you need to describe H1K torsors with the coefficient in the stabilizer. Stabilizers of different sub-algebras. And this is what we did in our proof. And I see probably it's a good time to stop. Thank you so much. So let me go back to the window. So I will stop at this point. Are there any questions? I have a dumb question, probably. Valodja, so are you proving that all anisotropic groups of type E6 are trivial, or is it only these ones that arise as anisotropic kernels? No, I don't. I don't prove for all groups of type P6. Even the anisotropic ones. Yeah, group of type P6, which appear in this basis are characterized that they are strongly inner forms of type P6. I do not want to go into details and to give the definition strongly inner forms. Oh, that's fine. Such groups appear. But in general, I can do nothing. But the strong linear forms, you're doing all of those. All strong. Doing all those all strong, uh, strong uniforms appears in this way, great, they're right subgroups of the structure group of Albert algebras. Perfect. Thank you. Um, any other questions maybe I can ask a question then in the um. In the Titz-Weiss conjecture, you had two equalities, right? So did you prove both of them? It seems like you only proved that the group of R-equivalence classes is trivial. You know, I use a reduction of voice to the problem. So the theorem of voice says that. The theorem of Wise says that if you can prove Knesarty's conjecture for groups of type E7 and E8, which I showed already, then it follows automatically. So both equalities follows as a corollary of our result. What we did, we computed the group of high equivalence classes. It's trivial, and then by voice reduction, this weiss conjecture holds. So it's just a consequence. So it's just a consequence of our result. But I cannot prove directly these both equalities. It's for me, it's a little bit. He proved the first one somehow. Who proved? Weiss. No, he proved that it suffices to prove only this conjecture. He reduced. I see. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Okay, let's thank the speaker again. And Misha, so now we need to stay around for the group photo or how does that work? So I think we scheduled the group photo for 11:30. So I assume. 11:30, so I assume that we wait for six minutes and then but yeah, but yeah, so I think we I think we should wait until 11:30.
