  Okay, welcome to the second talk of the morning, talk by Samantha Chatschild from Lex. She will tell us about the average degree of the essential burden. All right, thank you so much for the invitation. I have BAM on my bucket list, and I was going to go a while ago, and it was during COVID, so I didn't get to go. And so I attended here online, which was very lame. So I'm like super excited to actually be here in person. Yeah, so I'm going to talk about a project that was posted in 2022. I'm recording. Okay. So I'm going to talk about a project that I did last year. So we're going to talk about, we want to say what's the expected number of real zeros when it intersects a variety with a linear space. So here's kind of just a little pictorial thing. Here I have a polynomial of degree 10. And then if we intersect it with kind of a line in some form. In some form of general position, we have 10 intersection points. And then what we're gonna say is we're gonna say, okay, well, if instead of using this line, the like degree here is 10. But now if instead of like, if I go like, I don't know, like up here, then maybe I only have like two real intersection points. So then this is gonna be like, we can think of this sort of like an expected degree of two here. So we're gonna try to say what's the average degree. And then what we're gonna do is we're gonna define the essential right. Do we're going to define the essential variety and then we're going to come up with a convex body, which is a zonoid. And so this term has been thrown out, it will show up. And then this convex body sits inside our zonoid, which we used to estimate for that area. So these are the pictures. Okay, so this is joint work with Paul Riding, who's here, Kirpala Santosiro, and Alima Shahu, who are all affiliated with Osnabruck, and then Alima is also in Leipzig. In my singing. Okay, so I'm just going to start with the theorem. So the average degree of decentralized is 4. Thank you. That's all I had to share. Very nice. Yeah, yeah. So this is really exciting because, well, first of all, okay, so E is the essential variety. It's a variety. We'll discuss it later. It's a variety. We'll discuss it later. You do not have to know what it is. The degree is 10, which means that if we take the intersection with a random linear space of the correct codimension, and this is always counting real intersection numbers, this is always less than or equal to 10. So if we're looking at generic complex numbers, this is always 10. The real intersection is less than 10. Okay, so this was really fun. Sorry, just be a center of what I mean. So the essential variety, yes. This is a unique variety. Yes. Yes, it's expanded on any other. Okay. Yeah, that's that's already they didn't like it. They didn't like it. It's been projected from many vision journals, so we're just trying something else now. So I'll discuss actually a little bit at the end in the further directions of the vision people, some things that we need to answer in order for. We need to answer in order for the vision people to like this. Okay. Yes. It was very sad. Okay. Traveling objections are very sad. Okay. So yeah, that's life. Okay. So here's what we do. We take kind of the average intersection with the essential variety. Here we have an O of 9, we have an O of 9 invariant uniform sampling. And then the expected intersection number is 4. So this was really. Intersection number is four. So this was really nice. Yeah. So this is very not common when we work with random algebraic geometry. Normally we've got square roots all over the place. So this is very, very nice to have a round number. So then we said, well, let's look at a different distribution that is actually reflecting an algebraic vision type problem. And then we have no actual answer at all because we can't compute the volume of a convex body, which is the essential. Of a convex body, which is the essential zonoid. So, we're going to have some estimates on it, so we can talk about this. So, yeah, so we can write it as 30 pi squared times the volume of what we call the essential zonoid. And then, yeah, so we're going to have a different distribution here. We'll get a different answer, and we'll talk about some statistics of what we expect that answer to be. No, these are different distributions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Any questions? Okay. So this is the summary of the results and then, yeah? So psi is one particular distribution. It's a particular distribution, yeah. We'll define it later. We have a lot of stuff to define. Like the essential variety. What is E? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so yeah, we're going to talk about what is the essential variety for those of you who do. Essential variety for those of you who do not know what it is. And then the main technique we use is we use the coare formula. So, one of the things I love about this project is it's very hard to get the right answer because the coare formula is hard. But it's trivial in the sense that you use the coare formula and you can compute things directly, which is really cool. And then we'll talk about some experiments in further directions. And in the further directions, I'll talk about why the vision community does not like our results. Our results. Yeah, so these are my Euroskins. For more information, see this paper. So this is from Khalila Cole's Snapshot of Algebraic Vision. I really like this paper. And so this is just copied and pasted from the paper. And then they got it from Tomas Plantia. So we're just passing around this picture. Okay, so what is the concept of computer vision? So the concept of computer vision is I'm going to take a bunch of pictures. is I'm going to take a bunch of pictures. So we all take pictures on our phone. You have a bunch of pictures of one object. So now we have a bunch of two-dimensional representations of an object. And what I want to do in the goal, so the output, is I want to reconstruct what does the three-dimensional object look like and where were my cameras when I was taking these pictures. So this is kind of the goal, is to go from pictures to a three-dimensional object and knowing where my cameras were. Knowing where my cameras were. So, in between, how do we actually do this? Well, you end up saying we have a bunch of pictures, we want to match a lot of images, so there's a lot of algorithms that go into this. And then in part C, this is where our algebraic vision is going to really come into play. So, algebraic vision, what we're going to do is we say, okay, in this case, we take five points. So, we mark five points that we know they're the same on the 3D object, but they're these different points on the image. Different points on my image. So I have two different pictures and I have five points, and so these are called a point correspondence. And then we want to say what is the relative position between the cameras. And this is where we're going to be using some algebra. So we're really going to be focusing on this C part. The inspiration of this comes from. There's a much larger picture going on. Okay, so I'm going to talk about the five-point relative pose problem. Again, as mentioned, Pose problem. Again, as mentioned, the essential variety is the variety. I'm going to introduce it kind of from this perspective, but we'll see that it actually doesn't require the five-point pose problem. Okay, so the five-point pose problem, this was really nice because, yeah, we're working with five-point pose problem, and this picture has five points. So we have five points marked. So we have two pinhole cameras. So my pinhole camera is this one and this one. So I have my two pinhole columns. And this one. So I've made two pinhole cameras. And then I have their images and then I have their corresponding points. And then I want to say what is the relative position between the two cameras. So my cameras live in three space. They're taking pictures of things in three space. So in order to get the relative position, I'm working with calibrated cameras. So I'm going to do a rigid motion in space. So my rigid motions in space, I can rotate, and then Can rotate and then I can do a translation. So, this is what I want to find. And so, we're going to build up to finding a rotation and a translation in order to find the position between these cameras. Okay, any questions? Because I'm about to write math formulas. So if we don't have the idea, I'm waiting for the math formulas. I know, I was going to say, you start math pretty early, and I do pictures first, so that's okay. That's okay. That's fine. Different styles. Okay. So what is a pinhole camera? So when I think of my pinhole camera, well, I'm taking a picture of a three-dimensional object, and then I'm mapping it to a two-dimensional object. So I'm going to go, we're going to actually end up working in projective space. So we're going to actually go from P3 to P2 is my camera. And so my camera is going to be a matrix, which is a 3 by 4 matrix. A 3x4 matrix of rank 3. So in P3 I need 4 real elements, P2 I need 3, so this is why I end up with a 3x4 matrix. So my cameras are now matrices, and the way that I construct these matrices is I want to work with calibrated cameras. And what does it mean to be a calibrated camera? It means that I can write it in terms of R is my rotation for my rigid motion, and then T is going to be my translation in R. T is going to be my translation in R3. And then that gives us a 3x4 matrix. Okay, so cameras are matrices, and the matrices encode the rotation and the translation. So now what I want to do is I want to say, well, what is the relative position between these? So I'm going to fix my first camera to be the identity and zero. So my first camera is going to be fixed. And so in order to solve the relative pose problem, we need to say, how do I find? Say, how do I find R and D, which takes me from C1 to C2? Okay. So, now we have our cameras. Our cameras are matrices. And I want to have... You're just stretching? No, no, no. I'm just stretching. Okay. It's probably better behavior as a cause of that. I'm just stretching there. Okay, so now we have point correspondences. So u and v, so u is going to be in the picture for c1 and v is going to be in the picture for c2. And I want them both to be the image of x. So I have c1x as u and c2x is v. Okay, so this is the five-point relative pose problem. This is what we're going to be interested in solving, but we're going to take a step away. But we're going to take a step away from the relative close problem, and we want to say given any two point correspondences, we have a relationship between them via the essential matrix. So now this is just given any two point correspondences, we can write u transpose EV is equal to zero, so where E is going to be an essential matrix. So when I say an essential matrix, an essential matrix is always of the form, we're going to take the cross product, T times the R rotation. Times the R rotation matrix. So, yeah, so these are the essential matrices. So, we go from a point correspondence to saying we solve a linear equation. And when we solve this linear equation, we have this special form of the matrix, which comes from the special form of these matrices up here. So, this is, whenever I say a central matrix, a central matrix comes with a T and an R is my information. Is my information? Questions? So maybe it would be helpful to say where E actually lives up. E is a 3x3 matrix. Oh, right. Yeah, I didn't say that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. So, thank you. So, what do I do? What is this Tx? I totally forgot about that. So, Tx, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the cross product of T with each of the Columns, each of the columns in R. So Tx, this is the matrix which acts by taking the cross product with each of these columns in R. So this now is I take a 3x3 matrix, I take the cross product in each of these components, so this outputs a 3x3 matrix. So I have a 3x3 matrix, so this is why this is kind of nice, is C1 and C2 were 3x4 matrices. 3 by 4 matrices. Now I have a consolidated relationship where I can say when I have a point correspondence, I have this linear relationship, and the linear relationship is characterized by a 3x3 matrix. So now I'm trying to recover a 3x3 matrix instead of trying to construct multiple 3x4 matrices. Yes. Excellent point. Anything else I forgot to describe? Or questions? So, are you saying this? Yeah? So, where does Tx? Is it a 3x3 matrix? TX is a 3x3 matrix. Yeah, so this is something I actually didn't know about. We had a different notation. I think Paul is the one who's like, this is really nice notation. So, yeah, this is like a standard notation, is like the matrix of the cross product. Yeah, so this is the, yeah, so like when you like, because the cross product's a linear map. The cross product is a linear map. So when you take the cross product with something, it's a linear mapping, so you can actually write it as multiplying by a matrix. And that's what this matrix is. It's just the matrix. You can write out the coordinates and it gives you the cross product. Just the exterior product with T1E1, T2, E2. Yeah, yeah. Just that, just that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Any other questions? Okay. Okay. So, what is the essential variety? The essential variety is, oh, here I defined it. I'm taking 3x3 matrices. So I have 3x3 matrices, and I want them to be of the form of this cross product times the rotation matrix. And then I have these 3x3 matrices, so this is now nine-dimensional space, but I want to look at this projectively, so now I'm living in P8. So this is the official definition. This is the official definition of the essential variety as we want to project and B into P8. So, what we're going to do is I'm just going to say, well, let's look at E. Whenever we see an essential matrix, we have T and R associated. And we're just going to say this is a subset of P8. So it's a 3 by 3 matrix, but we view it in P8. This way. Okay. So this is our essential variety. And so this is this, yeah, so this is kind of all of So, this is kind of all of the matrices of this form. And so, this is from Demeter in 88. It says it's dimension 5, degree 10, and we're cut out by 10 cubic equations. The determinant of B is 0, and then we have this, which comes from, if you look at the fact that we're writing it as the cross product times R, then you can get this information for the trace, for this equation. So, we now have a variety. I was reading a little Have a variety. I was reading a little on the history of this before preparing, and like when it was first introduced, it was degree 11. And I don't know, they just had one extra and then they dropped it down one. I thought that was really cool. I had no idea. Yeah, they just had no idea. I think Emars Yuk is a well-known French mathematician with Emozi. Yes, yes, yes. So he was introduced to this problem by the Disney people and they thought it was like they didn't know how to compute. I didn't know how to compute the things like that, right? This thing was like t must be probably. Let me take a picture. Yes, there has been a few French at the front that I did. So we have the essential variety. So we have the essential variety. Our degree is 10. And now I want to go back to the five-point pose problem for a little bit. Then we're going to leave it again. Okay. So we have the essential variety. The essential variety are all the matrices, which whenever we have a point correspondence, we have this essential matrix, which captures our point correspondence. So now for the five-point correspondences, well, we want to look at all of the essential matrix. To look at all of the essential matrices, which then satisfy these linear equations now for five different linear equations. So we're now in P8. We have five linear equations. So assuming things are generic, this is going to be a codimension five condition. So what are we looking at? We're looking at the Grassmannians of three-dimensional lines in P8. So when I say, so remember for the first. When I say, so remember for the point correspondences, we want to define the R and T, which gives us the relative position. So we want to solve for R and T, which goes from C1 to C2. So in order to solve for the R and T, the E as defined by R and T satisfies all five of these equations. So whenever we find an E here, which is also in the essential variety, now we've solved the five-point correspondence problem. Okay, so this is the problem. So, this is what we're working with. And then, the number of real solutions, since we're degree 10 and we generically don't want to have any repeated roots, and they come in pairs of 2. So when we have real solutions, we have 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Okay, so back to this. Okay, so now we're going to ignore the five-point pose problem. We're going to take the essential variety, and then our first step is. Variety, and then our first step is to say, let's intersect the essential variety with kind of any linear space of codimension 5. Now I think I understand, and I also remember this problem. So you look at different distribution of L's. So if you write L O 9, does it need unique distribution? So I'm defining it right here. Oh, that's defined. I'm defining it right here. Yeah, you're getting ahead of me. I understand. Okay. Now I'm going to say what I was about to say. We define. Now, I'm going to say what I was about to say. We defined the uniform distribution in O of 9. Yeah, I ended up kind of compressing notation here so we could remember things. Okay, so what we're going to do is we're going to take a fixed linear plane. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply u to L naught. This gives me some other linear plane. And I'm sampling u uniformly in O of 9. So O of 9 is a compact Lie group, so I have a finite heart measure, so I make it the probability. Finite heart measure, so I make it the probability measure. It's not the right distribution of the distribution. That's a philosophical question. You know? So that, it doesn't have to. So this, for the five-point correspondence you're right, it comes from this. So when we get to the other result where we switch distributions, we're going to come back to this L. But for now, we're like, that's pretty hard. We're going to end up with zonoids. We're going to end up with zonoids. I'm not ready for zonoids, so we're going to stick with just any linear space. Okay, but I do want to sell, this is not a waste of time, because even though this doesn't tell us anything about the five-point pose problem, this is giving us information about the essential variety itself. So it's giving us information about the essential variety itself, and in particular, for the proof techniques, we're going to, along the way, compute the volume of the essential variety. The essential variety. It's like to expect people to look at the essential variety. Yes. Hence, average degree of the essential variety is the name we chose for the title. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So any questions about the theorem statement before I talk about how I prove things? Also, I want to underline that it's an integer, which is exactly this. It's not a general period. It's not a general. It's not mechanical right now. Yeah. Well, I mean, there's examples, but all of the sorts of Z-squared solutions and expected. Yeah. Yeah, okay. This is going to be my tentative theorem. Can I ask a question? This essential variety of processes now for CP space. But I have the impression it would be defined in more generality. I'm wondering whether this integrality and the expectation is a general phenomenon for a family. But I don't know. And you are right across to say what you think. Well, it's the exterior product. Just a question of mathematical curiosity whether it's have you seen this with the exterior product defined more generally, or just the generalization of the cross product? Or just the generalization of the cross product is the exterior product is what you're saying, Frank. Okay. But yeah, but it probably lands in the wrong space. People exploit the fact that that R, you know, that R3 is nice for R5, way too of R3. Okay. I mean, there is something like trifocal tensors, which is like a generalization. It's just transparent stuff. Anyway, cross product tool tells us for this generalization of cross product. So we understand cross products. Do all those possibilities happen? Okay, so your question is, do all these possibilities happen with positive measure? We don't know. So for experiments, it seems to. Too. But this is actually in the further directions. It's like knowing for each of these numbers that something's going to happen with a positive measure. In particular, the reason the algebraic vision community wasn't a big fan is because we don't quantify how often zero happens. In the experiments, we actually have not seen 10. But you've seen the other numbers so far. But we've seen all the other numbers, yeah. Because there's a formulation of this that has some Z by 2Z structure. Some ZMod2Z structure to it, guys, some internal symmetry. Suggestion you could have done that one. Okay, yeah, but in the experiments we did do, when we did a bunch of sampling, we ended up not really getting, we did like 10 to the 9 to the 5 or something. Of this, it gets 20 solutions to 20 pairs. Oh, yeah, I have seen that, but no, this isn't the. And that will definitely have gaps. Yeah, yeah. Was the probability of zero the same as the probability of B? No. I'm going to show you. These things really vary if you do a lot of computing. Yeah. So here's, I'll just go back, go to the picture. So look at this little picture. Here's our distribution. Okay, so this is the O of 9 distribution. Here's the other distribution that will relate to the five-point pose problem. So yeah, so here you can see we did, we sampled like, I don't know, like 10 to 5 or something. So here's the distribution. So for each, we did. So for each, we just look at how many, what percentage of solutions are, what's the percentage of the number of real solutions that we found. So again, as I said here, we didn't find 10 in our numerics, but you can see in this one, like only 0.1% were 0. So we could have easily just missed that in some of our sampling. In the O of 9 situation, we actually had all the way up to 1% were 0. And you can see that 4 is much. And you can see that four is much more common, and then it kind of goes off to the side. So, and there is some symmetry in like two and six, but it's not perfectly symmetric. Yeah. So, yeah, this is something, this is on the to-do list. Yeah, I mean, you kind of, yeah, it's not perfectly symmetric. It's not even that close to being symmetric. So, there is some extra geometry. So, there is some extra geometry going on that I would expect probably wouldn't make it very symmetric around four. Yeah. Any other questions? Yeah? So do you think the volumes of these others are a rational number? The probabilities are rational? Because we did like a little Monte Carlo thing, and with very high probability, so we did a numerical experiment. So here, this mean value is 3.9. Value is 3.9. When we did kind of a like estimate numerically, it was 3.95. And then with high probability, it's between 3.9 and 4. So I'm not expecting an integer. With the 0.9? Oh, with the O of 9? Yeah, like the 40.5, 0.0. I mean, there's just. Like the volume, these are measuring the volumes of those regions. What they're measuring by throwing charge at points. Measuring by throwing charts at blankets and board. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know. But that's my. Yeah, it would be great. It would be great. But no, I have no reason to expect that. Honestly, we have no reason to expect answer was four either. Okay. Good on time. Okay. So the last proof idea I wanted to share is I said we actually have some like kind of, it's almost, it's. Of it's almost, it's actually pretty elementary in the proof techniques. It is not easy, but it is elementary in the sense that you can at least write down what you want to have happen. It's very hard to make it happen. Okay, so this is, Peter introduced this, the integral geometry formulas, the kinematic formula. So this reference is from Howard. And so the idea is in order to take the expected value, we have the volume of E, the volume of L, then we have a normalizing factor. Of L, then we have a normalizing factor, and when we divide by the normalizing factor, we end up with the codimension in the denominator. Okay, so this is our kinematic formula, which says, okay, we actually do know the expected value in the O of 9 distribution. It's the volume of the essential variety divided by the volume of P5, and you can compute the volume of P5. So all we need to do is compute the volume of the essential variety. And so, in particular, the answer is 4. So, we're going to show the volume of the essential variety. So, we're going to show the volume of the central variety as 4 times the volume of q to the 5. Okay, so yeah, so what do we do? So the essential variety, what do we do? We're going to take R and T. This is six-dimensional space. So R is in SO3, T is in R3, and we're going to map to the essential matrix, which is the cross product times R. Okay, so. R. Okay, so now we have a map which maps from RT into E. We're going to take the volume. Well, the coare formula says that the volume is given by integrating over your pre-image, and then we have to scale by the Jacobian. So the Jacobian, so this is just a change of variables formula, the covariate formula. So the change of variables formula, you just take the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian. Of the Jacobian. But when we start ending up with different dimensions, this is where the coarea and area formula comes in. So, what does it mean? It means that instead of taking the, so now your determinant is not a square matrix. So, you end up taking the determinant of J J transpose and you take the square root of that. And this is how you end up getting this. So, this is called the normal Jacobian. So, the coarea formula is change of variables when you have different dimensions, and then you just And then you just multiply to get a square matrix where you have a non-zero determinant, and you have to put it in the right spot. Okay, so the coare formula tells us how to change variables. And then the big thing here is this Jacobian depends on R and T a priori. But when we work with really nice uniform distributions, it does not. So, in particular, the first thing we do is we say, well, let's have J. The first thing we do is we say, well, let's have J independent of R and T. So when we want a Jacobian independent of R and T, we just use the fact that we can prove that we have an SO3 cross S2 invariance. So once we have this invariance, then we can write it as the product of the volumes times the determinant. And over here now, I'm dropping a lot of notation, but over here, I'm evaluating the Jacobian at the identity E1. Okay, so what we did is we said the volume of the essential variety using the co area formula is the 32π cubed times this determinant coming from the Jacobian. So then what we can do, and this is where it is non-trivial but possible to do this correctly, so you compute explicit basis elements for the tangent space. So we want to compute the derivative. The way we compute the derivative is we actually do this in coordinates. So the way you compute In coordinates. So the way you compute it in coordinates is: well, you have your basis elements. So our basis elements here, so the tangent space to S2 at E1 is just spanned by E2 and E3. So we have E2 and E3, and then we have the identity. And then for these ones, we look at E1 and the second component, and in the first components, we then have our fundamental matrices. Yeah? I just want to make sure I'm understanding. So the point is, because it's independent of all these things, Because it's independent of all these things, it's just enough to compute that normalized Jacobian at a single level. A single point. And you choose the nicest possible point. Exactly. Even then, it's probably still involved. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even then, it's even then, it's honestly doable. Like, it's a paragraph. It's a page. Yeah. It's a page of writing out the computation. So it is actually quite doable once you are consistent in all your notation. Yeah. Yeah. Something confused with the excuse effect that we have to see out of tension space to SO No, it's not the idea. It's the excuse of excuse control. I think it's not very some excuse I'm gonna tell you about it. Yeah, the th that that's the position of the ones and the negative ones are the transpose of the market. Yeah. So normally you switch it as pointed out, but you No, this is deterministic here. This is the matrix. Because we're computing at a fixed point. So, a priori, this is the computation. You have to compute the determinant of a random matrix. And so, this is what's going to happen when we change our distribution to reflect. Change our distribution to reflect the vision aspect. But for the O of 9 distribution, actually, we can pull it out and we don't have to compute a random matrix. So, this is why in this case we can compute it for the O of 9 and we can't for the other case, because in the other case, we're going to end up with the volume of the essential zonoid, and then we're working with computing the determinant of a random matrix. So, we get to avoid it in this case. Yeah. But in general, no, you don't get to avoid it. This is because there's a special. This is because there's just some special geometry the way the exception is like some fiber bundle. Yeah, yeah, there's very nice fiber bundles, O of 9x, perfectly nice, and it works very, it is very nice with respect to SO3 and S2. And yes, it's very friendly when it comes to doing computations. Okay, so this is direct, and that's the proof idea. So we use the cover area formula, and we can actually compute things explicitly. And then, as you mentioned, once we want to look with the five-point post problem, To look with the five-point post problem, we're now going to be taking these determinants and we can't just factor out the Jacobian and evaluate it at the basis point. Kind of. Okay, so this is where now we're going to get back to the five-point correspondence. And now we want to sample, and so now instead of sampling kind of any line, I want my lines to be sampled according to a distribution which reflects the five-point pose problem. So, in order to do this, I'm So, in order to do this, I'm just going to take U1, V1 through U5, V5, and I'm going to sample these uniformly in P2. So, I'm sampling uniformly in P2 in kind of my image space of my two cameras. And then this creates a random linear space here, L. So here, this random linear space now is actually the linear space, which gives us the answer to the pipe point close problem. Okay, so here's where we're going to get a 30 pi squared times the volume of k. squared times the volume of k. So we now do the same thing. We use the coaray formula and now our Jacobian is a 5 by 30 matrix for our first change of variables. It was a bit ugly. And then after you do that we have to do another change of aces and we're going to get the expected value of the determinant of a random matrix. So we can't fully get rid of this determinant when we're doing the coarea formula. We're going to do a couple different Formula. We're going to do a couple different Jacobians every time we apply the coarea formula, and then we simplify it down to getting the determinant of a random matrix. So the expected value of a random matrix is the volume of a convex body, and this is a zenoid. So what we can do is we do some change of variables with the coarea formula, and then we're able to say, okay, we can create the volume is given by. The volume is given by the volume of K is given by a zonoid with the following support function. So the support function, yeah? So you need the expected value determinant at zonoid? Yes, expected value determinant. Oh, determined. Oh, add determinant. Yeah, thanks, yes. I just forgot to fix it in the second line. Yeah, so it's the expected value of determinant of a random matrix. Determinant of a random matrix. And this, again, this determinant really comes from we're doing this normal Jacobian and you take the determinant. But now with respect to this distribution, we have a random matrix. Absolute value of Jacob. Yeah, when you do like the normal Jacobian, you do the JJ transpose, you end up with a positive semi-definite, so you don't need to do extrabody. So I understand this distribution of L, I think it was Cosmo and three dimensionally inoculum variant right now. It's a different side distribution. The side distribution, no, we're no longer in the O of nine. Yeah, yeah. We lose the O of nine. We have. List of the O of 9, we have 10 O of 3 distributions. And so we have some symmetry that allows us to do things like compute this 5 by 30 Jacobian, so we're able to simplify some. But because we don't have kind of this full O of 9 invariance, we end up still having this random matrix showing up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In your picture you had these five points and they looked to be close together. Did you consider variants where you don't sample uniformly the P's and Ps, but five or somewhere close together? Yeah, so that is on the to-do list of looking at different distributions. So we do have a formulation where we say, okay, you can, we kind of formulate it in the paper is you can change your distribution and then you can play with the numerics. We did do an example with like a box. Did do an example with like a box, so you like restrict to a box. So you can do some numerics there as well. But then it really comes down to you need to decide what are the numerics you need to do to solve your problem. Because you can kind of do any distribution you want. How do you want it to be closer? So that's on the to-do list. But yeah, that is definitely a lot of this setup that we have. You can do some of this, like this, some of the first steps. Like this, some of the first steps of the coaray formula is actually for a kind of more general distribution. But then, once you fix your distribution and you want to get more than just kind of a general formula that you can actually do something with, then you need to kind of get in the gritty details. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, there is a framework there for you. If you have a distribution you want to look at, this is something you can do. Okay, cool. So yeah, so then I'll just mention, so we have the support function and this is kind of the inner product with this, this is our random vector. So here you can kind of see we have like our angles and then we have some normal distributions. And then we have some normal distributions. So we have a uniform distribution on the circles, and then we have some normal distributions in terms of our coefficients. Okay, so what can we say about the essential zonoid? We can say that the expected value, so in particular the volume, when you compute it, we can get a lower bound. So the expected number of solutions is bigger than 0.5. Number of solutions is bigger than 0.93. So, what this does say is that, you know, it's not always going to be zero. Which the algebraic vision people really care about. They get very upset about when you have zero and when you don't have zero. So, it's also unknown. Which is also unknown, exactly. This is like a really important question. So, this is like a very, very rough kind of thing that we can say about it. Of thing that we can say about it. So you're saying they like, ideally, they like the condition that tells them when there's not going to be a replacement. Yeah, basically, one thing I think would be really nice is let's take a probability distribution, which is, again, like what you're saying, like restrict to a small area. And the thing that would be really nice is if we say, if we take something like maybe uniform with a small little square, then zero solutions isn't going to show up. I think they would love that. Or we can say when zero solutions show up. Or we can say, for example, even with this distribution, For example, even with this distribution, to say the zeros solution show up less than 1% of the time. So I think anything we can say about the zeros is, I think, something that people really care about. Because once you find a solution, then they're happy and you can pick which solution you want. There's algorithms for this, but it's when you have no real solutions that really you get into problems with your algorithms. Okay, yeah, so the technique for this is this is a rather complicated. This is a rather complicated random variable. It looks so simple, and you want to do computations with it. When you try to do anything explicitly, you break the computer. That's so sad. Yeah. So this is a five-dimensional tolerance. Yeah. Five-dimensional, right? Yeah. So we get some bounds. So we get some bounce, and we say, okay, we're living in this, this polytope is a subset of this giant of this zonoid. And then we just compute the volume of the polytope. So this is nice, except, as I mentioned before, when we do some Monte Carlo arguments, with high probability, this expected value should be between 3.9 and 4. So, yeah. We can guarantee. We can guarantee it's bigger than 0.93, but it's probably bigger than 3.9. Yeah. Yeah, and so this is something that I think I'm kind of hopeful about is like, for example, in this distribution, the zeros show up much less. So it would be nice to get our hands on the zeros and be able to say something concrete about this. Okay. Okay, so actually, are there any questions on the results before I discuss some other directions? I wonder what the vision people would like. Would they like the statement that the probability living in zero is, I don't know, less than 1% or something like that? I don't know what are they interested in. So they don't like zero, right? Yeah, but they go over that. Yeah. Yeah. So they're not happy with that. Yeah. So they're not happy with just throwing away that one data point that says because there's noise. Yeah. They're not happy with that. That's the line I got from the referee. I just can answer. I don't know. Do you have any more? What the referee said? Just the saying it doesn't seem to happen very often. I guess if you can, I think saying it doesn't happen very often with high probability might not be as convincing as we know it. We know it doesn't happen. Yeah. Or we know it happens with probability less than 0.01%. The data set of cases that you've tested and classify the number of solutions? Like to just say, are they easy to characterize on a computer and analyze them? Classifying the number of solutions in those cases. Um like with these like Like, what do you mean classifying them? Well, ignore the classifying question. Like, the data set question of, like, is it easy to kind of just run through each of these? Like, how many, how many pieces? Oh, yeah, we did a lot of cases here. We use homotopy continuation. Okay, yeah. So 10 to the 9? 10 to the 9. And then how are the... So then it's reasonable to actually look at the file of all of those cases. Yes. Possibly. Yes, possibly. I do want to analyze it. In which way, but I mean, we did it. We all have summary statistics. We don't have summary statistics. No, but okay. I mean, this is the question about class, about sort of understanding the geography of parameter space. What actually is the region where zero happens? That's extremely hard. I mean, you want to compare it to, like, say, you know everything about the prime numbers, about the homogeneous groups of spheres or something. It's a hard problem. Problem. Even a specific point, yeah. But it was not so hard to generate this data. Yeah, that's what I'm getting out. Yeah, so yeah, if anyone who's like, if you like, I think theoretically, this is a very, very hard problem. But if you want to do like more refined statistics of this, I mean, it's in the ballpark. You can generate it. We can even give it to you. Okay. Yeah. Give it to us. And post it. Okay. So anyone can do the data analysis. Anyone can do the beat down that is the same. It should be online for people to just look at it. The code is online. The code is online. Yeah, we did the code online. Yeah, the code is online. You can run it, but I guess we didn't post the data set. Wait for more minutes. Yeah. So, can you see maybe like, so why were we not so happy with the design that this is equal to four? Because it doesn't tell us so much about the two. The problem is with the answer. The problems with the answer being four is it doesn't tell us what the zero sets. And then it also isn't relative to like the five-point post-prompt. It's just saying about the geometry of the central variety instead of giving more information about these particular problems. Yeah. I have to admit, I did not understand possible problems again. Well, th th they play one or more stronger results than than than are obtainable at this time. That's probably what it is. They play one or two results. Yeah, super fun. Yeah, so I don't know. There was also issues that, I mean, the co area formula is pretty mathematically motivated. So I do think there were also issues in writing and selling to the correct audience. I also want to say I think they're a little bit more like, I don't know how to say, like, the way they talk is a little bit more strong. The way they talk is a little bit more stronger, like we're like a little bit nicer in this community, I think. Yeah, so you don't take it too personally, they're just like, I don't like this, yes, and then if you cannot convince them, it's just anyway. Mathematicians like it, so that's fun. It's so different from people. Yeah. Yeah. Very strong language. Their pieces are largely connected research as people have. So you're fooled by a thought. Maybe you should be able to do it. Okay. Alright, so we're going to wrap up in 60 seconds. Okay, so to wrap up, the one thing I want to point out is that we can work with other minimal problems. So a minimal problem means you have kind of the minimal amount of data. So like we had five points and then there were ten solutions. So we want to say I want this many points and I want to know there's not too many. Many points, and I want to know there's not too many solutions, in particular, finitely many. So here we have the essential matrix. We had five-point pairs, the degree was 10, and we said the average degree was 4 with O of 9, probably less than 4 with the other distribution. Okay. And then, for example, the fundamental matrix, you need seven point pairs, it's degree three. When you do the same O of nine distribution, then your average degree is two. Then your average degree is 2. But we don't have any other information for the fundamental matrix. And then there's all of these different points of problems that I think would be achievable to kind of take these tools and attack. And we're going to need more tools of, we're probably going to need more statistics when we can't do things exactly. So yes, there's lots more to do here in this direction. And just literally, this is all the different directions you can go. There's lots of options here. Options here. And then the last thing is, again, we've discussed quite a bit. What are the zero solutions? What are other probability distributions? Also was discussed. And then exact values for the essential zoning would be really nice. But we're not there yet. So yeah, that's everything.
