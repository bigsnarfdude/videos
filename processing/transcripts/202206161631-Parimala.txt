In this very special meeting, the birthday conference of Andrei Rapinchuk. Many happy returns of the day, Andrei. And I wonder as the last speaker whether I should thank the organizers for the wonderful organization of this meeting. Of course, I missed being over there for the celebrations, but however, However, I'm happy to have this opportunity. So let me begin. So what I'm going to speak about is joint work with Jaya IR. So let me begin with some connections between pencils of quadrics and moduli spaces, in particular twisted pencils and twisted moduli spaces. Okay, C or K is a smooth projection. C over K is a smooth projective hyperelliptic curve of genus G. And we suppose that throughout that the curve has a k-rational point. We also assume throughout that the characteristic of the base field is not two. So I recall a construction of Ramanand, namely associating a pencil of quadrix to this hyper elliptic curve, which is a rational construction, which goes back to Ramanand. Which goes back to Ramanan and Deshale in the 70s, in the case when the base field is the field of complex numbers. Okay, let us fix the rational point P in C K and let us fix a line bundle of odd degree. Say L naught is O C of 2g minus 1 P, where P is the rational point. So let W be the ramification divisor on C for the covering C. On C for the covering C to P1 and V is the vector space of sections of this line bundle L0 restricted to the ramification divisor, which is a zero-dimensional scheme. So this is a 2G plus two-dimensional vector space. So first of all, there is a pencil of quadrics. Q0 is TQ1 minus Q2 on the projective space. On the projective space P of V with discriminant of Q0 equal to Ft, where the hyper elliptic curve C to P1 is defined by the equation y squared equal to Ft on the affine part. So the Ramanand's work, which is a dissent of Ramanand Desale, says that there are isomorphisms. Are isomorphisms of the moduli space of rank two vector bundles, stable vector bundles of determinant L0 on C, which is Mc2L0, with this variety Ig minus 1Q0, which is defined here, namely the G-dimensional linear subspaces contained in the base locus of the pencil. Base locus of the pencil Q0. That is Q1 intersection Q2, the base locus. You take the G minus one dimensional linear subspaces contained in the base locus of the pencil. So there is an isomorphism of this model space with this variety. There is also an isomorphism of the Jacobian of degree G divisors on C with the Ig of Q0, the G-dimensional linear subspace. Q0, the G dimensional linear subspaces of the Bayes locus. So since we are assuming the curve has a rational point, the J G of the K rational points is not empty. And hence, I g of Q naught K is not empty. That is, every member of the pencil, the Q naught, has a common G-dimensional linear. Dimensional linear space of zeros. So, Q0, such a pencil Q0 is called a soluble pencil. And the next remark is that there is an action of 2 pix C k bar on these on the modulus space given by the tensoring with the line bundle. Okay, because if you fix a determinant L naught, the rank two bundle tensoring with a two torsion line bundle doesn't alter the. Torsion line bundle doesn't alter the determinant, so it gives an action on the moduli space. Whereas, there is also an action of the two torsion of peak on the pencil q naught. It can be quickly described as follows. Over the algebraic closure, we may write the curve as y squared equal to product t minus lambda i, where these lambda i's are the 2g plus two ramification points for the covering. And pick a basis for the vector space VK bar consisting of vectors, Fi's, where Fi denotes the non-zero vector in the radical of the pencil Q0 at lambda i. It's the degenerate member of the pencil. Take a vector, non-zero vector in the radical. For this basis, the two quadratics q1 and q2 get diagonalized. Q1 can be written as summation xi squared. can be written as summation xi squared and q2 can be written as summation lambda i xi squared and the let p1 p2 p2g plus 2 be the points of the curve mapping to the points lambda 1 lambda 2 lambda 2 g plus 2 on the affine um affine line so these are the ramification points on c and look at the divisor classes p1 minus pj as j ranges from 2 to 2g plus 2 these ejs These EJs form a set of generators for the two torsion of the pick with only one relation, summation EJ equal to zero. The action of EJ on the coordinates of the projective space is by sending xi to xi for i not equal to 1 or j, x1 to minus x1 and xj to minus xj. So this action under this action the mass. action under this action the maps v and c we described before commute with the two peak action so we have if you if you're given a cosycle beta with values in the absolute gala group of k with values in two peak c k bar we get a twisted isomorphism c beta from the twisted moduli space nc beta 2i naught to the the space ig minus 1 of q naught beta one of q naught beta where let me describe what these spaces are q naught beta is a twisted pencil of chondric quadrics and there is an associated brouwer class a beta in the two torsion of the braver group of k associated to the following co-cycle we are starting with the cocycle with values in two pixie k bar which sits inside the automorphism of the pencil which in in turn goes into the pgl2g plus two of k bar so the composite gives So the composite gives a Bravo class. And in fact, the twisted pencil Q0 beta is a genuine pencil of cordrix if the Bravo class A beta is zero. Okay, so what is the interest in this isomorphism of the twisted spaces? So this is the period index questions, the method of Lieblich. So see, suppose So, C, suppose C over K is any smooth projective curve, L is a line bundle on C. Suppose C has a rational point. Take a Bravo class on C and suppose the period is N. So you have a subjection of the ethylcohomology H2C mu n onto the n torsion of the Bravo group of C and with kernel pixie mod n. So this alpha tilde which we are starting. So, this alpha tilde, which we are starting with the Brauer class, lifts to a class in H2C up to a choice of pixie mod n. This lift alpha can be chosen so that it's this is a technical point that over K bar this lift vanishes. This alpha is defines a gerb on C and N C alpha N L. This is the modulus space. L. This is the modulus space of alpha-twisted stable sheaves of rank 2 and determinant L. And the moduli stack is denoted like this MC half of 2L, the associated moduli stack. And so we have this morphism from the stack to the moduli space. This is a mu and 0 associated Brouwer class theta in the Brouwer. Brouwer class theta in the Brouwer group of MC alpha n L. Okay, so what is the relevance of all this to period index questions? If the modulus stack admits the k-rational point, then index of alpha tilde, the Brauer class we started with, divides n. Says the period alpha tilde is index alpha tilde. And if the Brouwer class theta of the jerk modulus stacked modulus. modulus stack to modulus space is zero, then the modulus space admitting a rational point is equivalent to the modulus stack admitting a rational point, which would imply that period of alpha tilde is index of alpha tilde. This is a way to attack the problem whether the period and index coincide for Brava classes, certain types of Braga classes. Now, what is the connection between what is this twisted model space N C alpha N L? Space Nc alpha N L. It is in fact so this model twisted model space that is this model space of alpha twisted sheaves is the same as the twist of the usual model space of rank rank n bundles with determinant L by a co-cycle beta from the absolute Galva group to two torsion of the precon group of C, which is the image of alpha in H2C mu n to C mu n to h1 k n pixie k bar, which is a split injection from Legis sequence. You get a split injection split subjection and alpha maps to beat the cosycle class beta. And then if the we have been talking about the twist of the modulus space via this cocycle beta, that is the same as the twisted modulus space of alpha twisted shapes. At least it choose. Okay, so in this connection, let me state some open questions and conjectures. Let K be a totally imaginary number field, C over K a smooth projective curve, and script C over O a regular proper model of C over K where O denotes the integers in K and alpha is a Brouwer class of C. Alpha is the Brava class of C. Then the conjecture says that period is equal to index for alpha. That is, for Brava classes, unramified or the function field of a curve or a totally imaginary number field, the period is equal to the index. Some evidence which motivates this conjecture is the following. So it is a theorem of Lieblich, the corresponding statement instead of a totally imaginary number. Of a totally imaginary number field, if you take a positive characteristic global field, so we are in the following situation: x over Fq is a smooth projective surface where Q is power of P2A and P is a prime. For alpha tilde in the Bravo group of X, with P not dividing the period of alpha tilde, index alpha tilde is equal to period alpha tilde. This basically Brawer X is the analog. Is the analog of the unranified Brauer group in the case of totally imaginary number field? So, this is this result is true. So, this motivates this following the above conjecture for totally imaginary number fields. Okay, so what is the significance of this conjecture? It has some impact on quadratic forms. If the conjecture is true for just the two torsion of the Brouwer group of the The two torsion of the Brouwer group of the function field for all curves over k, then for a curve c over k, the u invariant of the function field of the curve over the over k is finite. Okay, let me remind us that u invariant is the maximum dimension of anisotropic quadratic forms over the field Kc. See, for instance, for the base field K itself. For the base field k itself, which is a totally imaginary number field, the u invariant is four, and it is an open question whether the u invariant of the function field is finite at all. And a still sharper question would be whether the u invariant is exactly eight. That means every nine-dimensional quadratic form owes this function field of a curve or a totally imaginary number field, where is it? Number field, where is it is every nine-dimensional form isotropic? These are all pretty wide open questions. And in fact, if this period equal to index conjecture were true for all curves over totally imaginary number fails, then the finiteness of the U invariant would follow. So, this is the motivation for this conjecture, the quadratic form motivation. And in fact, the And in fact, the corresponding analog when Kv is a periodic field and you take a piadic curve C V over K V, then the U invariant of the function field of the curve over the periodic field is in fact 8. This was not too long ago that this was proved for characteristic for non-diadic fields, it was due to seration myself. And more generally, Heath Brown and Leap prove it for all. It for all periodic fields, so that again is a reason to ask a similar question for function fields of curves or totally imaginary number fields. I know that there are some skeptics in the audience about this question. Whenever I have mentioned this before, there have been sort of smiles and skepticism from some of you. But still, I keep persisting. I keep persisting with the question. So now, let me stick to the situation. I discussed some generalities. So let me assume now that K is a totally imaginary number field. So I'm just sticking to the two torsion of the Brouwer group case for a totally imaginary number field. O is the integers in K. C over K is a smooth projective curve with a rational point. Curve with a rational point. Strip C or O, a regular proper model for C over K. And you start with a two torsion element in the Brouwer group of the strip C. That's an unramified Brouwer class. So this gives rise to an element alpha in H2C mu2. This is a lift of alpha tilde from the Brouwer group of the curve C. And we may assume this technical condition. Okay, so Okay, so what are the things to observe here about what is special in this situation? The Brouwer class alpha tilde itself vanishes over these fields Kv C. Kv is the completion of K at the place of the global number field. And you base change to Kv of C, the function field of the curve or the periodic field. These brother classes are zero. Are zero. This is a consequence of the fact that our Brouwer class extends to a Brouwer class on a model over the OV, the periodic integers. And this is a C or O V is a regular proper scheme with the residue field of O V, a finite field. So this is a result of Glowthendic that this Brouwer group is zero. This Brouwer group is zero. So, in particular, our class alpha tilde has a property that locally it vanishes over K V C for all the primes V in omega. Okay, and secondly, when we look at these twisted moduli spaces, M C alpha 2 L, the moduli stack and the moduli space, when we look at the extend the curve to the periodic field Kv, then all these. Then all these twisted spaces untwist into usual moduli spaces of rank 2 model rank 2 bundles with certain determinant. It may not be L, but it will be L tensor some L naught where L naught is a even degree line bundle locally, locally arising because of the untwisting. This is because the Brouwer class is zero. Class is zero. So the modulus, the twisted spaces become usual modules spaces of rank two bundles with certain determinant. But the odd or even is preserved under this under this untwisting. Now, if you look at the jerb twisted, the stack to the modelized space, this gerb is trivial locally because locally the stack. Because locally, the stack as well as the modulus space they all admit rational points. There exist rank two vector bundles stable with determinant L for any curve or any general field of characteristic zero, for instance. So there is local untwisting of this. So in particular, the Brava class theta associated to this jerk vanishes locally. Jer vanishes locally in the browser group of the model A space or over CKV. I'm sorry for this. I don't know how to put off the phone. Yeah. Okay. So you the gerb untwist. And suppose now the second fact to observe is that if L, the line bundle we have chosen is odd determinate, degree is odd, then you have a subjection. Then you have a subjection from the Brower group of the base field to the Brower group of the model space. Every Brower class in the model space comes from a constant Brower class. So this is good for us. This is because we know a lot about the geometry of the model space or the algebraic closure. It is geometrically rational with trivial Bravo group over K bar, and the Picard group is Z. From these facts, one can calculate. Facts, one can calculate that the Brouwer group of the base field subjects on to the twisted model space. So, this is so theta is a constant Brouwer class which is globally given, which is locally zero. So, by Albert Brouwer North Hasse theorem, the Brouwer class is globally zero. Therefore, since the Ger class is zero, so modulus, we only need to check that the modulus space has. That the model is spaced as a rational point, and it would follow that period is equal to index for alpha tilde, which is our goal. Suppose for alpha tilde and two torsion of the brewer group of the model and L odd degree. So, this model is phase because it untwists locally, it has local points. And the question of periodical index follows from a Hase principle. Folllows from a Hase principle for the model X space. It has a local point over Kv, whether it has a global point. This is a question of Hase principle. Of course, this MC alpha 2L is a nice smooth projective variety, geometrically rational. So there is no Brauermanian obstruction because Brauer crate to Brauer group of the modulus phase is subjective. So there is no Brauver-Mannin obstruction. There is no Brou-Monnin obstruction, but still, it is quite open whether this model space admits whether there is a Hase principle, such a Hause principle in general. In fact, we can relax Hause principle to a one Hase principle for zero cycles of degree one on this because we can go to some co-prime degree extensions. But even that looks an outstanding open problem. Okay, so now. Okay, so now let us go back. So, in order to find rational points, let us our idea was to go back to this isomorphism of the twisted moduli spaces Mc Beta to L with the G minus one dimensional linear subspaces in the base locus of the twisted quadric. Okay, so here what is So here, what is beta? Beta is the image of alpha in H1K2 pixel. This alpha is a class in H2C mu2, and we take its image in H1K2 pixie K bar and look at the twisted isomorphism. And so, over Kv, so we have that this alpha Kv because it vanishes in the Bravo group, it is in the image of. Brouwer group, it is in the image of pick, say Kv mod 2. So, in this situation, one can show that we remember the Brouwer class alpha A beta associated to the Galva Co cycle beta. So, this Brauer class locally vanishes, and the twisted pencil is actually a pencil. This is not an obvious fact. We use computations of Arul, Shankar, and Wang. And van to conclude that the browser class vanishes locally because this alpha belongs to the image of pixie kv mod 2. Therefore, because it's a constant browser class, globally the browser class vanishes. So the twisted pencil q0 beta is a pencil of quadratics. Okay, come back to the isomorphism psi beta. Hase principle for NC beta 2L, okay, because all this isomorphism is equal. Okay, because of this isomorphism is equivalent to the Haasi principle for this pencil of quadrics, this variety of whatever linear spaces in the smooth intersection of two quadrics. Both the questions on Hase principle are pretty challenging. So, what is the property of this pencil? We have that, we are, if you remember, we are looking for a G We are looking for a G. Uh, so I'm sorry, this is a type O. So, Mc beta is isomorphic to I G minus one. G minus one dimensional Lagrangians. So, when we look at we are looking for a G minus one dimensional linear subspace inside the smooth intersection. But what we have locally is that it has. Locally, is that it has the pencil has a G-dimensional linear space contained in the base locus. This is a fact locally because the pencil q0 beta is this untwisted pencil. Therefore, this Ig corresponds to the G Jacobian, so it has a rational point. So, we have the additional condition: not only Ig minus 1 Q0 beta locally has a rational point, but Ig of Q0 beta locally has a rational point. Locally has a rational point. So the question is whether there is a House principle for Ig minus one, given that Ig locally has a rational point. Let us look at this question for the case gene is equal to two. So here, Q0 beta is a pencil of quadrix in P5 with a smooth base locus. Hase principle for smooth intersection. Hase principle for smooth intersection of two quadrics in P5 is in general a very open question. So let me just state the following results, what we can say. Suppose K is a totally imaginary number field. C over K is smooth projective curve of genus 2 with a rational point. Then period equal to index for Rate equal to index for unramified Brouwer classes. In other words, our conjecture is true for genus 2 and 2 torsion Brouwer classes. This is some kind of an evidence. Possibly you can expect a more general result. So as one can deduce with a little bit of observation from this theorem, and using our isomorphism, which I just mentioned before, ψ beta. Mentioned before psi beta, we have the following corollary. If x is smooth intersection of two quadrics q1 and q2 in p5, k is still a totally imaginary number field. Suppose y squared equal to f t, where f t is the discriminant of this pencil. Suppose this curve, which is a hyper elliptic curve of genus genus 2, has a k-rational point. Then, if the base locus If the base locus contains locally a line, then it contains a rational point. It is much weaker than a Hase principle, but this much we can say: that if the base locus contains a line locally, then it has a K-rational point. Okay, so at least there is something positive to say, at least in a very special situation. So maybe the next few minutes, I'm sure all of you are extremely exhausted. I'm sure all of you are extremely exhausted after so many lectures, so I'll finish soon. So, maybe I'll give a few lines on the idea of the proof of the theorem. So, there is a Heke correspondence due to Narsiman and Ramanan, which goes back to in 1950s or 60s. So, there is a variety P, which builds a bridge between the usual moduli space of rank 2. Moduli space of rank 2 stable bundles with odd determinant and the moduli space of semi-stable bundles of rank 2 and even determinant. Okay, so this P is the variety which builds this bridge and P is constructed as a Grassmannian from the so-called universal construction of Universal construction of Poincaré bundle on C cross MC2OCP. I'll not go into the details of the construction of this variety P, but it admits morphisms S and S prime. S prime usually is a rational morphism, but in the case genus 2 happens to be a morphism itself. So, what are the properties? Yes is a P1 bundle and And the semicircle moduli space on the right-hand side is isomorphic to P3. And further, this S' is a conic bundle smooth outside a quartic hypersurface in P3, which corresponds to the Kuma surface of the curve C. So we have this diagram. So the Hecke diagram can, we can twist the entire Hecke diagram by this cosycl beta. Heke diagram by this cosycle beta. So, which gives the twisted Heke diagram. And let us look at this MCB, this twisted space. So, I should have had on the top. This is a semi-stable. So, here there should be a semi-stable on the top. So, this semi-stable space on the right-hand side is, as we mentioned before, geometrically, it is a P3 and locally, again. And locally, again, this is a moduli space, regular model untwisted moduli space. Locally, it is a P3, hence it admits a rational point. Because this is, therefore, this is a Bravo-Severi variety, which locally admits a point. So it admits a point, and therefore, this top MC semi-stable 2OC, this is in fact a P3 over K itself. So we have a nice P3 sitting on the right-hand side. Sitting on the right-hand side in this parameterization. And this P beta is a conic bundle over P3. And it is smooth outside aquatic hypersurface. And further, because the entire diagram untwists locally, and this is a P1 bundle and so on, there are locally ranked stable bundles. So the fibers are all P1. So P beta admits locally rational points. Okay. Okay, so we are looking for a Hase principle for Pβ now. If it has it satisfies Hase principle, it has a local point and hence it will have a global point and it will project to a rational point on this modulus space with odd determinant. And we are done with respect to proving period equal to index. Now, so how does one prove this proof? prove this prove p beta this p beta twisted space satisfies Sansa principle so so the key observations are that one can choose a line L L which is a P1 inside P3 such that when you restrict this P beta to L this over L is a conic bundle which is smooth outside a divisor of degree at most four and further we can restrict in such a way that the We can restrict in such a way that the Brouwer group of K subjects on to the Brouwer group of P beta restricted to L. And finally, we can still maintain that P beta restricted to L locally as a rational point for all place V in omega k. Such a restriction is possible. And then once you have such a conic bundle over P1 with these restrictions, so this P beta restricted L locally has a point and there is no Bravarmanian. And there is no Bravo-Manin abstraction because we have arranged Bravar K to P beta restricted to the sorry, there is a Brawer K to the Brawer group of this restriction. This is onto, there is no Braverman in abstraction. So you will get a rational point on P beta restricted to L in view of the following theorem of coleothylene. X to P1 is a conic bundle smooth outside. Bundle smooth outside a divisor of degree at most four. Then Bravarmanin is the only obstruction to Haze principle for the variety X. So we have a rational point for P alpha, projects to a rational point to the modular space, leading to period equal to index. So thank you very much. And once again, so happy birthday, Andrew. Thank you all. Thank you very much for this nice presentation. Are there any questions, remarks, comments? Please go ahead. Hi, Paramala. Do you have a nice geometric presentation or understanding of what the twisted pencils are? The twisted pencils are uh, yeah, there is a very explicit description of the twisted pencil, uh, which is written down in the paper, which is on the archive. And in fact, um, you know, we have a very geometric description of what is a twisted quadric is to start with. If you take a quadric and twist it by a co-cycle with values in the orthogonal group, then the descent of the quadric is actually a twisted quadric whose X whose structure it is some kind of a grassmanning of zeros of a Hermitian form or a Deutsche algebra with an orthogonal involution, which is all written down very well in literature. This is a corresponding analog for a pencil of quadratics, and it is quite explicit what this space is geometrically. Yes. It's like a vibration and involution varieties or something like that. Varieties, or something like that, and it corresponds to a pair of Fermi spaces on a centered simple algebra with an orthogonal involution, and it corresponds to certain Grassmannion in this of common zeros between this. Yeah, just continue. I had a different question, which is recently. Question, which is recently there's been a sorry, is it Asha who's speaking? I can't see. Sorry. Yes. Okay. Recently, there's been a lot of interest in computer intersection of two quadrics in P5 because of this recent work of Hassett and Schinkel and Wittenberg and Benoit. And they proved this major conjecture, this old conjecture of the, I don't know, Sony diagram, I call it the land, but the Using diagram colours to land, but such a three-fold intersection of two quadratics as a rational point is the non-existent. And they use this by analyzing this intermediate Jacobian and doing some interesting. So is there some related, I mean, can you get anything new from this intermediate Jacobian? Is there a kind of a rational intermediate Jacobian? No, I mean, actually, I have looked at their papers quite a number of times. Their papers quite a number of times when we were writing this paper. So I don't think you can get back anything on rationality from this. Are you not happy anyway? I mean, so I have seen this paper quite often, pretty well, some parts of it. Oh, no, no, I'm happy. I'm just wondering if. I'm happy. I'm just wondering if the analysis of the intermediate Jacobian ever comes up in what you're doing. Intermediate Jacobian of the base locus. I mean, essentially the constructions are, I mean, so they are looking for a line in the intersection, right? Line in the intersection, right? Exactly. Which is a linear space with dimension one. And this, it's a g for g equals two, I think it's exactly a rational point on this ig, you know, ig minus one. Right. I g, if I'm looking for Ig minus one, what I get locally, there is a line, then I get a rational point. I mean, so still, Hase principle is missing. Four rational points. Yeah, is it okay? Yeah, we are clear. Anybody else? Let's thank Harimala again. And since this is now the last talk, let's thank all of Key Bay. Thank all of today's speakers. We should give our warm thanks to the organizers who put a lot of time and efforts into organizing this fantastic conference. And it was really a joy after two years to be able to participate in person in the conference again. So thank you very much, Bohemia. Thank you very much for that. Unfortunately, he wasn't joined up, but I know that behind the scene he was organizing a lot. And so we will meet together one more time tonight at 7:45. I'm not quite. 745. I'm not quite sure in this room here in this room. Okay, so that pick up the ones.
