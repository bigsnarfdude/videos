Marko Ravovanowicz from the University of Belgrade, and he will talk about the zero device recognition of middle-class men. Thank you. I hope that you hear me. Yes, we can hear you well. Thank you. So, first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to present my work at this very nice event. Work at this very nice event. So, my talk is going to be a bit different than the previous one. So, it is about computing and getting bounds for the zero divisor cup length of real Grassmannions. Okay, so we all know what, so maybe to do it like this. So, we all know what this is. We all know what zero divisor coupling is. So in fact, here we calculate mod two zero divisor coupleng. So all cohomology groups are with Z2 coefficients. So we have this diagonal map and we look at the kernel of the induced map in the cohomology and the elements of this ideal are zero divisors and we want to find the maximum number of elements from this ideal. Elements from this ideal whose product is non-zero. So, why do we care about this? Well, by the Farber's original paper, this zero divisor coupling gives us a lower bound for the topological complexity. And here, so just a notation: here I use unreduced topological complexity. So, contractible spaces have. Contractible spaces have topological complexity. So, usually, it is a hard task to find the topological complexity of a given space. So, we are interesting in at least finding some good bounds for it. So, in this talk, I will want to examine how good is this bound and let's say compare it with some upper bounds for the topological. For the topological complexity. Okay, so what do we know about zero divisor coupling? So, first of all, we have to each class of the cohomology, we have this zero divisor. And moreover, by a result of Klein and Sucho, this idea of zero divisor is generated by this set. Okay, so instead of looking for all Of looking for all possible products of elements of this from this set, this ideal, it is enough to concentrate on products of this form and find the longest such non-zero product. Okay, and now in doing that, one usually needs to understand very where this cohomology to have this to calculate this zero divisor coupling. Coupling. Okay, so here we are dealing with considering the case of real Grassmannians. So just to fix the notation, so GK of, let's say, R to the N is the space of chi-dimensional inner spaces in the R to the N, if F is R. Okay, so in fact, what are the known results about topological complexity of Gasmanians? Complexity of gas manions. So there is this remarkable result by Farber, Tapachnikov, and Yuswinsky that states that the topological complexity of real projective spaces is connected to this immersion number. So in all cases, except these three, it is immersion number plus one. And in the other case, it is just immersion number. Okay, so what about? So, what about the? So, already this shows that this question of finding topological spaces already for real projective spaces is very hard. So, but what about the other Grassmannians? So, in the case of complex Grassmannian, the task is simple because this one is simply connected and symplectic. So, we have this equality, there is a general equality, and this. There is a general equality, and this produces the exact value of topological complexity. So, what about real Grassmannians? Well, here the situation is very bad. So, except the ones, the real projective planes, we don't know topological, at least I don't know, topological complexity of any other Grassmannian. So, this topological complexity of this Grassmannian. Complexity of this Harassmania of two-dimensional planes in equilibrium space of dimension four is not known. Okay, so maybe it's hard to calculate the exact value. So what about the bounds? So let us try to at least calculate or give estimates to this zero divisor complex. Okay, so um Okay, so since most of the calculations are done in the cohomology of the real Grasmanians, so I will give an overview of the, let's say, approaches and methods to calculate in this cohomology. So since this is about calculating, so I will mention several approaches. Several approaches, most of which we actually do not use in our calculations. So, one approach could be to use a Schubert calculus. So, in this approach, we know the additive basis. It is given by Schubert classes. So, these classes are indexed by partitions with at most k parts and with each part at most n minus k. And this describes the additive structure of the The additive structure of the cohomology. But if we want to multiply two classes in this basis, to represent this product in this additive basis, these little Richardson rule and little Richardson coefficients appear. So these are certain combinatorial objects which are hard to compute even in the case k equal to. So, if one wants to use this, then when he calculates two elements of these bases, each time he needs to calculate a bunch of these little Richardson coefficients. And so, in this talk, we are interested in finding large products, non-zero products. So, we would need to calculate. To calculate, so to iterate this process many times. So, this is not really useful for us. So, the other description that one usually uses is Borel's description. So, it is given by, so it is isomorphic to this polynomial algebra on the Stifel-Whitney classes of the k-dimensional canonical vector bundle. K-model of this ideal, which is Which is well understood. So, this ideal is generated by these dual classes, and these dual classes satisfy this relation. So, it is from this one can produce explicit formulas for these dual classes in terms of these Stifel-Whitney classes. So, everything here is well understood. So, one might think that it is easy to calculate in this description. Calculate in this description, but unfortunately, it is not the case, so it is very hard, and so much finer understanding of this ring, this algebra is necessary. Okay, so what is the first step that is useful? So when we look at the cohomology, we know an additive basis that is somehow very useful when doing uh things in this um this uh description. This description. So, additive basis is given by the monomials of degree at most m minus k. Okay, so what are the tools to calculate in this description? This is our main question. So, we will use this description, but okay, so we need tools to calculate in this. Okay, so just to mention that, in fact, these Stifler-Widney classes can also be. Stifel-Widney classes can also be seen as the Schubert classes. So, this is the Schubert class of this partition. So, this one to the I denotes the A tuple of ones. So, this is 111 I times. This will appear many times in this talk. Okay, so one can, in fact, if we want to work with these Schiffer-Whitney classes, we can work also in this Schubert calculus setup. Sugar calculus setup. So one might think, okay, I will do a bit in this and then go back to this description and go between these two descriptions. But in general, this is hard to do because the transition between these two bases are given by Kostka numbers, which are again combinatorial objects, which are hard to compute even for k equals 2. So somehow one should decide. One should decide which one of these two descriptions should use. So we decide this one. And one other reason is that here we from start we have some longer products in the additive basis. Okay, so how to calculate in this description? So additive basis is here, but so multiplication is dealing in this additive basis. Is in this additive basis is not really understood. So, my colleagues Petrovich Provolovich and myself tried to somehow get some multiplication rules for this to calculate in this basis. So, what we did, we obtained the Gramner basis for this ideal. So, I will not go into definitions and so on, but what is this Gramner basis? But what is this grammar basis? So we obtained a nice, let's say, gramnar basis for this ideal. So this is a generating set for this ideal. So each member of this grammar basis is, the corresponding class is zero in the cohomology. So each element gives us an identity in the cohomology. And these identities are not, let's say, random ones. They are very nice. They are very nice in the following sense: that if we have any monomial of degree n minus k plus 1, so these are the monomials that are just not in this additive basis. So, the first one that are not in the additive basis. For each of them, there is an element of this granular basis, which such that the corresponding identity in fact gives us the representation. Give us the representation of this monomial in this sedative basis. Okay, so for example, if we look at this three-plane Grasmanian in the Euclidean seven-dimensional space here, n minus k is 4. So if we are looking for this element with degree 5, the grammar basis will tell us how it is represented in this additive basis from Additive basis from here. Okay, so in fact, this theoretically gives us the multiplication in this additive basis. So by iterating this process, we can find represent any monomial in this additive basis. But of course, usually it is very hard to calculate this, especially when these Especially when these exponents are big. Okay, so this is not going to be also our main tool of calculating, but from time to time we use this when we arrive to some, let's say, when we have some, when it is convenient to us, when we have these nice monomials. Okay, so here, so we also would like long. Would like long products, and these products are mostly much longer than this n minus k. Okay, so the thing that we finally that we use is this projection from this natural projection from the complete real flight manifold to the Grasmanian. And we use the induced map in the cohomology. So, why is that useful? Well, this cohomology of Well, this cohomology of complete real-flight manifolds is, let's say, much easier to deal with than the cohomology of Grasmanians. So this is again described by Borel to be a polynomial algebra in Stief-Litni classes or the canonical bundles. These bundles are line bundles, so we have only this first Stiff-El-Whitney classes. Again, we have certain any. Again, we have certain additive basis for this cohomology. So let us briefly look at this basis. So here we have E1 to the power at most n1, then E2 to the power at most n2, and so on. This last one is to the power at most 1. So these monomials give an additive basis for the cohomology, and also there are certain formulas. Are certain formulas to represent classes in this additive basis? Okay, what is interesting? So, this A1 to the power of n minus 1 is in the additive basis, but already A1 to n is 0. So, the height, in fact, of each of these classes is n minus 1. And what is also useful is that we can easily detect whether or not a monomial in a top-dimensional cohomology group is Dimensional cohomology group is zero or not. So, this is the case if and only if this is a permutation of these numbers. Okay, so what about this induced map? So, this is the second bullet is what is very useful for us. So, if we have a class in the homology of Barasmanians, so to test whether or not it is zero, it is enough to see whether or not To see whether or not this is zero in the cohomology of this complete flag. Okay, so this V is this monomial and to calculate this P star, we just need this observation that P star of this Stifel-Whitney class is the elementary symmetric polynomial in these variables. Okay, so let us see how this works. See how does this work? So let's say that we want to test if this is zero or not in this cohomology of three-plane Grasmanian in R to the N. Okay, so our previous bullet says that it is enough to test if this is zero or not in the homology of complete flags. Okay, now we calculate this. So the first one, W1, maps to the Maps to the elementary symmetric polynomial, this one, and this one maps to this one. So, in fact, we want to check if this is zero or not. And now we see what are the nice, let's say, monomial we are dealing with. It's these where we are just the exponents are powers of two, or let's say just above these powers of two, then this is easily calculable. Calculable. And so if we calculate this, so these summons are all zero because these degrees are n plus two, n plus one, and n. So this is n. And remember that the height of these classes is n minus one. Okay, so this is, let's say, the nice situation for calculating, but often we stumble upon this bad, let's say, monomial. At, let's say, monomials. So we can have something like this. So to test whether or not this is non-zero, we have something like this. Now we work in two-plane Grassmanian. So now we have to see if this sum is zero or not. Okay. So what is the problem here? So if everything is in the additive basis, this is of course non-zero, but usually this is not the case. So when we Case. So, when we calculate all this, we usually get some monomials that are not in the additive basis. So, for example, in this case, the degree of E2 is n minus 1, and the largest degree in the additive basis is n minus 2. So, we will need to represent this monomial in the additive basis and then to see if this. See if this sum is zero or not. Okay, but in fact, for example, in this case, we are lucky and this degree is n minus one, which is exactly n minus k plus one. So here k is two. So this is the monomial that we can calculate using the Reynolds basis. And here this immediately implies that this is. Immediately implies that this is zero. So this description is also not efficient at all times. So usually we arrive at some sums that we need to see how to calculate. Okay, so what are the results about zero divisor couplenged of real Grassmannians? So in their work for Fiber, Tabachnikong and Fiber, Tabachnikov, and Yuszvinsky calculated this zero divisor cup length of real projective spaces. And remarkably, I'm not aware of any other results until Paveshit from 2021, where he obtained certain results for K at least two. So, in fact, my work builds upon his ideas. His ideas. So I improve and in fact correct some of the results obtained in this paper. So methods and strategy are very similar, but computation and computation is a bit more difficult. Okay, so let us go back to this ideal. So it is generated by this class at z of x. It by these classes z of x, but in fact, we can generate it by these classes z of w i, so the zero divisors corresponding to Stifel-Whitney classes. So, this is relatively easy to see. So, we have, so each class is a polynomial in this Stifel-Whitney classes. So, we have a monomial like this and this zero divisor. So, it can be represented like this. Represented like this, and then by induction, we see that this is in the ideal generated by this one, which means that this generate this ideal. Okay, so now our problem is to find the longest product of this type, which is not zero. So this is our problem. Okay, so what we do. So what we do, we use some basic facts and some hard calculations. So these basic facts I will collect. So the first one is obtained by Paveshit. So it says that if we know the height of the class X, then we also know the height of the corresponding zero divisor. So of course, we would like these numbers to be as large as possible, especially. To be as large as possible, especially one, the first one. Okay, so here we have this gives us the bound on these numbers if we know the height of the Stiffel-Wittney class. And the second one, so if we look at this sun, by dimensional reasons, it should be at most two times the dimension of the Rasmanian, and so by And so, by when you are a bit more careful, we get that we can subtract one here. Okay, so these are these simple observations that will be used. Okay, and so this first one, in fact, goes together with this result by Stong, where this where the height of the first Stifel-Whitney class is calculated. Class C is calculated. Okay, so why is calculating zero divisor couplength that difficult? Well, first of all, calculating coupleng of real Grassmannian is hard. So there are only results for k at most form. So these are more or less the values that we are interested in calculating the zero divisor carplane. The zero divisor cuff length of Rasmania. So the other problems come with this problem is the following. So if we look at this product, okay, it is a product of this type. And when we expand this, we possibly get many summons, so maybe many non-zero summons, but we have to be very careful and see how these summons can. How these summons cancel each other. So we can have many equal summons, which are, let's say, represented in a different way as monomials. Okay, so what do we do? So again, we do not use anything, let's say, advanced. So this is the best that we can do when dealing with this sum. So how do we prove that it is non-zero? Prove that it is non-zero. So we look at these types of summons. So summons that are equal to this. So the second coordinate is the non-zero class in the top dimensional cohomology group. Okay, and then look at these classes Pi and the corresponding coefficients which are products of Which are products of certain binomial coefficients. Okay, and to prove that A is non-zero, it is in fact enough to prove that this is non-zero. So if this happens, then we can conclude that A is non-zero. Of course, if this does not happen, then we do not know anything about this A. Okay, so there are many problems already in this method. So we want to collect all To collect all possible summons with the second coordinate equal to this one, then we want to examine these products of binomial coefficients. And at the end, we want to see if this sum is zero or not. Okay. So are there any questions so far? Okay. Okay, so I continue. So in the case k equals 2, so I was able to find all monomials that are in this non-zero, in this sub-dimensional cohomology. So these are given by that. And so for k equals two, this is our, let's say, mean lemma for calculating. lemma for calculating already for k equals 3 finding all such so when you multiply something like this so on the second coordinate you get something like this so i would like to see if this is how is this in fact represented in our additive basis so in fact we are looking for this so is it equal to this already for k equals 3 this i think would be very difficult to obtain all monomial To obtain all monomials that are equal to the non-zero class of the top-dimensional cohomology group. Okay, so what are the exact values that I obtain? So these are these three. Okay, so I will not go into details, but so for the upper bound, we use the simple remarks about the height of this ZW1. This Zw1 and this dimensional upper bound on the this plus two times this. So to prove that there are no longer products, we use only that. And to prove that these are not zero, we use the previous idea. So in fact, in the second two cases, this is much easier because we have these exponents that are more about Exponents that are more about 2 to the s, it is a bit more difficult in this case. But okay, let's say that this is not that difficult because we have a small number of these summons mentioned in the previous slide. Okay, so let us see what this gives us in terms of the estimates for the topological complexity. So, in fact, we can for In fact, we can for Grasmanians can do a bit better than the usual Farber upper bound. So, since this fundamental group is Z2 for the Grasmanians, we can lower the bound by one. This is a result by cost and Faber. And in many cases, we can this holds, so we can lower it by another one. So, in these two cases, in fact, we can lower these bounds by two, and in this case, by one. By two, and in this case, by one. And if we compare with our band bounds, we get that there is quite a gap between these two bounds. So it is about fourth of the upper bound. Okay, so for example, in these small cases, we get this, and I think that these are the best possible bounds for these small Virasmanians. Okay, so what about k equals 2 and the general case? Here I was able just to obtain the lower and upper bound. So there is a gap of epsilon between these two bounds. And epsilon is, let's say, the lowest digit, not one, so lowest digit with j at least one with for this t minus one. t minus 1 and this t is in fact n minus 2 to the s and n is between 2 to the s and 2 to the s plus 1. So this can be in fact half of n or it can be small and also this j can be small or big. For example, if t minus 2 is longer than 2 or 3 minus 2 or 3 modulo 4, then this gap is just 2 or 3. Three. Okay, and so to obtain this, this is really where we use all of this idea, and this really requires a lot of calculations. So here we have number, so as the maximum possible, the maximum number of summons that we want to consider, and for each of them, when calculating using this complete flash. Calculating using this complete flags, we get a sum. So there is a sum of double sum to consider and prove that it is non-zero. Okay, and again, the gap here is in fact larger than the previous one. Okay, so I was also able to obtain some result in the case k equals three, so it is worse than the previous one. Worse than the previous one. And so, in fact, for the general k, I think that this is the best bound. But as you see, this is very, very bad. So, this is like logarithm of k times n minus k and the upper bound is 2 k times n minus k. So, there is quite a large gap for general Grasmanians. Okay. Okay. So the related question is about, of course, about higher topological complexity. So we have similar story and by result of Rudiak, the aged topological complexity is again bounded by above, by below, by this aged zero divisor coupled. H0 divisor cup length. Okay, so the question is again: what is the difference between the lower and the upper bound? So is this when H is larger, is this better or even what happens? Okay, so and let's say optimistic and nice answer is that for certain spaces X and some large H, this gap between the bounds become Between the bounds become very small. Okay, and so we will test this for Grassmanians and certain other flag manifolds. Okay, so first of all, we establish these preliminary results like for the ordinary zero divisor coupling. So we have this kind of We have this kind of basic zero divisors. And in fact, we can so the sum of these two for i and j give us this one. So in fact, we prove that this ideal is generated by this zero divisor. So this is like a coin. A coin and such a result for a larger age. Okay, so we can now concentrate on finding long products of this form. Okay, so what are the other, let's say, general results that we can obtain? So this H0 divisor curve length can be bounded for. length can be bounded from above and from below by the cup length of x. So it is here h cupleng and this h minus 1 cuplength. Okay, this is nice. And what is even nicer is that when we look at this bound between this upper bound and this, so this is of course by this always non-negative, but it is also decreasing. So as h gets bigger, So as H gets bigger, this comes closer to equality. So at some point it stabilizes and we introduce this to represent this difference here. So are there any chance to get equality here? So of course let me mention that these kind of results are obtained previously for real projective spaces and this semi-complete real frame. These semi-complete real flag manifolds. So, this is some kind of generalizations of this concept introduced before. Okay, so let us see what we know about real projective spaces. So, there the cup length is equal to this dimension. So, this gamma is in fact h times the dimension minus this edge zero divisor cup length. So, if you look at this, So, if we look at this, this is exactly the gap between the bounds in the Rudiac estimate for the age topological complexity. Okay, so these gammas are in fact obtained for all real projective spaces. So, first, by work of these authors, this stabilizing number is obtained for all. Number is obtained for all n. Okay, and then Davis obtained the formula for. So if you know this one, you of course know the zero divisor complaint, H0 divisor coupling. So he obtained the formula for all zero, H0 divisor coupling of all real projective spaces. And what is a nice consequence of these results is that we can Results is that we can calculate. So, in many cases, that is, for n is even. So, if A is E is 0, so if N is even, this is 0. And in this case, we have that this gap is 0 and we can obtain topological complexity. So, this is for all n even and all h greater than this number. Greater than this number, where L is something that depends on the binary expansion of n, we can find the H topological complexity. Okay, so what can we say about other real Grassmanni? So do we have other situations when this H0 divisor comp length is equal to H times dimension? That is, are there any situation when we can use this? Situation when we can use this cohomological bound to obtain the H0 divisor coupling. So this equality will in fact imply the exact value of the H0 divisor coupling. And so there are not many options when this can hold because we know that this is at most H-time coupleng, and cup length is always at most the dimension. Is always at most the dimension. So this can only happen if the couplength is equal to the dimension. And by a result of Berstein, we know that there are only a few cases when this can happen. So for k equal 1 projective spaces or for the two-plane Grasmanian in this 2 to the s plus 1 dimensional Euclidean space. So let us test what happens with this one. with this one so we in fact obtain the general general formula for this gamma of two-dimensional real Grassmannians. Okay, it is again depends on the binary expansion of some number. So let us see what happened in this case that we are mostly interested in. So here t is one. So here t is 1. So here t minus 1 is 0. And the numbers of 1 ending 0 is 0. So this is in fact 0 for all h this big. So for all h this peak, we obtain the exact value of this h topological complexity. Okay, so I'll skip this. So what about other some other Some other flag manifolds. So a natural generalization of real projective spaces are these semi-complete real flag manifolds. So these consist of these k plus 1 tuples. These first ones are of dimension one and the last one is of dimension m. So if we take k equals one, we get k equals one, we get real projective spaces. Okay, so for these manifolds, we again have that cup length is equal to the dimension. So there is a chance that we can use this cohomology method to obtain the exact value of the age topological complexity. And so what are the results here? So first, this group of otters First, this group of outdoors obtained this topological complexity for k at most three. And in my result, I extended this for k bigger than three. So k at least three. I obtained again that the topological complexity has this largest possible value. Okay. Thank you very much. Are there any questions online or off here? Okay, well, if there are no questions, yes? Okay. Thank you. There is one question here. Yes? Okay, thank you for your presentation. In the page 13 This one the 14, I think. This one, this one, this one in the sketch of the probe, 13. Okay, what's your technique to prove the? What's your technique to prove that the z omega one to the power two to the power s plus one minus one is different from zero sorry can you repeat please this and this but your technique to prove that z one to the power two to the power s plus one To the power s plus one minus one z two is different from zero. Do you do you use any to prove this? Yes, okay. So okay, so this is exactly this. So I look for all, so when I expand them, let's say this, so this is something. So, this is something like of this form. Okay, so when I expand this, I look for all summons equal to these things. So, w2 to n minus 2. So, I know all, let's say, a1 and a2 from this lemma that will give me the second coordinate equal to this one. Then I look at Then I look at these, let's say, products of binomial coefficients. In this case, I have only two of them because there are two brackets. And I see whether or not this is equal and collect all these p i's that I obtained from this summons. Okay, so potentially I have s plus one summons here, and then I look at for this expression. Expression. Okay, and then I look, I use this technique to this technique to see whether or not this sum is equal to zero or not in the cohomology of complete flags. So it boils down to so each of these pi's is some sum, something like this. And then I have some sum of these sums. And then sums and then some some some things that i haven't mentioned some additional lemmas are required to see uh that this sum is uh not zero okay so it is a bit technical thank you are there four questions no okay well then we thank you again Thank you again. And our next
