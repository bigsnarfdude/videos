Alright everybody. My talk won't be as technical as the other talks, but maybe you'll find it interesting. Alright, so... That's true. Not my buddy, though. It's not my money. Okay, so I run the Dynamical Systems and Control Theory program at AFSR. I introduced myself earlier yesterday, I believe. And I said that I've been there for about eight years. There are some things that I've noticed over the years being in the program. You know, I've seen some. I've seen some changes, some breakthroughs that they can control theory. In terms of things being computable, it's kind of been slower. They've had some methods that have occurred in optimization for dynamical systems and for control, but again, there's always some complication, like SOS programming, for example, but then you have a hierarchy of STPs that you can't solve after a certain time. You always put this complexity somewhere else. There's complexity somewhere else. So I'll get to that in a second. But you're a part of the Space Force group. Was that? Yes, we do fund research for both services. The Department of Air Force houses the Space Force and the Air Force. It's kind of weird having Air Force twice, but that's how it works. Didn't make it up myself. We have many funding opportunities at Air Force. These are just a list of some of them. We have workforce development. We fund graduate students. We have the Assured Program for undergrads. Undergrads at ease for graduate students, smart program. It sends them to DOD laboratories afterwards. We have an early career award program. It's typically very competitive. I usually only get one a year. And that's the case for all programs. Many of the YIP awardees you see in my review, you give really interesting presentations. And we have only, for grants, we only do grants to universities. We only do grants to universities now. We have to do contracts for anything as a company. In the past, you could do grants to companies, but you can't do that anymore. All right, MURIs. Some of you here are on Muri teams. My recent MURI that just got out. Luckily, I've been very successful getting Muris, but they're very hard to do on my part. It's a lot of work. We have to write reports. We have to write the topic. We have to do our own research, write the topic, defend it. Research, write the topic, defend it. Then, once if our OSD approves it, we have to formulate form a panel with external people on it, and then we decide on the mirrors after that. You know, and I have to write a report after our decisions. So, whatever you see this, just have a little respect for the POs when they're putting these things out. It's a lot of work on our part, but it gives us a lot of money to leverage in our program, which is very good for us in the community. So, it's very good for okay. This is, I believe, the current setup. I believe the current setup, there isn't, no, there's some things missing from this. Okay. These are essentially, you can think of: these are the teams for IFWSAR. The branches, this is one branch, and this is another branch. I am in the information networks branch. This is formerly kind of like the math-oriented branch. They used to have like divisions above it, and they would have some of the programs here be in the math team or whatever. And the math, the math been. And the math-bent programs now are my program, Fariba's Computational Mathematics program, and mathematical optimization run by Warren Adams. There is another program that popped up this year. This past year, my division chief wanted, and the rest of the office wanted to have an astrodynamics program. That's formerly my community. I was like, oh, what you want to do? I haven't been in that community for eight years. So we, you know, my colleagues and I brainstormed, had a workshop, and decided on the way forward for that program. Workshop and decided on the way forward for that program. We still do not have a program officer for it. There should be advertising for it. If you know any of your students or yourselves want to apply, feel free to. Let me know if you have any questions about that. But that's an up-and-coming area that needs mathematics, good mathematics and computational theory. And it's extremely important to the Space Force. And they're going doing things that I never could imagine the Department of Defense would be doing. So it's very interesting. I could talk to more a little bit more about that. I could talk a little bit more about that in a couple of slides. Okay, one thing: we have international offices. There are some people here from different countries, and most of the time they don't realize. I think we're probably the most progressive in funding international research among all the server science offices. We have actually another office not appearing on there, two other offices actually. We have one in another SOWARD office in San Paulo. We have one in Chile, Santiago, Chile, and we have another international office in San Paulo, Brazil. Reason why Brazil is so big, it takes up half the continent, more than. So big takes up half the continent or more than half the continent. So you can't just have one office really, really south in Senegal, Chile, to cover the entire continent. We have an office in Melbourne, Australia now, too. It was too hard for a Tokyo office, the people in a Tokyo office to keep flying to South Asia because, again, it's very far away. Just because it's called Asia doesn't mean it's close, right? So they've made some changes there. All right. This is my program. My program. It's a dynamic system in itself. It does have change, it changes with time. I changed it from the classical program originally. The classical program didn't have, like when I took it over, I should say, didn't have as much emphasis on dynamical systems theory, on modern dynamical systems theory, so many problems. So I added that. What I mean by that is like, you know, something Rafal would appreciate. Set value dynamics is one thing that. Is one thing that is becoming very interesting. A lot of reachability set calculation on differential on differential inequalities, differential occlusions. There's a lot of interesting stuff there. Paul gave a beautiful talk yesterday, and you see how sometimes when you generalize a problem, you get better results. It's very true. Graphs are, I want to move fast graphs. I've been trying to get people to send me things on higher order complexes such as hypergraphs. On higher-order complexes such as hypergraphs multigraphs, topological complexes. And there's a reason why. The problems that the DOD is interesting, it's not just aerospace vehicles, okay? Are so complex that the representations that describe such problems, they're all over the place. You can look at the programs at the technical directorates and our programs at our office. They have mathematical representations that are not just graphs. So that's why I've been trying to move into a little bit more general. A little bit more generalizable of mathematical representations. Formal methods is very important to autonomous systems. The tractability of computational formal methods, synthesizing safe controllers, verifying the system behaves well. There's been some wonderful advancements, especially by Powell in that area over the years. The control barrier functions have, you know, their work on that is pretty much everybody's using it now, everything, but it has made a lot of But it has made a large set of specifications tractable to verify, which is great. Where this is going is also black box elements. They're not necessarily neural networks, but when you have an autonomous system, you get components. They're proprietary. You don't know how the thing works, like the inner guts of it, right? The company's not going to give you those secrets. Distributed and decentralized control of network systems. I'm not funding as much of this as I used to be, and the reason why is because. Used to be, and the reason why is because we have a complex networks program. Whenever I go up to review, he's, you know, Don Wagner's got the sexy stuff, you know, sociological neurological networks, very high complexity, billions of nodes. And I go up there with, you know, my, you know, formation flying of three vehicles thing. The complexity is different, but still, there is somebody that does have much more knowledge on network science and graph theory and other areas. I don't, that's handling some of that. That's handling some of that. But I am funding some of this stuff on higher-order complexes. I am interested on how you control multi-agent control over hypergraphs, over more general topological complexes. So a big thing that I've been putting more resources into, Art could be presenting that tomorrow, I believe, is high to infinite dimensional control. It took Frieba about almost eight years to convince me. About almost eight years to convince me. She convinced me. She started a lot of new programs that I found very impressive. So I've been adding more money to that. What I mean by high, you could have a countably infinite set of ODEs. You could have PDEs. You could stuff in ensemble control. You could do all these things. So you can't just say infinite. So high to infinite dimensional. It's valid for many different types of non-mechanical systems, too. So yes, that's another. And finally, constructive mathematics. Now, this is a very Constructive mathematics. Now, this is a very pure area. People would ask why I'm funding this. I'm not funding people to solve conjectures using computers, okay, or proof assistants necessarily, but what I am funding is to build some of the plumbing for all the theorems and lemmas you guys prove so that they can be fit into some of these theorem provers and search library. There's libraries of those theorems and everything have been proven for autonomous systems. This is going to be very important someday. Very important someday, so I'm not missing out, and I'm actually putting some resources into that. All right, here's some of my opinions. Now, everybody's, this is where you guys throw stones, probably. Smooth manifolds, great. Lead groups, great, a lot of structure, a lot of good theories, very nice. We have systems with constraints, and many of those constraints turn these manifolds into stratified spaces. You might have dimensions collapse, they glue. You might have dimensions collapse. You have strata glued together. Strata might be nice, but they're glued together and they're not the same dimension everywhere. I would love to see results in the topological and geometric nature on stratified spaces. I'd like to see that advance. And the reason why, we have constraints. I don't want to see people constraining vector fields anymore. And assuming that you have the entire space, and there's a reason for that, you have to keep track of where the. And you have to keep track of where the vector field and you have to make adjustments. You might even make this system more complex in doing so. I want people to be able to deal with that structure, and that's what I'm looking for. So that's just an opinion. Again, these don't have to be finite-dimensional pieces either, right? They can be a mixture, right? For semi-algebraic, I believe it has to be, but I mean, there's other stuff I'm interested in beyond the simple stuff here. Beyond the simple stuff here, the simpler stuff here. Okay, I already mentioned this, but again, different dimensions: sheaves versus tangent principal bundles, you know, sheave cohomology, all, you know, this area is becoming really hot, but how do you compute it and how do you guarantee certain properties? I believe Rob Grice talk I saw at Socio-Math Review, he said, and he admitted, I think it was, you could compute the first homology. You could compute the first homology, the first cohomology and the second one, maybe zero from the first. But after that, it's not functorial in general, right? It's not so that means you don't get the collapsibility, like you can't use the things for computation necessarily that you can contract all the cells and make it a much simpler computation. So, computation homology would probably have issues here. So, yeah, I'm really interested in this. Just extensions of the work that's Just extensions of the work that's been done, the great work that's been done to things that might not have the same dimension. The things above the stratified spaces. All right, computation. This is something that we've had a couple workshops on at IEEE CDC and ACC. Computation aware control. It's just not being addressed. It's really, there's like a thin line between Between doing something very specific for a specific application, and that's applied research, but then there's also being aware of implementation issues to drive the theory. And some of the things that I think the community misses is that they come up with a great theory, but they don't take into consideration if it's even implementable once they turn it into an algorithm. I mean, you might look at complexity of an algorithm and how many computations it has, but even memory, on a lot of these. Memory. On a lot of these, a lot of real systems, you don't have the memory. You can't do all the tricks that you did on your MacBook Pro. Okay, I mean, a lot of fielded systems have very little memory and very laughable computation. I mean, I believe the satellites, if they're still using the RAD 750, which I thought, maybe it's for tilt seven or something, but it was like a penny in three. Okay? So when you tell me you got your M2 chip, M3 chip, and this is how fast, it doesn't matter. It doesn't mean anything. And this is how fast it doesn't matter, it doesn't mean anything, right? At the end of the day, you have a processor with lots of memory and you have a very fast computer. So, for real systems, eventually the theory's got to lead to things that are implementable. Okay, so that's something that I'd like to see. How do you compute invariants? What invariance? I think John brought up something funny, like 25th homology. You know, I've talked to people about this before. I mean, what is it telling you, right? What are the invariants telling you? Whether the geometric. Invariants telling you, whether they're geometric, whether topological invariants, what are they telling me? It's an invariant set. Okay, what can I learn from that? How can I compute things? This is important. I think that, especially in the topological data analysis field, I remember reading, seeing some results, and I was curious, what does H, the 125th homology mean? Like, what does it mean? And, you know, what can I gather from that? Like, how do I use those embarrassments? From that? Like, how do I use those invariants to say something about the system? I want to know that information. In the MURI, that's the open hybrid systems MURI. That's something that was really important to me because I want composition to preserve the idea of what the invariants do. I don't want invariants to be destroyed or what they mean over composition. And that's very important for hybrids. I believe for hybrid systems. And composability. Compositionality, composability. I don't know, composition. Composability. I don't know if compositionality is going to work. But yeah, you know, we have very hard problems. Any theory that leads to modularizing those problems and giving you similar to the same result is welcome. I think that's a very elegant and a nice way of doing things. There's global versus local. We need both types of information. I think a large part of the, you know, a lot of the research in the universe, but I wouldn't say all by large has been focusing on local results. Local results. And, you know, it's really nice to be able to say what solutions are not even possible before you even start constructing and synthesizing the right solution. Be nice to say, you know, the admissible sets that are allowed to you at this point in time have this structure. It has this many connected components. It has, you know, this place in the space, this place that holds the ambient space, you want to be able to stay. You know, you want to be able to say those things before you start tracing out trajectories in those components. And that's something that I think needs to be done. Optimal versus feasible. Feasibility is very important to autonomous systems. I don't care if I say fuel fly fly off a cliff. I want to be able to stay on the road, drive safely, meet all the requirements first, and then be optimal. But how can I trade those off? What do I get from trading those off? Trading those off. I am more inclined to accept tractable feasibility results than I am to accept intractable optimal results. So that's just the other thing. And finally, I didn't make a slide for this, but we do have an astrodynamics portfolio that we're starting up, and its emphasis is on a couple things. One thing is intelligent servicing and assembly and manufacturing in space. So essentially, spacecraft program. So, essentially, spacecraft robotics for servicing and manufacturing things like larger structures. It's extremely complex. It's a very hard multi-body system with tons of uncertainty. So, I mean, these are problems, and sure, you could say they're applications, but you don't really have the mathematics to trackably do any of these things and still be computable on space and implementable on spacecraft processors. There's also the more classical problems of in astrodynamics. And astrodynamics, cislunar space. So, believe it or not, the Space Force is interested in having spacecraft between here and the moon, which I couldn't believe, you know, because that's been NASA's domain for a very long time. But the problem is, is they haven't, the conops they have for what they want to do is against a large chunk of the work done on those problems. A lot of the work done on those problems. A lot of the work done on this problem, and I'm not talking about the analytic solutions or the closed-form solutions. I mean, those go back a long time. The top mathematicians in the world tried to solve these things. But even just the more relaxed problems, you know, a lot of the work in astrodynamics has focused on regimes close to liberation points, when you have nice trajectories. Now, they're not rectilinear orbits or anything necessarily, but you still have things that kind of remain the same shape in the chaos. Same shape, and the chaos is much less there. There's more chaotic regimes away from these points. The problem is that the CONOPS for the service wants orbits, and APL and other people, not just the Space Force, wants orbits that go around a whole bunch of libraries points. And one of the big problems with cislunar and the gravitational wells is you have trajectories that go around the moon, come back, and go around Earth, come back. Back and go around the earth, come back. You have these weird things that happen. It's not, they don't all stay in between the moon and earth. And one other thing about that, topologically, a lot of the physicists look at n-body problems and they're not solving the same n-body problem here. The bodies are not homogeneous. You have to delete that diagonal from the space because you don't want them to crash into each other. You want orbits not, you know, not consensus. Okay? So it's a different problem. So, it's a different problem. The topological space is much more complex, and there's room for research there. And that's really all I have to say, and the rest is open for questions. I only prepared at 15 minutes long. Yes, John. I have a question. I I know this initial phone leak uh calls for proposals. Calls for proposals. Do you guys ever get together, program managers, and jointly school and Yuri? Yes, all the time, actually. We actually supposed to have the other services aware of all of our mirrors. I've had other, I mean, we've had ones with ONR and ARO. I've had more with ARO, I think, than ONR. I have a couple, well, they've kind of changed their office a lot. A lot of people left and switched out, I think. But ARO, I've had more. But ARO, I've had more people from ARO involved in my Mirrors than ONR. But we do have even people from DARPA, people from other agencies in the government that are involved in our MIRIs. They pay attention to them while they're awarded. They come to review sometimes. I'm sorry. Sorry, John. Go ahead. I want to monopolize, but no, you have plenty. Some of the mirrors are interesting to me. Interesting to me is that they have engaged other countries. So that's harder to do. Australians. So that's an interesting question, and I'll tell you how that's done. It's very ad hoc. Basically, what ends up happening is OSD, not us usually, talks to the other country, and the other country agrees to pay a team on the similar amount of money to do the project. Of money to do the project and collaborate with the team that we pay for, but it's not, there's not a BAA or anything, I don't think. There might have been in a couple of BAs actually, but OSD had to set that up. Yeah, that was my impression. And they had a revised BAA because it was after the fact. Yeah, I think the OSD gets a collaboration set up because a lot of these things are cost-sharing. So it's like, Cost sharing. So it's like, you know, the US government's throwing in one and a half million a year. So what are you willing to put in? You know, and it's only specific countries, obviously. So there has to be some bilateral, trilateral, whatever agreement. So it's kind of out of our, it's got to be done through like Lords Development or the Secretary of the Air Force Office or something. Okay, Matt, something else. Oh, thanks. I know we talked about this a little bit yesterday, but I was wondering if maybe there are other things. So but you're Things. So, but you're, I guess, the first bullet under spaces. I was just wondering if you could maybe say something about: are there specific problems you have in mind about what would be addressing doing stratified spaces? Well, I mean, compute invariance, understand the types of solutions that are available. Like, you know, you brought up Rocket's lemma, I don't know, you know, the types of control solutions, even, like, the types of controllers that you can construct on these spaces. That you can construct on these spaces. I mean, I looked at these things from a singularities aspect for a little bit, but I mean, there's little, there's obstructions, right? And, you know, you want to be able to say something about, you know, one of the things is like the example I used, I think, at lunch yesterday was there was a winery in Virginia, in Madison, Virginia, called Early Mountain. No, actually, it's one of the winers we go to that's our favorite, one of our favorites. Maybe it's Barrel. Sorry. But you're driving on the road. Uh, but you're driving on the road, you can change lanes, you have, you know, you can go, you can go in the X direction, right? And you go, you go forward in the Y direction. You get to a little bridge, you can't. There's a little bridge that goes to the winery for a certain amount of time, and you can only stay. I mean, one person's got to wait for you over here, but you go through. I mean, if you look at that as a space, that choke, you know, it's like a, you know, it's like a dumbbell almost, right? Or like, you know, yeah. Or like a kettlebell, actually. The point of it is. The point of it is: it is low-dimensional there, right? There are problems that actually have dimensions collapse that you have to deal to deal with. And that problem would be for the navigation, right? If it's trying to tell me to change lanes, there is no other lane, right? The system's got to be smart enough to move aside and let the other person in to go in, right? So, yeah. So, you know, when I, the reason why I also bring this up is semi-auto-breakout. Also, bring this up is semi-algebraic optimization. A lot of the tools you see and a lot of the constraints you see form these types of spaces. You get them out of the admissible set from the get-go, right? And if you get them out of the admissible set from the get-go, we should be paying attention to the topology and geometry of them, you know, versus just pumping everything through optimization, assuming it's going to work. The feasibility problem is really hard. I mean, missible set problem is very hard to get an optimization. Sorry. Yes. But you know, just I want to expand a little bit on this example of your example. So my perception was that dynamics of stratified spaces is sort of difficult. But you know, like already the pre-dynamics, if you look in this example, you have like a couple of vehicles trying to navigate through the singularity. You know, this is the integration space of multiple points with you know all the singular spaces. So raising the sort of continuous. But y so you you're okay with just looking So, you're okay with just looking at pre-dynamics, like even just the topology of migration spaces would be already. Because you want to know where you shouldn't be trying to construct solutions before you construct solutions. That's what I was trying to say. At this point, you shouldn't be constructing a two-dimensional solution here. Here, you shouldn't be here. You know what I mean? Like, if you're trying to get from this point to this point, when you get here, you have to construct a one-dimensional solution. Here, you have to go around a circle. You have to be not. Circle, you know, you have to be knowledgeable of what you can actually do, what the space allows you to do before you construct solutions. And that's really what I'm getting. The sheets as well, I'm thinking of the same sort of thing, right? It's going to be a bound for the variety. That's right. That's right. I mean, I see that as the next step, right? You know, different dimensional pieces of information lying above the spaces. So I'm sure you can inflate the You can inflate the thing and add zeros, and you know, but I, you know, at some point you're destroying the tractability of computation because you're making it with the two foods. Is that it? I think everybody wants to. My name is Krishna Prasad. I'm calling remotely. Hi. I have a question. Among the programmatic things that you presented to us at the beginning, That you presented to us at the beginning in multiple columns. One item of interest I found had to do with neuroscience and cognitive science, and I believe under the information area. And are there interactions between the dynamics and control program and that type of concentration that I had to find? There always is. There always is between all the NOs. The problem with neuroscience has been that the mathematical representations that my colleague uses, or that his community uses, that runs the computational cognitive neuroscience program, they're not that interesting from a controls perspective, right? Because uh th now there is controls people doing very interesting stuff in neuroscience, but the neuroscience community hasn't adopted, I don't think, uh uh as much like at least the community he's working in, uh much of the controls stuff. Much of the control stuff. I've never got sent anything, for example, that I thought was like, wow, this would controls could change, like, you know, make this, you know, a game changer for this thing that you have. But I also don't know neuroscience that well, so I rely on my colleague to tell me what the big problems are. But it's of interest to me. It's of interest to me. Definitely. Okay. All right. Well, I guess then we're done.
