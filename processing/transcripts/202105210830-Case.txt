Time to start. This is the last talk in the meeting, and we're happy to have Jeffrey Kayes. It's the I prime curvature in CR geometry, so please go ahead. So let me start by thanking Mar for the introduction and the organizers for giving me the chance to talk. Organizers for giving me the chance to talk, and also all the speakers for all the really great talks this week. It's been really good and definitely worth waking up early for every morning. Okay, so I'm going to talk about this thing called the I prime curvature, which I expect maybe three people have heard of before. Before I get to that, let me first motivate it by something in conformal geometry that is probably a lot well more well known. So, what I'm writing here is known as the desert. Is known as the Deser Schwimmer conjecture. It was solved by Spiros Alexakis in his thesis, and I'm just writing the year that his book was published. So the statement is the following. If you start with a natural scalar Riemannian invariant, so it's a function, but natural really just means this can be written as a polynomial and the curvature and derivatives and things like that. With the property that this particular integral here is conformally invariant on all closed n-manifolds, well, it turns out you can. Manifolds. Well, it turns out you can give a very good description of the scalar invariant itself. It has to be a linear combination of the Q curvature, the critical Q curvature we've seen show up a lot, basically highest power derivative of the scalar curvature in lower order terms. There's also a divergence, of course, because I'm integrating. And then the only other things that can show up who have conformally invariant integrals are actually integrals of local conformal invariance. So we all Conformal invariance. So, we all know the formula for the Gauss-Benethern formula in dimension four, where it's the integral of Q plus the integral of Vile squared. There's things like that in higher dimensions. So, of course, if you do work in CR geometry, the natural question is, is there a CR analog of this theorem? As Kengo mentioned in his talk, there is a CR analog of the Q curvature, but it's not a very good object for. Not a very good object for this statement because the Q curvature has the property that it always integrates to zero on a at least strictly pseudo-convex CR manifold. That's a recent result of Marigame. So most of what my talk is about is trying to formulate a version of this conjecture in CR geometry. It's still an open problem. Okay, so let me quickly remind you of what a CR manifold is and introduce some terminology. All this showed up in Kango's talk a while ago. Showed up in Kengo's talk a while ago. So, a CR manifold, it's even sorry, an odd-dimensional manifold. You equip it with a rank n distribution, sub-distribution of the complex tangent bundle. We're going to require that it's integrable. That's written somewhere in here. And we're also going to assume that it's non-degenerate. So, I'm writing the non-degeneracy as the Levy form. This metric, if you will, on the bundle T10 is non-degenerate. The bundle T10 is non-degenerate. So it's a contact manifold, and on the contact distribution, you have this integrable, almost complex structure. Now, the one form here, theta, the one whose kernel is the real part of this bundle T10, this is not uniquely determined, of course, because you can take theta and you can multiply it by any nowhere zero function and it'll have the same exact properties. So a choice of theta matters. A choice of theta matters. A choice of theta is determining a, I'll call it a pseudo-Hermitian structure. But I'm really interested in what quantities, either scalar or integral quantities, can I define in terms of theta, which are actually independent of theta. So the local invariants will be the ones that are local invariants independent of the choice of theta. I'll mention strict pseudoconvexity. Sometimes that's when the metric is positive definite. Definite. Okay, so what's the problem with Q curvature in CR geometry? It's not on this slide, but I'll say it. The problem with the Q curvature comes from this important class of contact forms called pseudo-Einstein contact forms. So these contact forms, the name was introduced by Jack Lee in 1988. These are just the contact forms. Well, let's just point here, which in higher dimensions have the property that the Ricci tensor. Property that the Ricci tensor, the Ricci tensor you get from the canonical connection associated to a choice of contact form, the ones for which the Ricci tensor is a multiple of the metric. Okay, so this looks like the Einstein condition that we're used to in Riemannian geometry, but it's actually very far away from the Einstein condition for our various quantitative and qualitative properties. So for example, if you're Einstein, well, if you're pseudo-Einstein, you don't have constant scalar curvature. And you don't have constant scalar curvature. All right, this definition that I gave here is the same as the one that showed up in Kengo's talk. So, this definition here makes sense in all dimensions. Of course, when n is equal to 1, this holds trivially. This is not what you want to use as the definition of pseudo-Einstein. Instead, you want this condition here, and it just translates as a local formula to some equation involving the derivative of the scalar curvature when n equals 1. When n equals one. Okay, so the key point here that I'll write now is that if you have a pseudo-Einstein contact form, then there is a notion of the Q curvature for a contact form. This Q curvature can be, say, defined by using the Pfefferman circle bundle. The Q curvature is identically zero. So the Q curvature is not really that interesting. Is not really that interesting, especially for the pseudo-Einstein contact forms. What makes this somewhat worse in a way is this characterization of pseudo-Einstein contact forms. So let me first say that we'll call a function CR pluriharmonic if locally it's the real part of a CR function. So let me point out here that if your manifold is actually the boundary of a domain. A domain inside of Cn. I guess the Cn plus one because of the way I'm normalizing things. If you're actually a boundary of a domain here, then any CR, sorry, any holomorphic function, let's call this F holomorphic in omega, this restricts.
