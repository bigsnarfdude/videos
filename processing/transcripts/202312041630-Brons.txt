So, this is about so should I point this way? No. Ah, here we go. Yes, no. Yes. All right, here we go. No, we don't. Why does it jump back? Well, it's not quite in sync, but what you see here is what you probably know: the flow around a circular cylinder in a sort of moderate Reynolds number. And what happens here, flow comes in here, vorticity is created at the surface. Vorticity is created at the surface of the cylinder, negative at the top, positive at the bottom, and a shear layer is created. And this shear layer sort of transported downstream and organizes itself into very nice vortices. And so this is a von Kármán vortex street. And this wake is known also as a 2S wake, meaning that during one cycle, because this is a periodic flow, two single vortices are created. One for one. Are created, one positive and one negative. And yes, we knew that. And then one more. Here we go. If you oscillate the cylinder, you make it more exotic wakes, as they have been called. And here's an example of a P plus S wake. Here's the cylinder, it's oscillated. Here's the cylinder, it's oscillating up and down. And during one cycle, the flow is still periodic. You get one vortex of one side being created and two other down here. So there's a single and a pair created during each cycle. And now I wonder if I did it right. Oh, right. Okay. Should I point to the screen or to the computer? Which one is forward? It says this is for this is forward, right? Here we go. Yes. If you have other shapes of the oscillating body, for instance, here, so this is a flapping foil you have here, you can get not only exotic waves, you get very exotic waves with different combinations of vortices being created during a cycle. Here, for instance, a 2P vortex wake, where during each cycle you have two vortices shed. Vortices shed two times, and you can have all kinds of combinations of single and double vortices being shed through a cycle. The flow is still periodic here. So I'll look into this flow in the case of the cylinder, go back to that, not a foil. And this problem is described by: well, there's an incoming flow velocity, of course. incoming flow velocity of course there's a uh an an amplitude of the uh of the uh of the forced motion of the cylinder supposed to be harmonic and if you uh if you jump up to the uh to the coordinate system following the the cylinder there's sort of a wavelength associated with this uh uh with this stefan can't hear How are you doing, Stefan? It's better now? Okay, if I don't speak, you can't see, of course. So going to some dimensionless groups here, there's, of course, a Reynolds number, and we'll fix that to 100 in this talk here. This dimensional amplitude of the Amplitude of the forcing. And then you can either have a dimensionless frequency or a dimensionless wavelength. And we use the Struhal frequency of the problem. The Struhal frequency is the frequency of oscillations that will occur if you don't force the cylinder. And so we measure relative to that, or you could also use the Also, use the wavelength at dimensionless wavelengths. So I like to think about this as a two-parameter problem. You have the amplitude and the frequency of the forcing for fixed Reynolds number. And there's a very famous experimental investigation of this problem by Williamson and Roscoe, where they identify this parameter space, the dimensionless. Parameter space: the dimensionless amplitude of the oscillations and the dimensionless frequency or wavelength of the forcing, and you get different regimes with the 2S vortices down here, 2p, 2p wake and a p plus s, and some other more complicated stuff. And here's a typical experiment used to identify these vortex structures. Structures. If you do numerical simulations, you can get something that sort of looks like this experimental diagram, not quite, but nevertheless, there is certainly here a region with the 2S wakes, and up here there's a P plus S wake. So you should ignore this line. It's not irrelevant for what I'm going to say. And here's sort of a typical simulation. A sort of typical simulation on the basis of this one here. So this is a forced oscillator and it means that there are some resonance phenomena and there are sort of so-called Arnold tongues sitting at various rational points down here where inside those you have resonance and you have a periodic solution. Periodic solution. So inside this region here, the flow is periodic and with various configurations enumerated by these P plus S and S symbols and so on. So what I want to do is to say what's actually going on from a topological point of view as you go. uh as you go into um from the 2s to the p plus s region here uh i'll fix uh this uh this parameter to one so i'll go at the stuhal number i i have some comments about other frequencies a bit later but what's going on as you go from here up to here what's actually what is the process that's that's going on through this transition This transition. And we will do that on a numerical study. And here I have two different simulations. Little blurred, I'm afraid. So there's the green one is down here in the 2S region. And I think you can see that there's one blue and one orange vortex being shed through each period. Period. This is the vorticity field that I'm drawing. But up here in the red one, when you are above this line, here you will see a P plus S wake, where you have after a transition period, you will get this into a stable P plus S pattern. So that's fine. So let's go a little closer to this line here, to the blue one. And to see what's going on there, okay. Yeah. So so so that was that was the the the the the blue configuration. The blue configuration and oops, we are going a bit ahead here. That's fine. No, no, no, this is going too fast. Okay. Let's keep it here then. No, no, no. We need to go back a few. Yes, and one more, please. This was supposed to move. All right, let us keep it there. I was supposed to see some animation here. I don't think your computer can follow. So I would like to go one back, please. Can you go one back, please? Yes, that's fine. Let's keep it there. What you may or may not have. What you may or may not see that in this flow, there's actually a spatial temporal symmetry. That if you go half a period in time ahead, period one is assumed here, and you flip the coordinate system and change the sign of the vorticity, you are back to where you started. So there's this translation reflection symmetry in this problem here. In this problem here. And if I want to study how this wake sort of is transitioning, I of course need to have an idea of what a vortex is to do it in a more systematic way. And just to relate to the previous very interesting talk, my situation is much simpler. First of all, this is 2D. And secondly, it's not turbulent. So I Turbulence. So, I will go for a very fundamental definition of a vortex, namely a critical point of vorticity. So, of course, inside every vortex here, there's sort of a maximum of positive vorticity or a minimum of negative vorticity. And simply identifying these critical points as a vortex or feature point for vortex, that will be my way to go. Way to go. So, a critical point of autism is defined by these two equations. But these critical points come in two flavors. Either the Hessian matrix has a positive determinant, meaning it's a maximum or a minimum, or it's a saddle point where, yes, where you don't have either a minimum or a maximum. And I identify And identifying these points here is done here. And the black points are the vortices, and the red points are the sets. And what you were supposed to see, this was actually really a simulation, was that these points are created in here, they move downstream, and then you'll see a merging down here. So these points here, these critical points. So, these points here, these critical points of vorticity, they are not material points. They move relative to the fluid. Actually, there is an equation of motion for these points here. Maybe I can, while this sort of goes into some steady space, the velocity of a critical point of voices is equal to the velocity of the fluid. To the velocity of the fluid, but there is a correction which is proportional to viscosity, which is this Hessian matrix inverted times the gradient of the Laplacian of omega. This you can easily derive from the Navier-Stokes equation. So, when there's no viscosity, such a critical point follows the fluid, which is clear from the fact that. Which is clear from the fact that in a viscous flow, vorticity is frozen. So the critical point must be so as well. But if there is viscosity, then there is sort of correction, there's sort of a slip of these points, the critical points relative to the fluid flow. And if you're close to a bifurcation, that's the one we see here, where the two points merge. points merge, this becomes, ace becomes singular, meaning this becomes very large. So this part of the velocity is actually dominating. But if you are away from bifurcation, then you follow this equation of motion. So this bifurcation phenomenon that we're seeing here, where there is Where as a saddle and as an extremum, they merge. It's often called a cos bifurcation. And this is going this way here. You can also, and this happens very close to the cylinder, you can have vortices created in this sense, going from this way. So out of nothing, a critical point is created, which is degenerate, and then it splits into two. And then it splits into two: an extremum and a saddle, as time goes along. So as we can see here, due to these bifurcations, these topological bifurcations, the sort of the structure of the vorticity field changes downstream. So just characterizing a wake like this by a single This by a single symbol like 2s or P plus S is too simple. So I propose to extend this classification by sort of concatenating these sort of elementary symbols where you have an alphabet consisting of these elements here, with these letters here, and then you repeat them the number of times that they actually appear. Of times that they actually appear as you go downstream. So this wake here should be in this classification be classified as 2p cubed. So there's a there are three periods where you have two pairs. And then after the bifurcations, you have two single vortices for the rest of the time. Of the time, at least as long as you can see out in the future. So there are these intermediate patterns that connect the full 2S wake, which only consists on this, and the P plus S wake. So there's an intermediate thing like this. Interesting enough, there's a region of bi-stability. So this is So, this is the same parameter value, same amplitude value, and there are two different periodic solutions. There's one I showed you before, which is this one, but there's actually also another one which enters into a P plus S wake at some stage, where this sort of after the transience is just a 2S wake. And this has been elucidated by the top one fulfills the symmetry, but the bottom one doesn't. There's no way you can have a reflection translation symmetry down there. So this has been discussed in detail by Mataru. Detail by Mataru and Hazel and Heil. And it turns out that there is a subcritical symmetry breaking bifurcation from the symmetric branch. So if you sort of measure by this epsilon how a flow is not obeying the spatial symmetry, if the amplitude of the oscillation is low, this is zero, meaning that the symmetry is fulfilled, then at some value of the amplitude A2. Of the amplitude A2 here. There is bifurcation. The symmetric solution loses stability here, and an unstable solution which is periodic but breaks the symmetry appears here. This branch of periodic solution turns around in a fold bifurcation down here. So there is a, and these two bifurcations, the subcritical. The subcritical pitchfork bifurcation, where the asymmetric solution is born, and the cusp, the fold bifurcation A1, they are, as you see, extremely close. So, from a practical point of view, I think they can be considered identical, but it is actually possible to, by careful simulation, to distinguish between these points here. So, it's important to say that this bifurcation is of a different nature than the one I discussed before. One I discussed before, because this is a bifurcation sort of in function space, so there are periodic solutions, periodic vorticity fields are created in this bifurcation here, and the parameter is the amplitude. The bifurcation that I discussed before was in physical space, in the plane, and the parameter was time. So, there are different kinds of bifurcations in this. So, the first kind of time is the time. In this. So the first kind is related to the creation and destruction of structures, and this one is related to the creation and destruction of different modes of motion. So what's going on here? So I'm a bit pressed for time here, but let me show you what's actually going on if you vary the parameter, the amplitude from a low. The amplitude from a low value to a higher value. So let's start. The diagram, the bifurcation diagram we found is shown down here. This is the downstream distance and this is the amplitude. And what we're showing here is when certain events appear. So this parameter here, value A0. If you're below that, you have a pure 2S. You have a pure 2S wake. Then you have this topological bifurcation occurring at this value of the parameter. And if you go slightly above that, you will have a short region where you have this 2P thing, where you have an extra vortex being created in this cost bifurcation. In this cost bifurcation, which disappears again shortly after this. We're still down here, we're below this value A1, so we are still on the symmetric branch. And this sort of continues as you increase A and the number of 2P, the period of 2P becomes longer and longer. And this will then go on until you reach the parameter value A2. Parameter value A2. Then what happens is that you jump directly up here as you increase a a bit further to the other stable branch. So there's nothing stable close to this one here. You will jump to the other one up here. So that happens at A2. So between A0 and A2, you have patterns of this form here. If you go above A2, then you have broken the symmetry and then you are allowed to have. Then you are allowed to have P plus S part on the cycle. And since this is a discontinuous transition here, you jump immediately into two patterns of this type here as you go above A2. So there's a small region up here where you have these 2P that are sort of they survive here. This is a discontinuous transition. This is a discontinuous transition. This is why these limits are not connected. And then, if you increase the amplitude a bit more, this region becomes smaller and smaller. And finally, you only get a P plus S configuration. So I think I will go to the conclusions because this was the main part. If you go backwards rather than forwards, it's slightly different. Backwards rather than forwards, it's slightly different. But the idea is that the actual transition process going from 2S to P plus S is not just a single bifurcation, it's a series of bifurcations. So, and it takes place over quite a large interval of forcing amplitudes. So, the single line that's normally drawn. So the single line that's normally drawn in diagrams like this is sort of a very substantial simplification of what's going on. So to describe these stages, I think you need an extension of the classification of Williamson and Rosto to give a description of these intermediate stages where there is spatial variation of these patterns. And they are of this type. And they are of this type here. So, the top type, this one, respects the spatial temporal symmetry. When that is broken in the pitchfork bifurcation, you get patterns of this type, which do not respect the symmetry. And there are some important values of the parameter here where things are happening, where the topological bifurcations appear and disappear again, and there are the Appear again. And there are the two. So these are the A0 and the A3. And then the dynamical bifurcations where the pitchfork and the fold appear. And these are the four key parameter values in this problem. There is a mystery in this problem: is that in the numerical simulations, you don't see You don't see local patterns, you don't see 2p waves, but you do that experimentally. But all of this may be related to these 2p patterns actually existing as transients. So maybe there is some clue to why some experimental techniques give rise to these two p-wakes, even if they don't exist according to Lumer. Exist according to numerical simulations, but only for a limited time. So I should stop now, and I just have a reference for further study if you're interested. And thank you very much for your attention.
