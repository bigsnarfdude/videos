I'm normally enjoying the climate in band, but now at the moment, what I'm doing is getting up later than the morning talks and seeing what I can later in the day. And this is rather early for me. Okay, so today, what I would like to do is the main idea is I'd like to apply something known as topological recursion to the spectral curve of monopoles. I was brought up in monopoles and I've been doing some work in it even in recent times, but my mathematics has moved to moduli spaces of curves. Again, spectral curves arise in this world, integrable systems. And so I've long been curious about how the spectral curves from topological recursion, again, which I will define briefly later. Briefly later, could have something in common with spectral curves of monopoles. So, a spectral curve for topological recursion is a curve. So, this is a curve or a Riemann surface. Let me get that pen working. This is just a Riemann surface or a curve. These are two local. Are two locally defined meromorphic functions. Well, when they're locally defined, we can call them holomorphic, but often they're globally defined. And this is a bidifferential. So the classic example of a bidifferential is if sigma is rational, it's the Cauchy kernel. So, this is defined on sigma cross sigma, and it's this Cauchy kernel such that if I was to, it's a kernel, what I want to do is I want to integrate with it. So, for example, if I take f of z prime, b of z z prime, I take contour integral around z, this gives me the derivative of z. So this kernel. So, this kernel can be generalized to Riemann surface sigma. And so, a spectral curve of a monopole is just a, well, it's more than a curve that lives inside TP1. It's a curve that lives inside TP1 with extra conditions. And so, there would be two questions. One, can one produce from it the spectral curve for topological recursion? We need these two locally defined functions in this by differential. And two, can one calculate it? And three, Can one calculate it? And three, what could its meaning be? Okay, so that's the motivating question for me. And it ends up that today I'll mainly be speaking about this object here. And so I'm going to take a spectral curve inside, well, just a curve, in fact, inside TP1. I'm ignoring the extra structure. The extra structure is a trivial line bulb. Trivial line bundle being trivial on the curve. And I'm going to be interested in the deformation space of this curve. And so that's what most of the lecture will be about. And then I'll bring this back to the motivating question of topological recursion. So the deformation space of a curve will give rise to a prepotential, a holomorphic function on this deformation space. So inside this deformation space is the moduli space of monopoles. Space of monopoles. And so I'll begin with, just to warm up with spaces of curves, I'll begin with the famous family of the Cyber-Witten family of curves, which possesses a very special differential known as the Cyberg-Witten differential. And it's special in that it has this property that variations of this differential in the family. So I'm looking at a family of curves and now At a family of curves, and now when I vary the differential on at a particular curve, I will get holomorphic differentials on that curve. Each variation will correspond to a holomorphic differential. So I'll go through that example to set the scene. And then I will show that this arises more generally with essentially a cohomological cyberguid differential. So rather than a differential, I actually want its cohomology class, and then I'll find that often I can only And then I'll find that often I can only find the cohomology class, not the actual differential. And then, given this warm-up, I would like to describe a construction of Kenseavich and Solomon, which is a more recent construction of topological recursion, which will now naturally bring these together. And the aim is to apply this in the case of a curve inside TP1. But the main story is. Main story is what I've given here with the red arrow. So, given a monopole, this is a pair connection in Higgs field on R3, this is equivalent to a curve inside TP1 plus conditions. As I said, there's a line bundle that needs to be trivial on this curve, and we can have further conditions for a smooth monopole. So, I'm interested in the deformation space of this curve inside TP1. This curve inside TP1. So, in general, well, not in general, but always, this deformation space is bigger than the moduli space. So, here is its dimension. So, if we take a curve in this class, O2K, O2K is the pullback of the OP12k to the tangent bundle of P1, then the dimension of its deformation space is k times k plus 2, where we can Where we can identify this with the k times k plus 2 with the genus of the curve plus 4k minus 1. So this is now looking like the dimension of the moduli space of curves. What we need further is G genus G conditions on sigma. Erkolani Sinner came up with some. There was also Connor and Romain. And Romeo, Connor, Manton, and Romeo gave a version of this. And so, given these conditions, I'm left with 4k minus 1 dimensions, which is the dimension of the moduli space of monopoles. We also have a real condition on our spectral curves, and so I would need to also use the real condition, and the moduli space sits inside this deformation space. But it's this deformation space I'll be considering. So, in the end, I won't. So, in the end, I won't be drawing a conclusion on monopoles. What I'm really trying to do is coming from the perspective of topological recursion: is there a link? Can I apply it? And so I will show, I'll be essentially just defining the, first of all, this pre-potential topological recursion. And I will be just making statements about what this could have to do with monopoles. I won't draw conclusions on monopoles. I'll go. Okay, so the aim. Okay, so the aim here is to define coordinates on this deformation space, this k plus k plus two-dimensional deformation space. And yep. This sentence where you mentioned that there's conditions on sigma leaving the moduli space in there. I'm not sure I understand what you mean there. You mean that on the curve, we've got a bigger. We've got a bigger family of curves. So suppose k is equal to 2. We have a complex eight-dimensional family. You're saying that there are conditions that push sigma out of the moduli? So these conditions, so given an algebraic curve, one can put conditions on these curves. One can find G conditions defined by a Defined by Erpelani Sinna. So algebraically, this curve needs to satisfy these conditions. So it's inside this deformation space B. Our curve would need to satisfy these conditions to live inside a 4K minus one-dimensional space inside that. And then further, one needs to look at the real points inside that. Thank you. So, my aim will be to define coordinates on this deformation space, Zi, dual coordinates, and together these will define a pre-potential via this property that df dzi is equal to wi. So just see, what does this do? Yes, via this property here. Okay, so let me show. Okay, so let me show this in the example of the Cyber-Witten family. This is rather famous. Okay, so the Cyber-Witten family of curves is a G-dimensional family. The parameters here are the coefficients U1 through UG of genus G curves. So this is Genus G. This is a hyperelliptic curve here. Perhaps it's just to make this clear, it might be useful to Useful to also express it in this way. If I express it, y is equal to w minus 1 on w, then this, and say this is equal to p of z, this right-hand side is p of z, then this curve here can also be expressed as y squared is equal to p of z squared minus 4. So the hyper elliptic structure in the structure in the highlighted yellow is W goes to one on W. The branch points, when the fixed points are this, that's W equals plus or minus one, and hence the left-hand side is plus or minus two, and each of these has G plus one solutions. So it's two G plus two branch points, hence its Shinus G. And again, one could look at the hyper elliptic structure in the more standard way as y goes to negative y. And so we have this g-dimensional family of So, we have this G-dimensional family of Genesis G curves. This coincidence we'll see is much more general, and there's a reason for it. And the cyber-Witten differential is a meromorphic differential on each of these curves, Z dw on W. And it has this very special property. So, the variation of this differential will give us holomorphic differentials. So, let me explain what I mean by the variation of this. mean by the variation of this. So I want to put w is equal to a constant. So I'll explain what this means. So I've got this family of curves. It's true the family that I'm going to be looking at will be living inside TP1, but I can still write it this way. In this case, this family lives inside C2, so it's pretty much the same. It's a family of curves inside a surface. And here's my universal space. Uh, universal space. So this space here has dimension g plus one, and its fibers consist of these curves, and this base space is B, the deformation space. And so then now, if I take a vector inside the tangent space here, d du I, I want to lift it to Lift it to a vector in the total space, which I'm going to abuse and also called DDUI. So, how do I do that? This is a connection, so I need to define a connection. And so one way I can do this is simply via coordinates. So, I have these coordinates on the base space, u1 through ug. And now I'm going to choose a coordinate on the fiber. So, I'm going to choose w. So, given coordinates, these g plus 1 coordinates. These g plus one coordinates of this universal curve, I get g plus one differentials and hence g plus one dual vector fields. And in particular, these vector fields annihilate the coordinate w. So I could have chosen any coordinate. I could have chosen z, for example, but this is the choice to choose w. So this is what we mean by this variation here. And now let's calculate this. Well, this is now equal to du of. du I as oops dz dui times this constant term and I've written I've introduced this notion of P of Z is this polynomial so what I have let me differentiate this first equation w plus 1 on W is equal to P of Z well the W term just vanishes Well, the W term just vanishes. It's constant with respect to this derivative. Really, it's a covariant derivative. Like I said, we're really looking at a connection on this bundle here. So we've got zero is equal to p prime of z dz d u i plus z to the g minus i. And so from this, you can see that I will get dz dui. I can solve for this, and this is negative z. And this is negative z to the g minus i on p prime of z. Put this into this expression, and I get this times dw and w. And the expression I've written here is, well, of course, there's a relation between dz and dw on this curve, and I've just written in terms of this relation. And the reason for that is if we substitute one, w minus one on w for y, you can see this is the standard. This is the standard expression for holomorphic differentials on the hyperelliptic curve. One other important feature of Z D W on W is, well, I'll point out that feature in one moment. So what we're going to do with this special differential is find coordinates on the moduli space. So we've got coordinates, u1 through ug, but we're going to come up with, in a sense, better coordinates. So let's So let's choose A and B cycles in the first homology of our curve. And we define the coordinate Z I to be the Ai period of this special, this Cyber-Witten differential. So this gives G local coordinates on B. And what was important here, well, let me look at the dual coordinates and then speak about this other property. The dual coordinates, Wi, will be the B periods, and these are functions. And these are functions of the Z's. And so, an important property of this Soviet-Witten differential is that it has no residues. It's zero residues. Otherwise, this is ill-defined. This period, an A period, will change depending how this encircles the poles. So, this is NDW on W has two poles and they have zero residues. So, this is well defined. Okay, so what we have here is we have is we have this two, well, a first set of coordinates and second is a collection of functions. And the theorem is that this two-form on B, dz i, wedge dwi, vanishes, or equivalently, this is probably easier to read, dw i dzj is equal to dwj dzi, and the proof of that is the fact that this derivative gives the period matrix for the curve sigma. For the curve sigma. So if I differentiate d dzj under the integral here, this is where I'm going to use my special feature of the Sabbath-Witten differential. The derivative of the Saber-Witten differential will give me a holomorphic differential, and this holomorphic differential, its B period, is exactly this tau ij. And the symmetry of tau ij is giving us this symmetry we need. This symmetry is a necessary and sufficient condition for a Necessary and sufficient condition for an existence of a prepotential. So that's this function, holomorphic function on the deformation space defined via this, that the functions wi are given by the partial derivatives of the prepotential with respect to zi. Okay, this function f is used in four-dimensional gauge theory, and so it has importance. And so what I'm going to do. And so, what I'm going to do now is show that this arises much more generally. And this is a special case of more general setup. So, look, I'm going to be interested in TP1. TP1, I'll use a Poisson structure. So I'm looking at an intermediate setup at the moment, and that is if we start with a symplectic surface, so a curve inside a symplectic surface. So again, a spectral curve inside TP1 will be just one step away. Okay, so given a curve sigma inside a symplectic surface X, we have this exact sequence. I think I'm already on that pen. Zero goes to the tangent bundle of sigma, to the restriction of the tangent bundle of x on sigma to the canonical. So this is a much more general feature of sigma. Much more general feature of symplectic vector spaces. So if I have a Lagrangian subspace of a symplectic vector space, so this guy say is symplectic. So T sigma is a Lagrangian subspace of this Tx sub sigma is a symplectic vector space, a two-dimensional symplectic vector space, and T sigma is a subspace of that at each point of sigma. Space of that at each point of sigma. And this map here simply sends a vector to omega w, say, of this vector to a linear function. So this linear function acts on all of w, but I'm restricting it to L. So this now gives me an element that acts on L. So lives in the dual of L. And the kernel, of course, since L is Lagrangian, the kernel. Is Lagrangian, the kernel is L. Again, this is a general fact, it's not requiring w to be two-dimensional. So the kernel of this, given that it's Lagrangian, is L. And furthermore, this map is surjective. This again uses the fact that this is a Lagrangian and the symplectic form is non-degenerate. And so that's what we have here. We have the dual of this tangent space is the cotangent, which gives us the canonical. And so what we As the canonical. And so, what we see here is that the normal bundle of sigma inside x is isomorphic to the canonical bundle. So, the normal bundle is the quotient of the tx by t sigma. So, it also sits in this location here. So, we have this isomorphism. And now, given this deformation space of sigma, the tangent space of sigma is isomorphic to the space of global holomorphic sector. Of global holomorphic sections of the normal bundle. So, what we see here is we see that the tangent space of sigma is isomorphic to the space of holomorphic differentials, and that's this isomorphism. So in the previous example, this is what we also found. We found that each of our vectors, we've got u1 through ug coordinates, ddui give us vectors in B. I give us vectors in B. Each of these vectors corresponds to a holomorphic differential. In fact, you can hopefully see this is an isomorphism. This is a basis of holomorphic differentials, because this is the standard basis for hyperolliptic. And so, and the way we associate in this previous example is we differentiate this Sybic-Witten differential. At the moment, we have associated this tangent space just via the symplectic, the The symplectic, the ambient symplectic space X. Okay, so the holomorphic differentials naturally have cohomology classes. So we'll embed these inside the first cohomology of sigma, where C is the constant sheet. This is isomorphic to C to the 2G and defines a flat bundle over the deformation space. So B consists of curves inside X, and to each curve you associate And to each curve, you associate its first cohomology, which gives us this rank 2g bundle. So, this isomorphism from the tangent space to the space of holomorphic differentials living inside this cohomology vector space means that phi defines a one form on B with values in this bundle H. So phi takes in vectors. So phi takes in vectors on B and spits out elements of the first cohomology, which is this bundle here. And so this next calculation is going to show that phi is flat. I'll give the calculation and then mention the Gauss-Mannon connection. But what we have here is, okay, so I'm interested in, well, let me. Well, let me just do the calculation. So let me draw this picture here. So I've got this B here. This is B. And I'm interested in showing that phi is locally closed. I'm not mentioning the connection much, so just think of this as exterior derivatives. So I'm just going to take a small loop. So gamma will be a very small loop in B. Be a very small loop in B, contractible, whereas alpha is any old loop, but it's more likely to be non-trivial homology class. So we've got this probably quite long loop alpha and this small loop gamma. And I'm interested in integrating phi, this one form, and I'm interested in integrating it around any small loop gamma. So that's what I've got here. I've integrated phi around gamma. This now will leave me with an element of the cohomology of the fiber, and I want to. Of the fiber, and I want to pair this with a homology class, alpha. And so it ends up that this is the same as what we have: we have this small loop in gamma. We have my homology class alpha. My homology class is defined up to isotope. I've defined it precisely here, but I'm going to now in nearby fibers, as I move around gamma, I'm going to move it. Move it necessarily so that I come back to itself. And so, what I find is I get a long, thin torus inside X. Again, it's the map from gamma, lift to this alpha, get a collection of these alphas. And so, given that sigma lives inside x, this gives me a torus in x. And then it ends up that this pairing is given by just integrating the symplectic form over t2. But since t2 is this long. But since T2 is this long, thin torus, it's homologically trivial. The symplectic formula X is closed, hence, this is zero. And so that's just a calculation. But what this calculation tells us is that this is locally exact. And so, in particular, it's closed under this Gauss-Mannon connection. So, what I have omitted to say. Omitted to say, but maybe it's clear to some of you, is that this map from the tangent space to the space of holomorphic differentials, I've realized it in another way here. I've taken a vector downstairs, and a vector downstairs corresponds to a section of the normal bundle. And I've now paired this with the symplectic. In symplectic form, this is a holomorphic differential. And so this is a more direct geometric way to realize this isomorphism. And I've used that here to show that the pairing of this one form with this homology class is indeed given by. Homology class is indeed given by using the symplectic form. So, what we have here is we have that phi is locally exact. In fact, that's what I proved up here, that if any small, the integral around any small loop is zero, then phi is locally exact. For some cohomology class theta, so theta I've written here as a section. So, this is simply saying to every curve in X, that's a point in B. That's a point in B, we'll get a cohomology class. So that's what this theta is doing for us. So let me summarize here. So there was a bit of technical stuff going on there, but the main idea is this. Given a vector inside the tangent space B, so that is at a particular sigma inside X, we have this cohomology class theta on sigma, such that the On sigma, such that the variation of this cohomology class gives us a holomorphic differential. And the cohomology class extends to nearby curves sigma in the family. So this derivative makes sense. And this is really the covariant derivative. Maybe I could write it that way. It's the covariant derivative with respect to the Gauss-Mannon connection on this cohomology class. Okay, so now this is resembling the previous example. Resembling the previous example where we produce this isomorphism via differentiating the Cyber-Witten differential, but instead of the Cyber-Witten differential, we have a cohomology class, and we have that because we can't get hold of, in general, we can't get hold of a family of differentials. And so in the Cyber-GWITN family, we can realize this as a family inside a symplectic surface. It's already inside C2. It's already inside C2 with a particular symplectic form, but we can realize this inside a symplectic surface where the symplectic form is not neuromorphic. And then the cyber-Witten differential, its cohomology class is this cohomology class defined. So this is, besides the technical information that I've described, this is the main message here that analogous and in fact more That analogous and in fact more general than the Cyber-Witten family of curves, given a symplectic surface inside X, just because of the way it sits inside this ambient space, its tangent space is isomorphic to its space of holomorphic differentials. And we can realize this isomorphism via the variation of a special cohomology class on each of these curves. And this is taking the place of the Cyber-Witten differential. Of the cyber-Witten differential. So that's the message. Okay, so now we can proceed as we did before. Let's choose A and B cycles on sigma. So this shows that we only get local coordinates because this choice, it's a topological choice, but it's still a choice. And we define these coordinates Zi where i equals 1 to g. So this moduli space B, of course, has dimension G because again, it's isomorphic to it. Again, it's isomorphic to its space of holomorphic differentials. So we get these coordinates zi, and then we get these functions of the coordinates, the wi, given by the b periods. And again, the result is that for the same reason, that dzi wedge dwi, this two-form on b, is zero. And the same reason being that the period matrix arises again to show the symmetry dwi, dzj is dwj. I dzj is dwj dzi. And so this now produces rather generally, given a curve inside a symplectic surface, the deformation space of this curve is of dimension G, and there is now this holomorphic map on this deformation space known as the prepotential defined via this property, which is implied by this property. This property. Okay, this pre-potential is important in other situations. So for the Soviet-Wind differential, it was important for four-dimensional gauge theory. In this case, it's been used, for example, to produce metrics on this deformation space, which could be interesting for monopoly. Okay, so let me now move to Poisson surfaces. So basically, it's the same story, just a little bit more technical. So I'll try. Bit more technical, so I'll try to move away from some of those details. So, given a curve inside this Poisson surface, Xd, so D is the divisor of vanishing of the Poisson bivector, or we can think of X has a meromorphic symplectic form. So X minus D is symplectic, and it has a Meromorphic symplectic form with poles at D. Okay. Okay, and so now we have before we had that the normal bundle of the curve is isomorphic to the canonical. Now the normal bundle is isomorphic to the canonical twisted by d sigma, where d sigma is the intersection of this d with sigma, with each sigma. And again, we take the deformation space of sigma, its tangent space as usual, it's isomorphic to the space of holomorphic sections of the normal. Space of holomorphic sections of the normal bundle, which gives us an isomorphism. The tangent space, not now with the holomorphic differentials, but with the Meromorphic differentials with precisely this pole structure. So it's a bigger space now. This dimension is g plus degree of g minus one. This is assuming, of course, the degree is not zero. zero as usual when the degree is zero this doesn't restrict to g minus one it gives us the previous formula of g this from rim and rock okay so let's look at examples just to make this rather concrete so if the pair x t for example is p2 with the its divisor is three times the hyperplane section then when sigma is just a line then the this formula gives us This formula gives us that the genus is zero, the degree is three, that is, the intersection of three h with sigma is three, so it's zero plus three minus one is two. And indeed, we know that the deformation space of lines in P2 is P2 dual, so this gives us this two-dimensional space. And in the example that may interest us from using monopoles, if the pair is TP1 and Is TP1 and 4 times the fiber? This again is the, there exists a neuromorphic 2-form on TP1 with poles exactly along four fibers. And if sigma lives in O2K, then the dimension is given by, well, there's the genus, and now each fiber of, sorry, each of these. Sorry, each of these, we've got four times the fiber. Each fiber intersects a spectral curve, or sorry, a curve in this class in k points. And so we've got four k of these. And so this is this deformation space that I discussed before. G plus four came on as well. Paul? I'm trying to understand your first example there, and perhaps it's useful for me to understand the type of deformation we. And the type of deformation we allow here. So you're saying we would deform lines, but not through all possible lines, just such that there's something here where d sigma is interfering here in the normal bundles. Yeah, so look, this is an interesting point. So mostly I'm discussing just these local deformations. So I just take a curve and the way that it intersects D is transversally. Transversally, and then I just look at the local deformation space. So, in this case, I have a line inside P2. Maybe my 3H is three lines, but let's just call it an elliptic curve. I have an elliptic curve. It intersects transversally in these. Well, sorry, it does not need to intersect transversally, but I'd like it to intersect in this case for an elliptic curve. Case for elliptic curve, anything will work. I'd just like it to intersect in a collection of points. But what I'm going to be doing is just looking at nearby lines. So it's just instead of the entire P2 joule, I'm just going to be looking at a little open subset in that because I'm actually interested in a pre-potential locally defined. But the interesting point you've brought up is that the global behavior of the Behavior of these moduli spaces is definitely interesting. And each argument can be the prepotential can be extended. Each of these objects can be extended right up until something goes wrong with some. There's going to be further structure I'll introduce soon, of foliation, and I will need some generic setup. And one can still analyze it when it's not generic. So anyway, the answer to your question is mainly I'm just looking at this. Looking at this curve sigma and then just a very small neighborhood of the deformation space B. But could I change that D to something else than 3H and then I would get a different sort of deformations? So the space of deformations is the same. And what the choice, when you say change 3H, it's going to be the choice of Poisson structure. Structure. So when I change the Poisson structure, this further structure that I'm about to describe will then change. But of course, the deformation space is just the deformation space. It doesn't know about the choice of Poisson structure. But we're going to put structure on this deformation space and it will know about it. Was that clear? I think so. So the intersection sigma, the degree of that Of that, it would be independent of D, if I choose the different Poisson structure and I had, let's say, 4H, that would not change the dimension of B. So, this 3H is forced upon us. We need the existence of this object. So, what is this object? Instead, we can think of it as a bivector. Think of it as a bivector, or let's just think of it as the dual object. It's a section of the canonical bundle, and the section of the canonical bundle now has a divisor, and so this divisor is forced upon us. So this 3H and this 4F were chosen, well, not chosen, they were given to us. Okay, that's the piece I was missing. Thank you. Okay, so what we did before is we used the fact that this curve. Is we use the fact that this curve lives inside this ambient space, and I gave a rather general reason for why the tangent space is isomorphic to the space of holomorphic differentials. And in this case, the tangent space is isomorphic to the space of these meromorphic differentials with poles at this divisor. But I also said there's this local. But I also said there's this local, it's more intuitive, geometric argument where you take a normal section, section of the normal bundle, and you pair it with the symplectic form, and this pairing is well defined. Even though a section of the normal bundle is an equivalence class, the pairing with the symplectic form is well defined. And so the same argument works here, in fact. A curve inside this Poisson surface doesn't really know it's Poisson. It thinks it's mainly, it thinks it's symplectic. It's mainly it thinks it's symplectic, right? Of course, something occurs at d sigma, but it mainly thinks it's symplectic. So, again, this symplectic curve sitting inside this ambient space basically has behaves the same as in the symplectic case. So, we see this here. So, here we have the generalization of H1. So, maybe I will write that here: that this, when D is empty, this This is simply H1 of sigma C. This is just a Hodge decomposition. And so this is the generalization. Now, instead of H1 of sigma C, we take these holomorphic meromorphic differentials, meromorphic along D, plus H1 of these local functions vanishing at D. And this arrow here is simply the isomorphism onto the first factor, as we had before. The first factor, as we had before. So the tangent space maps isomorphically to these meromorphic differentials. And this space here now, this vector space defines a bundle over our deformation space. Again, if this is looking a little bit technical, think of the example that we just went through where the fibers are simply the cohomology of the curve, but this is now a generalization. This is. Generalization. This is again a symplectic vector space. It's symplectic, but this was chosen to, it's the Sare dual of the H0. So Sare duality gives us the pairing, and hence this is a symplectic bundle. It's then, of course, it's double this dimension, g plus degree sigma minus one. And so Kensevich and Solwoman, maybe I should write this, I learned this from them. I learned this from them, so I can save it. Sobelman defined a connection on this bundle which requires more structure. The Gauss Mannon connection required no structure. And in this case, now we require some local coordinates on sigma around d sigma. These local coordinates. These local coordinates, eventually, we're going to be interested in these local coordinates in the family. But for the moment, I'm not going into that technical detail. Let's just say that there is this is a flat bundle and there is a flat connection, which on the homology, the usual cohomology part of this is the usual Gauss Mannon, but there is more at the poles here. And again, it satisfies that. Satisfies that nablifies zero. Again, this shouldn't be surprising because essentially this curve sitting inside this Poisson surface really thinks mostly it thinks it's sitting inside this symplectic surface. So it's the same local argument that was given for the fact that this is flat, this phi. And so therefore, phi is exact. And so we And so we can define this. Well, before it was associating to every curve in the family, it associated a cohomology class, but now it associates this generalization of a cohomology class, an element inside this vector space here. And so the summary to all of this is: given a vector inside the tangent space of the deformation space, there exists this class. There exists this class inside this generalization of cohomology such that its variation gives Meromorphic differential meromorphic along D. Look, an example is if D has, if each point in D is of a multiplicity one, then this is the log canonical bundle, and this represents, it's a natural generalization. It's a natural generalization of holomorphic. Sorry, this here would then be the log canonical bundle if all the points in D have multiplicity one. And this is a natural generalization of holomorphic differentials, just sections of this log canonical bundle. Okay, so sorry, you're devising this example was four fibers of TP1? This is general what I'm talking about, but for example. What I'm talking about, but for example, the divisor can be four fibers intersecting. So, this D sub sigma is now its intersection on the spectral curve. And so, a very natural example would be two fibers with multiplicity two. And so, this would correspond to, well, anyway, let me stick with four fibers for the moment. This corresponds to 4k points on the curve. K points on the curve, this d sigma. But I'm working quite generally at the moment. So, is there something special about deformation of the curve near the intersection with those chosen devices, with chosen fibers? Well, I'd hope so because this I haven't analyzed. So, it ends up that what your question is is Is addressing is the fact that I have my usual deformations, but this is my genus, this is actually the G part in this deformation space. So you've pointed out that this part here is what we understand, the deformations due to holomorphic differentials. But we want to fix some conditions, so we're not looking at g of these deformations. We're not looking at G of these deformations, and it's precisely these deformations we would like to know about. So, I haven't answered your question, I've just re-asked your question and said that indeed it is interesting. And it is understood. One can write down this space in different ways. This space here comes from the hypocohomology of some sequence, and so one can see these deformations rather explicitly, but I haven't analyzed these, but it definitely is pertinent to the issue. It's pertinent to the issue. Okay, so what was achieved before is we used this, we worked hard, well not too hard, but we worked to get this generalization of this cohomology class along every curve in the family. And so we used this to define coordinates. And so what we did. And so, what we did before is we took homology classes and took periods. And so, here we need to do something a little bit different. Again, this comes from Kensevich Solomon. This type of idea is in work of de Brovin, but it was not said the same way as Kensevich Solomon wrote it. So, here's my, this is a nearby copy. So, here's my curve. Let's say this is d sigma in. Say these points, and then just take a copy of d sigma, and this is d sigma prime, and just a nearby copy. And so what we've got here is we've got this, oh, sorry, and I'm only describing the case when each point in d sigma has multiplicity one. That it's the answer has been given more generally, it's just simpler to describe. And so now one takes this homology of sigma. Homology of sigma minus d sigma relative to d sigma prime. And the only thing I'll point out is it at least has the right dimension. Okay, so we have our usual G, say, A, or 2G A and B periods. And then now the homology of this removing D sigma introduces G minus one contours around G minus one contours. G minus one contours. That doesn't look very green, does it? So that's an extra G minus one. And then the relative to the D sigma prime introduces G minus one of these paths. And so we can see that we get this homology here. It now has, instead of we had a 2G dimensional or a module of rank 2G, we now have two time. have two times g plus degree g minus one. So we take the periods of, well, a periods, we choose the a periods plus, for example, these circle, these closed contours around these points to define the coordinates z i. And then the dual guys are the B periods and then these lines between the d sigma prime, the paths, and these give us Give us functions of these coordinates, and this gives us this gives us again we get this result that dw i dzj is equal to dwj dzi and we get this prepotential on this family. So the summary is that given a curve inside this Poisson surface. This Poisson surface, such as a spectral curve inside TP1, with we can choose various Poisson structures. It's most likely that the different choices of Poisson structures will give us related structures, but I haven't analyzed the structures, so I don't know that. And this, the deformation space of a curve comes naturally with. comes naturally with a prepotential, F. And of course, the idea would be to restrict this F to the moduli space of monopoles, although that hasn't been done. Okay, so the next idea would be to calculate F, but before I do this, I need to now mention this topological recursion that I've mentioned in the introduction. Okay, so. In the introduction. Okay, so Anar Aranton, out of matrix models, produced this algorithm which takes as input a Riemann surface, two Meromorphic functions on this surface, or where you can allow them to be locally defined, with this technical condition that dx has simple zeros and a bi-differential on this curve. So the bi-differential locally, it lives on sigma cross c cross c in this case, and it locally looks like. Looks like this with respect to local coordinates plus some holomorphic terms. And the output is a sequence of tensor product of differentials on, well, C to the N. So, for example, when n equals one, these are just differentials. So, it's a collection of differentials, one for each G. And then we also have, like I said, tensor products of these. And it's defined recursively. Now, don't expect us to Don't expect us to take this in. What I simply want to say is there exists this thing known as topological recursion. And so the reason I've written down this kernel, this actually should have its parameters k of z, 0, z, is equal to something which takes as input the two functions y and x. So that's really all I want to see here. And we use the bi-differential as input for the first of As input for the first of these omega g n's. And then we have this recursive formula here, which uses the smaller omega, the simpler omega g n's to calculate, oops, that's crossing out, to calculate omega g n plus 1. And the picture viewpoint is that we're taking this omega g n plus 1 and different ways to cut off a pair of pants. Cut off a pair of pants. That's what this picture here does. All of these need to be taken into account. So again, I'm going to move off this page. I don't expect us to take all of this information. The point here is that this curve plus these two locally defined functions and this bi-differential were enough to recursively produce a whole collection of. Of differentials on this curve. And so examples, these differentials are used to get, for example, local expansions of these differentials will be generating functions for interesting quantities such as intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves, Vay-Peterson volumes of the moduli space of curves, and more recently, super-Vay-Peterson volumes. Recently, supervised Peterson volumes of the super moduli space, Hurwitz numbers, many different types of Hurwitz numbers, or before fold simple Hurwitz numbers. They're used to enumerate discrete surfaces. This is really where they came from. This is a matrix model, comes from matrix models, expansions, R spin numbers, Gromov Witten invariants of various varieties such as P1 and local Colabi Yau. Local Colabi-Yau from a Witten invariance. And a theorem that really lets us know what topological recursion is due to Dunamakovsky, Arendt, and Chagrin Spitz, is that for any semi-simple columnological field theory, there exists a spectral curve such that topological recursion applied to that curve produces this semi-simple cohomological field theory. So, really, what it does is it encodes intersection number. Intersection numbers. So I'm not defining a semi-symbol cohomological field theory, but Gromo-Witt invariance is an example of this. And it encodes intersection numbers on the moduli space of curves using this. So the point of this page here is simply to say topology recursion has many applications. And that's the point. But really, what we're going to use is the fact that there exists something. The fact that there exists some things that are like differentials on a curve. So now I want to get back to the talk where I was, and I'm interested in the local expansion of this prepotential. So now I'm going to replace these coordinates via shifted coordinates. So zi0 will be these coordinates on a particular curve in the family, and zi will be the coordinates nearby. So that these coordinates, these new coordinates, zi, they vanish on a curve. And in fact, there's a little point back. A little point back here that requires this. Let me just go to the, instead of the more complicated, let me just go to the symplectic case. When I defined this theta here, this actually is, of course, not well defined. It's only well defined up to addition of the constant class, and that's a constant cohomology class. And so then when I talk about these coordinates here, About these coordinates here, they're only defined up to a constant, in fact. And so, what is well defined is this difference. So, this Zi and super zero and Zi are only defined up to a constant, but their difference is well defined. And so this is actually natural to consider the prepotential this way. And indeed, this is the prepotential, this arises in many in the world, for example, of Gromo-Witty invariants and. Witten invariance, and we're always expanding around zero. Okay, so now we need some extra structure. This is an idea due to conservative solgerman, is we choose a foliation on the Poisson surface. This foliation should be tangent to the divisor. And so, in the case of TP1, the foliation naturally exists. It's the fibers are given by the map TP1 to T1. Given by the map TP1 to P1. Okay, so foliation again is just a sub-line bundle of the tangent bundle. And so now this we define collection, this defines R. So we define a divisor on in sigma by the points where F is tangent to sigma. We have a technical requirement that it's tangent, the tangent points are simple. So now we're looking at this definition. Simple. So now we're looking at this deformation space, a particular sigma inside this space, and then all nearby deformations. This is this point that I alluded to before, that we're looking at really at an open set around this sigma in its space of deformations. And using this set R, we define the vector space of meromorphic differentials on sigma, which have poles at R and zero residue. And zero residues there and zero A periods. And so, what topological recursion produces is these differentials. Again, think of maybe n equals one. So I can say differentials, they're really tensor products of differentials on the Cartesian product of sigma with itself, but differentials omega k inside V sigma, or more generally, tensor products of sigma. And so it ends up that topological recursion requires us to use. Requires us to use this spectral curve, which has two locally defined functions and a bidifferential. And that was one of the original questions I asked in the introduction. And this is what I'm just answering now. So what one takes as input, this curve inside this Poisson surface, this foliated Poisson surface. So this omega x is a meromorphic two-form. We choose. We choose, take a choice of A and B cycles on sigma. And so then now, using this choice of A and B cycles, this gives a natural bi-differential. B is a bi-differential. I won't describe that. It's known as the Bergman kernel, but we're trying to get this information of something that can be used as input for topological recursion. And then our recursion and then our local functions will be defined to be we'll choose darbu coordinates for x and further we would like x to define the foliation the x equals constant gives us the leaves of the foliation and so it ends up that this is not well defined but it's good enough for us so xy can change to any function of x it still defines the same foliation And then y divided by f primed of x shows it's still daboo, and we can even add a further function of x. So these local coordinates are not well defined, but it ends up that the way they were used in topological recursion in that kernel, it's independent under this change. Well, it's invariant under this change. And so what we find is just the way the curve lives inside this ambient, it's essentially symplectic, but it's Poisson, the way it lives. But it's Poisson, the way it lives inside this allows one to apply topological recursion to it. And so again, we get this omega kns defined recursively. And so in the case when x is symplectic, a theorem that I proved jointly with Kaimerawong, Swaddle, and Tabacol is local expansion for this pre-potential. So the statement is that. So the statement is that we're producing all these omega kns. We're going to take the genus zero sequence, omega zero, two, omega zero three, omega zero four, et cetera. And we take, these were designed, these differentials or tensor products of differentials, they're designed to be integrated along periods to give us numbers. So that's precisely what we do here. And this gives us the expansion of this prepotential. Pre-potential using these using topological recursion. So, this is the theorem in the lecture. Mainly, I'm interested in showing how one can apply topological recursion to spectral curves, but it's worth putting in a theorem. Okay, so let me just say something about this theorem: that what we're not simply doing is calculating recursively the coefficients. So, if we could calculate the coefficients in this expansion recursively, it's essentially a Recursively, it's essentially a differential equation that this satisfies. But we can't do that. What we do is we're calculating these guys recursively, and then we lose information when we take these B periods. These are normalized B periods. When we take these B periods, we lose information. So that's rather interesting. And what's important about this result is that the expansion uses a single curve. So this expansion needs to Expansion needs to know about the family of curves. That's what it is. It's the prepotential, which I needed a family to define the prepotential, and then it's the expansion in a neighborhood. But what this result gives us is given a single curve in the family, we can now on that curve apply a recursive procedure on a single curve, and that will tell us about. And that will tell us about this prepotential in a neighborhood, which allows us, for example, to take a spectral curve of a monopole. So I haven't been dealing with these G conditions. I haven't been dealing with the real structure, but now I can take precisely the spectral curve of a monopole. I can form this calculation. Of course, this result we've only proven for X symplecti, but we believe it to be true for X Poisson. And so I will skip through. And so I will skip. Well, let me see. The only thing I'll give about comments on the theorem is this generalizes the theorem of Gregler and Wayne for in the Hitchin case when X is symplectic and is the cotangent bundle for a curve. What I'll do is I'll just finish with the conclusion that what I've shown is that topological recursion can be applied to a spectral curve. It makes sense to apply to it. And what does it produce? It and what does it produce? It produces this pre-potential. Well, this at the point, this needs a generalization of our theorem, but we believe it to be true. We can write down a formula and the proof seems to go through. It produces this pre-potential on the moduli space. I put the input inside this was all the genus zero information, omega zero, two, etc. I can put in the genus G information and this. G information and this produces fg for each g greater than or equal to zero. In fact, so we can define a sequence of these functions. This sequence was used by Kensevich and Solomon to define deformation quantization of this of the deformation space. And so, anyway, the other final comments are just these. Final comments are just these: that this, of course, applies to the whole story to the hyperbolic monopole case. And the use of such an F, I haven't got a use of such an F in the monopoles case. I'm just presenting this connection actually, but it was used by Bragli and Huang to study the special Kalometric on the deformation space B due to hitching. I'll finish there. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Paul. Any questions? Please just turn on your volume and ask. Maybe I have a question, Paul. So I imagine you will apply to monopoles directly. Directly, I'm not sure. I mean, this was prepared for this, inspired by this conference. I mean, now that you spoke about it, how can you stop? Well, I mean, I've got to say that to generalize our theorem, it seems that it's so straightforward to generalize that we will need applications. The generalization itself won't be good enough. And the reason one would like to generalize it is that it's easier to work with the Poisson. Is that it's easier to work with the Poisson case? For example, one can look at lines in P2. It's already a very interesting example. So, absolutely, we'll need applications in order to justify the generalization. And so, this monopulse could be it, could be the example. But, like I said, so far, this hasn't been done. And we'll see. You mentioned Barakia Huang used FK. Can you add? Used FK, can you amplify and how do they use it to study the special calorimetric? Yeah, yeah. So this is actually rather important that, of course, the d squared F dzi dzj is tau ij. This is the period matrix for the curve. And this has a property. The only property I used in this lecture was that tau i. Lecture was that tau ij is equal to tau ji. That was really important for me. But of course, it has its other important property, and that's that this is, I hope this is clear. Maybe I should write it correctly then. But by that, I meant it's a matrix, so it's positive definite, is what I mean when I write that. Okay, and so then this these coefficients here. These coefficients here give you coefficients for our metric. And so this is precisely the metric that they use using this function. So in our case, it ends up we're using more than this period matrix tau ij, because we have more than A and B periods. We also have these contours and these residues. And so what I imagine could occur here is the real structure on The real structure on the so basically, I'm thinking that the symmetry remains for the tau ij's, but we might lose this property unless we have a special curve. And so now this is entirely a guess, just because there's something real happening here, that the real structure, for example, on a spectral curve might be the type of structure that would help us to gain this important property. In this important property. And so, yes, one could wonder if this helps to give a metric in particular. Well, I guess the Euclidean case is very interesting. I've got a long history with hyperbolic case, so that definitely interests me. I had a question, which is any idea of what this computes? And how does it vary if you vary your monopole? Very good. Right, well, it's using what we've just said here regarding the metric, is it indeed so what are these prepotentials often compute? So they often give us expansions of some enumerative problem, and it seems unlikely in this case. And the other thing they're used for is exactly they give us this local. Exactly, they give us this local behavior of a metric on the moduli space. So, just as a Kayler potential, basically. Yes, yes. And so, then that's the one that I would back in this case. But, you know, I don't know the answer to it. But, yeah, the analog in this case, like I said, is probably the Broglie-O-Hain result. No, I shouldn't even say probably, is possibly. Different for spectral curves in different monopole problems, there are the constraints look quite different. So, where in the story does the information about the constraint enter? Is it structured? Yeah. Look, that I'm not sure of. Let me say that there are natural constraints here, of course. So, if this, the generalization. So if this the generalization of this theorem involves not just B periods, but it involves these, well, actually, depending on what I choose for my A periods, this would involve residues as well. So let me say that the dual periods are the closed contours. And so the A periods should have been the A periods plus the open, the interval contours. And so then when one's looking at such an expansion. When one's looking at such an expansion here, one can naturally cut out G dimensions in this expansion just by expanding the, like I said, there's not just B periods now, there's B periods and these generalized B periods, which will end up being residues. And so one can just look at this expansion, just the residue part of it, and then not include these Z coordinates dual to the B coordinate. So there's a natural To the B coordinate. So there's a natural way to cut down G dimensions here. But yeah, when we need the precise, for example, Erkeline.
