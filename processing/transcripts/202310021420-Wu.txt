It's really a great pleasure to meet such a beautiful phrase and meeting so many friends. So, I'm going to talk about some recent work on the Haberbani-MIGD and Habarian neighborhoods and the Haberbarika MIGD equations. Let me first start with the Habani-MHD equations. So, hey here. So, well, I guess most of you are familiar with the MHD system. So, the first one is the velocity. One is the velocity field with molten forcing term. And the only difference from the standard MHD is that, so here it has an extra term, so it's gamma partial GTOB, and this part here together with this part is the standard MICD system. So here, gamma is positive, it's bigger than zero, and I'm going to call this a hyperbole MICD. Call this hyperbolic MRGD, and sometimes the also call this one here the MRGD equation of downplay wave type because clearly the V equation involves the downplay wave operation. So let me tell you where it comes from. So this is not artificial. So in some sense that it is this just artificially added to it? No, it comes from Yeah, yeah. So there's a graph. I mean, when I think about MH, there's an equation, there's a graph w equals zero, that's seven constraints. There's a pressure term, so that's seven constraints, right? Now, if you add graph W equals zero, that's a constraint, right? And that thing is usually for the magnetic field. We have just dt E plus eta graph B equals eta plus e plus eta graph E. You've got divergence, and dt grab del B is just a plus graph del B. So divergence B probably is propagated. If you add this gamma dtb to this zero, if the b is zero, divergence b is zero. I mean this is Gauss's law of magnetism built into uh the physics. Uh so the derivation is pretty simple. I'm gonna The derivation is pretty simple. To convince you, I'm going to actually go through the so simple process to derive that equation. This is a Maxwell equation, and this is always more. These are pretty standard in my textbooks. So if you look at the second equation, and then you substitute E from the last equation, that's what you get, right? And then this term is here, and then you replace J here. Then you replace J here by the first equation here. So just replace it and you put it here. And then you have the partial partial T over E, then you use the second equation. You differentiate in T, you use the second equation. You plug that in, and here it is. And then you use the basic identity is KL B is A's and the KL of U cross V. And the care of u cross v is probably a master how running average volume. I mean, in textbooks, in physics textbooks, they say that this template is pretty small because the absolute number is extremely small, they can ignore it. So therefore, you get a standard RGB. But so, in some sense, this one here is a real one. So, they do have this robotic attempt here. The last four questions I answered about this simple body diagnosing equation. So the first one is global resistance and regularity, even in a two-dimensional case. And the second one is given the concept of weak solutions. So of course you want to know do we have global weaker solutions? So the main reason is that when we look at a global recognizing problem, Regularity problem, this quantity here, the gamma of partial GT, actually prevents us from obtaining any global bound, even the L2 global bound in the two-dimensional case. We don't get any considerable quantities. But later on, I'll quickly show you that the harbor structure actually has a stabilizing effect. So we do stability problems. So let me quickly explain to you why this. Can explain to you why this term here actually is a better term with global bounds, global regularity problems. So it's pretty simple. And if you want to get a global L2 bound, and then you dot a U equation with U, B equation with B, and you add them up, and then all the standard MHD terms, and U dot grad B, U dot grad U, B dot grad U, all those becomes zero because diversion is free condition. Divergence free condition. So the only thing that's left is this guy here. So this double T term. And naturally, you want to take one T out. So you take one T out, then you have to subtract this term. So this is just identity, product rule, right? And then you get a better term of this point of T use good term. And a natural way to sort of eliminate this better one here is that in the B equation, Is that in the B equation, you start the B equation by pi ut of B. Therefore, you're going to get a positive pi ut B of t. So, and then you multiply suitable coefficients and then you add them up. So, then you get everything on the left-hand side to be positive. So, and then the trouble is that you get two nine net temps getting into play. So, when you do the L2 estimate, so the two nanometer temps here. So the two Nanian temples here, actually mixing is not a self-concern in some sense that this requires higher derivatives. You have three paths, and then you cannot just use L2, L2, the other one you have to use L infinity. So in two-dimensional case, you need more than one derivative to control these two batteries. So you want to control the L2 norms, you need to go to higher-order derivatives. So you don't get any global bonds on the L2 norms. Bounds on the L2 norms. So that's the difficulty. So you don't get anything L2 or L1. And furthermore, it looks like if you want to even get the L2 bounds, uniform bounds, the lower in time bounds, you need to go to higher order derivatives. So that's the difficulty here. Okay, so Okay, so um uh okay so so in a recent paper we uh we will obtain a result uh but with some sort of a smallness condition. So let me explain to you. So this is a very simple 2DMH equation. When you put a constraint on gamma on the size of the initial data, you can actually get the local bounds in L2. So let me explain to you. So, let me explain to you. So, this is the theorem. So, we have the two-dimensional hyperbolic MHD equations, sometimes MRGD wave equations, as some people call it. And here, the initial condition is for the u error of the velocity initially in L2, even though if you directly do energy estimates, appear to be impossible. And for since the B equation has two time derivatives, And two time derivatives, you need the initial P0, you also need the initial partial TB and T equal to 0. So this, I use A0 for partial Tb when T is 0, for the initial data, because if you use B1, it could be component. So I use A0 for the partial TB, the initial data. So this is the H1 and L2. And then if we first And then um if furthermore uh the gamma okay so if gamma satisfy this condition here, so this is uh a a constant uh so we can find gamma zero and uh we satisfy this condition. This is a kind of a smallest condition. So the initial normal times gamma to this power here. So I see it's between half and one, so this this power here pretty much like a quarter. So if this condition is, if gamma zero satisfies this condition and it's smaller gamma, and then that harbonic MRGD system has a unique global solution. So and furthermore, the harbonic MRGD system, the solution of the harbor MRG system converges to the corresponding two-dimensional Two-dimensional emergency system. So we have an exponential convergence rate. So more or less make gamma to a quarter. So S is between half and one. So half S is half, and that's pretty much like one quarter of the convergence rate. Okay, so that's the Hieronica MHD result. So let me quickly show you. Okay, so now the Okay, so now the bigger issue is that if you do not have that constraint on the initial size, on gamma, you get global solutions. That's open. We do not really know how to do it. And so we're actually in the process of trying to show some sort of blue-up. So several people from conservation role appear to have some idea about how to get blue-up results instead of like showing the Results instead of showing the global regularity type results. I'm going to quickly tell you how we did it. It's pretty simple. So the idea is that you cannot really do LGSMIs. To do LGSMIS requires more than one derivative. In fact, you require more than two derivatives. Even if you have a simonius, close the LGS limits. Instead, we're going to just do the unique group form. The integral form. So, we're going to rewrite the Harvard MRGD into an integral equation, and to be more efficient, simultaneously we're going to take the difference between the Harvard MRGD and the MRGD. So, we're going to, okay, so to write down the integral form, and the B equation is a damped wave-type equation. So, we have to solve the linearized wave equation, and then so. And then, so here's a general formulation we developed. It's pretty simple. So if you have a damped MRCD system of this general form, so here and Q are just a general Fourier multiple of operator. And then you can write it exponentially the solution of this general dump of the wave equation in this form here. So k1 and k2 are the color function. K1 and K2 are the color functions. So these are the colour functions exclusive in terms of the eigenvalues of the characteristic equation. So the characteristic equation is simply you put the partial t terms as numbers of word, and then you get the characteristic equation, you'll find the IV values, and then you can find your operator K1 and K2, and then you'll K1 and K2, and then write down the generalized down the wave equation. So apply another general formula to the MRCT system. So for the velocity part, we just use the Hidden operator to write it as an integral equation. And for the B equation, is that the MHT system, we write it in terms of the Wii operators. So and then so here the formulas The formulas, and then we take the difference. So B denotes, so U and B denotes the solution of the standard MRGD, the MRGD without double T tail. And then U gamma and V gamma denotes the solution of this hyperbolic MRGD. So you take the difference, and of course, you got quite a number of terms, and then you put it in. terms and then you put it in the functional setting of L4 so this is and and then h1 half so and and then you do an estimate so okay but before I can do the estimates we have to sort of figure out how the wave the wave colors in the B equation find some basic properties about them. So what's a really amazing I was surprised that Really amazing. I was surprised that one of them behaves pretty much like a hit operate. You can, in some sense, if you replace the heat of operate, in those estimates, you replace the hit of operate by this wave operator, you get exactly the same type of estimates. So let me quickly show you. So the kernel functions for the hybrid double The hybrid Double Wave equation has an exponential representation in a Fourier space and they behave differently in different frequency space. So for high frequency, you basically cut it off according to this number here. So for high frequencies, they pretty much behave like a donkey. So and then for K1, for the second one, you gain one derivative. And then for the normals, and then they pretty much behave like a dumpster plush operate. So that's the point-wise estimate in a free space. And so then we need to put these two operators also in the functional setting, like so it's LP. So the LP from 0 to T and then H S plus 2 over P, the standard type of space for Labour-Stokes for heat equations. So next one is for the head to operate. And then you can derive very similar type of estimates for the two kernel functions, so K0 gamma and K1 gamma. And they behave pretty much like the Halo operator. So in particular, the K1 gamma gamma gamma. So, in particular, the K1 gamma here, exactly like the airport, it operates. But here, we did this to make sure how this coefficient depends exquisitely on gamma. So, because we are going to do a convergence later on. So, for example, this type of estimates, if you do it in this type of space, you gain two derivatives in L1, and then you gain one derivative. And then you gain one degree reduced in L2, and so on. So this is pretty much like the standard way to operate. And then in order to do the convergence, we were so so okay. So maybe it's a good idea. Let me tell you what I was trying to do here. So you want to compare the original The original MRC equation with the Habani MRC equation, we need to compare them at a linear level first. So, this is the dumped wave equation, and then this is the head equation. So, you can find an exponential bond about the difference. So, in other words, when gamma approach is zero, the Double-Waver equation indeed converges to the Hittite equation. heat equation and then with the exponential convergence rate so you can figure out exactly what is our gamma here so and and then we so once we have the the estimate for the linear piece and then we can uh do the estimates uh for the difference. So we have already written them in inequal form and then we can just estimate each sheet. We can just estimate each piece. So the first piece here comes from the initial data here, comes from the convergence of the minimum parts. And then you have some choices, only depends on the solution of the original machine equation U and B. So you have a, and you also get a piece that That meaning depends on the difference. So we're estimating the difference in this functional circuit. On the other hand, here, some terms came out actually the linear cheese, but with the coefficients depend on the norm of the standard MHD solution and the UND. So, and then you're going to have quadratic pieces. And the basic idea. So and the basic idea here is that we're going to mount a prototype argument. So we're going to show that difference is small. And what this piece is here, in the calculation, we exponentially figured out how it depends on the coefficient gamma. So what we have gamma to a positive power, so and then that. Power. So, and then this only depends on the original MHD solution. So, Mungama is the smallest piece that should be fine here. Now, one toward the piece appears to be the Nina piece. So, the Nina piece, the idea here is that you cannot redo the whole time interval and then you cut the time interval into several pieces. So and according to a basic theorem, analysis, so if you I mean we we know the solution of the standard MRGD equation is bounded. So therefore these quantities are bounded. So we can just take a tiny piece, the time interval, to make this small and uniformly not depending on the time interval. Not depending on the time interval, but depending on the size of the time interval. So therefore, we have just the S and this difference here from 0 to T1 such that this coefficient here is less than one half, then it can be absorbed on the left hand side. And then you get an estimated from 0 to T one and then you iterate from T one to T two. So uh and then you get uh a global volume stuff. Global farm stuff. Okay, so that's the estimate, and then once you take a care of the NINAMPs, then for non-NIMPs, you just do a full-streaming argument. So that's a pretty standard post-streaming argument. So that's our theory. So I'm going to move on to the To the Harbani neighbors dogs so I'll present two very recent work. So for the first one is about the global resistance and the regularity result for a general harbour neighbor stokes. So again, the harbor neighbor stokes has gamma partial T term and here we put a general fractional We put a general fractional dissipation in the equation. Otherwise, so without this term here, it's pretty much the never stopes. And the second result is this puzzle about, we tempted a global weak solution. So, right now, since we don't really know the real result on weak solutions. But now let me first tell you the global existence and regularity result. So the theorem here can be stated as follows. So here we have a general fraction of plus operate and we require that alpha is between two-thirds and two-thirds plus g of three. This is the question. Yeah, but then you asked the question. So what what is the physical motivation for modifying the navy stokes with this camera? Oh, so I say that what was this double temp? Okay. I'll tell you right away. So just the many ways to generate this temp here. So I'll put in a reference and three references and then also it comes from a stepping type of problem. So I'll show you. You're able to see this very soon. So here, so this is the Howardian nephews with the general fractional dissipation. And the result says that when the index of the fractional dissipation is between two thirds and two thirds plus 3D, and the initial condition is functional setting. Well, this looks complicated, but I can interpret it a little bit. So, for example, here, Little bit. So, for example, here, in the two-dimensional case, when D is a 2, alpha is 1. So, this is standard 2D hyperbolic liver stokes. So, in this case here, this is pretty much like L2, right? So, in the two-dimensional case, while this just simple, the standard howbody never starts. Just not process dissipation, you have quite a GTM. So, in that case, this is. So, in that case, this is pretty much in 2D, it's L2, and this is H1. And then, so U1 here is in L2, that's in 2D. And in 3D here, this looks like the homogeneous Half, and actually 3 halves, and actually half. And we define a quantity here in terms of the size of the initial norm. So you write down the norms. Down the bonds. And then if gamma and the matter quantity, so this involves the size of the initial data satisfying this condition here, again this is type of smallest condition. Then furthermore, if gamma here is in this single critical range, it's between two-thirds and a half plus four D, and then you require the liquid stokes to be well posed. So that means that. Holes. So that means that the double in the 3D negative stokes you want to be small, the initial size. And then you have a unique global solution to the harvarium negative Stokes equation. And then the solution is in this functional setting. And then the difference between the standard level stokes and then the Hawaiian level stokes simplify miss estimates. This estimates, so the convergence rate is gamma to colon side. And then, of course, you get a global bound for the hierarchical stoke solution. So that's the result. So again, this is sort of type: either you requiring gamma to be small or you require initial size, the initial data to be small. So let's. To be small. So that's the type of results. And the open problem again is that even in a two-dimensional case, so you'll see your initial condition is in U0 in H1 and U1 in L2. Then without that condition, we do not know if we have a global solution. Or maybe the solution will run. So again, when you're in process of constructing When you're in process of constructing block solutions. Okay, so I'm going to work about global existence. Recondarily, I'm going to quickly tell you the rule with Kazoo. So I invented Kazoo for some exchanging time because I'm very interested in how Valiant Neighbours Delta's equation. So in particular, since it has no global L2 bar, we don't No global or two bound. You don't get any global bounds. So, how do we define a weak solution? And how do we show the global resistance weak solution? So, that's the task Kazi is very interesting to do. And as you know, Kazi is an expert on the conversion integration quick type solutions from detail using naval stocks, the costing neighbor stokes, and so on. So, it's actually For his expertise and recognition here. But the difficulty here is that this is a hybrid nemostok regarding the partial teaching term. I mean, until now, there's no work really deal with this type of equations, even in converse integration. So, okay, so we define a weak solution. This is pretty much your shift to all the derivatives from the solution. The derivatives from the solution to the tester function. So, what are the time derivatives, measure derivatives are on the tester function? And then, this is a sort of variable in the distributional sense, that's a weak solution. So, it is not, as we sort of explained at the beginning, that you don't get a global two bounds. So, there's no way, I mean, I don't know, at least we actually. I mean, I do not know, at least we talked to Caso, we do not know how to attempt some other kind of weak solutions, or regular weakness solutions, don't have global L2 bounds. Okay, so here's the result, the weak solution. So this is the kind of wild weak solution, weak solution out of convex integration. So here we're again we doing the general fractional Laplace dissipation. Laplace dissipation. So here we use the meta m. So meta m here is the power of the fractional power. So m here is between zero and two thirds. I don't know accidentally in the global regularity result, we require alpha to be bigger than two thirds. But here, for the global, for this kind of weak solution, we require alpha to be this range. I don't know, right now I'm not sure. Right now, I'm not sure whether or not this tool cells is sharp or is it just accident. So we have to figure this out later on. So I mean this range and then we have a weak solution in that distributional sense signifying this type of inequality. So sometimes you might neutralize the quality as well as the solutions. The corresponding wild solutions. So, in this case, I mean, we do not know even physical because we do not really know the Hiwatika names don't conserve the L2 no. So, the L2 noble could go wrong. We do not really know. So, this is that's the result. So, you have a weak solution, in that sense. And the weak solution has this kind of properties. The auto mobile becomes bigger than it all. The auto mobile becomes bigger than it all. So the construction is extremely complicated. So I did not really attempt. I tried to put some slides, but the mass, enormous number of locations, so I give up. And Kazakh, if you want to know, Kazakhan explained to use the machinery of a convex integration, but here you have quite a bit detail how we deal with it. So that's the way. May some work we have to deal with. So, well, one word about the uniqueness or nine uniqueness. So, in this work here has not been able to go to the nine uniqueness part. So, the reason is that the solution constructed here does not really have a competitive support in time. So, many of the solutions, the common integration. Solutions, the common integration solution for living stokes has a compactness supporting tau. That gives you nine uniqueness immediately because there is a solution, you construct a solution, you get a nine uniqueness. But here, we have not able to do the compactness part in time. So I guess we still have more work to do. So okay, so um okay, so that uh that's about the uh That's about the um herbodic neighbor stoves. So I'm gonna uh I'll say one thing about here. Where does this uh herbodic neighbor dose come from? It was derived in the 70s by the Italians. They're trying to add this term to take account of the some sort of inertial properties or the momentum and heat flux. You can find this people right away. So it's uh it is the and the Pachy Territory. And the project changing table using it. And then you can also derive the Harvardian neighbor stokes in a rather quick way by replacing the stress tensor in a standard neighbor stokes by a delayed stress tensor. So I can write it to you probably about 30 seconds. So you also got to have one. And twenty years ago, And 20 years ago, Bernier and the collaborators also derived the Habana name stokes from a system of equation, they call it relaxation of Euler equation. And okay, so I'm going to tell you a little bit about. I'll do it all back. I know you're doing third party. Just make it time to stop. Okay, so what I really want. Okay, so um what I really want to tell you here is that surprisingly, uh the harbonic uh uh in the stokes, harbonic properties comes from stepping problems. Even though the original problem does not really show any sign of wave-type equations, but uh if you combine them and then you do get a double wave equations in those uh uh stability problems. So I'm gonna give you uh two simple examples. Simple examples. So, one example is the older Roderick B model. So, the older Roderick B model is a model in complex foods. So, it consists of two equations. So, this is Nevi-Stokes. And here we consider general d-dimensional Nevis-Stokes, Rd, and with a nine-duthion stress tensor. So, that's this is pretty much standard. And here we have no dissipation in the velocity equation and dimensions. Equation and dimensions of ray. And the tau equation here is simplified, it's pretty much standard for viscous fluids. So viscous elastic fluids. But here we put a general fractional dissertation here. And this Q-type term, I'm not going to tell you, it's just the banana term. Pretty much standard in this elastic food user. So that's the system. So that's the system we'll consider here. And the goal here is stability. Small data global welfare is and stability. So, and actually I don't say any wave equations. But if you differentiate this system here, so first of all, if you go back a little bit, so if you first project the pressure away, just apply the nerve. Apply the neural projection, and then you take a time derivative, and then you make several substitutions, and you get the Double-Wheel equations. So, and the minimal parts, the Double-Wheel equation for the velocity field and for projection divergence tau. So, if you combine the equations and then take one more time derivative to make some substitutions, you can convert that. You can convert that equation into this format. And here, this is pretty much exactly a double-width equation. So the gamma equal to zero, that's pretty much the damping term, and that's a Naplus term. So that's another way to obtain this type of helbodic systems. And this thing here really helps. So originally, the reason why it helps originally. The reason why it helps that originally here, the velocity equation is Euler. So, and plus the fourth and ten. And normally, if you don't have a mechanism, there's no way to show that oil is stable. And truly we solution or truly well-like growth. And as Sasha and Safari were doing this long time ago, so double exponential in time, possibly. So and no, it's really where the So 3D weather and Tariq Tom Ho and was recently Diago. They showed a 3D weather boost of the final time. So how do you show stability? But this some of the wave situation really helps you. It means that some of the food terms from Tau equation actually helps stabilize the fluid through the Dr. Wim equation. So this allows us to show So this allows us to show that, this is a recent work with Peter and two young colleagues, to show that flat general G-dimensional older roundabout system, even though your velocity equation has no dissipation, no diagnosis, you have to show the stability result. So here, the spectrum is just saying that if the initial The statement just saying that if the initial perturbation, the size of the initial data is in HS, so it's pretty standard requirement because your velocity has no dissipation. So it's one cross half of D and the initial size is small, then that older right to B system has a unique global solution and the solution remains small. So furthermore, you actually gain, I would call the Gain, I would call the enhanced dissipation tail. So originally, in your Euler equation, the velocity says that the Euler equation has no mechanism, looks like it has no mechanism to smoothize. But nevertheless, you gain this type of dissipative hype-assiminase of the velocity field. So that's what you to the double wiggly preacher. And yeah. And yeah, so I'll give you a last example I'll create. So the second example is about a two-dimensional MHD equation. So this MHD equation here has a dumping velocity. So this is the dumping term. And it has two extra terms. So A dot value B and A dot value U. A here is a constant vector field. So where does this kind of equation come from? Kind of equation comes from. This equation here comes from the stability problem of the standard MH equation. Here the background. So when the magnetic field is here, the background A, and then you write down the equation for the perturbation, it generates two terms. So one is A dot value B and the other one A dot value U. So and there's And the stability problem here, the difficulty would be because your B equation here has no mechanism of dumping or dissipation. So in general, for equations, for universal equations, snipping problems are pretty hard. Most equations will not even be true. So again, what you can do here is that you can convert this system here into a double wave equation. into a double wing equation. So this is the W term and but it's not a full lock loss, it's just directional flaws. So the A dot greatness word of U. So if you age 100, it's just a partial wise word. This degenerate will be partially. What levels that is listened here really helps. So if you write it down an integral four An integral form, and you look at the kernel function here, you do have less supposing properties, and then you can show the stability, you can show decay in time. So that's I'm going to stop here. Thank you. Because you're finished. I'm finishing, I'm pretty much done.
