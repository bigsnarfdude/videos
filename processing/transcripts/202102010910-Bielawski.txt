Wish I could be in Banf, yeah. We all do, yeah. But thanks. And I can only support what Derek said. Yes, I'm sure it's a lot of work to organize it online. But at least you don't have to deal with expense forms. Good. So as I said in the introduction, the goal is to explain why the spectral curve governs the geometry of monomers. Govern the geometry of monopoles directly in terms of the differential geometry of the moduli space. So I wrote this abstract of the talk, and once I started preparing the talk, I realized there are such explanations, and it's just that I never found them satisfactory, so somehow I forgot about them. So, yeah, in 1999, I gave such an explanation. Such an explanation in terms of action of a twisto group, which then was well, it was also formulated, and it's an equivalent formulation by Dunaisky and Mason in terms of hidden symmetries, which can be also defined as killing spinners. So these are essentially other explanations why monopoles, why the moduli space of monopoles. Why the moduli space of monopoles can be constructed via the generalized Legend transform construction of Lundström and Rochek. So this gives us always construction of hyperkelometrics. And if you can do this, then it's actually comes from certain curves. So the difference is now that what I'm going to talk about is that this hyper-Poisson geometry Hyper-Poisson geometry is much more restrictive. So it will work. So the thing before work for any hypercalor manifold constructed via generalized Legend transform. This will work for SUN monopoles with maximal symmetry breaking and also for color ones. Well, in terms of the num description, I suppose. Okay, so let me start. Okay, so let me start by telling you what hyper Poisson bivectors are. So here is the construction. So they can be defined on any hypercomplex manifold. So hypercomplex manifold is one such that the complexified tangent bundle is a tensor product of two vector bundles. So let's say manifold had dimension 4n, then E. Had dimension 4n, then E has rank 2n, and H is a trivial bundle of rank 2. E has also a quaternionic structure, so an anti-holomorphic involution which squares to minus one. Of course, C2, these are just quaternions, so it also has a natural quaternionic structure, the usual multiplication by j and And the composition of these two quaternionic structures that should be the real structure on the complexified tangent bundle. So basically it's a conjugation. So what I described until now is basically an almost hyper complex manifold and then there is the integrability condition that any unit imaginary That any unit imaginary quaternion here, the action on the C2, defines an integrable complex structure on them. So it has a two-sphere of integrable complex structures and they behave algebraically like unit quaternions. So on such a manifold, there is a unique compatible torsion-free connection. Torsian free connection known as Ovata connection and well one can everything can be interpreted in terms of the twister space so the twister space well essentially parametrizes all these complex structures so the product of M and S2 can be made in a complex manifold Z fibering over Cp1 CP1 together with an anti-holomorphic involution which covers the antipodal map on P1. And then M can be recovered as perhaps only a collected component of real sections of this projection with normal bundle splitting as some of line bundles of the Q1. Right, now if you have a holomorphic vector bundle on Z, which, well, okay, so normally we assume that it's somehow m trivial, so this means that the space of section, yeah, the space of holomorphic sections of W restricted to a section of this twister projection is constant. Projection is constant. So then we get a holomorphic vector bundle on MC defined like this. We take a point of m, which corresponds to a section, and we take the space of sections restricted to Sm. So in particular, the vertical tangent bundle on Z, so the kernel of d pi, restricted to tz. d pi restricted to Tz will give us then the complexified tangent bundle to M. And if we twist this vertical tangent bundle by the pullback of O minus one from Cp1 we will get the bundle E okay well let me now recall the bit of algebra here for this for these bundles. Bundles. So Simon Salomon, in his work on quaternionic manifolds, shows that one can decompose the exterior algebra of TCM into two components. One of them is everything is skew symmetrized in E. So it's really skew symmetric on E, totally skew symmetric on E. Well, then you have to make fully symmetric on H. And then there is And then there is a component which is uniquely defined by the fact that this is P1 invariant. In terms of complex structure, this has very nice interpretation, namely AR is given as the span of forms which are of type or yeah or they are not forms. Well, these are not forms, these are no multi-vectors of type R0 for different complex structures. So AR is just given by linear combination of multi-tangent vectors, which are of type R0. And then Br is everything else. So Br is now something belongs to Br if it's of the type R minus. Of the type R minus one, one plus plus plus function for all complex structures. So it doesn't have this R0 component. Right, so A R actually, so in this construction from the Wolt transform, right? This is the Wolf transform for holomorphic vector bundle on Z. Holomorphic vector bundle on Z, we get a holomorphic vector bundle on M. This arises from the R's exterior power of the vertical bundle on set. And then, well, the further part of the World transformed well, Penrose Wolf-Solomon transforms and Simon Solomon did lots of work here in the case of quaternionic manipulation. Here in the case of quaternionic manifolds. So a section γAR arises from the holomorphic section on the twister space if and only if it satisfies this equation d gamma is equal to zero. And this operator D, this is essentially given by the connection which arises from the Word transform plus some contractions here. But equivalent definition of condition for this that d gamma is zero precisely when the r0 component is holomorphic, right? So it's not just index r, it's the direct sum of type of r0. And here, if it satisfies this equation, this means that it's the r0 component is holomorphic for each complex structure. Complex structure. This R0 component, this can be identified simply with the restriction of this holomorphic section on the twist of space to a fiber. Okay, so that's the preparation a little bit of this this this tensor algebra for hypercomplex manifold and let's now define this hyperpoission bivectors so a bivector on a hypercomplex manifold is called hyperpooisson if it belongs to this a2 component of salamon and for Salomon, and for every complex structure, the corresponding two-zero part is a holomorphic Poisson bivector on Mi. So well, one can rephrase it, well, it must satisfy this, it must be in the kernel of this Penrose mode-Solomon operator. So, that's the condition that it belongs here. It belongs here and it's holomorphic. And then it must be Poisson for each complex structure. So that means that the Scouten, the Neinhu Scouten bracket is in this B3 part, right? The three zero part will be zero. And even And even simpler, even well, much more perhaps intuitive definition of this that we can define the corresponding bracket, right? If you have a bivector, we describe, we define bracket on functions by applying the bivector to differentials. And the equivalent condition for this bivector to be hyper-Poisson is that this bracket is a holomorphic Poisson. It is a holomorphic Poisson bracket on the sheaf of i holomorphic functions for every complex structure. Okay, the twist or interpretation of this is that pi corresponds to, well as we've seen before, pi corresponds to a holomorphic section of the lambda 2 of the vertical tangent bundle and it will be Poisson on the Who are sown on each fiber? Okay, so that's one can define this on any hypercomplex manifold here. Not that I have any examples which are not hypercalor. So let's now assume that M is in addition hypercalor. So what it means is that it's of the Riemannian and the Lebichivita connection is actually Lebitschwita connection is actually the Obata connection, right? So the complex structures are parallel for the Lebitchwita connection. So that means that it has a two-sphere of califormes. And well, there is much more information. So in particular, those caloriforms can be formed together into an O2 valued symplectic form along the twisted projection. Along the twisted projection. So, in particular, well, for every complex structure, we also have a holomorphic symplectic form omega i on m. So, for example, if we choose the complex structure corresponding to I1 in the standard basis of quaternions I1, I2, I3, then well this. Well, this form combining omega I2 and omega I3 will be I work holomorphic here, as shown by Nigel a long time ago. Okay, so here's an example of a hyper-Poisson bivector. Take any of the Keller forms on a hyperkeler manifold and take the corresponding bivector here. That will be hyperpool. That will be hyper-Poisson for the complex structure i and minus i, this will define a trivial Poisson structure. It will be zero. But for others, the two, zero part will be non-zero and it will be non-trivial. So these are somehow trivial examples. The point is that these are also compatible, right? So one usually wants compatibility. So one usually wants compatibility between one looks for compatible Poisson structures and then here we can talk about compatibility with the metric. So a hyper Poisson bivector is said to be compatible with the metric, hypercalometric. If the two zero part, this Poisson bivector is compatible with vector is compatible with the well corresponding holomorphic symplectic form yeah so the Nyenkuscouten bracket of those two is here all right so well having two Poisson structures is of course a very important thing in integrable system Integrable system and guarantees the integrability. So that's what is going on here. All right, so here's now a non-trivial example. I mean, known, but non-trivial. So in four dimensions, a hyper-Poisson bivector, which is not a constant linear combination of those scalar forms, omega 1, omega 3, is a linear combination. A linear combination where the coefficients must be a hyperkeler moment map for a tri-Hamiltonian vector field. So any such thing is hyper-Poisson, and conversely, any hyper-Poisson bivector, which is not a constant linear combination is of this form. Yeah, so, and it's also automatically compatible with G. That's well, basically. That's well, basically, because of dimension, right? I mean, in four dimensions, your complex structure has dimension two. So essentially, all Nierhus-Scouten brackets are trivial. I mean, for decade two. Okay, but here is an a l less trivial example. So I came with a word of warning that Okay, but with a word of warning that I worked it out now when I was preparing the talk, so I hope this is correct. It seems to be. So let's take an ALF hypertoric manifold. So that's the Cau-Nut modification of hypertoric manifold. Yes, so there are those hypertoric manifolds which are quotients of Euclidean space by tori, and we can introduce the modification. Modification by taking the product with well, well, essentially, we are putting, we are making the volume growth, I want the volume growth here not to be Euclidean, but 3n. This can be done by this. So, then there is an analogous n-dimensional vector space of hyperpooison by vectors compatible with the hypercolometric. Right, so let me maybe recall a bit about this now relies on these works of Magri and Morosi and many other people on bi-Hamiltonian systems. So, let's say we have a hypercalculic manifold with a compatible hyper-Poisson bivector. So, in particular, Vector. So, in particular, for every complex structure, we will have a pair of compatible Poisson, holomorphic Poisson structures, the one given by the holomorphic symplectic form, and the one given by the hyper-Poisson bivector. So, if you have two compatible Poisson bivectors in general, real or complex, with one of them non-degenerate, so coming from a symplectic form, A symplectic form, then we can form the so-called recursion operator, which is an endomorphism of the tangent bundle, well, by taking tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle using the non-degenerate one, and then going back to the tangent bundle using the possible degenerate pi2. So, if they are compatible, then the Are compatible, then the properties are that the lion whose pencil is zero vanishes, and the eigenvalues of R are commuting Hamiltonians for both pi one and pi two. All right, and the third property is that the determinant of this r is naturally a square of something other, of something else, namely the these are both. These are all skew symmetric things, so we can form the quotient of the Favians since this is non-degenerate, and then the determinant is square of that quotient. So now we can also form a whole family now of compatible Poisson brackets by taking, so pi one stays the non-degenerate. So pi one stays the non-degenerate one, but we replace pi two with pi two minus lambda pi one and when we consider the characteristic polynomial of this of the corresponding recursion operator well it will be of form du b square of some other polynomial just like this here. Okay, so that's the sort of general thing. Now, on our hyperkemmel manifold, we have for every complex structure now holomorphic Poisson bivectors. One coming from the holomorphic symplectic form and from the two-zero part of our hyper-Poisson bivector. So, according to this, we get a polynomial. And it will be of this form. So it will depend on the complex structure. So this is affine coordinate in Cp1. So it will be a polynomial of this one. Yeah, dimension of m is 4n. So what we're getting is basically a spectral curve, right? It would be a curve in TP1. Let's call it the spectral curve of the bivector pi. But of course, I should say here, so right, so from the bivector, we, this hyperpoisson bivector, we immediately get spectral curves. I should say that, of course, the recursion operator will carry much more information. And well, I mean, in the few minutes, I will explain the existence of hyper-Poisson bivectors on. On monopole moduli spaces. And of course, I don't really know yet with this. I mean, there should be some information about monopole modular spaces coming from this recursion operator, which I haven't investigated yet. So, for example, one information which you get is One information which you get is that you get a certain sheaf which is supported on the spine coming from this recursion operator. If, for example, if this curve, this spectral curve, the spine is smooth, then this will be a rank two vector button. All right, so yeah, let me move. Let me move to this existence of hyper Poisson bivectors on monopole moduli spaces. So, this all this comes from the construction of the twister space of charge K Su2 monopoles on R3, which can be found in chapter 6 of the bestseller geometry and dynamics of monopoles by Tia and Hitchen. So, their construction is as follows. We start with the twister space of charge 1 monopoles, which is easy. The charge 1 monopoles are determined by location in the phase. So this is the moduli spaces R3 and S1. And the twistal space will be the total space of a certain line bundle on TP1. So Derek explained nicely that TP1 is the mean. Explain nicely that TP1 is the mini twist for space of R3. So these are the locations of monopoles, and then we're getting the phase is given by the total space of certain line manolium. And we have to remove the zero section. So the fibers of the twister projection are just secret C star and this fiberwise O2 valued symplectic form. all two valued symplectic form is given by is just a standard symplectic form on C cross C star right so Atiya and Hitchen show that one constructs now the twister space of charge K S U two monopoles by taking a certain by taking sort of a fiberwise construction To the fiberwise construction related to the Hilbert scheme. So, what one takes is a Hilbert scheme of k points on C cross C star. But all one needs is a structure an open subset, an open subset which corresponds to such points D so that the induced projection on the set of D On the set of d points with multiplicities is an isomorphism onto its image, right? So, so what you're doing is you're choosing points which either lie in different fibers or if they are multiple points, then they are not tangent to a fiber. Yeah, maybe a simple. Yeah, maybe a simpler way also is that it can be equivalent to describes that these are just multi-jets of sections of C process of this projection onto C of total order K. So we have to choose. So we choose a bunch of points in C and then we choose an R depth of a section at each of those points so that the top At each of those points, so that the total order is k. Okay, but this is actually much simpler than the full Hilbert scheme. Okay, so one can form such a thing on C cross C star, and now the idea is that we do it on the fibers of this twist of projection, Z1 to P1. So this multi-jets also can be identified with Russia. Jets also can be identified with rational maps of degree k. And then, when one does it on the fibers, we get this complex manifold z k fibering over p1, and it has symplectic form on the fibers, which will exist owing to results of result of Boville about the existence of symplectic form on the Hilbert schemes. Yeah, well, if I write it like this as rational maps, then If I write it like this as rational maps, then we also know this. So this form is can be over the set where the roots of the rational map are, or the poles of the rational maps are distinct, can be written like this, and it extends smoothly to the whole space of rational maps. All right, now, however, this result of Bouffille about the existence of symplectic form on Hilbert schemes has been extended by Bottracin to Poisson surfaces. So if you have a complex surface with a Poisson bivector, then we get a Poisson bivector on the Hilbert scheme of k-p points. So now we had this. symplectic form here so that so we get this this was symplectic so we take it we can take this inverse and let's just multiply it by beta so that's Poisson by vector on pi one must be Poisson since we are on the surface okay so apply now so we know from Podachin's theorem that we're getting a We're getting a fiberwise Poisson bivector, so a section of lambda 2 of the vertical bundle, which is compatible with the complex symplectic form. The compatibility follows from the fact that they were originally compatible. And this gives us a hyperpoissant bivector on the moduli space of charge KSC2 monopoles. So now So now, well, I mean, the 2-0 part of this hyper-Poisson bibertor for any complex structure is easy, right? It's again written, can be written just by just like this, just like for the complex symplectic form, right? But so the complex symplectic form for monopoles for every complex structure, that's the easy bit, right? I mean, that's the thing here. One can compute it, but of course. Can compute it, but of course, it's a big step from there to actually to the metric. So the same thing happens here. And so the two, zero part of this hyper-Poisson bivector is easy, but it's far from getting the hyper-Poisson bivector as a as really a bivector on the moduli space for the real. So I can show that. So I can show that I can compute it in terms of Nance equations and symmetric. So if I compose the bivector with this isomorphism between cotangent and tangent bundle given by the metric, then I can write it in terms of the solutions to Names equations like this. Yeah, where these forms... These forms involving matrices are just this. So, yeah, this is, yeah, so it actually, yeah, remember that the Ti's here have poles, so this doesn't even look finite, but it turns out to be finite if we integrate. So, this is so we have to plug in here the tangent vectors to. Plug in here the tangent vectors to the moduli space, not any TI's. And the proof of this is that I just compute the two-zero part for each complex structure of this, which is again easy. Quite easy. And show that it's exactly what we're getting from this twister construction. So this is the hyperpool. Hyperportson by Victor in terms of the solutions to Lamb's equations. Right, well, I mean, there are things here which are definitely unexplored. So, for example, pi will persist to the asymptotic matrix. So, the asymptotic matrix which you get in this sort of the Gibbons Manton and also the ones which I long time considered, they they they they still will carry the They will still carry a hyperpooce on bivector. Okay, so let me now say. So, okay, so well, okay, so there is a hyperpoisson bivector, and you could ask, well, okay, well, this here is lucky because we start with something in two dimensions where everything is Poisson, and we're getting compatibility. Yes, there's compatibility and so on, right? So, so what about the SUN monopoles with making? Quick question about your remark. Your remark is about that some holds on a complement of some compact set when you mentioned that it applies to asymptotic matrix. What I mean is that in those cases about the asymptotic matrix, of this Gibbons-Manton. So, those Gibbons-Manton matrix or the matrix which I long time defined using spectral curve, they will also have hyper-poerson by vectors. And I assume. Even though in the interior, they might be. No, of course. Of course, they are defined, yeah. Okay, so on the complement of some, you cut out some complement. Okay, thank you. Oh, no, sure. But yeah. Yeah. So SUN monopoles, right? So it turns out they also exist on the moduli space of SUN monopoles with maximal symmetry betting and again just give us the corresponding spectral curves. And the reason this works is that the twister space can be also Of space can be also constructed as some sort of resolution of singularities. So I remember actually, many years ago, I even talked to Jacques about his world. I mean, is there an analog of this Attiya-Hitchin sort of construction, this resolution of singularities, partial resolution of singularities for SUN monopoles with maximal symmetry breaking. Symmetry breaking. If I remember correctly, Jacques' answer was a good question. But yeah, so many years ago, accidentally, I wasn't thinking about it, but we realized this. So there is such a description. And this is a particular case of our current joint project with Lorenzo Foscolo on the construction of QALS. Of QALF hyperkeler manifolds as well as Coulomb branches using the invariant transverse Hilbert schemes. So the idea is that one starts with the W invariant against this ALF, so time-dutch modification of a hypertolic variety. One takes its twist. One takes its twist of space and considers fiberglass invariant transverse Hilbert scheme. So in general, a Hilbert scheme, if you start with something in higher dimensions, a Hilbert scheme will not be symplectic. Essentially, because we here have this W invariance, everything behaves almost like a simple as for As for symplectic singularities, so everything will behave almost as if it was in four dimensions. Yeah, so such a hypertonic variety is determined by a bunch of co-dimensional flats, you could say hyperplanes, even in C. And then from that, one, one, one, so one, so if one starts with the hilt. So one, so if one starts with the Hilbert scheme of this, one applies this fiberwise invariant Hilbert scheme, and what one gets is, well, putative hyperkela manifolds. So yeah, so the one one one the okay, so the corresponding mind has Corresponding Mind Hyperkeler manifold consists of curves in this fiberwise twist of construction. And these curves have to satisfy certain conditions and they should correspond to certain moduli space of solutions to Names equations, except in general we don't really know what the boundary conditions. Don't really know what the boundary con, or we don't know yet what the correct boundary conditions are. So, this is the aberration of for Cochiggs vector, for Cochiggs bundles. This is the correspondence between the curves and Taurus bundles and modular spaces of Cohic bundles. Of cohig bundles. However, if we lucky, we recognize the conditions which these curves have to satisfy. And for example, we recognize them for SUN monopoles with maximum symmetry breaking. So for SU3 monopoles of charges K and L, the corresponding The corresponding hyperplanes, flats, they correspond just to, well, essentially the two types of monopoles meeting. So we take CK cross C L and we take these hyperplanes to be given by the Xi equals to Yj. The corresponding while group, this is just the product of SKS. This is just the product of SKSA. And now everything works through. I mean, if this, the hypertonic variety, as I said before, will carry a, well, K plus L dimensional space of hyperpoisson by vectors, but there will be only two dimensional space which are SK cross S L invariant. And those two, this two-dimensional space, will carry through via this Hilbert scheme construction to the moduli space of monopoles of charge KL. And the correct well has a cruise for any of such hyper-poor sound directors, we get the Such hyper-Poisson directors, we get spectral curves. So now we get pairs of spectral curves which correspond to SUT monopoles. Similar and a similar construction for SUN, as well as if we are on a circle, so we get colours. Yeah, maybe just one remark that this what I said before there is this the recursion operator which carries more information. So as I said in the case okay so well in the case of SU2 monopoles of charge K I know what the corresponding sheaf is. This is simply Simply, as shown with the work of students of Nigel Hitchen, Oliver Nash, SU2 monopoles are also constructed as curves in the moduli space of charge one monopoles. Yeah, this is essentially the same thing as this transfer scheme construction. And the shift that we're getting from the recursion operator, this will be the normal bundle of this. This will be the normal bundle of this curve in this three-dimensional twist of space here. So that's the interpretation. However, there is an interesting thing because we're getting these two-dimensional things. We can consider also flows of those things, for example, with the hyperpooison, bivector, recursion of the rituals, and so on. So I think there is lots of things which still go on here, but which I haven't ingested here. Okay, so maybe let me make a quick conclusion that that it seems to me that this hyperpoisson geometry, this is a common generalization of hypertoric manifolds and hyperkeler manifolds exhibiting this particle-like behavior, just like for monopoles. So there is some sort of perhaps nice hyperkeller integrability condition. Condition. And well, okay, so yeah, there is a generalization where we can allow gasoline that have bivectors. We can allow sections of lambda 2e and s2rh. So these are no longer bivectors. But this can be also, they can be just identified as interpreted as polynomials with values in lambda to e and then we could we could ask then this polynomial for every value of zeta is a polymorphic Poisson bivectors compatible with solving a zeta so these things so for example centered monopoles will not if you take centa SU2 monopoles they I mean the I mean, this is not a hyper-Poisson sub-manifold. So the hyper-Poisson bivector does not restrict, but what we will get is one of these lambda 2 etc. And we will get these things also on any of those putative QAF um manifolds with the store and so that I hope to show exist that they exist. That they exist. All right, I seem to have either rushed or didn't plan well enough. So that's it. Thank you. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Are there questions or comments? Because I had one actually, which is I had one actually, which is that I think I have another example which seems to be linked, but I'm not sure how. A few years back with John Harnad, I was looking at these basically sort of lax integrable systems with a sort of lax representation with a spectral parameter, exactly as you could do for Names equations. There's a theorem that says that if you look at these things, you know, this symplectic geometry of these things, well, your lax representation gives you a spectral curve. And so you can think of these things as flows of line bundles on a spectral curve. Now, your spectral curve sits naturally inside a rule surface which has a Poisson structure. It has a whole family of these Poisson structures. Poisson structures. And symplectically, you can think of your integrable system as a symmetric product, or if you want a Hilbert scheme, given by just representing these line bundles as points on a spectral curve and then giving, you know, sort of as divisors, basically. So now you think of that point sitting inside the surface. And so you've got a picture where your integrable system is basically. Your integrable system is basically a symmetric product of the surface, and your level sets are symmetric products of the spectral curves sitting inside spectral products. And so you can play this game, and you have exactly the same thing, and it's very reminiscent, but somehow not quite of you. I mean, you don't really have a hypercolor structure, do you? No, no, like I said, it's sort of close, but not. Like I said, it's sort of close, but not doesn't quite fit. There's no real structures there, there's just you know pure complex geometry, but yet looks very similar. So it's it's and then your comment about the sort of particle-like behavior is extremely intriguing, of course, because for the rational maps, you have these. And how that fits is kind of. Is kind of intriguing. Yeah, but okay, but I mean, in this case, which you're saying, you're getting this from a surface via the Hilbert construction. That's probably that's that must be the particle-like behavior because Hilbert schemes essentially harm it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I said, it's sort of close, but not quite. I mean, you know, the symplectic form for the Form for the monopoles, of course, is it's particle-like too, right? I mean, you've got essentially poles, not quite residues and poles, but anyway, poles and holomorphic values. So it's close, but not quite the same. And of course, you know, then there's the presence of the Nam equation, which you can think in terms of a Lax pair. And again, it's close, but not quite. Of a lax pair, and again, it's close but not quite the same. So it's very intriguing. Anyway, it's one of those totally unhelpful comments which I seem to be making a career of. No, why? Pointing links is important. Okay. Anyway, thanks. Any other questions? Any other questions? Sorry. So seeing none, we can either all retreat to Sokoko and either find an isolated room to nibble our lunches in.
