Okay, I hope everyone can hear me and can read the blackboard. If not, then please comment in the chat and I can hopefully do something about it. Okay, so what I'm gonna tell you about is some results about homological stability for the general integration of the integers. Groups of the integers. This uses tools that I developed with Sir Anglatius and Oscar Wendell Williams for studying general linear groups of fields and semi-local rings. But the input necessary to make these tools apply to general linear groups of the integers, the input was provided in joint work with Jeremy Meller and Peter Past. Okay, so I'm just going to start by giving you an overview of what's known about the homology of GLMC. About more GLMC. Okay, so of course you know what the general linear group of the integers is, m by n matrices with integral entries that are convertible. It's the prototypical arithmetic group. You can construct from this a classifying space in your favorite way. And then you can take the homology of that to get the homology of the group. Unless I want to be very careful, I'm going to just plot the B because it coincides with good homology. Unless I'm saying otherwise, I want to use integral coefficients, but I have to write a lot, so I'm just going to use this. But after I also, I'm just going to use this supreme. Okay. So I think for many people at this workshop, the motivating question is the following. What is the homology of GLNZ? Homology of GI and Z. Okay? Well, we know a few things about this. Firstly, we know that the homology groups are finitely generated because a finite index subgroup of GLMZ has a classifying space. Here's a classifying space which is homotopy equivalent to a finitely W complex. And use the Borel-CI compactification, this metric space. It's also easy to compute what happens in low degrees. So maybe I mean the homology of G L and Z for D is one, two. Um you can do zero yourself probably. You can do zero yourself, probably. Okay. So, how would you get at h1? Of course, that's equal to the mean position. And to compute that, you might want to use the following exact sequence. Here combined a determinant and its kernel which is split if n is odd, but we don't really use that. And we use that this group S and Z is perfect if If n is at least 3. So, what you get from this quite easily is that H1 of GLNZ is isomorphic to Z mod 2 if N is advanced. But N is 2, something else happens. To get that, I won't write this down, but to get an H2, you use the fact that S1 0. The fact that S1Z is perfect, hence at least three and sure multipliers. This was first done by Milner for and at least five, and then you can read in the paper on the colour, what happens when it's three or four, if you're interested in that. Okay, now what's important about this is that here you see the first instance of homological stability. This first This first homology group does not depend on n as long as n is sufficiently large. Peter is colorblind. Oh. Also, it does show up. Don't worry about it. Zoom, keep going. I can read it perfectly. I think you wouldn't lose any information if this was white instead of blue, sir. Okay. But uh I will try to use uh white from now on. Okay. So what does that mean? So, what does that mean? Well, most of you have already seen this, but there is a map called the stabilization map from GLM to GLM plus 1 of Z that takes the matrix to that same matrix, but we don't want attended quarter. So, this is homomorphism, and first of all, it's a factorial homomorphism. So we get an induced map on specifying spaces. I'm building out the same way. And hence an induced map on homology. So I think it was Marsen who first proved, working with tools that Quiller developed, that this map is an isomorphism in a range, depending on n. He also proved the surjectivity result. One step earlier. And if you want to conveniently write out its result, you should use relative equality. So this, of course, implicitly defenses that method S. And if this is zero, 0 or d s equal to alpha 2. Okay? So for example, if you look at H2, then the map from GL4, H2 of GL4 of Z to H2 of GL5 of Z is rejective. And from that point on, it's an isomorphism. And it's already something that was proven by Miller. Book on algebraic K-theory. Okay. So to make this useful, Useful, but very useful. You want to know the stable homology. So it's either maybe the homology of G on infinity of Z, or maybe you prefer to think of this as the collier of this n goes to infinity of the homology of G L epsilon. And it's a consequence of the group completion theorem, which uses some structure on these classifying spaces that I'll talk about in a bit. That this is isomorphic to the homology of the path component of the infrared loop space of the algebraic K-3 expression of the integers. So you could try and compute the stable homology using algebraic K-theory, or you could use try to compute algebraic K-theory using stable homology. Okay. I won't mention algebraic theory again. Okay, so combining Borel-Ser with the stability result, you know that these groups are finitely generated. You know that these groups are finitely generated. So if you want to compute them, you might as well compute the free part and the torsion part separately. You want to reduce any information? So we basically know that the free part was computed by Borel. So maybe one way of stating it is that the rational cohomology of g of infinity of z is a free greater commutative elderly. It's a free greater commitment of algebra over the rational classes of degree 5, 9, 13, etc. So every four degrees side 5. These classes are called Borel regulators. Secretly, what Borel did was compute the cohomology of GLNZ with rational coefficients or maybe real coefficients. Coefficients in a range using analysis on symmetric spaces. But this is a consequence of it. One thing that's maybe interesting, I just want to mention as like a side remark, the image of the map that pulls back these stable classes to finite map. This is known. This is known. And it's contained in work of Franklin. You can also find it in a paper I wrote with Bena and Jeffrey Johnson Cousin. But we also do it for symplectic groups. Okay. Next thing you diagnose is a torsion. Part of the stable homology. So, okay, we don't exactly know it is, but we basically know this. So, if you how do we know if that mixed abound is true? We know the answer as long as you only take a Irregular, sorry, primes p, which are not irregular primes bigger than, I think, nowadays, maybe 10 to the 9th or something. So with some exceptions, we know the answer. The problem is that you, for those cases, you don't need to know the Venn diagram conjectures. Conjecture is true. We know that, well, you're going to use the Venn diagram conjecture to prove that k phi of z is zero. So as long as you know that k phi of z is zero independently of that, you can still get the computation I'm going to tell you about to go through in the range. We know that k four of z and k eight of z are zero. The first was proven by Rogness and the second by myself and the Deutsche theory, which L. Pasmin sent. And what you had? Okay. Anyway, let me just state the answer, because I think not so many people know that you can actually look this up. So this was done by Y original. And let me say for P all odd regular to get that the S Propology. We get that the FP hormology is isomorphic to that of a path component of an infrared space of the image of J, which the fifth is functional KL. And maybe Fabio want to also have something like this for symptomatic groups. Ah, okay. Yeah, I'll write that out. The upshot of this is that Of this is that, oh, by the way, I don't know a computational damage of these known classes in the cohomology of G on M of Z with Fp coefficients. I think that would be interesting. So do we just know the Fp cohomology, or do we know, like, let's say, the Z mod like, you know, 9Z or whatever? Can we know that part, so the rest of the torsions? I think so. I think this is a statement about like p completions of. I think the real statement is a statement about the p completion of the k-theory spectrum. You can think about what that you, I think that buys you what you want. Okay. Anyway, the upshot of this is the stable homology is pretty well known. And if that's the case, it becomes important to understand how good Mazen's result is and whether we can improve it. And so that's what we did. So let's see. My asset result is slope one-half. In other words, In other words, the degree has to be less than or equal to n alpha 2. And what we did is improve this as slope one. At least, this is your caveat, after inverting two of the coefficients. I'll talk about a practical in a bit. Okay, so what's the statement precisely? Sorry, can we take a brief question, please? Sorry, can we think about two questions, please? Is that the topology in relative mode of a stabilization method with C on half coefficients is zero for the investment? Oh, there is a question. Yes. Yeah, can you briefly say what is behind the requirements of Requirements of inserting two in the previous blackboard. The previous blackboard. Let me just confirm. So the question is, why is it important to invert 2 in the coefficients? Yeah, exactly. Okay, yeah, that's the question. Well, it's false, otherwise, and I'll tell you why. But maybe on a technical level, we're going to use these EK algebra techniques. EK algebra techniques and we're going to build things from three E infinity algebras. And there's more classes in low degrees at the prime two than at higher primes. It turns out that some of them survive when you try and build this more complicated object I'll talk about in a second from these three algebras. But I'll give a counter example in a bit in the parents. Okay. Yeah, because normally Sorry, as normally because it'll take you some time to relate that question. Sorry, can you uh ask your follow-up question? No, I don't have questions, but I have a comment. Because yeah, in algebraic K-theory, we normally don't invert so unless we deal with Hermitian K-theory. And this is why I wonder what's behind inverting here. Okay, the other. Okay, yeah, the comment is just that in algebraic K-theory, normally there aren't problems at the prime 2, in contrast to like Hermitian K-theory, where there often are. And so the comment is just maybe it's surprising that the prime 2 is different. Yeah, I use CYNT. So let's see. Here's the N, here's the D. I'm going to write down What's known about the rational ghomology or homology of the general linear groups? And there's a class here, the H5GL5. This class is the Borel dual to Borel regulator, so these are its small terms. And there's a bit more, something in the grey. Something in degree 8 here, something in degree 9. The rest is empty. This is all done by computer. Buzzfits and Splaying Gangl that is. Anyway, what you see is that you can't have better than slope one because of this fast appearing. This is optimal. At least it has to change the offset. And the optimal slope, and that you change the obstacles. The second remark is that it's actually also true for the Gaussian Eisenstein integers. Let me not talk about that. All right. So we're going to pract two. This may be clear V. So there's still a better range than the one. There's still a better range than the one from Mausen, which was again slope one half, but here it's only slope two thirds. Oops, that's not perfect. Okay, so it goes down a little bit. And this is a this is optimal. This is optimal. And we think that goes as follows. In GLNZ, you always have a symmetric group. We know the homolog of symmetric group, which we have finite fields coefficients completely. And you can always reduce to F2. And here Here I previously studied the F2 homology of these groups, the term relations Oscar and Williams. And here it's optimally sloped two-thirds by classes that come from the symmetric group. And so by some factorization trick, you get that this is ultimate. Okay, maybe you could ask in general whether there is some range in which the failure of stability for these guys are the same with F2 coefficients. Okay, so what is the goal for the rest of this talk? Is to explain how theorem A is related to Steinberg models. And we'll meet a type that I think is not studied that often, which is a relative stager. Okay. And I think part of my what I want to bring across, if people are interested in thinking about this, is that if you want to make improvements to homological stability results by studying Steinberg modules, you also have to study these relative ones at the same time. And even though good results are known here often, because we don't have these relative results, we can't push things further. Okay, so now we've got a little section where I will black box most of the machinery that Soren Oscar and I developed. But probably Oscar will talk about some of these things in his talk. Okay. So the starting point is the following observation. If you take the classified spaces of G Ln Z, this has additional structure. Well, one thing is staring you in the face, which is that it comes with some grading, which you need to keep track of if you want to phrase all logical stability. So maybe a secret we want to consider this as some kind of predictive project. The second is that it has a product on it. So, this product will be compatible with the grading in the sense that it will take Rn times Rn to Rn plus M. And this is just an oxide. So it's induced by the homomorphism from GL N of. G L N of Z times G L M of Z to its sum, which takes A, B to A and fills as a matrix with zeros. Okay. This modification And this multiplication is not strictly commutative, but it is commutative to coherent homotopy. For example, For example, um there's a path there's a path between these matrices and maybe I want to say this, but maybe it's not precise stuff. Conjugation gets, I mean each of these guys is maybe secretly a loop in your classifying space and conjugation by a matrix that has A matrix that has zeros on the diagonal and identities over here creates a homotopy between those two loops. If you swap the A's and B's, that's maybe a bit annoying to write. Maybe it's better to say that this is true because we can recognize R as follows. R is a classified space. Here is a classified space of a symmetric monoidal robot that we saw in Peterstock. The objects are finely generated free Z modules. And I think if you want to maybe have the right generalization, you should forget it. Get it. And the morphisms are isomorphisms. And the tensor product is direct sign. Okay? Whenever you have a symmetric model of groupoid, this thing will be something called an E infinity algebra. So this is the homotopy theoretic version of commutative wide. If you haven't seen it, me giving definition is probably not going to help, but maybe it's intuition will help. Okay. Okay. So why am I telling you about these structures? They are used in this technology that Sora and Moscrate and I developed. Okay, so if I have to explain this, it will take the remainder of the talk. So I'll just give you a very, very short summary of how this is supposed to go. If you want to learn more about it, maybe a good place to start is some lection or two or four Wolfer seminar on this. Seminar on this, which give maybe more examples than papers do. Okay, so the first step is that that is after taking chase any E infinity algebra R actually, I don't need to change the Can be built by iterative taking push out against free algebra. So maybe we call these Ethimpi cells if they're free on a sphere of magnitude, free on a disk with additional grade. With additional grading. Now you want to estimate how many you need, because these three infinity algebras have homological stability, at least if they're connected spaces. So you get a bound on the E infinity cells. This implies some sort of homological scale of yourself. Okay, so now you want to get this bound. So this bound, just value two chains. The bound is in terms of T infinity and decomposables. P infinity in decomposables, which you can estimate by E1 in decomposables. E1 is the homotopy theoretic analog of an associative homoid. So every infinity algebra is in particular E1. And then in this particular case, the E1 indicomposables can be In decomposables can be computed in terms of sufficient complex splits. Maybe sequential sense. Spillings. This is true in general when you uh come from a symmetric monoidal coin. That's sufficiently nice. Okay, so this is just some black box. But let me tell you what the simplicity of those fittings is that comes out at the end. And what you need to prove about it is to get a stability result. So these official sets of splittings, they will be the split detailings. They will be the split each building. Okay, so it's a nerve of the postet of pairs A cop B of proper Of proper non-zero, say, rejected submod of z to the n, such that the induced map from the direct sum into z to the n is isolated. And we have And we have uh that one is less than or equal to another. If and only if I want A prime to be contained in A and B to be contained in B prime. So, what you think is that Is that we're shifting over some stuff from A to B prime, you get to the other side. Okay, so these were studied by Johnny before. And maybe I won't write this down, but the k-synces are just splittings into k plus 1 non-zero pieces, ordered. And of course, there's an evident G on and Z action on this. And let me now summarize what all of this black box stuff tells me. What all of this black box stuff tells you in the proof about this. Okay. Okay, so oh, there was a question that I missed in the question. That I missed in the question is about: can you do everything for SLNZ? And then Peter answered not without a slightly worse offset, but if you have any other comments on that question. Well, it doesn't have a difficulty with the symmetric monodal structure. Is there a sign that might appear? Maybe the answer is yes, but not without additional work and the results might appear. But not without additional work, and the results might change slightly. But certainly, like within the realm of possibility, you can do this fast and okay. So, we need to prove this and that the GLNZ coin variance of the Split-Steimer module Which is defined to be a reduced top homology of this complex. It has to vanish after tensoring with Z one half for f at least. Of course, it won't be true when f is 1. Okay, if this is true. Okay, if this is true, then you get the homological stability result that I mentioned before A. This is what you need to put. If you have a different sequence of like paradigmatic groups you're interested in, then probably you can write a similar argument as 1, 2, 4, 6 to get a similar reduction like this. Some complex will pop out of machinery if you prove it highly connected. That proves some vanishing of co-invariant install homology to get a signal result. So, for instance, like would that work if you looked at kind of Like, would that work if you looked at congruent servers and you just work right on it? Could you improve the range of rural stability there if there works? Again, I'm a little bit worried about some technical things involving these E-infinity structures, but this can probably be resolved. And then, if you can prove some complex, which is now going to be more annoying because it's going to be splittings that reduce to standard splittings after reduction, if you can prove that that's highly connected. After reduction, if you can prove that that's highly connected, that's probably going to do something like this. Because of the error. But it's like sympatheticism. Okay. So now I want to tell you how you might go about proving something. And what we're going to use, at least what you would like to use, is. Is the map of his fits this moment to the usual? In my notes, I was going to find this again, but you've seen it twice at this point, so maybe you remember what this is. It's a nerve in the posteth of proper non-zero summits and z to the n and the inclusion. You can take a, b to b, so you have a nice map like this, which is glm z a They invariant. And the corresponding version of the theorem is true for the text building. So this is due to solar monetics at the shabby m this is n minus 3 connected and the GLMZ coin. The G of X co-invariance of this time where point all vanish. And they also vanish up for diaspora signal, too. So I can see now. Okay. So that seems like a great start of an argument. I think on that one you can avoid tensioning with inverting two. Yes, you can. But we don't need it. And if you would like to use this, you would maybe want to do some kind of You maybe want to do some kind of quidened map of process type argument. So, in general, Quidden says that if you have a map of process from A to B, says that you can understand A through knowing things about B. Okay, I do definitely know things about B. B, okay, you definitely know things about B in our case. And two other things. The links, which are those y, which are y smaller than x containing b. Those would just be smaller versions of these buildings, so we all start out. That's good. And through maybe that's called the fibers, A F greater than equal to X, which are those C is just Z. Which at those z is just like z, f of z is greater than equal to x container. And uh here you encounter a type of complex you haven't seen yet. Here you encounter it like a relative split teacher. So these guys will be relative split these buildings. Each of the lengths. So maybe they're like SZ to the N. Let me just change the dimensions because it's a bit easier to state connectivity results later. Okay, so these are splittings. A comma B such that B contains Z to the N. Okay. At least we haven't seen yet, and then we need to do that. We're going to do an inductive argument. So, what you're going to do is use a similar trick to go down from these Down from these to a relative version of the distillery. Okay, this is going to send A, B to A. And now you can think about what this should be based on that description of the relative splitting spelling. This should be the norm of the MOSAT of non-zero proper sumaps. zero proper summaps A inside of Z to the n plus n such that A intersect Z to the n is zero and their internal sum is a sum at. There's some kind of a relative version of this. Okay, and what we prove, which is maybe the new result, is that oh, and if you think about applying this quillum trick again to this map, you realize that now you're closed under induction. You're only going to see things that you've seen before. Okay, so what we prove is that This is n minus 2 connected. It's one higher than the corresponding t-shirting, but that's fine because you have this C to D F that allows you to still be proper even if you rank F. So you've been higher. So this is for M at least one. Yeah, M is at least one here. Correct. And secondly, what acts on this? Well, a bit more acts, but at least this acts. Dissects. Those automorphisms which fix pointwise e to the n. If you take the co-invariance of the reduced, this would be a relative Steinberg module to reduce stock hormonal of this complex. They vanish. Take vantage and create the one and after densering creates equal. And I'll end by saying how this is proven. Maybe classically knowing about the complex of partial basis gives you a generating set for this timeberg module, these integral partners that Peter talked about. If you use I talked about. If you use Church and Beltman's augmented basis complex, you can produce a generating set for this Steinberg module, and then you can compute co-expressions pretty easily from that. Okay, so let me stop there. Are there any in-person questions? I guess this last step that you do need to invert one half there, I guess, because that you do need to invert one half there, I guess, because you can't like you you like you just like you should change orientation by flipping two things or something. That's where the argument goes. It's not impossible that a very clever person can go with a more complicated way of proving a co-invariant management. Maybe Jeremy. It would contradict. So in a paper we use inverting two in two ways. We use it here and we use that we start from the symmetric group and the symmetric group is slope one stability. Group and the symmetric group of slope 1 stability with z adjoint 1 half coefficients. But we could have started, if these co-invariants vanished without inverting 2, we could have basically started from bounded symmetric powers. And so, like, this is the only part where we use it essentially. So it would contradict, you would be able to prove a result with Z coefficients. But what have you done in this thing where these numbers maybe is only true after these two? Oh, yeah, maybe eventually. But like, I'm pretty sure you can't the state I'm pretty sure for some n and m, it is not true that the z coinvariance vanish. Otherwise, you get slope one stability with z coefficients, which we know doesn't hold. Yeah. I mean, originally I wanted the goldens paper also. Maybe exceptional stability. I think this is somehow very small. Exceptional stability, I think this is somehow very special to GLNZ. For congruent subgroups, you shouldn't expect anything like this. So that's low one-half, I think, is what you would expect there. And here's some very special venue that happens. And this is why you need to work with Z or maybe like Gaussian or isochinators because these augmented pressure basic basis complex don't work very well by the further brains connectors. Are there any other in-person questions? For some questions, okay. I'm going to put my headphones in, and are there any Zoom questions? So you wouldn't expect slope one stability for congruent subgroups away from the defining prime, let's say. There's 40 known comprise animals. Even over Q. Well, or oh, well, he said you have to invert the prime, and you're saying, well, if you invert everything. Right, just invert everything. No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. No, but I guess Peter's comment is just like, make sure you invert the prime if you want homological stability for congruent subgroups. Right. Groups, right? I mean, even for H1, that's necessary. I also don't understand why, like, now we can all hear Peter no degrees. I think if there are, if they're enough, paper, this is necessary. Oh, yeah, I mean, so like H1, like a congruent subgroup of SL2 has non-trivial homology. Well, that's also true for SLN. I mean, the congruent subgroups of SLN. Subgroups of SLN or GLN have non-zero homology mod P. Like if you're looking at the level P concrete subgroup, yeah. No, all I was saying is, I think that like it means at least your offset is worse because here like H1 G L2Z with Q coefficients is already stable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm saying you have to even with Q coefficients, you have to make the range a little bit worse. But you, I mean, with that for SL. With that, for SL, for SLN, you need to make the range off by one constant term at least. So, you wouldn't expect congruence of groups to be better than special linear group. So, it's possible that it's just that the last like four years, I've been like trying to prove like slightly better than slope one half stable range for congruent subgroups, but slow. So So can I ask a question? Yeah. So in the case with coefficients in F2, where does the slope two-thirds come from? I don't know, but you probably don't want like technical Don't want like a technical answer, and maybe you want like a more moral answer about why that is the right thing to expect. I can't give that answer, but I can give a technical one. The technical one is how these techniques usually work, these self-govern techniques, is that you build a small thing that captures the harmonic ostability behavior in a range, and then you prove that more stuff that you might add to that doesn't affect the model stability behavior. This small thing is built from no. This small thing is built from knowing what the, in this case, the F2 homology is of GLN, F2, or GLN, Z and low degrees. You read that off from computations that other people have done. You block your small model, you do computations there, and you read off that the slope is too fast. I don't know whether it's very illuminating. Yeah, and one thing is we just reduce it to your guys' calculation. Your guys' calculation for while studying GL F2. Yeah, the same small model. Yeah, we just reduced it to that same small model. I feel like you have a remark in the paper where you said basically you're sick of fighting the spectral sequence and maybe someone could do better, but I'm not. Yeah, if you put in more information about generally groups, at least over F2 with F2 coefficients, you could build a better model. You could build a better model and hopefully get a better result or at least understand what happened in some metastable range. But it becomes pretty complicated to do these cell attachment spectral sequences or scaled potential spectrosequences. But I think there is hope of understanding what happens between like two-thirds and three-quarters, for example. You had an interesting conjecture that maybe if you don't want to invert two, then you can get arbitrarily good slope. Arbitrarily good slope less than one, as long as you're willing to accept arbitrarily bad constant term. Or maybe conjecture is a strong. Like a thing you said once two years ago, which I think is a, you know, would be interesting if that were true. And, you know, it's hard to find a counterexample because you're arbitrarily bad offset part of the question. Would that mean you get slope two for rational coefficients? For rational coefficients? No. It's not integrated to this. Actually, I have a question. Let's say you're looking, this is a different sort of thing. Let's say that you're looking at G L N Z, but say Z adjoin 1 over P or something like that. So you're looking at some like S arithmetic thing. Can you improve the. I mean, again, you should just explore all the rational coefficients. Right. But it will improve tremendously. Things will improve tremendously, I guess. Yeah. I mean, you definitely know homological stability for those sorts of things, but the question is whether you could get better ranges. I think yes, but I'll try to see what we do get. It's a bit what is Borella Yang thing seems to suggest to me is that there's somehow There's somehow a world in between rings of integers or like semi-local rings or something, right? Yeah, there are enough inverted primes. Boo ranges kick in. Please rationally. Yeah, give people the Lauterlin computed if you take the rational cohomology of GLN of the member field. They computed that completely. And actually, the result works in a range. And actually, the result works in a range as long as you integrate it off the primes in the main company to do this. And that's using analytic methods. So they're viewing the number field as a discrete field, and then they're computing that homology? Yeah, it's just like automorphic formology. So looking like the actronic space of the idelic kind of some like. Any other questions?
