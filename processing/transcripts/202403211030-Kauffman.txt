Maybe and they have of course graphical nodes. And the question is how do you get at the topological properties of a graph with its graphical nodes? And this method, which I'm going to show you by doing various examples, is to replace the graphical nodes in some way in order to end up with a not or a link. And then you can look at the topology of that nod or link. You can look at the topology. Link. You can look at the topology of the NR link directly if you want to, if you happen to know something about it, or indirectly by calculating the invariance of it. This talk is brought to you by the Van Springs Hotel and its Celtic knots and its hot chocolate. Photographed courtesy of Lynn. That's a nice Celtic knot on their floor. I checked what Semper. Um, I checked what semper eata means. It means always the same, but I'm not sure what the reference is here. So in order to talk about this, we start with just arbitrary graphical vertices, of which I've drawn some four valent ones in this slide. But this four valent vertex really just means any graphical vertex whatsoever. It could be trivalent or 170. Trivalent or 1700 valent. And the first three moves are the well-known Reitemeister moves for the topological part. And they are, of course, obviously ambient isotopies. If you have something that you've drawn that is meant to represent a line embedded in space, then you can pull it or slide it or slide it underneath another crossing like that. And those are. Like that, and those are equivalent topologically. But the good theorem due to Alexander Briggs and Reidemeister a long time ago in the 1920s tells us that if we have curves embedded in space and we take projections of them so that we can work with diagrams, graphs of that kind, then these moves suffice to get isotopes in space. And the point is that you can add a few extra moves for thinking about graphs in space. And the moves are a line that is going underneath or over a graphical node can just go ahead and slide, just like the third Reidemeister move. And then you have to ask, well, what am I allowed to do near a graphical vertex? And we call a vertex topological if you can do it a little independently. If you can do a little independent twist of any two lines that are coming into that vertex, so that would be a topological move, but it might not be possible if you had actually made it. For example, suppose that your vertices were little hard spheres and you had attached lines to them in various places along the sphere. Well, then when you try to move the sphere around, you're going to move more than one line at a time. And if you rotate Line at a time, and if you rotated the whole sphere by 180 degrees, you'd have lots and lots of entanglement going on. So, the basic notion is illustrated here, where I'm doing a 180-degree turn of that rigid vertex, and both the upper lines and the lower lines have to conform and turn at the same time. And of course, there's a horizontal one, and if you drew And if you drew, and then you can deduce all the rest of them from simpler ones like that. But you can imagine, for example, that if you took a vertex and then you combed all the lines going that way, and then you turned that vertex by 180 degrees, then they all have to twist like that. So, rigid vertices are often a little more realistic than topological vertices, but topological vertices are sort of at the But topological vertices are sort of at the base of what might happen. And so then the question is: how can you get some information about the graph knowing that these are the moves that you want? And you would like to be able to tell whether two graphs are equivalent by moves of this kind. All right. I wanted to mention before I forgot that another way of thinking about the graphical vertices, if they're forvalent like these. If they're forvalent like these, is that they are black boxes, and the black boxes might contain a crossing, but you don't know which way it is. Maybe the crossing that this black box contains is this way, or maybe it's the other way. You just don't know. Well, then if you think about it for a moment, you realize that every move that I've drawn here up over to five-star, rigid vertex move, those are all moves that present. Those are all moves that preserve whatever it was that was in the box. You see, right? If you moved something underneath that crossing, that's fine. That's actually just number three. If you rotated the thing by 180 degrees like that, whatever is in the box will also concomitantly rotate along with you. So that means that you can think of these moves. Can think of these moves as moves for what people like to call pseudonaughts, where a pseudonaut is a knot where you don't know what some of the crossings are and you've represented them by forvalent vertices. There's one move that's left out if you like to think about pseudonauts, and that's going back to number one. Imagine that you had a black box on the crossing in number one. Then you ought to be allowed to eliminate the black box just like you eliminated it. Box just like you eliminated it in number one. So, people who work with pseudonauts would have another move that would allow a vertex with a loop at it to be removed. Or not, depending on whether they like to do the one move or not. Okay? So, those are the moves. Doing the vertices this way. We're going to be reformulating the vertices in a moment, but this. Vertices in a moment, but this is the standard idea. I'm just trying to understand number five, and I thought Jan has got input for me. I understand five star, but I'm confused by five. That looks like it can absorb a twist. I'm trying to get the physical picture of what's happening in five. Not five star. Five star makes sense, but five might be sorry. You're thinking that five doesn't feel very physical. Five feels weird. Or what's your question about five? Could you explain five? What's your question about five? Could you explain five again, please? Explain five. Well, imagine that you just had a point here. You had four lines that are just coming into a point. And a point has no nothing going on. They're just attached there. And then topologically, you could twist it and nothing happened at all, right? It just got twisted. It swivels right there. Yeah, but I think that what that means. Yeah, but I think that what that means is that the equivalent class of the underlying graphs are abstract graphs, because this is allowing you to change the rotation system at the vertex. So, for example, you've got no embedding, no fixed embedding of the graph. You're allowed to re-order the children. But this may help, and in any case, it's a piece of formalism I'm about to introduce. Suppose that I had a bond that was like this. And then that is supposed to be a kind of expansion of something like this. So this is reminding me that something is going on there. Well, then it might be that you were topologically allowed to do this here. And it wouldn't be affecting anybody. I think the problem is for me in my. I think the problem is, for me in my head, it's calling that a topological vertex when, in fact, what it's doing is stripping the topology out of the situation because it takes out any embedding of the graph. The equivalence class that you get here, two graphs that are the same as empty. You're explaining it in the usual topological way, but people are thinking about how would it look physically. Topologically, it's a point set, continuous motion. Continuous motion of the curved space. Yes, but it means that the underlying graphs that you're looking at, if you look at your underlying graphs and you're allowed to make this move, without this move, your equivalence class are embedded graphs. So the embedded graphs are defined by the rotation system. But if you allow this move, you've destroyed any. You've destroyed any rotation system at the vertices, and thus your equivalence class are abstract graphs. There's no distribution. There's no deposit. That's correct. So the second one we have. But that's actually another good point. If you're dealing with planar graphs, for example, then you have a natural rotation order at every vertex that's given by the planar graph. The planar graph. And if you're given an abstract graph with some rotational system on it, then you can find a surface on which the graph lives that corresponds to that rotation system. Right, but you're allowing me to change that rotation system. So that graph that you've just drawn there is equivalent under these moves to that graph on a torus, to that graph, wherever it may live. And the rigid vertices, this means your equivalence class. I have to check something. I have to check something here. Your edges are only strings, they're not ribbons. I'm not using ribbons at the moment. No. So these are the equivalence class of cocks. Right. Okay. Right, so we're just talking about the abstract equivalence class. Yeah, the word for graphs up to this equivalence is called COGS. So those are Those are graphs where you have kept the cyclic order around the vertices, but replaced all the ribbons by straights. Yeah, I get that, but I think he allows every rotation system. No, not here. Not here, because I can't get with this one eye star move, I can't get to any rotation system. I can only get to the reflections. I can only get the reflections. Five star, yes, that's the reflection. Five stars. Yes, no, that's what I said. So five star is all graphs, and we're going to buy in the discussion. But now notice that if I made a device like this, then in here it might have a little gearing that would allow it to rotate. And then you see this side could pick up rating in that way. If you wanted to make a device that would allow, If you wanted to make a device that would allow you to braid any two lines, that would be harder to manufacture. As I was saying, out of a topological vertex, you can add or subtract any amount of braiding because you see a braid just comes up to the vertex and has a twist. You can get rid of that twist. Then there's another and another, and all the braiding goes away, or all the braiding comes. So, talk about. So, topological vertices absorb or emit grades to their heart's content. So, for example, this graph, which you might think ought to be a knotted graph, is topological, with a topological vertex, is not a knotted graph, because the little bit of gradient that you see going around there just gets absorbed by the vertex. On the other hand, I'll show you in a moment that this is knotted as a rigid vertex graph. So let's first talk a little bit about the topological method. Topological method that I can use to find out about something about the embedding of one of these guys is to go to a vertex and unplug one of the edges. So for example, I've unplugged the top edge, and I can throw that one away if I want to. It's just an unknotted curve. But the other one is a knotted curve. But the other one is a knotted curve. And so, what happened? What I've actually shown when I did that unplugging is that sitting inside this graph is a knot. There's a knot embedded inside the graph. And then you can think of it that way. When you move the graph around topologically, the knot will be moved around, but you won't be doing anything to it that's bad. You keep it topologically knotted just as it was here. Here. And therefore, that knot is telling you that this graph is knotted. So you can find out about topological graphs by unplugging the vertices and seeing. You won't find everything about them, but you'll find something. Here's a chart with some examples. The one at the top isn't telling us anything at all. The one at the next one is a pair of eyeglasses where the eyeglasses are linked. And as you see, if I unplug the See, if I unplug the horizontal one, I get a link. And that's telling me that it is different from just an ordinary pair of eyeglasses. Here's an unknotted theta graph, and here's a knotted theta graph, which is knotted for the same reason it was before. And here's an exercise that you can do to check that this makes sense. You want to see that if you did all possible unpluggings at a given node, and then you did a tweak. Node, and then you did a twist of that node since we're talking about topological, then combinatorially you get exactly the same set of configurations that you did before. So you can check things combinatorially, and sometimes that's good for your confidence or good for some other reasons having to do with invariance. But the general argument was, very simple, that if you do a topological move, it won't affect the things that happen after you. The things that happen after you've unplugged them. They'll still be moving around topologically. So that's unplugging. On the other hand, with rigid vertex graphs, as we said, when you do that move, you're just rotating the rigid disk there by 180 degrees. And that means that if you think of it as a black box containing not necessarily just a crossing, maybe something more complicated, a tangle. Something more complicated, a tangle, a tangle being any weaving at all that's connected to the four ends. Then, when you turn it by 180 degrees, you get something that's topologically equivalent to what you had before. You just hold on to the ends and rotate it back. So, that means that if I were to take my graph and insert into some of the black boxes various tangles, then Various tangles, then the topological class of the resulting link or not would be moving along just in parallel to whatever I did to the graph. So that means that you can say, if you like, that the corresponding link that you make by inserting tangles is an invariant of the graph. Simplest example is inserting a crossing. Inserting a crossing, and as you see, when I rotated it, two of these cancel, and you get the same crossing back that you started with. So, what are some examples of that? Well, we can go back to this guy and insert the right crossing. I insert that crossing, and I get a trefoil knot. So, that means that no matter what I do to this graph, I will always have a trefoil knot over here if I make that insertion. If I make that insertion. And therefore, that graph couldn't possibly be turned into the one we were thinking about, which one we were thinking about and didn't write, which looks like that. And certainly, if you inserted a crossing in that, it would be unknotted. So you can't get from here to there because of the knot. Of course, you have to choose the right insertion. If I had The right insertion. If I had inserted the other crossing, then this would be an unknotted trefoil. And if I had done it this way, then it would be an unknotted curve. But on the other hand, if I inserted this way, then you, oops, this one's horizontally smoothing, like that. Oh, I see. I didn't realize I had drawn it wrong, but I felt wrong. I meant to draw, of course, the horizontal smoothing. Course, the horizontal smoothing. And then you get a link. And the link is also telling us that the graph is non-trivial. So various insertions will tell you something. And insertions are quite powerful, as far as I can tell, for discriminating graphs from one another. How powerful, I don't know. Now, if you want to make invariants, you can do the following. You can say, oh, okay, I'm going to write a linear. Okay, I'm going to write a linear combination of all the different insertions that I'm interested in. Now, there are infinitely many that you can choose, but I chose horizontal and vertical smoothing and crossings of the two types, and I gave them some coefficients. And in this case, just to show you what the technique is like, I'm going to have to give them the same coefficient because I made no discrimination of orientation on that note. And then I say, okay, now I'll apply an invariant to this big collection of linear combination of graphs that I get. I'll get a large linear combination of resolved graphs, a linear combination of links. And I have an invariant of links, some invariant, say the Jones polynomial. And I apply the Jones polynomial to each of those links and add up those Jones polynomials. And I will have an invariant of the graph, a polynomial. Of the graph, a polynomial type invariant of the graph. You can use any invariant you like. For example, you might use the bracket polynomial model for the Jones polynomial. But I'm going to stick with geometric insertions and not worry you in this short talk about polynomial invariance. So now I want to talk about adding a formalism that we think of as a bond like this. As a bond like this. So I'm going to take the vertex and I'm going to open it up and draw a bond in between the two ends. So you can think of this as an actual bond. You started folding some long molecule and you ended up bonding in these various places. And usually you're thinking of the bond as some local bond, and you may be thinking of it as rigid, in fact, but from the point of view But from the point of view of what we want to do, and that's where I'm referring to Yannis Diamantis and Sophia Lambra-Kuel in the collaboration that this is. We want to think of local bonds and long bonds and knotted bonds, whether it makes any sense or not physically, and stretched bonds and bonds that might contract, all of that. All of that, and then what would it mean mathematically? Well, that's what's nice about going to that level of generality. Mathematically, it just means that I'm looking at a trivalent graph. I have trivalent vertices. Some of the edges are labeled bonds. That's it. And topologically, I'm going to either think of these as rigid or topological. However, I'll give you a caveat on that in a moment. Okay? In a moment. Okay? So I could have topological nodes. So those nodes can be topological. And that means that when you have a bond, you can do a topological twist here, or you can do a topological twist at the other end. But now I want to explain what I mean by a rigid bond. And so I'll think of this as a rigid vertex, and then I'm allowed to do this 180-degree turn. 180-degree turn, like that. And I'm not necessarily allowed to do the other 180-degree turn. And furthermore, if I have a very long bond like this one, then if it's a rigid bond, if I want to twist it here, that gets transmitted and it has to get twisted at the other end as well. Okay? And then you see that. And then you see that those are rigid but non-local bonds, and we can have a theory of graphs with rigid but non-local bonds. And that's kind of interesting to see what will happen there. So the first theorem, first lemma is every R V rigid vertex long bond graph is equivalent to a graph with only local bonds. Proof. You just take your finger and push along here. Push along here until this is short. And if you're thinking ribbon, by the time I have told you that it's rigid, you could actually model that by putting a ribbon in there to keep track of the twisting if you wanted to. But I have to do this carefully as though it were flat in the plane with a ribbon and just parallel cut it all the way over. Parallel cut it all the way over to the other end and contract the bond in that way. Okay? So everybody is local if they want to be. An example would be this guy here, and I contract him over there, and then I decide that it's rigid, and I want to do a rigid vertex invariant, and I decide to, in fact, insert just a parallel smoothing like that. Moving like that, and I see that I get something that's knotted. And I look at it a little bit more carefully, and I see that it's a trephile knot with an extra linking component. And in this case, that's kind of amusing, the example, because what I did over here, inserting here, is exactly the same as if I had inserted the parallel smoothing directly into the long box. Directly into the long bond, which would be the same as doing what I did, as you see. So that's an example. Here are a couple more examples. We have five minutes. Here's a forgetting the term. Pseudonomic, right. Bonding. And we want to show that it's non-trivial. We want to show that it's non-trivial, or at least find out something about its topology. I'm in the rigid category. I make one insertion of something a little more complicated, that little two twists in a row. And if I do it with that one, as you see, I'm getting a trephile knot. If, on the other hand, I took this one, which I wish to discriminate from that one, and I make exactly the same insertion. Insertion, then I get a link of three components. So they're very definitely different. Okay, now again, this depended on making the right choice. If I had chosen an opposite one, I might have gotten a non-not up there. If I had chosen smaller, but we'll see in the next slide, or almost the next slide, what would happen if I did some other examples. Would happen if I did some other examples. But here's another pseudonym, but it's got a twist in the middle, like that. And if I make the exact same insertion that I made before, you see that I now have an alternating knot over here, which is a more complicated alternating knot than the Trefol knot. So this one is definitely not equivalent to the this one is definitely equivalent to the equivalent This one is definitely not equivalent to the one on the top. Now, how do you know that? At that point, you might want to be referring to a knot theory book or calculating an invariant, but it is a fact that you can find in knot theory that if you have an alternating knot and it doesn't have any extra twisting in it, then it's definitely non-trivial. And the least number of crossings in Number of crossings in any representation of it is equal to the number of crossings. So I know that this nut is not a trephoil because it has more than three crossings. But you might calculate an invariant. It depends on what you want to do. Here's the large question about this. I can take bonded rigid vertex graphs and some chosen tangles and map to knots and lengths. So given two bonded graphs, Two bonded graphs such that they're not equivalent, does there exist a choice of tangle insertions so that the corresponding tangle-inserted Gs are topologically distinct? In general, I don't know. You can look at some small examples to see part of the problem. Take the one we were looking at before. This isn't quite large enough, but if I only inserted this left-handed crossing, This left-handed crossing, then I get an unlink. If I only insert the right-handed crossing, I get an unlink. But if I insert a right-handed and a left-handed, then I get a link. And that's good. That's my collection. I'm taking a collection of tangles and doing an insertion. And that last one proves that this guy is non-trivial, but I have to use more than one tangle in order to do it. On the other hand, in the example that I gave you before, In the example that I gave you before, this one, I took a more complicated tangle and I only had to insert one tangle. So it might be that the conjecture is even true with one wonderful tangle doing the job of finding out about those G and G prime. Or their conjecture might be false entirely. So we're going to generalize this in two minutes to bonded nautoids. Bonded notoids. A nautoid is a generalization of a knot where you have two ends, and the ends are not necessarily in the same region. And they're of interest for physical and molecular reasons because you can think of a nontoid as an open-ended curve in space, and maybe it's bonded. And if you choose a projection direction down into a plane and take the parallel lines that go through the end zone, Lines that go through the ends of it, then you end up with what I'm drawing as a nautoid in the plane. And then, if you restrict the motion of the nautoid in the plane so that it's not allowed to slide across the endpoint, then that's the same as letting it move freely in space, but the endpoints have to be on the rails of those two parallel lines. So, this is a way of restricting an open curve in space to move in a certain way. In a certain way, so that we can analyze diagrammatic non-theory in relation to it. And so, this has been taken up by various people. And you can, if you have an open curve in space, project it in a lot of different directions and get a map on the two-dimensional sphere of different kinds of Monterey classes that correspond to it and think about the topology of open curves by doing that. And this is a reference that's related to our work. And you can see how you might start with molecular data, abstract it, project it, and end up like that. And another example from our work. And here's a toy example, and I'll stop. This toy example, you started with a molecule, you ended up with a bonded nontoid, and then Bonded nontoid, and then you did some contraction of bonds and analyze the resulting curve, just like we were doing. And another example would be this one where we have the parallel lines, and you could unplug the parallel lines in the right way to see that there's really a knot there, and that knot is telling you that this notoid in the plane is non-trivial. And if it had a bond in it, you could detect that the bond was. Detect that the bond was actually producing something non-trivial, and there I stopped.
