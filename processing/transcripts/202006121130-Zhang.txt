Along geodesics in last passage percolation. So go ahead. Oh, yeah. Thank you. And thanks for the invitation. And so today I'm going to talk about the work that I am collaborating with my advisor Alan Sly, where again we study the exactly solvable exponential last passage percolation model in the KPD Universality class, which we have seen a lot these days. The problem we look at is the convergence of the empirical. At is the convergence of the empirical distribution along the geodesic. So, this is a problem more or less, I mean, the interest more or less arise from the FPP community where we studied this for the related exactly solvable RPP model. And our arguments use both non-exact solvable geometric arguments while also rely on some results from the integral community. In particular, we would use the local Brownian property and The local Brownian property and also the KPD fixed point. So I will explain this later. Okay, so let's, since I just have 20 minutes, maybe I will be a little bit faster and on very high level stuff. So let's look at this model. So the model we are studying is the two-dimensional lattice, the exact solvable exponential LPP, which you have seen from the Shoshindu's talk yesterday. So for each vertex, you have the IID random variable. IID random variable which has the exponential one distribution. And then the passage times and the geodesics are defined in this very typical way. So that for vertex U and V, where V is in the upper right direction of U, you consider all the directed passes from U to V so that the path can only go up or right. Okay, and for each such path, you sum all the ways along this. You sum all the weights along this path so that you pick the path with a maximum total width and you call that the geodesic. And the passage time from U to V is just the maximum of all this total passage times. Okay, so this is exactly a solvable model, like maybe partially due to its equivalent to TASIP, and it also has this famous 123 KP theory scanning. So I'm just very So, I'm just very quickly listening to the exact solvability of this model, which many of you may have seen in the previous talks this week. So it was first seen that the passage time, if you look at the passage time from 0, 0 to n, it's in the order of 4n, so that it's like 4n plus some new total of n. And then around 2000, following the Even around 2000, following a series of breakthroughs using the RSK correspondence, people managed to identify the fluctuation as in the order of n to the one-third. And after you rescaning, the fluctuation converges weakly, and the limiting object is identified with the GOE trace-Wedden distribution. And then people also study the point-to-line profile, where you fix the lower end point to be 0, 0, and then you allow To be 0, 0, and then you allow the upper end point to vary in the line x plus y equals 2n. So you see that when you fluctuate in the spatial direction, you have this correlation length in the order of n to 2 thirds. And again, the fluctuation is in the order of n to the 1/3, so that you have this rescaling limit after this n to 2 thirds and into 1/3 rescaling converging to the station. Converging to the stationary Ari 2 process is minus surprising. Okay, this is something we have seen a lot this week. Also, we would use that this Ari2 process is absolutely continuous with respect to Brownian motion following the work of Ivan and Alan in the paper of the Bronying Gibbs property of the every line on some things like the every two process is just the top line of the every line. Is just the top line of the every line ensemble. Okay, so another thing that would be useful to us is something that Shuraf has just mentioned, which is the KPZ fixed point. So in our setting, we can just state it as following. So now you allow your lower end point to vary in the line x plus or equal to zero as well. And you also have some general boundary condition f so that you optimize the sum of f. Of f, the function f with this passage time. So you optimize all the lower endpoints, and then you get this passage time with this general initial data. So as long as your general initial data converges in the same rescaning, then this random function also converges, and the limiting object is just a KPZ fixed point, which I have just seen. And in the paper of Mateski-Kosto and the Romanik, they also gave formula. Remaining, they also gave formulas for this object. Okay, so these are just some exactly solvable results that would be useful to us. So, let's go back to the problem that we are studying. So, what we look at is this very local behavior along this geodesic. So, you say you take the geodesic, so that's the maximum weight, the maximum total weight path from 0, 0 to n. From 0, 0 to n, n. And then for the vertex along this geodesic, you look at the constant size neighborhood. Okay, so you just take some fixed non-negative integer s, and then you look at the local neighborhood, like the infinite ball of radius s. So you get some, so you look at all the random fields in that ball, so you get some. So you get some 2s plus 1 square dimension number. Okay. Okay. This is a random number. And then for each that number, you give it a Dirthead measure in the space R to the 2s plus 1 square. And then you look at all these Dirthead measures and then you average over them. So you have like from 0 to N, you have like 2N numbers to 2N. Numbers to two invertices in your geodesic. So you just average over them, then you get the so-called empirical measure of this, which we denote as mu s. Okay, so this empirical measure is just a measure in this space r to the 2s plus 1 squared, while it's also a random measure. Okay. Okay, so the natural question that would arise is the limiting behavior of this. Limiting behavior of this random measure muNS. So, this was more or less from the FPP community where people use this to study the local structure of this geodesic. Where in the FPP, people are interested rather than the longest directed paths, they start more interesting in the shortest path between a pair of vertices. And in general, people study the In general, people study the general weak case. So, in general, in FPP, there is no exactly solvability. So, making this problem more untractable. So, we study the same problem, however, in the directly last passage percolation case. I need to mention that there is also some result by Eric Bates, which very recently will probably also be online shortly that this. Shortly, that this he studies this problem for the FPP case, where he shows that in the FP case for some general family of general weights that this empirical distribution converges. So, in our case, we on the contrary study the specific measure, which like specific weight, which is an exponential weight case in the directed last passive percolation setting. And then we show that the And then we show that the empirical distribution converges weakling probability. So this means that there exists some deterministic measure mu s in this 2s plus 1 square dimensional space such that this measure converges. Weakly probably. So that means that you can take some bounded continuous function f such that the integral of f dμ n s, which is a random variable. Which is a random variable, converges in probability to the integral of f dμ s. So that's a main result of us. So far, any questions about this? So just to make sure I'm clear, so you're looking in the vicinity of the geodesic at the environment that you're seeing, and then you're averaging over the spherical measure. Right, empirical measure, right? Right, right. Okay, does this include the information of just what is the weight, you know, the empirical measure of the weights along the geodesic as well? Yeah, yes, yes. Just to look at the, yeah, that includes the weights around the geodesic as well. So just a local randomness around a vertex in the geodesic, while this local randomness only looks like constant size spots. Like constant size spots. Okay. Is there any question in the chat? Okay. Okay, let me talk about this, some ingredients of the proofs, which might, I don't know, like have something interesting as it reveals some information about the local structure of the geodesic. Okay, so the general idea. Okay, so the general idea is that we show that you have like a symptomic independence. So this is that if you take two vertices along this geodesic, you call them V alpha and V beta. So they are just taken as, okay, you fix some number alpha and beta between 0 and 2. Then you look at the antidiagonal x plus y equal to alpha n and the antidiagonal x plus y equal to beta n. plus y equal to beta, okay, suppose that the intersection with the geodesics are V alpha and V beta respectively, then you want to see that the local randomness around V alpha and the local randomness around V beta are symptomically IID. So what this means, so more formally stating is that you can have some measure psi ns such that this psi ns is independent of alpha. Is independent of alpha, so it's the same no matter like where you look at along this geodesic. While your law of this casine S V alpha is very close to this measure. And also, if you look at two of them, the joint law of them is very close to just two independent copies of this psi and S. Okay, so using this, you have this asymptotic IID, then this means that essentially. This means that essentially, asymptotically, this random measure, this randomness, so the empirical measure is a random measure. So, this means that asymptotically, the randomness disappears. So, like it converges to some this measure of psi ns. While for convergence, you need something slightly more than like the concentration. So, this just is a randomness of disappears, but you also need that the deterministic part also converges. Also convergence. So the next step is to say that okay, this sine ns also converges as n goes to infinity. Okay. Okay, so let's go back to the first step about showing the asymptotic IIDness. So why you have asymptotic IID? Let me ask one question. So are you saying that it doesn't matter which kind of how deep into the geodesic you are? Deep into the geodesic, you are, what the local environment looks like? Yeah, so what do you mean? Sorry, what do you mean by like hot deep? I mean, well, you're looking at alpha and beta, and then you're looking at these local boxes. And what you're saying is that in the vicinity of alpha and beta, locally, it looks the same. Yes, no matter what alpha and beta you take. Locally, they should look at the same. Yeah, and if you take two different alpha and beta, they should be asymptotic. We had this should be asymptotic independent. Okay. So, why you have this asymptotic IIDness? The takeaway message is that you can the very local information around V alpha and the very local information around V beta should rely mostly on some very narrow strips around the line x plus y equal to alpha and x plus y equal to beta. alpha and x plus y equals beta n. So you just take some s alpha to be some strip. So the whites of this strip is some constant times n. While you require that the strip s alpha and s beta to be disjoint. So formally speaking, it says that, okay, condition on all the randomness outside the strip, the law, the local random field around V alpha is close to this psi. This psi NS. So, no matter on what randomness you are conditioned on outside this strip. Well, more rigorously, I will say it's not no matter whatever, it's just it's like with very high probability environment outside this strip, S alpha. Condition on this randomness outside this alpha. This outside S alpha, the local information around V alpha is the same. It's always very close to this Euro, this sum. This some major psi ns, which I will define later. Okay, and so as so this basically says that the local randomness around V alpha mostly depends on the information inside this strip S alpha. And that's the same for the local information around V beta. So as S alpha and S beta are disjoint, then asymptotically in the ship. Then asymptotically they should be, you should have some sort of independence. Okay. Okay, so I guess I have five minutes. So let's look at, so why should this be the case that no matter what your condition are outside the strip, the local information is the same? Okay, so we take a closer look at. We take a closer look at the strip. So, what we do is that we take a narrow strip inside this strip. So, that the narrow strip has wides some delta times and where delta is a very small constant to be determined. And then you look at the so this the boundary is like L minus and L plus around x plus y equal to alpha n. Okay, now you consider the passage time from 0. The passage time from 0, 0 to L minus and the passage time from N to L plus. Linpu, there's a question about what is the width of the strips? So the width of this white strip is like some constant times n. So it's like in the order n. So the white strip, as long as your s alpha and s beta are disjoint, then they are good. So the y's might depend on, so actually the y's might depend on like alpha because if you take alpha and beta together. Like alpha, because if you take alpha and beta to be very close, then the constant needs to be very small, but that's some like technical aspect you can avoid. So, basically, you can think of them as like point one, the strip to be like 0.1 times n. Okay. While this third high is very small, so let's go back. So, if you want to reconstruct the passage time from 0, 0 to n, n, what you do is that you take some u in l minus and w in l plus. L minus and w in L plus, and then you sum the passage time from 0, 0 to U and from U to W, and then you go from W to N. Okay, so you have this, and then you optimize over U and W, then you recover this X 00 by this H minus and H plus, and all the randomness inside between L minus and L plus. Okay, that's it, like condition on this. like condition on this H minus and H plus, you can reconstruct the geodesic between L minus and L plus using the randomness within L minus and L plus. Okay, so for this I would also denote the part of the geodesic between L minus L plus as gamma H minus H plus. Okay, so this is just a zooming picture of why So this is just a zooming picture of what's happening around where the geodesic intersects anti-diagonal. Okay, so the next step is that, okay, we want to replace this H minus and H plus by some universal object. So recall that this H minus and H plus depends on the randomness outside this strip. So we want to replace that by something universal. So the thing that we want to use is that We want to use is that the H minus and H plus are locally brownian. Okay, then that's where we use this exact solvable results. So as you see that the H minus is just a line to point profile from 0, 0 to L minus, and H plus is the line to point profile from 0, 0 to L plus. So each of them converges to the ARIA2 process. However, the Area 2 process has a locally Brownian process. Has a locally Brownian property, which we have seen a lot these days. So basically, this is that H minus and H plus are locally Brownian. While we need something slightly stronger, so we won't say that even if you condition on all the randomness outside this strip, the H minus and H plus are still locally brownie. Okay, for that, I would use KPZ fixed point formulas for this, but possibly we can also use something else like what should I have. Something else like what Shurap has just mentioned about the local Brownian property of the PPD fixed point. Okay, so to be more specific, we studied what's happening around the arcmax of this H minus and H plus. So this should be, we would expect that to be very similar to what's happening around the argmax of the sum of two independent Brownian motions. That said, you can replace H minus and H. H minus and H plus around arcmax of this in this small box by some B minus and B plus, so that the sum of them is a 3D basial process, and the difference of them is an independent Brownian motion. So that's basically, if you take two independent Brownian motion around the argmax of them, it's locally look like this thing. So that the sum of them is like a 3D baseless and difference of them is an independent Brunier motion. So we say that, okay, here around the Argma. you see that okay here around the argmax of h minus plus h plus the h minus and h plus are also similar to that object so that you can replace this h minus and h plus by this b minus and b plus okay so then there is also some like something which we call the stability of this so if you so we have shown that this h minus h plus is very close to something some universal object b minus and b plus where you replace it you you still need some You replace it, you still need some stability result, which says that if you replace the boundary conditions, the geodesic does not change much. But I do not have time to dive much into that. But the take-home message is that, okay, now you can say that with high probability, this gamma H minus H plus largely overlaps with gamma H B minus, gamma B minus B plus. So by largely overlap, I mean that when you are Overlap, I mean that when you are close to the inter, like the end, you can fluctuate a bit, but in the bulk, they are like with hyperability the same. So this is that with hyperability, the intersection of gamma H minus H plus with X plus Y equal to alpha N is the same as the intersection between gamma B minus B plus with X plus Y equal to alpha N. Recall that gamma H minus H plus is just the part of the geodesic. The part of the geodesic between L minus and plus this is just V alpha. So basically, we say that V alpha can be just replaced by some. So the law of V alpha, I mean the local information around V alpha can be replaced by this local information of something that we construct, where B minus and B plus is something that depends only on N and S. It's independent of all this Randomness that you condition outside the strip, and it's even independent of alpha. So you get. We should try to wrap it up soon. Okay, okay. Sorry. Yeah, so maybe just the last slide, like so we want to show the convergence. So for completeness, like as we have the symptomic IDNIs, but we still need the convergence of this psi NS. Well, what we do is that we fix some large Take some large fixed M and then we just cover the geodesic from 0, 0 to unknown with a family of lens M geodesics so that for the vertex along the geodesic from 0 to unknown, like it's very likely to be also a geodesic, it's very likely to be also in some lens M geodesic. So this gives that the psi N S is very close to your psi M S and then this gives you And then this gives you the coverages. Yep, sorry for not on time. Yeah, and sorry, any questions? Thank you very much.
