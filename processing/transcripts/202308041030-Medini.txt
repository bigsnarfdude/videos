Okay. Okay. Thanks to the organizers for inviting me. Thanks to you for listening to my talk. And all of this is joint work with Soltan Vidnyansky. Okay, let's start with preliminaries. All spaces will be separable. All spaces will be separable and metrizable. Space is homogeneous if for every pair of points there's a homeomorphism sending one to the other. It is a classical notion that has been well studied. And a space is strongly homogeneous if all its clop and subspaces are homeomorphic to each other, and so to the whole space. And we'll talk more about this. A space is rigid if it has at least two points, so we avoid trivialities. And the holy omeomorphism of the space is the identity. And now the topic of this talk, which you could have easily predicted, I imagine, is sigma homogeneity, which just means you are the union of countably many homogeneous subspaces. Many homogeneous subspaces. Well, everybody knows what a Borel set is, but a Borel space is a tiny bit harder, but it's just a space that's homeomorphic of a Borel subspace of some Polish space. And you can similarly define an analytic space and a co-analytic space. Of course, this is not really needed for analytic, but. Needed for analytic, but for co-analytic, you have to say something like this. Then we will say that a space is C-crowded if it's non-empty, and all of its non-empty open subsets have size continuum. And finally, we will say that a space is nowhere P, where P is some topological property. Topological property if it is non-empty and no non-empty open subset of X has this property. Asking that X is non-empty is just to make things easier technically. One more preliminary, two more preliminaries. There's this lemma of Terrada, which says that to be strongly homogeneous, you just You just need to have a pie base consisting of Lopen sets that are homeomorphic to the whole space. And another lemma, which now it's a joke, I start every one of my talks with this, it's that the name strongly homogeneous is appropriate. And remember that I included zero-dimensional in the definition of strongly homogeneous. And the proof is a picture, right? We want to send X to Y. So we fix a nice nested Kloppen base at X. First countability would be enough. We do the same at Y. But now these two guys are homeomorphic because all Copen sets are homeomorphic. Same of these two guys. And now you see where I'm going. You just And now you see where I'm going. You just swap all of them, leave every point outside of the circles fixed, and send x to y and y to x. There's your homeomorphism. Beautiful. Okay, now a few words about the axioms. This is probably not needed, so I'll be quick. AD is the axiom of determinacy, means that every game is determined, so one of the two players has a winning strategy. Players have a winning strategy. Oops. DC is the principle of dependent choices. If you have a binary relation such that for every point there's something below, then you actually have a descending sequence. And a couple of things about these axioms. The set-theoretic universe is extremely regular under AD, so it is incompatible with the axiom of choice. With the axiom of choice, because it allows to construct pathological sets. And DC lies in between full choice and countable choice in strength. Zf plus DC plus determinants is consistent if you assume large cardinals. And DC is sufficient to carry out every recursion of length omega that you want. Omega that you want. In fact, fun fact, it's equivalent to Bayer category theorem for completely metrizable spaces. And then a big theorem for Borel determinants, you don't need any extra assumptions. So now from now on, we will be working in ZF plus independent choices. So we cannot do the usual transfinite recursion. Okay, and an established pattern in set theory goes as follows. You have some property. Every Borel set has this property. Under AD, all sets have this property. And usually, but crucially, not always, these two things are proved in essentially the same way. Under AC, there's a count. Under AC, there's a counterexample to this property. And under V equals L, you have a definable counterexample, which is usually coanalytic. And the classical regularity property are the most famous instance of this pattern. So perfect set property, Lebesgue measurability, and bare property. More entertaining examples are not being a Hamel basis and not being an ultra filter. This is weird, like. Filter. This is weird. Like we are defining not being extremely ugly as a regular, as a beauty property in a way. And in my latest paper, I do this for Afros group, while the positive part was due to Jan van Mil. This talk is about P equals sigma homogeneity in the context of zero-dimensional spaces. So, I'm going to try to give you a bit of an introduction to wage theory, which is interesting in its own right, hopefully. Given a collection of subsets of a set, we define the gamma check as the set of complements of the sets in gamma. And if gamma and gamma check are equal, the set the class is self-dual and the delta. And the delta is simply the intersection of gamma with its check. And in his PhD thesis, Wage defined this reduction, which is the most natural reduction you can think of for topological complexity. Right? You have an ambient space Z, and you say that A is reducible to B if there's a continuous functions that sends points in A. That sends points in A to points of B and points outside of A to points outside of B. We will say that A is wage-reducible to B and that F witnesses the reduction. If you have a space, you define A down arrow as the collection of things that are below A in this order, of course. And a wage class. And a wage class is exactly a set in this form, and a set if self-dual if the wage class is self-dual. First examples, and the wage class works really, really well if you have for uncountable zero-dimensional Pauli spaces. Then you've got everything you could possibly want. Well, the trivial example are these two singletons. Trivial example are these two singletons. Then you have the Klopen sets, and the generator is just an arbitrary proper Klopen set. And then let's look at the classical Borel classes. Recall that they have a universal set that means a subset of the product with the counter set, for example, such that the collection of all vertical sets. The collection of all vertical sections is the collection of all sigma zero q sets. Well, this is going to be your generator, right? And claiming that this is a waste class, and this is going to be your, and of course, there's a little problem that this is not z, right? Two to the omega times z is not the space we want, but this can be overcome with a bit of machinery. With a bit of machinery. This is still the main idea. And the same goes for the projective classes as above. So let me give you a picture, which at this point looks a lot like the classical Borel hierarchy, but it's much more complicated. For example, this question mark is not a single guy, and the higher you And the higher you go, the more complicated it gets, because there's this accrued interest phenomenon where the more classes you have at your disposal, the more you can use them to construct ever more exotic waste classes. Let me say more about the question marks. These are the difference hierarchy, which is defined as follows. Well, the one difference is the set. Well, the one difference is the set itself, not super interesting. The two difference is the difference, still not super interesting. The three difference is the first one minus the difference of the other two. And then you keep going like that with a distinction. You behave in different ways when you're at odd and even stages. And you keep going like this. You keep going like this, and then you can define a class which is the collection of all these differences for a fixed eta when applied to an increasing collection of sigma zero C sets. These are also weight classes, and for C equals one, they are exactly. They are exactly the they feel exactly the question marks in the slides before in fact there's a general theorem of Hausdorff and Kuratowski that says that the successor deltas are the union of the corresponding differences. But it doesn't mean that they are the only wage classes. Once eta is bigger than one, no one's Than one, no, once C is bigger than one, you actually have more complicated classes in between. And why do we need determinacy? Well, there's wage lemma, which might not say much when you see it like this, but it was kind of the stroke of genius because it brought gains into what wage was trying to do. Trying to do and therefore links with determinancy. And I think wage theory exploded from that point on. Two simple applications, though, are that anti-chains in the posit of all wage classes have size at most two, which looks a lot like they are the non-self-dual pair in the picture before. And also, if you have a properly gamma set, so it's in gamma but not in. Set, so it's in gamma but not in gamma check, then it actually generates all of gamma. Another very important fact is that this posit is well-founded. In fact, a lot of proofs of wage theoretic stuff begins with saying take a minimal wage class with such a property and so on. So you can define a wage rank. And actually, if you And actually, if you identify the non-self-dual pairs, you get a well-order. And the length of this well-order is a famous ordinal analysis of self-dual wage classes. We have this operation of partition union, which is very important in wage theory, and you, if you have. And if you have sets in gamma, instead of just taking the union, you want to take a sort of tame union along this partition of the Vns, which has to have complexity, bounded complexity. And the interesting for c equals zero, there's an important result that An important result that explains how self-dual classes look like. And namely, they are all partitioned unions of some non-self-dual classes of lower complexity, an accountable collection of them. And for example, this shows already that if you have a wage class of some uncountable, Of some uncountable where the rank is an ordinal of uncountable cofinality, then it must be no subdu, otherwise, it would contradict this. And now, let's just stare at a pair of socks for a couple minutes. What did you say? No, I'm not weird. You are weird. No, this is actually tied into the talk. Tied into the talk miraculously. And it's the pair of socks problem. Right. Essentially, how can we distinguish gamma from gamma check? There seems to be no obvious way to do it. Except that in this world, we have van Wese-Ben Skiel, who gave a very elegant solution to this problem. Problem. So recall that a collection of gamma has a separation property. This is a purely set-theoretic thing that if whenever you have two disjoint sets in gamma, then you can separate them with C in the corresponding delta. The easiest example of this is, right, if you have a pair of disjoint closed sets in a zero-dimensional space, you can separate them with a clopen set. Separate them with a clopping set. Well, this is the ultimate version of that. It turns out actually that under AD, for every non-soft dual-wage class, exactly one of gamma and gamma check has the separation property. And this is not a collaboration. I think Van Bese proved at most one, and Steele proved at least one. Least one has the separation property. And the way in which we apply this is quite funny because we do not care at all about what the separation properties say. We just need a way to choose without using the axiom of choice. So there it is. A little more steel. It's a very nice result that allows us to make the considerable. Allows us to make the considerable jump from having the same complexity to being homeomorphic. And as far as I know, it is at the heart of all topological applications of wage theory. Which makes sense because topology is about being homeomorphic and wage theory is about complexity. And we will say that gamma is reasonably closed for every For every well-look, robot robot. Any questions? This is an ad hoc notion, which I don't want to define. It's a bit too, it wouldn't be very enlightening, let's say. But if you have classes of that kind and you have two subsets of the Cantor set that are either both commeager or both meager, and for all basic. For all basic Kloppen sets have exactly the same complexity, and that complexity were restricted to the Kloppen set. It turns out they are homeomorphic. So there's a homeomorphism of the counter set sending one to the other. One acute example of this, for example, Example of this. For example, you can prove that the infinite power of the rationals is homeomorphic to the space of elements of bare space that converge to infinity as a sequence of natural numbers. And the complexity class in question is pi 03. It's still not completely trivial, but it's certainly nicer than finding an explicit homeomorphism. Finding an explicit homeomorphism between these two guys. And now let's talk about homogeneous spaces, which were classified by van Engelen in his remarkable PhD thesis at the Borel zero-dimensional homogeneous Borel spaces. And he discovered that this class, which we will call simply delta, is the fundamental dividing line. Fundamental dividing line. I will speak more about this. For example, above delta, Steele's theorem can be converted into a uniqueness theorem of this classification, which in its general version is a joint work with Rafael Carwal and Sandra Müller. And it says that if you have two zero-dimensional homogeneous spaces of complexity higher than delta, Complexity higher than delta, and they are either both bare or both meager, and they have exactly the same complexity in the sense of wage theory, then guess what? They are homeomorphic. We will actually not need this theorem because we will need to go back to Steele's theorem, but hey, it seemed fitting. What happens below delta? What happens below delta? So let me start by stating some classical characterization in slightly weird ways. This due to Sierpinski, X is homeomorphic to the rational, if and only if it's countable and nowhere singleton. This means it's crowded, right? X is homeomorphic to the Candor set if and only if it's compact and If and only if it's compact and nowhere countable. I think this is Alexandro Furizon, just like this one. A little less known, Q times the counter set, if and only if you are sigma compact, but nowhere compact and nowhere countable. This is maybe Brower. Bear space is just. Bear space is just complete, is characterized by being complete, but nowhere compact. This is due to Jan van Mill. The Rational Stand Bear space is strongly sigma-complete, means the union of countably many closed complete subspaces, nowhere complete and nowhere sigma-compact. And this thing goes. And this thing goes on. Actually, Van Dawen and Van Meer made one more step in this direction by defining the spaces T and S, and it gets a bit comical. For example, S is complete union sigma compact, but nowhere sigma compact and nowhere complete union countable. I mean, it gets a bit ridiculous. But the nice thing is that van Engelen completed this line of research. Completed this line of research by going all the way, and there are omega-many steps. And these spaces are precisely the zero-dimensional homogeneous one of complexity below delta. And more precisely, he defined these properties. I will not define them, but for example, the first ones are being a single. The first ones are being a singleton, compact, countable, sigma-compact, and so on. And then he defined a class of spaces with the following properties for each one of these properties that are just like in the previous theorem, they are characterized by having one of these properties and being nowhere p. Nowhere P for all the properties that are before in that order. And the remarkable thing about these classes is that up to homeomorphism, they contain exactly one element, which happens to be strongly homogeneous. So this is the below delta classification. And this is a picture. And this is a picture of how it looks like. And let me point out one important distinction with the other case is that, well, let's look at the rationals and the rationals times the counterset. They are both meager. They have exactly the same complexity, which is being sigma-compact. And they are no simpler than that, but they're clearly not homeomorphic. So you see, the situation is very different from the still theorem type situation. Okay. So now we can start talking about the positive result. Talking about the positive result. All of this was inspired by a result of Alexei Ostrovsky, who proved that every zero-dimensional Borel space is sigma-homogeneous. He used the techniques of an Engelen thesis, which are based in a 1983 paper of Louveau that classifies Borel wage classes. And I say it's somewhat impenetrable. I've said harsher things in my private life. Things in my private life. But the key point is that using still Louvaux work, but it's unpublished book, it's possible to extend these techniques beyond the Borel realm. And this is what we did with Raphael and Sandra. And we use these techniques here. So the theorem is that under AD, every zero-dimensional space is sigma. Every zero-dimensional space is sigma-homogeneous. And the idea is to associate to every subspace of the counterset a strongly homogeneous clopping subspace, making sure that if the subspace is non-empty, then HC, which stands for homogeneous cloppin, will also be non-empty. Empty. And another corollary, this is not a corollary of the theorem. Sorry, this is a corollary of what I just told you. There are no zero-dimensional rigid spaces under AD because of this HC, right? If you have a homogeneous clop and subspace, then you're not homogeneous. So let's assume that this HC. So let's assume that this HC has been defined and let's prove the theorem that every space is sigma homogeneous. So we define a derivative of sorts starting from X, which will be our X 0. And then at the successor stage, we remove the homogeneous clop and subspace. And at limit stages, of course, we take the Limit stages, of course, we take the intersection. Now, this is a sequence of closed subsets of X. This is a separable metrizable space, so this sequence must stabilize at some countable ordinal. Let's call it delta. And we notice that x delta will be empty. Otherwise, Otherwise, we would take a chunk off using HC. But now we are basically done. Actually, we are done because it means that X is the union of the HC of X alpha for alpha smaller than delta, which is countable. So we have shown actually something significantly stronger. X is the union of countable. X is the union of countably many, pairwise disjoint, strongly homogeneous, and closed subspaces. And notice that this has nothing to do with homogeneity, right? As soon as you can prove a little lemma that gives you the HC for the property you care about, you will have proved that every zero-dimensional space is sigma your property, right? Right. And the coffee cup is a homage to Ken Kyun. So, how do we construct KHC? The idea is simple. Just take an empty Kloppen subspace of minimal complexity. Making it rigorous is a bit painful, but I'll try to say a little more using the stuff. More using the stuff that I explained. Let's start by fixing a well order of the Kloppen sets of the counter set. Okay, the case x equal empty is trivial. We simply set hc equals empty. And now, as my algebra professor would say, we are 50% done. The case two is the low complexity case. If x is a non-empty open surface of complexity below delta, well, then we pick the minimal property of that form, such that for some Kloppen subset, the Kloppen subset intersects FX, of course, and it has that. Course, and it has that property, and then you simply define HC to be that intersection for the minimal clop and set, like that. Remember, we need to be specific in our constructions. It is clear that this guy is clopen and non-empty, and by van Engelen's theorems, it will be. Van Engelen's theorems, it will belong to the class corresponding to that property. And he tells us that it is strongly homogeneous. So case two is done as well. And the hardest case is the high complexity case where x is nowhere delta. Still, we have the Martin-Monk theorem. We have the Martin-Monk theorem saying that the hierarchy is well-founded, so we can pick the minimal wage class such that for sample open subset, same thing as before, but we have belonged to gamma instead of having the property. And now we use the weird thing about the pair of socks. It could be that both gamma and gamma check are both acceptable choices. So pick the one that has the separation. So, pick the one that has the separation property. And then, as before, HC is going to be that Kloppen set, the minimal Kloppen set like that, intersected with X. Plus, we also want that this Kloppen set either intersects X in a meager space or in a bare space. But of course, this is no problem because if you are not barely speaking, This is no problem because if you are not bare, you can find a Kloppen subset that is meager. That's actually the definition of not being bare. Clearly, this will be Klopen and non-empty. And using Steele's theorem and Terrada's lemma, it is not hard to see that it's strongly homogeneous. Maybe I can say more. Remember Still's theorem. We will apply to this Klopen set and to another Kloppen set of HC. So they have to have the same bear category and the same complexity. Same bear category is easy because if you're a clop and subset of a bear space, then your bear. Of a bear space, then you're bare, and if you're clopen subset of a meager, then you're meager. The complexity, well, follows from minimality, right? Certainly taking clopen subsets does not increase the complexity. But if you decrease the complexity, then you would contradict minimality. And so, there we go, we can apply Steele's theorem. Terrada's lemma is simply because. Terrada's lemma is simply because we haven't checked all clopen subsets. We only checked the ones that come from basic open in the counter set. So we need to do one more step. The technically demanding part is the one that I censored before, right? It is to prove that this is reasonably closed. So, more coffee for us. And that was the positive result. Now I promised you a counterexample in ZFC. And observe that if we were to define hereditarily rigid in a naive way, we would get something very silly because as soon as you have a discrete subspace with at least two points, you're not rigid anymore. You're not rigid anymore. Or if you have copies of the rationals, fail. It turns out that a small tweak yields an interesting notion, hopefully, which is that of C hereditarily rigid that asks that the space is C crowded and every C crowded subspace is rigid. So we require rigidity only for some special. Rigidity only for some special subspaces. And the theorem is that there exists such a space in ZFC. Zero-dimensional. And the corollary is that there's a zero-dimensional space that is not sigma-homogeneous. And I'm sure you'd be able to figure out the proof, but let me tell you anyway. Tell you anyway. The examples are the same. Just assume that you're assume that this C hereditarily rigid space is the union of countably many homogeneous subspaces, then one of them will have to have size continuum. But if you have a homogeneous space of size continuum, then it must be C-crowded. Crowded because if you had an open set of size less than continuum, you could move it around by homogeneity, and there you go, you no longer have size continuum. You extract the countable subcover and you're done. So we get the corollary, but how do we prove the theorem? Well, the theorem is surprisingly. Surprisingly easy to prove. Actually, if you ask me what's your recommended proof of a rigid zero-dimensional space, I would tell you this one. We actually started trying to be fancy boys and using elementary sub-models and weird stuff, but in the end, we just scraped off all the junk. And the proof is very, shall I say, elegant? I probably shouldn't. They probably shouldn't. It will be enough to construct a subspace of the counter set that has size continuum and such that every C-crowd subspace is rigid, because then you can simply take a C-crowded subspace of X and you're going to be done. So, very classical thing to do. I enumerate all homeomorphisms of the G-delta subsets of the counterset, making sure that the Making sure that the first one is the identity. The zeroth one is the identity. And the construction is simply peak x alpha such that it's different from all the pre-images of the previous points for small homeomorphisms, small index, a smaller index. A smaller index, and it's also different from the images of previous points under those homeomorphisms. And in the end, set X to be the collection of all X alphas. Doesn't get any simpler than that. Our choice of X0 guarantees that we have size at least continuum, size continuum, because they are different from all the previous ones, right? ones, right? And how do we verify? Assume that you have a C-crowded subspace of X and a homeomorphism of it. We need to prove it the identity. By Lavrentier's lemma, we can extend it to a homeomorphism of G delta, so it will have been enumerated. And it will be enough to show that H will be the identity on X alpha. The identity on X alphas within X sufficiently big. Why? Because S is C crowded. So the set of points for which it's not the identity, after you remove it, will leave you still a dense set. And so if you're the identity on a dense set, you'll be the identity. And this is what I just said. So fix some alpha bigger than delta and let be its image. Let x beta its image. We will show that beta is equal to alpha by proving that all other cases are impossible. Case beta bigger than alpha is impossible by construction because alpha is smaller than beta and therefore. Smaller than beta, and delta is smaller than alpha, so it's also smaller than beta, so no good. And the other case, it's the same, but with the inverse, because in this case, beta will be smaller than alpha, and delta will also be smaller than alpha. So I don't think it gets any simpler than that as a proof. And if you are a little more careful, notice we didn't use. Careful, notice we didn't use anything about the codomain of our homeomorphism, so we proved something stronger, which, of course, in a burst of great creativity, we decided to call strongly C orderly rigid. And that means that the space is C-crowded, and the only homeomorphisms between C-crowded subspaces are the identity. Identity. And of course, since we are a bit psychotic, as soon as we make this definition, we ask the question: is there a space to strongly, hereditarily rigid, but not hereditarily, sorry, hereditarily rigid, but not strongly? And now, a quote that we can all agree on: obviously, if you're a topologist studying computability, Studying computability is a complete waste of time. Wrong, very wrong, total disaster. And in fact, to construct the counterexample under V equals L, we will use some computability. So let me tell you the story. There's a famous paper by Arnie Miller in which he Barney Miller, in which he sketches a method for constructing coanalytic versions of the classical pathological sets, just like Gödel's coanalytic set without perfect set property. But the paper is not easily readable by dum-dums like me. But thank God, our friend Zalton, in his PhD thesis, I think, gave us a black box version. Gave us a black box version, which is usable by humans. And right, you, you yes, and it can be used to prove this little lemma, which gives us a coanalytic subset of bare space with these properties. It is dense and C crowded. And C crowded. So it's C dense, if you wish. And every element is self-constructible, which I will explain in a second. And it satisfies this thing that I will refer to as the injectivity condition, which means if two points in X are different, then their omega 1 will be different. So what the hell am I talking about? So, what the hell am I talking about? Omega 1 of x is the smallest ordinal not computable from x. And you've probably heard about omega 1 CK, which is of course named after comedian Louis CK. And it's this thing when x equals the 0, 0, 0 element of bear space. And x is self-constructed. An X is self-constructible if it belongs to L relative to its omega 1. Now I don't have much intuition about this, but it works like a chart. Another lemma. So, this computability property turned out to have nice topological consequences. In fact, if In fact, if X is as in the previous lemma and Y is its complement, then we get that X and Y are C crowded. X is strongly C hereditarily rigid, and therefore it's not sigma homogeneous with the same proof I gave a couple minutes ago. Y is also rigid, but it's not C here. But it's not C hereditarily rigid. And there's a very easy reason for the second part, actually. Y is not homogeneous. We would like to prove that Y is not sigma homogeneous, but we were only able to prove that it's not sigma homogeneous with Borel witnesses. And here I mean relatively Borel in Y. In Y. And so we have this theorem in particular that there exists a zero-dimensional coanalytic space that it's not sigma-homogeneous. And also we have sort of an updated version of another theorem of an Engel Miller and Steele from the same paper as before that. Before that constructed analytic and co-analytic examples of zero-dimensional rigid space, right? We are sort of more precise in a way. Okay, well, let's let's use those conditions. Let's see how the proof works. First, a useful claim, which will be this condition star. Should be this condition star. If you have any two subsets of bare space and a homeomorphism without fixed point, then the points in X that will stay in X are at most countable. So there's some explosion going on. Wouldn't know how to describe it. Well, we want to. Well, we want to prove this. So, assume that H is a homeomorphism like that, and assume that that set is uncountable. We want to prove that the homeomorphism has a fixed point. So, as always, Lavrentyev's lemma allows us to extend it to a homeomorphism between G deltas. And the point is that this H tilde is essentially a real. A real so it will be coded in some L delta for some countable ordinary. But by the injectivity condition, remember if x and y are different, the omega ones will be different. So they will push them high enough so that we can find one with omega. Find one with omega one bigger than delta because this set is uncountable. Right? And remember that all elements of x are self-constructible, so they belong to the corresponding L. Now set y equal to the image of x and observe that y belongs to the image of the image of the image and observe that y belongs to the same l because h tilde become because belongs to belongs to that l so if you have the function you also have the image but now the omega one of x does not belong to the corresponding l is just a general fact about l alpha doesn't belong to fact about L alpha doesn't belong to L alpha and therefore it's not it's not computable from Y because if it were then it would also belong to it right L C is computability but omega one of y is the minimal such coordinate so it means it's smaller than omega one of x. Omega 1 of x and now you apply the same argument to h inverse and you will get the other inequality. So in conclusion, these two guys are equal, which by the injectivity condition again implies that x and y are equal, which means that we have the fixed point we were looking for. Right? Right, and why do we care about this condition? Because it allows us to prove what we want and more. So assume that H is a homeomorphism between C crowded subspaces of X. If we had, if this thing were not the identity, then we could cook up a homeomorphism like in condition star. Simply take pairwise disjoint neighborhoods of X and of the image of X and restrict the homeomorphism to those. Certainly, it won't happen. Certainly, it won't have any fixed points. And because this neighborhood of size continuum, you will have the uncountability that contradicts star. So the condition star gives us what we want. And how can we prove that y is c crowded? Let's see. First, we observe that x cannot compare. First, we observe that X cannot contain copies of the counter set. Why? Well, we just proved it's hereditarily rigid, and the counter set is far from rigid, right? So no copies of that are allowed. But now remember that X is co-analytic, so it has the property of bare, so it must be meager, because otherwise we would find it would be. It would be nomiger on some open set, and therefore we would have a counter set inside. So the complement, which is why, will be commiger, which in particular implies C-crowded. And now we can show that. Now we can show that y is rigid. Let's fix a homeomorphism of y. We need to show it's the identity. As usual, let's extend it to a homeomorphism of a G delta. And now let's look at the complement, so a homeomorphism of G. So, a homeomorphism of G, where G is a G delta. And we observe that the complement of G has to be countable. Why is that? Well, that complement is a Borel set. So if it were uncountable, it would contain a copy of the counter set. But that complement is also included in X because G is a superset of. Because G is a superset of Y. So that can happen. In particular, this means that G intersect X is C crowded and actually dense in the bare space. But we know that X is hereditarily rigid. So that the So the H tilde restricted to this C crowded set must be the identity. So it's the identity on a dense set, so it's the identity on the whole of its domain, and therefore H is the identity because H still is an extension of H. So we know that Y is rigid. Wise rigid. And let me point out, it's not hereditarily rigid for the same reason because y is analytic, so it contains copies of the Cantor set. So those are certainly not rigid. I don't think I have time for this, which is lucky because it's the most painful part of the proof. Painful part of the proof. But here we use condition star again. Actually, this is the main reason why we defined condition star. If you only wanted to prove the previous stuff, you didn't really need that. So let me happily skip this and tell you some open and closed questions instead. These are not cloping questions, some of them are open. Not clopping questions. Some of them are open, some of them are closed. The following is the most pressing one, which is the only bit missing. Is every analytic zero-dimensional space sigma homogeneous? That's the one that I would be more interested in learning the answer to. Plus, there seems to be a parallel between rigidity and the lack of sigma homogeneity. For example, under a determinacy, they are vacuously equivalent. Say they are vacuously equivalent. There is none of those. So, the following question seemed natural, and there's a question not anymore. Is there a zero-dimensional sigma-homogeneous rigid space? And the answer is a resounding yes, due to van Engelen and van Meel on the year of my birth. Jan told me privately that this paper was done to celebrate my birth. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I completely believe him, but the result says that there are homogeneous subspaces of the reals such that their union is rigid. And more than that, they even got that these are disjoint, they are homeomorphic to each other, and the whole thing is a bear space. So obviously, this space is sigma-homogeneous and rigid. Another thing we can observe is that our positive result gave us a very strong form of sigma homogeneity. Remember, the witnesses were pairwise disjoint and they were also closed. So, can we distinguish the stronger versions from the standard one? Another question: not anymore. Is there a zero-dimensional zero? Is there a zero-dimensional sigma homogeneous space that is not sigma homogeneous with closed witnesses? It's actually the same example that was in the previous slide. You just need to do a bare category argument. It's obviously sigma homogeneous, but if it were sigma homogeneous with closed witnesses, one of these closed witnesses would have to have non-empty interior. Interior. So you would have a clopen subspace that's homogeneous, and then you're certainly not rigid once again. So luckily, we were, these questions were in a previous version of the paper, but we were luckily Jan was at the conference and he told me this, so they are no longer in the final version of the paper. Final version of the paper, but the following covering versus partition question is still open: Is there a zero-dimensional sigma homogeneous space that's not sigma homogeneous with pairwise disjoint witnesses? I asked Will Bryan, that is the world's expert on covering versus partition, and he didn't immediately come up with something. So, maybe this is actually a good question. I think the other questions were good too. Only they were answered 40 years ago. What's the big deal? And the final slide, more on hereditary rigidity. There's an example we constructed some time ago of a partition of the counter set in X and Y, such that both pieces are bursting. One piece is homogeneous and one piece is rigid. And one piece is rigid. And it turns out, so like it looks like this Y is rigid, but just barely, right? Not too much, because its complement is homogeneous. And in fact, this turns out to be the right intuition. This thing is not, why is not hereditarily rigid? But I don't know the answer to this question. We don't know how to make it coanalytic. How to make it coanalytic, it would be nice to have a definable version under V equals L, of course. And the last question that I came up with recently that seems natural, can we construct in ZFC an Aleph 1 hereditarily rigid space? The definition is kind of obvious, even if I haven't told you. I guess omega-1 crowded and every omega-1 crowded. And every omega one crowd subspace is rigid, and of course, under CH, the answer is yes, but it would be nice to have a ZFC answer if possible. Maybe I should look at Todorčevich's article on trees in the handbook of theoretic topology. Some spaces gotten from trees, but they might not be separable, metrizable. I don't know. Let me know if you have any ideas. And finally, since this paper is dedicated to Ken Cunan, let me conclude with this quote from my PhD thesis, which I very much stand by still to this day. That's it. Thank you for your attention. Well, thank you, Andrea, for a nice talk. Well, thank you, Andrea, for a nice talk. Let's see if there are any questions or comments. Will Brian has an answer for you? Who has an answer? Hey, Andrea, nice talk. I still don't know the answer to your covering versus partitioning thing, but for your last question, you said you do want matrizable separable there, right? It would be ideal, but even if it's not, I'm already a little happy. I'm already a little happy. Okay. Well, for matrizable separable spaces, I think that would have to be a subspace of the reels. And under Martin's axiom, all Aleph 1 dense subsets of the reels are homeomorphic. They're order isomorphic under PFA, but they're already homeomorphic under Martin's axiom. I see. What's that? Yeah, yeah, I think so. So I think if you insist on Matriza. So, I think if you insist on metrizability, then the answer should be no, not in ZFC. Uh-huh. Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah, I think you're right. Thank you. Sure. Thankfully, this question does not appear in the paper. It's a more recent one. I just put it here because there was still room. Because there was still room in the slide. Any other questions, answers, or comments? If not, well, then let's thank Andrea again for a beautiful talk. And we have one more thing to do, which starts in Which starts in
