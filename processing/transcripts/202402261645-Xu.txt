So today I'll talk about drawstrings and scalar curvature in dimension 3. The talk will be two parts. First, I will introduce what is drawstring and its connection to various results in scalar curvature. And for the second part, I will give some detail about how to construct a drawstring. And let's start with the classical Start with the classical Girash conjecture. It states if we have a metric G on a torus with a negative scalar curvature, then this metric has to be flat. And of course, the statement is true in all dimensions, but let's be focused in dimension three because this is where our main theorem takes place. So there are various proofs of the geological conjecture by Sheng Yao, Goma-Flawsen, and Stern using different techniques. Flossum and sperm using different techniques. So, recently, there is a growing interest in studying the stability problem associated to the George conjecture and including many other conjectures, many other theorems. So, in the stability problem, we're given a metric G on the torus such that the scalar curvature is greater than minus epsilon. Than minus epsilon, and plus some other conditions, the question is: what can we say about g? Is it close to being a flat force? And not only for the George conjecture, we can pick any theorem that has a rigidity statement and ask, if we relax rigidity with a room of epsilon, is our manifold stay close to the model? Stay close to the model case. So we have Pausi-Math theorem, Kendrow's inequality, Larou theorem, et cetera. And as we know in Sven's previous talk, there is a huge progress in this direction using the method of harmonic functions and spacetime harmonic functions. And in kind of single spirit, we Single spirit, we also consider the compactness problem initiated by Romov. We consider the space of remaining manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound and other conditions like diameter and volume bound, and etc. We can add more if we find out it's necessary. Then the problem is: first, is there a topology? Is there a topology for which such space is pre-compact? And second, can we find a notion of weak scale curvature lower bound that extends the smooth one and makes sense for the limit space? So all these sort of problems is pointing to a big idea of finding a synthetic notion of singular curvature lower bounds without requiring us. Without requiring a sim structure. Okay, so this is kind of background introduction. Let's go back to the specific George conjecture. So the version that I write down here is not correct because there are a few classical examples which I'm going to introduce. I'm going to introduce. Let us briefly recall a construction by Gromov-Lawson and Zhe Yao. Suppose we're given two manifolds with scalar curvature lower bounds, then we can build a tunnel that connects these two manifolds. We can realize that the scalar curvature is only decreased by amount of epsilon and the construction is deed. Construction is deed by modifying the metric in the very small scale. So the next part of that metric is looking pretty like the Schwarzschild metric. And induced by this, I'd like to mention in the work of Assyria Dojik Somani and Swini. Silo Dogic, Somani, and Sweeney, you can find a fairly detailed construction in the most general case. And induced by the connected sum construction, we have these classical examples. First one is bubble. It's also called the other world or back of gold in some circumstances. Second is spline. The difference between slides, splines, and bubbles is. Between splines and bubbles, the spline is not detected by minimal surface because you can arrange the construction so that each section is strictly mean convex. And the third one is tunnel. Basically, you pick two points on the same manifold and connect it with a romantic connecting sub. So physically, funnel is similar to a Tunnel is similar to a bone hole and geometrically, tunnel has the effect of shortening the distance between points. So it's heuristically a shortcut. And here is an interesting construction induced by Tunnels. It's called Sewing by Pasillo Dodge Somani. So, we start with a manifold and take an arbitrary subset, let me take a curve gamma. Then, we start with building tiny tunnels in a dense manner. So, this arrow, for this arrow, I mean the place that we're brewing. So, we're built. So we build tunnel, build tiny tunnel in a dense manner. And in the limit space, you will find that on this gamma, you have shortcuts traveling everywhere. So in the limit space, the effect that the diameter of gamma becomes zero. In the meanwhile, In the meanwhile, the rest of the manifold is not affected because Kotana is getting smaller and smaller. It remains flat. So this is a highly degenerate space. It is called Port String space. Which is a terminology in metric geometry. In metric geometry is metrically the quotient of m by identifying gamma with the point. And in this limit space, you may wonder what's the sphere curvature. Let's take a point x on gamma and its geodetic neighborhood will actually be. Will actually be single. So the volume of previous R will be at the level of R to the n minus 1. So in the volume limit sense, you will find the scalar curvature is kind of negative infinity. So, from tunnels, they can really abstract highly degenerate limit spaces. So, in the considering all these counterexamples, this is a version of the submit. Of the stability conjecture that takes care of these functions. The new ingredient is first a mi-A condition. The mean A invariant is defined to be the minimal area of closed minimal surfaces. So we assume a uniform lower bound of the mean A and we set the convergence to be intrinsic flat. To be intrinsic flat in the Somani-Wender sense. So the Mi-A lower bound has the effect of prohibiting small x. So in particular, it forbids bubbles and funnels. Meanwhile, the intrinsic flat topology ignores those lines. Ignores those splines. So, in the intrinsic flat sense, the spline is closed and being flat. This is how this conjecture deals with the current examples. But now, a new class of examples is being discovered recently. We call it drawstring. draw string you will you will soon find why is it with this the name here is the main theorem of draw string let me draw a picture so we fix a flat torus let me just draw a cube and we fix a closed geodesic gamma in the vertical direction then for any epsilon there exists a smooth metric g. There exists a smooth metric G such that the following item holds. Item one is G equals the flat metric outside the epsilon neighborhood of gamma. So we are only editing the metric in this tiny tube. The second is the interesting one. The length of Of gamma is reduced to atmos epsilon. Meanwhile, the third, we can keep the scalar curvature above minus epsilon. So, combining item two and item three, something not trivial is happening inside this tube. And moreover, as a consequence of our construction, this metric has the uniform behavior. The uniform behavior loads independent of epsilon. We call the resulting metric as epsilon drawstring around gamma. Okay, so a remark a remark here we are doing drawstring on the Taurus but with some more efforts we can show More efforts, we can show that drawstring can be constructed by replacing the underlying two-dimensional torus with either sphere or a hyperbolic surface. Oh, mean A is the minimal area of embedded minimal surface. minimal surface. Yeah, like this. So we can construct a drawstring in any of these two product spaces while keeping the scalar curvature close to the model case. Gamma is a vertical S1, yes. Okay, and as epsilon goes to zero, we have similar kind of effect. Similar kind of effect. The remaining part is not additive, so it remains flat, but the length of gamma becomes zero. So the linear space is a full string space, which is metric quotient by identifying gamma point. And it is rigorously proved by Vasilium-Dodrigan-Somani and Vasili-Somani. And Basilio Somani that it is converging in one of house mode and intrinsic flat sense to the closed tree space. So the conclusion is so the conclusion is we get a limit space which is not a flat torus. A flat torus. So, this leads to a counterexample of the Ming AIF. I forgot to say the version with Mi-A lower bound and using intrinsic flat convergence is called the Ming AIF stability conjecture. So, we are having a counterexample used by Jawstream. And another remark is: we can produce more degenerate behavior by putting drawstrings everywhere. We can put drawstrings in every direction, making sure that they don't overlap. But we can put them in a denser way so that the limit space collapses completely. The limit states collapse completely. But in this case, I have to say that it's difficult to verify the MA condition. We are not able we are not able. So, yeah, in our example, it's one drawstring. Okay, and let me mention this result by the neighbor Mohmeyer. This result is saying drawstring phenomena exists in dimension four or above. This result is prior to our result. And yes, this is the precise statement, giving a torque with dimension at least four and a close geodesic in the direction of a coordinate. Of a coordinate, then we can construct a metric that satisfied all the conditions that I written in the previous slide. So it's basically a drawstring in dimension 4 or above. So this result is fair to us and is kind of the starting point that made us seriously think about the phenomena of geostrategy. Of drawstring. But what is the difference between ours and this dimension 4? The difference comes from the co-dimension. So let me make an observation here. The connected sum construction of roller flows in Sheng Yao happens at codimension 3. And we can draw a picture and see why it's A picture and see why is we have this constraint. So, in the connected sum construction, we start with a manifold and pick a point. Then the construction says that we can edit the metric near this point to form a stable mean surface. In this process, with some calculation, we will find that the radio, the radio That the radial part of the curvature is really negative. But on the other side, the section is S n minus 1. And when n is bigger, is greater or equal than 3, it is really sphere. So you can produce large amounts of positive curvature to offset the negative radio curvature. But in codimension 2, In codimension 2, this Sn minus 1 becomes S1. Then you don't produce the positive curvature. So similarly, we enable no MRS construction. The fact that S2 carries positive curvature is used in a slightly different way than this, it is using that the three-dimensional cone carries positive culture. Carries positive curvature. I will be more detailed later. But yes, we will find that three-dimensional cone carries positive curvature, but two-dimensional cone is flat. So the strategy of the neighbor Neumeier doesn't generize directly to dimension two. There needs to be some new idea, new element that you'll see. So yeah. So it's a So it's a in scalar curvature there are a few phenomenons that are sensitive somehow to the change of co-dimension. And in this case, as I said, we're going to co-dimension 2, 3 from code dimension 2. There has to be some new idea. I'll be more detailed in the second part of this talk. It's not how much time that's correct. 35 minutes. Okay, fine. Okay, uh so before we go into the construction, let me mention a few connections, other results and problems. So here is um a conjecture that I made. A conjecture that I made before the discovery of drawstring. I think it's, I think, I posted it here because I think it's interesting and you can get some feeling of what's the effect of drawstring. So the conjecture says, suppose we have a compact street measure M with uniformly positive scalar curvature and mean A, and moreover, the boundary of M consists of Boundary of M consists of two stable minimal spheres, then there exists a very small epsilon depending on this constant so that item one, if their distance is smaller than epsilon, then m is topologically trivial. So some kind of epsilon regularity for the topology. Second, if the distance is less than epsilon, then Is less than epsilon, then the host of distance is bounded by constant times distance. So you may think of this as some kind of Hardach inequality for the distance function between stable numerospheres. So I didn't find this conjecture appearing in any reference, and there seems to be no. Seems to be no obvious counterexamples before drawstring, but let's see that drawstring is actually making this conjecture false. The example is like follows. We start taking a round s2 cross interval. Then we can do whatever we like on one side of On one side of this manifold, then put a drawstring on the other side. Because of drawstring, this drawstring has length less than epsilon. Therefore, we get a closeness of distance for free. Yeah, I destroyed. Yeah, I destroyed. And we suppose the boundary of M consists of two stable minimal surfaces. Yes, so we see obviously the condition of item one. The condition of item one is not true. Condition of item two is not true because these two points are set are far away. So the next result application that I want to present is an application sorry, I'm still an application to the volume entropy. So the setting is we're given a closed hyperbolic three-manifold. Then we define the volume entropy to be To be the exponential, the exponent of the volume growth in the universal copper. So if we let tilde b be a geodesic ball in the universal cover, and suppose that this volume grows like AE to the BT, then Then, the volume entropy is the constant V on the x-axis. Now, the following question is posed by Egglestorm Thurston. If we assume scalar curvature greater than minus six, is the volume entropy bounded by the model case? So, the constant two is the volume entropy of the standard of volume space. And one useful, one interesting observation here is a bubble doesn't increase the volume entropy because if we put a bubble on the manifold, then the extra volume of this bubble will go into the constant rather than the exponential. Now, in a joint work with Dimitri Kadars and Antoine Song, we give the negative answer to the question posed by England Stone Listen that on every closed hyperbolic free manifold, there exists a metric such as scalar curvature bounded by negative six and volume entry strip. And volume entrance is strictly larger than the model case. And here is the idea. We start with the standard hyperbolic metric and pick a close geodesic in the fundamental group. For example, pick a shortest loop in the fundamental group. Then produce a draw. Produce the drawstring near the curve. And what happens in the universal cover is that you will see many copies of the drawstring. Now, because the drawstring shortens the distance between two points, Between two points, it will allow you to travel to more fundamental domains. Let me put geodesic bulk here. And does this increase the volume entropy? Not obviously, because there's an issue. The issue is the drawstring only decreases the distance along Gamba. So, So, if your copy of JawString is kind of a thought not the geodesic sphere, it will lead you far away. On the other hand, if your drawstring is kind of tangential to the geodesic sphere, it will not need you going so too far. So, we need to use one extra ingredient, which is the equity distribution of geodesic sphere in hypervoltic manifolds. So, the equity distribution result says the following. Among all the drawstrings that you encounter, there has to be a proportion for which the direction is not so tangent. So, there is a portion of drawstrings so that this angle is bounded away from pi over 2. And the second ingredient is we can use a counting argument. The counting argument will imply that for some proportion of directions, you will not only encounter a good drawstring, for a good drawstring, I mean a drawstring that is not so tangent to your design theory. You will meet not only a good string at the endpoint, but also many good drawstrings in the history that is. In the history, that is proportional to the length. So, this is roughly statement for some constant measure of directions of directions. You will meet, you will meet epsilon constant r. Uh constant R amount of boot draw strings. So the effect of this is each drawstring needs us a certain distance away and CR amount of drawstrings leads us a constant. Leaves us a constant R distance wave. So we are paying a lot of effort to use the arc. So the overall effect is the geodetic wall becomes kind of like x1 plus c r with respect. R with respect to the hyperbolic term, with respect to the hyperbolic metric. And this extra one plus c will have the effect of increasing the volume entropy. Any questions? Oh, yeah. So it's used, it's used in. So there's a result in hyperbolic geometry called backward distribution of geodesic spheres. So this roughly means the geodesic spheres is wrapping over the manifold evenly in all directions and all places. So this result is used in the conclusion that there is the proportion of directions where you meet Of directions where you meet draw strings in a particular direction, a particular range of directions. B0 is the geodesic wall in the universal term. Oh, B0. B0 is B0 is the geodetic core with respect to the hyperbolic metric. P is with respect to the metric that contains structures. So I'm being kind of vague at this point because it's not totally small. It's only reaching this distance in some directions. But these directions cover at least the same amount of measure, so that's still enough to increase them. Can volume entropy be arbitrary large? Can volume entropy be arbitrary large? Although we didn't prove this in our result. Let's go into the construction of draw strings. So the draw string will fall into the class of warped products, where the metric H here is a metric on the tweet mesh of the torus, and the volping factor is i. So the scalar temperature. So the scalar curvature of this work product is given in this formula, 2 times Gauss curvature minus R plus 5 over φ. And let's briefly summarize what is our setting and what is our goal. We're going to find such h and phi so that first thing the metric is completely flat outside the small neighborhood. Second, the working factor Second, the working factor is quickly decreasing to zero at the center. The third point, we want to keep scaling potential almost non-negative. So this equation is obtained by setting Rg greater than minus 2 epsilon. So let me start with explaining the neighbor noise. Explaining the neighbor Neumei construction, the construction is in dimension four or above. So the underlying base metric H is three-dimensional. So in three-dimensional, the cone carries positive curvature. So we let H to form a slightly acute cone near F0. Then we Then, we set phi to be decreasing near f0 at the rate of r to the some very small power. And the parameters are set up in such a way that delta is far smaller than the cone angle, far smaller than one. And let's compute what is the scalar curvature in the cone region. cone region it is scalar curvature of h minus the plus pi over 2 the plus 5 over 5 because h is a cone with mention 3 or above you will find a level of 1 over r squared amount of temperature on the other hand you will find negative 1 over r squared in the plus phi over phi and the result is The result is if we arrange the parameters very carefully, the result will be a positive one over r squared. And which is called the whole picture. So this is the current region. Big O1 over R square scalar curvature. In the center, Curvature. In the center, we need to smooth the measuring a little bit, but this turns out to be not a big issue. And in the transition between cone and Euclidean, we have to lose that absolute amount of collection. Now we turn to dimension three. We face the problem that a two-dimensional code is flat, so we don't. So we don't have the positive one of our square to observe negative thing. But here is the is the give this observation give us some hope which is the two-dimensional cone is not entirely flat. It's flat outside the vertex, but the vertex itself contains a delta amount of curvature. Amount of curvature. So if we can smooth the co-vertex in a very careful way, maybe there is hope that this gives the friction large curvature, 2 degrees 5. So this raises the question, can we do this? And the final result is yes. So here is the Here is the building block of the smoothing. We have g to be. This form of metric is still a worked product, just that the e to the minus 2u goes into both factors. And we set f to be this function, u to be this function. I will make some explanation of these functions later. So the result is. So the result is the scalar curvature is computed using this formula and in particular if you set C2 to be very small then the rest of the thing is positive so having this building block how to embed it into the example so here is the Here is the picture. We first form a cone and then we put our building block in this very small readings that replace the colour. The reason that we can embed this is because of mean curvature comparison. So there is a gluing theorem in scalar curvature which says if you're two curvature will say if you're two if you have two manifolds with isometric boundary and the mean curvature of one side is greater than the other side with some proper choice of sign then you glue this together and you can smooth the metric so that it has scary curvature normal bias and we can compute the mean curvature of the two sides Of the two sides of this metric, one side is the cone, so the mean curvature is one minus constant over r. Let me write it down. One minus constant over r and on the other side, we can compute this explicitly is one over r minus little o of one over r. So this little of 1 over r is 1 over r times load load r to the sum power. So for r very small, you can realize this switch inequality, so you can embed it into the clone. This is about infrastructure. About construction, and I think I still have several minutes to make some technical explanation of our building block. The first is why do we choose that form of that non-standard form of worked product? So this is mainly because of this observation that the scalar curvature is computed using this formula in particular. It doesn't involve the second derivative of u. The second derivative of u. So this appears to be quite technical, but it is a very useful fact in our construction action. So in particular, this appears in our hyperbolic drawstring construction. So the drawstring is constructed for product manifolds. And to construct a hyperbolic drawstring, Construct a hyperbolic drawstring, we need to first transit from hyperbolic to product, then from product to drawstream. And in this process, this form of metric is doing a lot of help. And second, this is a somewhat far-reaching thought that this thought of reducing one order. Using one order derivative has also appeared in a counterexample in intermediate curvature. So I think in Florian's talk, we will understand intermediate curvature more. So let me not go further in this direction. And let me let me skip this. And the second more important question is Question is: Is there a natural explanation of this particular form of functions? So here is a heuristic that we found after the discovery of drawstring. I call it conformal inversion. So this is the main ingredient. So if we have a closed surface and a positive function. positive function then we consider the new metric tilde g is phi to the fourth power times g then with some straightforward calculation you may find that la plus g less than kg is equivalent to la plus g tilde phi inverse less than the gauss curvature of g tilde times phi inverse equivalently Equivalently, the work product on the left-hand side is PSC positive scalar curvature if and only if the metric on the right-hand side is PSC. So with this transformation, we can convert a volume vector to its inverse. And the next ingredient is ingredient is there exists a voting factor that is arbitrarily large at the point. So on the stand on the wrong sphere, so g0 is the wrong sphere, we can find a function phi so that la plus phi less than the gauss curvature is one, so la plus phi less than phi, but phi is actually large near a point. The analytical reason is because this is the sub-solution condition, super solution condition, and there is no uniform upper bound for super solution. For example, you can take it to look like a conformal Green function. Let us use this concrete example by Somani Tianhwa. This particular function starts. function satisfies la plus by less than phi and if you take delta to be zero it will look like a green function so it is unbounded okay summarizing these two ingredients we find a metric phi to the fourth times the round metric plus phi to the negative round metric plus phi to the negative two dt squared which is drawstring like so there is a vertical fiber that is degenerate but the whole the entire work product is not degenerate and let us take the limit delta equals zero so that phi is an unbounded function okay now if we compute If we compute the asymptotic behavior of this new metric, we will have this lemma. So, in a metric, you will find e to the this function, which is the u in our example, and r square of this term. The dots are lower order terms. So I so we that they are lower order terms. And Order terms. And the second vector here is precisely the function f. So this conformal inversion heuristic can be thought of explanation of the region that the drawstring metric can achieve. So So, thank you for your attention. This is the end of my talk.
