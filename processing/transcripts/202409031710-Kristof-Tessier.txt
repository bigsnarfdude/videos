It speaks about teeth productivity and the parallel therapy for coxoderms. Oh yeah, it's for coxompers. But yeah, thanks for coming. Of course, for the last talk, I'll be presenting a proof, so everybody likes that, right? But I'll be keeping it a bit short. But yeah, so the point of the talk is to give a proof of the parallel wall theorem for cost of recruits. So maybe let's start with. So, maybe let's start with a COTSOR group. This is my COTSOR group, and it'll have generating set S. If you guys want to use graphs, well, I don't want to. Anyways, so in our Coxeter group, we have a set of reflections. What are these reflections? These are the set of conjugates of elements in my generic set. Elements in my generator set. So it's all elements of this home. Right. These guys act by involutions on my Caleb graph, which will be this is my Caleb graph over here. And so if we have a reflection, right, we just said it acts on the Haley graph, well we could talk about the fixed point set. And this is called a home ball. And this is called a wall. So wall WR, this is equal to the fixed point set of our acting one. Right, and they're called walls. They look like hyperplanes in Tad0 Q complexes. So they'll separate my Cayley graph into two connected complexes. My Cayley graph into two connected components. So a wall will look like this. And if I have any two points or two vertices in my Cayley graph, the distance between the two is exactly the number of walls which separate them. So far so good? Yeah, so maybe it was the parallel wall theorem. This was first proved by Brink and Howlett. Branken Howlett in 93. And what it's saying, it says that there's a bound K, which depends only on the heliograph, so that any point or vertex in my heliograph, which is at As at distance greater than k from A wall W will be separated maybe by another bullet. So, what this looks like, maybe I'll read. Maybe I'll reuse this picture. Is I have a point, and I have a wall. And if this distance is sufficiently large, well, I'll find another wall which separates this point from this wall. So they look parallel. Yeah, and so for context, maybe why you should care about this theorem, yeah, called the parallel wall theorem, is that it was first introduced by Davis and Shapiro. By Davis and Shapiro, and they used this to prove that Coxer groups were automatic. And then it was later, the parallel wall theorem was later proved using root systems and lots of linear algebra. But it's the last talk of the day, and I don't want to do linear algebra. So what we'll be doing is instead we'll be using a property called bipodality of Coxider groups. And this was introduced. This was introduced by, or first proven by Darren Howlig, and then later rediscovered by S.A. Dan Shiatitsky. And yeah, so kind of I want to give a little bit of advertisement for this property and how it can be used to prove lots of properties. Okay, so maybe first before we start, I said that we could always find the parallel wall. Well, we don't really know that there exists. We didn't we don't really know that there exist parallel walls yet, uh right, so maybe I have to use a little result I'll write here in small. And this is again by Break and Howitt, and then also rewritten nicely by Niblo and uh Reeves in uh two thousand. 2002 or 6, one of them. It's in my notes this far. But what it says is that there's a bound Q on the number of pairwise intersecting walls in any classroom. So pairwise intersecting walls. Okay, and what this looks like in the picture is: well, maybe I have a wall like this, I have a wall like this, maybe I have a third wall, maybe I have a fourth wall, but I can't keep going. And maybe why you should believe this proof, why you should believe this is true and it's not a proof, but essentially what you could do, I've drawn lines on a black. Drawn lines on a blackboard. Well, you can define the angle between these walls in some precise sense. And Dyer, in his thesis, shows that these angles only take finitely many values. So if I keep doing this, well, I'm bound to find maybe a triangle where these angles are the same. And for this to happen, well, this is positive curvature. This to happen, well, this is positive curvature. And if this happened in a coxitor group, I would get the wrong confidence. So that's the sweet. Okay. So with that in mind, let's talk about bipodality. So what is bipodality? Well, first, I'm running out of drawing space. Oh well. First, if you have two intersecting walls. Two intersecting walls. What you could do is you could, these correspond to reflections, right? So maybe two reflections like this. And you could look at the action of the sum generated by these two reflections on the Haliograph. And what does this look like? Well, it'll look like these kind of cones. Of cones. So, or sorry, you could look at the fundamental domain for this action, and they'll look like cones. Yeah, and so maybe this is a fundamental domain for the action. I didn't really count right, but something like this. And there's going to be, and the fundamental. There's going to be, and the fundamental domain will be bounded by certain walls. And so we'll say, we'll say a fundamental domain, we'll call this D, we'll say D is sharp angled if the underlying reflections do not commute. So maybe call this Maybe call this WT, which is bounding in this fundamental domain. So this is WR. The wall is bounding B, it's WR and WT. So we'll say if R and T don't conduct so maybe what would be a bad fundamental domain? Well, this is what it looks like when you two reflect. Well this is what it looks like when two reflections commute, and hence right angled, not sharp angled, so bad. Okay, so yeah, what's bipidality all about? Essentially what you do is so I'll just call this a letter. Uh maybe my modality maybe give some references priorities at these people, but uh better in Halloween it's up it's up here somewhere Uh 2016 and uh we'll say the C in 23 22. Okay, so when you do it, you start with a sharp angled fundamental domain. And you suppose it's bounded by two walls, say WR and WQ. So the other thing you do, take an element in this fundamental domain, and you suppose it's separated, separated. Separated from, say, WR by a wall, say U. So maybe the first step of the picture, take a sharp angled fundamental domain, say WRWQ, take a point over here, so X, and maybe this is what you. And maybe this is what u looks like. Separating X from W R. Yeah. So then for any translate of these walls, so maybe under this RQ action, so maybe this is, we have a new wall here. Let's translate with these two walls. Translate put these two walls. Um you under this. Well, we could find another wall, U prime, which separates maybe I should use color on you guys. Maybe this is This is w prime, and then I'm saying, well, there's going to be a wall u prime that separates x from w prime. So separating x from w prime. So far so good. And yeah, so the way I think about it is some sort of like procedure. I have parallel walls, well, I could find others by just translating. I could find others by just translating along at a sharp angle to fundamental domains. And this is kind of the strategy I'll use to sketch a proof of the parallel wall. Why is it called bipedal? That's a really good question. And I'm really glad you asked that because I spent time with a friend trying to understand, trying to figure out why it's called that. It's not bipedal, right? Bipedal is a different word, right? So I looked up on. So I looked up on on online what bipidality meant and there's nothing. So maybe you have the historic history. Okay. I think maybe bipedality is the same as bipedality, but it sounds worse. And this is kind of you got two feet. I don't know. I'm not a bipedal myself, so anyways. Anyways. Tripedal, maybe. I think that's the next one I'm working on. Anyways, okay. So with the last how many minutes I have remaining? Six minutes. I have six minutes, okay. I could give you kind of the idea of Of uh the how bipodality applies a parallel wall theorem. And I'm gonna draw a point and a wall. And let's say I have this point here that is minimizing this this is the closest point uh on my wall from from X. So maybe I'll draw a nice little geodesic here. Draw a nice little geodesic here. Well, we said that the number of walls, the distance between this is basically the number of walls separating them. So I could look at all the walls here, and I could assume that they intersect W, right? Fair enough. And what happens is that if the distance between X and say I X is what? Is large, well, by this Niblo-Reeves thing, I could find a pair of parallel walls here. So I could find maybe another wall up here, which is parallel. Speed? Anyways. Now all you have to do is Take the reflection of, say, W, call this WR, and maybe this is WQ and look at this area. And you'll see I have basically the same picture. And so, by bipodality, I could find a parallel wall, and that's the basic idea. Them. That's the basic idea. You should object, though. Maybe one thing to check. First, one thing to check is that I haven't really talked about whether, first of all, I haven't talked about whether this is a fundamental domain at all or not. I could have, there's nothing telling me that taking this reflection along this wall will, it might separate X like this, right? Then I wouldn't be able to do what I did. Than I wouldn't be able to do what I just did. Other thing I want to check first is maybe whether a domain like this would even be sharp-angled. So, and so say, that would be equivalent to saying that W R and W commute, something like that. So maybe this is. This is W and this is WR and my point X passes through this wall to hit pi X. Well, this can't happen because if this happened, I would be able to just reflect along this wall here, find a shorter path from X to pipe X, so play this game. So all of these kind of intersect at So, all of these kind of intersect at a sharp angle here. Yeah, the thing with the fundamental domains is a little bit more problematic. And you basically have to do a different construction, where instead you just, starting from these walls, you pick a fundamental domain for this action that contains x. So the wall bounding it, so maybe if It. So maybe a picture. Here I have a wall here that separates x from IX. And I could take a different fundamental domain here that has the same, but this wall won't be the same as this wall. So I get a new wall. But still. Still, so yeah, so I can't, now if I do this, I can't immediately apply this Nibbler-Reeves thing because I have multiple walls that are representing, like, there's nothing telling me that this doesn't grow as the distance from X to Pi to X grows. Maybe if I I could rephrase that by just saying like I say say this is yeah say this is my goal for this reflection and I take a fundamental domain that contains that contains x and maybe maybe this wall called Well, in the symbolics, I could, it's possible that there may be S or there may be another, there may be Q with U equals VR. So maybe I Is that my one minute mark or my zero minute mark? Anyways, this is the last talk. We got down late. Anyways, maybe this is my WQ. And if I reflect along, I might get something like this. And this would be the same wall. But the point is that I've drawn them all so that they intersect at a single point. And this can't happen too many times. This can't happen too many times because of nibbler reefs. So, what happens is that I could find, so these representatives slow grow as the distance increases, and then I could basically do this same construction to ensure that I have a sharp angle fundamental domain containing x and another wall separating. Yeah, that's the proof. Maybe if this was incomprehensible, this is the right proof, but it's not. But this is the thing to keep in mind when these are just details. Are there questions?
