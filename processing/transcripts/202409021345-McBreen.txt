So, this is joint work with Pengzhou, and it began also somehow with Mina Agnag. But so many years ago. But that somehow then we ended up splitting the two different streams. So these are the co-authors of the paper, which you can find on the archive. So the basic question is the following. We start with a symplectic manifold. And to this, you can associate a Foucault category. A Foucai category. Now, supposing you have a group acting on your symplectic manifold. So, some let's say Hamiltonian group action. You could consider the symplectic reduction of your symplectic manifold, get a smaller dimensional space. This is a new symplectic manifold. And you can look at its Foucai category. The first question is, what is the relationship between these two categories? And this falls into the general topic of something like quantization commutes or reduction. Which says very roughly that there's some operation you can do here that on the categorical level that recovers Thought that might be my thought. That recovers the geometric operation. Okay. I won't discuss in what generality this holds, because I actually want to look at a kind of special situation. But this kind of expectation Kind of expectation was sort of explained by Telemann a few years ago in this setting. But the question I want to ask is: what happens? When our parameter theta, our symplectic reduction parameter is singular. So i.e. G does not act freely on. On this moment map. So, this thing, which remember is the fiber of the moment map quotient by G, is not well defined. Depending on your setup, you might think of this as a stack, but in the world of real symptoms, In the world of real symplectic geometry, if G is not acting freely here, this is a slightly suspicious space. Okay. And so I don't want to ask this for arbitrary spaces. I want to ask it in the situation where X is a Is a Belian Coulomb branch so hypertauric or Tauric hyperkaler. Variety. We'll say something in both the additive and the multiplicative cases. And multiplicative cases, so by the end of the talk, I'll explain how to modify this quotient here to get some sort of well-behaved Hamiltonian reduction procedure. Hamiltonian reduction procedure, this special case. Maybe now's a good time to apologize for the tenuous connection with quantum droidal algebras. It's not non-existent, but if you were to rank all the talks by how close they are to the word quantum Troidal algebra, this would probably fall towards the bottom of the pile. But please interrupt me if some of these objects are less familiar. And I will try and say a few words about a more precise connection at the end. Okay. So in this setting, In this setting, so we're going to have a space X, this is the chi category we're interested in. And we have a mirror symmetry statement. So this is equal to coherent sheaves on some other space y. And And the action of the group on X is going to correspond to a vibration near to the dual group, dual torus. Okay. And so And so the kind of situation that Teleman originally considered you consider, so fix a non-singular data in here. In here, and then you expect that the Foucault category of the reduction at that value theta is equal to coherent sheaves on the fiber above theta. And so let me so the sort of well write as a claim will be a theorem in some set of circumstances by the end of the talk is that if beta If theta is singular, then it still makes sense to take fiber over here. So you can still consider coherent sheaves. And so the question is, what do you write on the left-hand side to replace this category? So it's going to be a sort of regularized version of this symplectic reduction. But this means something very silly. We just removed singular. Singular locus. Okay? So it's a completely basic prescription. And as you can tell, this is unlikely to work in some great generality. And it's also a little bit imprecise as stated because, well, Foucai category depends on the symplectic structure, so I have to tell you how to put some symplectic structure here. But it does. But it does work kind of on the nose in our setting. Okay, and let me also mention here that this is so we studied this question. Studied this question in the setting of these spaces, but other people have, kind of in parallel, independently, studied it for some similar spaces. And so there's a paper of Bikili and Seagal that makes a essentially identical prediction. In a slightly different setting. Okay. So now let me start being more concrete. So okay, so we fix, we start by fixing a torus of dimension z. Dimension D and some characters of this torus and some numbers and so we define certain subtori could imagine. Subtori, could I mention one subtori in here? It would be just the inverse image of each number by its character. And this is called a toric arrangement. So it's like the toroidal or just toric analog of a hyperplane arrangement. Of a hyperplane arrangement. And they were studied by, well, many people, but let me mention De Concini and Procesi, who computed their cohomology. So there's a nice formula for the, nice expression for the cohomology with the complement. So So this has some, the Betty numbers, or rather the actual Cohomology ring has something to do with this combinatorial problem, this knapsack problem, where you're trying to figure out how many different ways you can add up n fixed set of integers to give you some arbitrary. You some arbitrary integer and various generalizations of that. Okay, so that's the data we start with for us. For us, this collection of hyperplanes, or sorry, subtori is going to correspond to sort of three spaces. Well, four spaces. So most basic space is the hyperplane complement. And then three kinds of hypertoric varieties, so the additive. So the additive, Betty multiplicative, and the Dolbo multiplicative. Let me tell you what these guys are. So the shortest thing to say, well not the simplest, is that you can define Is that you can define a map of tori from C star of the D to C star to the N using this list of characters. And so, of course, this gives you an action of C star to the D on Cn. And you can think of this as a data specifying a supersymmetric gauge theory in three dimensions. And you can use the Roberman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima's definition of the Coulomb branch. So this gives you X additives, you take the original, this is a cohomological Coulomb branch, or X multiplicative, you take the K-theoretic Coulomb branch. But let's describe concretely what these spaces look like. Okay, so let's see started the G, which we're going to call this. Which we're going to call G dual, mapping to C star to the N, mapping to quotient torus, which we'll call T dual. From now on, I'm going to assume that this is also a connected torus. And then if you dualize this sequence, you get sequence of tori moving the opposite direction. Moving the opposite direction. And the additive space is very straightforward to define. So this is the cotangent bundle of Cn. Hypercaler reduced at some parameters theta lambda. So it depends on these parameters. Parameters. So if you're not familiar with these spaces, they are hyperkiller analogs of toric varieties. So they carry an action of So here I'm being a little bit sloppy with whether these are complex or real tori. So let me say, write a little C to indicate this is just S1. Okay. So there's a hyperkiller action of this torus with a moment map that lands in C. in C C plus R to the K. And they're, why are they hyperkiller analogs of toric varieties? Well, this action is as big as it can be. The orbits are as big as they can be if you want the torus to preserve the hyperkiller form. So you can think of toric variety as a space with an action of a torus that is as big as possible if you require that it preserves. If you require that it preserves the Kalar form, and if you want to preserve a hyper Kaler form that's more restrictive, so the orbits are at most quadrational. Okay, what about the multiplicative guys? Oh, maybe I should do an example. So If in our situation T is C star acting on C2, then this guy at lambda equals zero is just going to be a cotangent bundle of P1. If T is C star acting on Cn. Acting on Cn, then, so diagonally, then for some choice of parameters, you get the cotangent bundle of Pn minus 1. And on the other hand, if you take the kind of dual choice, so T is C star to the N minus 1 acting on Cn by a By a kind of determinant one diagonal matrices, then this is going to be a resolution of the A n singularity surface. So, physically, I guess these spaces. I guess these spaces are interesting, partly because they carry hypercalor metrics. So the original construction of hyperkiller metrics on spaces like T star Pn minus 1 or this guy is rather takes some work. And then you can construct in a kind of uniform way via hyperkill reduction. The hyperkiller reduction. And mathematically, they're partly interesting because they encode properties of matroids, dependence relations of vectors. Okay. What about the multiplicative space? So, we want to do something similar. We want to take a hyper Kayler type quotient. But now instead of T star CN, we consider T star C minus a conic to the N. We're going to take a kind of multiplicative quotient. And this torus here. So, what does this mean? So, this carries a two-form with a pole line, the conic that we removed. And you have a multiplicative. And you have a multiplicative moment map, so valued in C star rather than in C. And you can use that to define, well, a multiplicative moment map for higher rank tori and take a multiplicative symplectic production. So this no longer has a natural hyperkalar structure. It's just holomorphic symplactic. This is for smooth. So smooth, holomorphic, symphactic space for generic alpha beta. I keep catching glimpses of myself through the blackboard. It's very uncanny. So, okay, so um So, these spaces are not so, so different from each other. So, we compare them in an example, which is representative of the general situation. So, if we take x additive to star p1, and I'm going to draw just the map. Just the map, the complex part of the moment map, which finds in C for the torus action. So the general fiber here is a copy of C star. And the special fiber over zero is a union of P1 and two lines. So it's a kind of conic vibration that degenerates at a point. If I deform, so this is theta sub 0, let's say. If I deform a little bit, we consider 0 theta instead of theta 0, then what do I get? I get the conic vibration with two singular fibers and everything else again equal to C star. equal to C star. So what about the multiplicative case for the same data, essentially? Well, now you're fibering over, so this was a copy of C, this is now a copy of C star. This is now a copy of C star. But otherwise, somehow nothing has changed. You just have the same picture as before. And so in particular, if you're interested in the geometry of this special fiber here, you're kind of free to study it inside either of these spaces. And this is kind of connected if you think both of these as If you think both of these as arising from Coulomb branches, and you think, well, cohomology and K-theory are not so different in this context. There's a churn character map from K-theory to cohomology. And if you specialize equivariant parameters, maybe it's an isomorphism after completing. Okay. So. So this guy has some nice features that the multiplicative one doesn't. But it has a conical C star action. That means an action that contracts, in particular, the base of the moment vibration to a point. Of course, there's no such action here because there's no contracting action on the torus. And this conical action is very, very important when you're developing the quantization of this space. And the fact that it is not present here gives you all kinds of technical headaches. It makes it much, much more difficult to just define basic objects here. On the other hand, note that if I pick individual fibers, these guys look exactly the same. All right, so focusing on these two spaces for a second. So we have an action. So we have an action, just as in the additive situation, we have an action of the torus, complex torus now, on this multiplicative guy. And you have a multiplicative moment map valued in the dual torus, which is just a copy of C star to the D. We have C star to the D. And this is kind of a remark. This is easy to prove. So the regular locus of mu g is exactly this guy. So is I'm going to write it as g check circle. I'm going to write it as G-Check circle from now on. So it's C started to the D minus this hyper, this collection of affine subtori. Where, of course, the affine subtori dependent on some choices, right? I can move them around inside C star D, but those choices correspond to these parameters. Okay, so this is the key. Okay, so this is the key. This is going to be key for us. You can go back and look in this example here. Here I have a single non-regular point, but if I pick more generic parameters, I will again have two non-regular points. That's going to correspond to Correspond to H one and H two inside C star. Um Yeah, so again, our the eventual goal is going to be to show that the Foucault category of this space Category of this space after a suitable process of Hamiltonian reduction becomes not the Foucai category of this space, but the Foucai category of this space. Okay, so that's what we're going to see. So that's some relationship between A model here and the A model here. Model here. But let me first start by recalling a much older but slightly mysterious appearance of this same phenomenon, which is kind of maybe brings it a little bit closer to the topic of this conference. So this is just going to be motivation. This is just going to be motivation. So it's not. You're going to explain some stuff, and then you can feel free to forget it and start again here. So if you're considering mirror symmetry in the sort of style of, you know, Gibbon Tal's. Given Tall's early work for the additive hyperturk variety, what are you trying to do? You're trying to take the quantum connection. So this is a flat connection on X over this torus here, which is just G check. G-Check, whose fiber is just the equivariant homology of X, and whose connection matrix encodes virtual counts of rational curves. And you want to show that that's equal to some sort of mirror object. So some. Mirror connection, where this is now a Gauss-Mannen connection. And what Gauss-Mannen connection on some cohomology groups, so what is this cohomology group? It's the precisely the cohomology group of this toric complement with coefficients in a certain rank one local system. So this is due to myself and Daniel Schenfeld long ago when we were both graduate students. But if you're, yeah, so if in the setting of not of hypertoric varieties, but of this spring resolution or quiver varieties, Or quiver varieties, these quantum connections are related to these Kalager-Mosner systems or KZ systems that were mentioned earlier today. And this kind of mirror symmetry equivalence gives you some integral formulas for the solutions of these systems in terms of period integrals. Okay, so somehow we think of this torus here. Again, this torus here is being the natural home for these. Home for these period integrals that solve various integrable systems arising in gauge theory. And this is a slightly weird form of mirror symmetry because here we have something, something what we have. Well, we have something of dimension, so real dimension 4n minus 4d, but this torus has half that dimension, so 2n minus 2d. So usually mirror symmetry Usually, mirror symmetry relates to sort of equidimensional spaces, and there's something to explain. So, why not something that looks more like a hypertoric variety on the other side here? Okay, the closed parentheses. So, this board is motivation, but I'm not going to use it any further. What is important for us. What is important for us is that so it can also prove homological neurosymmetry. For the multiplicative guy, this is going to work with then damage and then With Ben Gammage and Ben Webster. So, what does this say? Well, in short, it just says that if you take If you take for specific values of the parameter, moment map parameter, take the Foucault category of this multiplicative space. It's isomorphic to, or equivalent to, coherent sheaves, basically the same space, but with the parameters switched. So, this is going to be the sort of statement that we want to take the Hamiltonian reduction of. So, yeah, so maybe let me say a few words on the other side. Say a few words on how this is proven. So, well, first you need to make this a precise statement. So, we need to define a Levil structure on this space, so a symplectic structure plus a bit of extra data that makes this category well-defined. And so, we actually use Use a Levo structure on X beta, which is, as far as I can tell, essentially impossible to define directly on X beta coming from natural structures. Structures on yet another kind of hypertrophic variety, X Dolbo. So, okay, I need to say a little bit about this. And this space is less well known. And so I'm going to quickly sketch a definition. So So suppose we start from, again, I'll just define it in an example, okay, and then leave it to you to imagine how this works in general. So we start from t star p1 and we want to define kind of Dalbo version. So So you can think the real moment map for T star P1 lands on a line. And here's P1. It's an image is an interval on this line. Is an interval on this line. So the image under the moment map of P1. And so what I want to do is consider a space which instead has infinitely many P1s that fit into a chain and whose moment maps tile the line. So they give you a kind of periodic version of this. A kind of periodic version of this. So this is going to be, we'll call x periodic. So it's a kind of infinite type hyperturk variety. And it has an action of z. And it has an action of z by translation. So you can translate these links. So if you think this looks like an, a bit like an affine springer fiber for SL2, I mean the so it contains this infinite chain. So it contains this infinite chain as a Lagrangian subvariety, but it is it's actually a two-dimensional complex two-dimensional surface, right? So it's again Tim C equals equals two. And this orange shade of P1s is Lagrangian subvariety in there. And so. And so Z acts on this periodic guy, but this action is not free or hopefully discontinuous or any of those nice things that make an action, that make the quotient well-behaved. But you still have a moment map valued in C, and you can consider And you can consider, sorry, I call it pi. You can consider the pre-image of the poly disk, or just the disk here. And this action is going to be, this is a good action. And so x double in this example is the quotient. By Z. So it looks like what? It looks like... So the generic fiber is a quotient of C star by Z, so it's an elliptic curve. And the special fiber is a pinched elliptic curve, a nodal elliptic curve that comes from quotienting this chain. So this space was known, say, to Aguri Avafa, who constructed a hyperkiller metric on it. So it's a sort of a local model for a degenerating hyperkaler family of elliptic curves. So, if you're trying to describe the hyperkilometric on a K3 surface, this is maybe what it looks like that has an elliptic fibration. This is what it looks like near one of the singular fibers. Okay, so more generally, so we start with a higher-ranked hyperturk variety. This guy is has a map down to a poly disc. This is an algebraic integrable system. So that means that, for instance, pi inverse of a generic point Point is an abelian variety. And pi inverse of zero is called a degenerate abelian variety. In practice, it means it's a union of toric varieties glued along. Along toric divisors. So here we have P1 glued to itself. But more generally, yeah. It also has a hypercalor metric, so a non-complete Non-complete hyperkalar metric, which again, if you think of this as sort of a limiting picture of hyperkalar vibration near one of the singular points, it kind of makes sense that you don't get a complete metric at that point. Yes? Sorry? Where does it come from? So it's basically, you can think it's like the limit. I mean, sorry, you can define it quite, usually you just define it directly from coordinates, let's say. But in this presentation, it's the limit of the just complex moment maps for the finite type hypertorics. So I think you think this is kind of a limit where. I think this is a kind of a limit where you add more and more intervals. For each one of those, you have a map down to C. So these Dalbo guys, I learned about them from Housell and Crowdfoot. Hustle and crowdsuit. So I should write their names down here. But it is somehow closely connected with HB. So this is a theorem of, well, basically of Yang Li, but somehow we just did the We just did the kind of easy higher-ranked generalization of that. Dansko, myself, and Vivek Shande. So the Dalbo space embeds inside the Betty space. So this is a deformation, this is an open deformation retract. Okay, so you can think the Betty space, so just to draw it in pictures here. So if we remember, the Betty space looked a bit like let's say like this. And then you can find some real Lagrangians in there and neighborhoods of these real Lagrangians, which is the Dalbo space. And then one of the things we did in this mirror symmetry paper is we show that Extalbo has a natural Legoville structure. So this uses the hyperkaler structure on Extalbo from hyperkalar method. From hyperkalometric. This is kind of a, this is not a soft property, this is a delicate property of Xtalbo. And Xbeti is the Liouville completion. I can think of as Liouville completion. So this is how we define a So, you so this is how we define a legal structure in XPEDI, and it's what makes this statement make sense. I need to finish up soon. The The skeleton, Bouleville skeleton of this Biouville structure is the zero fiber. The zero fiber. So in other words, so what this means in practice is that you can compute the Fukaya category of expedi locally. Along high inverse of zero. Is there some sheaf of categories on this skeleton? Again, that would be, here's our skeleton. So there's some sheaf of categories on this thing whose global sections is the chi category. And the sheaf is easy to To describe so, locally near a toric component. So, it's an irreducible component. What do we get? We basically. We get, we basically have, well, let me say the sheafified version of the Fukai category. What does it look like? It looks like perverse sheaves on that toric component, which are smooth with respect to the toric stratification. So that's what this lambda means. And this. And this has a quiver description due to DuPont. So this is equal to representations of a certain quiver, which actually is a kind of, looks a lot like these pre-projective quivers that you used to define quiver varieties. Okay, and then some more work you can somehow. And then, some more work, you can somehow show that the pre-projective quiver shows up again on the mirror side of your correspondence. Okay, so proof, compute left-hand side by localization, right-hand side by using a tilting bundle. And then you just compare. Okay, so in the last six minutes of yeah, what is the point of today's talk? So okay, so theorem one from this paper with myself, Shande, and Cho is that so. So the action of G on this ready space induces, in a suitable sense, an action of just functions on g on S Foucai category. Which is mirror to the moment complex moment map action on coherent sheaves. So this is okay, so so the So this space here has a map down to this torus. And so of course you can pull back functions. And functions act here by multiplication. Meaning you get a map to the center of that category. So the point is, there's some natural action. Natural action on the Foucault category coming from just coming from the topological action of this group, and those two coincide. That's one. And number two, if we take the fiber of the complex moment map at one and consider the momentum. And consider coherent sheaves on that guy. So, this is a singular fiber, some union of toric varieties. Then this is going to be equivalent to the Foucai category of the hyperplane complement, which in turn Just recall that this is the same thing as the regularized symplectic quotient of the Betty space by G. Okay, so you just remove the singular locus and you take the usual quotient. So these two things together tell you that Teloman's Telemann's prediction can be made sense of in this setting for these singular values if you remove if you do this funny thing where you just remove the singular locus. So I should say that again sort of in parallel with the parallel with this work there's some work of make sure I don't forget any of the authors names so so see also Li Li Liu and Meck so we prove a kind of a similar story Similar story for the additive hypertoric variety and additive hyperbling complements using, oh, I don't know how similar or different the methods are and again. And again, I wrote it down before, but just write it again. So, this also falls in line with these kind of conjectures that Lucilli and Seagal made in a slightly more general setting. Sorry, that was in the diagram here. Okay, and yeah, so how do we prove this thing? So I just have just a yeah, well, I'm pretty much zero seconds left. Let me just say that if you go back to the description of Kerber sheaves on this toric variety, the sheaves are smooth along a toric stratification. So it means that if you restrict to a torus orbit, That if you restrict to a torus orbit, they're locally constant. And so you can take the monogramy of the sheaf along a torus orbit, and that gives you an automorphism of your sheaf. And those automorphisms combine to give you this action of this polynomial algebra. And then when you just force all of those atomorphisms to be trivial, so you basically To be trivial, so you basically take the fiber over one of this family of automorphisms, what you get, again, you do not get the Foucault category of the quotient space, but the sort of regularized quotient. And that you can prove by local computation. So we prove it basically, we do we push forward the sort of sheaf of categories on the skeleton to a sheaf of categories on the hyperplane arrangement. sheaf of categories on the hyperplane arrangement. You can just prove it by an easy local calculation. So yeah, so kind of that's sort of a neat thing, I think. But on the other hand, we don't have a conceptual explanation for how this regularized thing comes about. Okay, thank you.
