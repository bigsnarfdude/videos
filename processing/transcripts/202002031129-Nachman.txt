I'm a PhD student Ritan Regiev and Daniel. And the story will be about a nonlinear transform that allows us to solve an integrable version of the David-Stewartson equation. It also, and that was my original interest in it, allows us to treat an inverse boundary value. An inverse boundary value problem. We'll see if there's time for that before lunch. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about this. Oh, I should say I'm not at all an expert in dispersive equations. Please feel free to correct anything stupid I say and doze off if I say I talk about things you know too well. I'll then describe the main object of the talk. Describe the main object of the talk, which is the scattering transform. Try to convince you that it really is a non-linear Fourier transform, and then tell you what it allows us to say about Davies-Stewartson and the Calderon problem time permitting. So here's a slide about things I know not much about to motivate the study. To motivate the study. David Stewartson equations are reduction of the water wave equation under certain regimes where you have weakly non-linear surface waves traveling principally in one direction. But then they've also found applications to ferromagnetism plasma. To ferromagnetism, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. And so there's about four parameters in this family. And the local well-posedness in the L2 critical case and global well-posedness for small initial data has been proved by PDE methods in the 90s. Here I'm going to To pardon me, focus on the defocusing ds2 because it's an integrable system. So, what does that mean? Here's the equations we're going to be talking about. Just basic notation, I'm going to use a lot of complex analysis, so z will be x1 plus ix2. We're in two plus one dimensions. And well posedness for this particular Baby-Stewartson equation was shown by Peter Perry in 2014, assuming the initial data has one derivative in L2 and also it's in a weighted L2. Here we'd like to treat the mass critical case. We want to be in. Case we want to be in L2 and assume nothing else. So the system is integrable in that you can have a lax pair. In other words, you can write it as arising from a in the form of the compatibility of two operators L and A. L is the main object our study. Our study. A, I will stick with tradition and not write it out for you. So for the moment there is, we don't have a time variable. We are in the complex plane. We have a potential Q, which will be in L2. And we solve this. And we solve this system for m1 and m2. And then we define the following transform. So there's a parameter k here, which is complex. And the transform is defined by this formula. I've written it down there for future reference in a slightly different form. So, where we integrate So, where we integrate q against m1 and we have this, think of this as e to the ix, c as in a Fourier transform. Here's the formula for it. Okay, so the first reason why this might be called the nonlinear Fourier transform. Well, first of all, it's nonlinear. It depends nonlinearly on Q. But if you linearize, then to a first approximation, M1 is 1. Approximation m1 is 1, and then you just get essentially the Fourier transform of, in this case, the complex conjugate of Q. And so the miracle is that if Q satisfies the equation one, so now we bring in time. So now we bring in time, we let Q flow, if it satisfies equation 1, then corresponding scattering transform at time t will be a family stk, which evolves linearly. Incidentally, with the normalizations I gave you, the inverse scattering transform is exactly the same thing. So that's one reason why we like this. Reason why we like this complex conjugate if you treat the forward problem, you've also done the inverse problem. And so the scheme, which of course started out with the KDV story, is that we're given the Cauchy problem, we have a potential Q0, we take the transform of Q0, we then flow it linearly in transform space. When we get to time t, we When we get to time t, we take the inverse scattering transform to get the potential at time t. So we'd like to go this way. And the question is, can this be made rigorous just assuming Q0 is in L2? So typically, PDE methods win over this approach even for integrable systems, because typically, just think of Because typically, just think of the Fourier transform. If you want to prove the Fourier inversion theorem, you typically have to add some conditions on your functions, if you're not exactly in L2. So typically one needs more conditions to make the forward and the inverse map work, and that. And that makes it challenging to have sharp results for, but here we managed. Okay, so back to the scattering transform. Biels and Kuiffmann noticed that it happens to satisfy a planchural identity. Plancherel identity, which they proved when Q was in Schwartz space. Of course, if this was the Fourier transform, you'd be done, but I remind you, it's a non-linear transform, so just knowing that the identity holds for nice potentials doesn't imply that it holds for general L2. And so, this was one of the open problems we were interested in. It's sort of there. Can you have Can you have this identity? Can you prove it for Q in L2? And this has been open for a while. A number of people have tried. And here I'm listing some of the results. Russell Brown proved it for Q in small norm. Peter Perry for the space that I talked about. And most recently, Most recently, Brown, Ott, and Perry show that if Q has alpha derivative in a weighted L2 beta space, the transform has beta derivative in a weighted L alpha space. So it does behave a lot like the Fourier transform. So we have three reasons to call this a non-linear Fourier transform. Its linearization is a Fourier transform. You use it for solving PDEs. You use it for solving PDEs the way you would, say, the heat equation. That's how the Fourier transfer was born. And the analytic properties are similar to that of the Fourier transfer. And these partial results are also an indication of the challenge. So you have, as we As we will see, it's sort of easy to define F and maybe even show it's bounded. But if you want to show that it's in L2, you need some decay in K. And for that, by whatever means, integration by parts or fancier versions, people need at least a little bit of differentiability of Q. So the challenge will be to do this without assuming that. Without assuming that so now I can state our theorem. The assumption is we're just in L2. The scattering transform that I've defined is a C1 map, a diffeomorphism from L2 to L2. It satisfies the Planchetal identity. It also satisfies, as we'll see, this point. This pointwise bound here, M is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function, and you will see this has nice implications for the nonlinear flow. It's by Lipschitz. There's an inversion theorem. It's also a symplectomorphism, if you're interested. So that's the theorem. So that's the theorem, that's our Planck Scherel theorem. So let me tell you a little bit about how the proof goes. You can scalarize the system that we had for M1 and M2 by introducing these M plus, M minuses. And that's what I wrote over there for future reference. And so we turn these equations into integral equations the usual way. And the main challenge will be to somehow capture the large k decay of this without any smoothness assumption on Q. And the other challenge, which is unever big. And the other challenge, which is an even bigger challenge for the by Lipschitz property and so forth, we want the norm of this inverse operator to depend only on the L2 norm of Q. And so to do that, we have a new estimate on standard classical. Fractional integrals that you see in textbooks, but you don't see this estimate. So I remind you: this is the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. And this inequality is valid in any dimension. And our d bar inverse, oops. Whoops. Sorry, I keep pressing the wrong thing. Our d-bar inverse is bounded by d to the one-half, sorry, d to the minus one. But again, the estimate is true in general for fractional integral. So it's a pointwise estimate, which tells you that the fractional integral. That the fractional integral of a function in Lp is bounded by this product of the maximal function at the point and the maximal function of the Fourier transform at zero. So a quick way to understand that is that the Fourier transform, this will be, have something like xi to the alpha, this multiplier. Alpha as multiplier. Let's say I have C D C And so the tricky business is when x is zero. Away from c equals zero, this is a standard multiplier. So in fact, here's a sketch of the proof of this inequality. This inequality. We do a little with Paley decomposition and we split into low frequencies and high frequencies. For high frequencies, this is treated as a standard multiplier. And for low frequencies, we write since the maximal function at f hat at zero is the soup over these averages. It's the soup over these averages divided, right? Average means you have a 1 over r to the n. We can bound the L1 norm of f hat over such a ball by r to the n times m hat. And if you substitute that in here for the low frequencies, you get this bound in terms of the maximal function of the Fourier transform at zero. And that bound from sort of more standard inequalities. So if you then optimize over the cutoff frequency, we get back the we get this inequality. So I should say. I should say when we bring in the operator that we'll have because of that oscillatory term, we'll actually have something like this. And the effect of putting the oscillatory term here is to move the maximal function f hat at k and that will allow us to get to capture. To get to capture decay in K. Okay. So here comes the, in some sense, the most difficult part. And that is to show that you can invert this little operator. invert this little operator d bar plus q, which as you see shows up when defining our m pluses and m minuses with norm depending purely on q and l2. I'm not going to talk much about the proof of this. This was entirely Daniel's work. The idea is to use methods To use methods you're familiar with, induction on energy and profile decompositions. But the novelty is that we do so on the static problem. There's no T here. So we're using these tools to study the inverse scattering for the potential at fixed time. Okay, so putting together the two things I just told you about, the estimates on the maximal function and this invertibility, we find we can prove, we can construct these m pluses and m minuses, which will, I remind you, come into the, if you wish, into the definition of the scattering transform. And lo and behold, we've captured dk in k because of this oscillatory term, so that if q is in L2, q hat is in L2, and this is in L4. So we get that our Yaost solutions, which is what some people call these M plus minuses, are in L4 both in Z and in K. All right, the work's not completely done. So here's one way to write the S, here's another way to write the S. But essentially the story is, we know Q is in L2, we know this is in L4 in Z. So, and we somehow want the result of this to be an. Of this to be an L2 function, and by the way, also L4 in K. And we want the result of all this to be an L2 function in K. So you can think of this as a pseudo-differential operator. Put some other f hat here. It doesn't have to be the same as Q. This is your symbol. And it is a symbol. And it is a pseudo-differential operator with rough symbols which you're not going to find in, let's say, Koichman-Meyer. So we'd like to prove that this is a bounded operator on L2. So that was another ingredient in the story. And so we have another theorem which is valid in all dimensions for precisely Precisely pseudo-differential operators with symbols like this. There is, by the way, a remark in Coiff-Ma-Meyer that if your assumptions on the symbol are somehow of integral type as opposed to pointwise, some results are easier. And so here we have a result on boundedness. Boundedness in L2 of such a pseudo-differential operator with additional pointwise estimate. And I can tell you just two words about the proof. So the main assumption is this, in line with a typical assumption on a symbol. You have the derivative Behaves nicer. This is just some kind of decay assumption. It doesn't, the precise nature of this is not important. The important thing is here. And if you write A, if you let B equals minus this A, and you write A as this This to the minus a half b. So it's to go from here to there that we need some kind of decay in A. Substitute that, so this is now my one minute sketch of proof. Substitute that form of A into the formula for the psi DO and now move. And now move the fractional integral of B onto f hat times the oscillatory term. And now the magic estimate with the maximal function that we have before can come back in. And this is basically how the proof goes. All right, so that was the end of the sketch of the proof of the Planchrel theorem. Of the proof of the Plancherel theorem for the nonlinear Fourier transform. Let's see what it does. It tells us about defocusing ds2. Again, only assumption is Cauchy data is in L2. We then get a global solution which is in L4 in TNZ. Satisfies the uniform bounds that come out of the Planchel theorem. Let's see. I didn't write here the pointwise bounds. I will tell you about them in a moment. So we have uniform bounds on the L4 norm and Norm and as well as stability with the constant depending only on the L2 norm of the initial conditions. So the point of this slide is to convince you that the Let's see. That the pointwise estimate where was it? Sorry. That the pointwise estimate 2 on our scattering transform, and by the way, also on the inverse scattering transform, because they're the same thing. I mentioned that that's going to tell us something about the nonlinear flow. So here it comes. Here it comes. Okay, wrong direction. Okay, so the scattering transform transforms linearly. We have the potential at time t, it's the inverse Fourier transform, inverse scattering transform of where s is at time t. Where s is at time t. The estimate I just mentioned then tells you this. And so you have the... Now what is this? This is the inverse Fourier transform of the scattering transform at time t. At time t. Well, this is basically the linear flow on whatever this is the Fourier transform of, which turns out to be the wave operator, as I will mention in a moment. And so, what this is telling you: so that the estimate that I talked about before, the pointwise estimate on the nonlinear Pointwise estimate on the nonlinear scattering transform tells you that the nonlinear flow is controlled by the maximal function of the linear flow that this is asymptotic to. And that gives you the L4 estimate, etc. Here I'm just, I will skip quickly over this. I will skip quickly over this. I'm just defining the wave operator, standard definition. And so the scattering result is not only do you have global existence, you also have scattering. And the wave operators are obtained as follows. So we have our initial Q, which involves Which invol uh evolves nonlinearly. Here is q naught. Sorry, this is q naught. This is w plus of q naught. How do we, what is the formula for w plus of q naught? Take the scattering transform of q naught. That's a function of k. Don't use the inverse scattering transform. The inverse scattering transform, use the inverse Fourier transform. That's going to give you a potential, and that's precisely the wave operator. So think about what this says. Suppose you don't want to hear about inverse scattering. You want to solve the problem using PDE methods. And by PDE methods, you show. And by PDE methods, you show global existence, you show scattering, you show existence of the wave operator, and boom! Here is our non-linear Fourier transform appearing as the wave operator. So that tells you that somehow it's there in the problem, whether you like it or not. And we like it, of course. Okay, so whatever we know about S, we now know about the wave operators. The wave operators, C1 diffeomorphisms, etc. What's the time? Oh, plenty of time. You want to eat or do you want to hear about the Calderon problem? First. Okay, Calderon problem. So, as they say, multipython, now for something completely different. Um wait, sorry So here's the problem of Calderón Here's a region which you know think of it as your body or well in this case a slice through your body because we're talking too deep. Through your body, because we're talking 2D. And when you do medical imaging, you image with CT, you image with MRI, those each give you different properties of your body. Ultrasound. What if we could image the electric conductivity? Right? The heart function electrochemically, so that gives you important information. Important information about the heart. So, for instance, if someone had an infarct, you could image where exactly the infarcted tissue is in the heart. If we can do this super well, the brain also functions electrochemically, so could also read your thoughts. We're not at that resolution. All right, so there is a sigma, which is an electric conductivity, which we think of as unknown. Of as unknown. If you do know sigma, then you have the standard kindergarten-Dirichlet problem where you place, so u is an electric potential. You place an electron, you have electrodes on your You have electrodes on the surface of your body. So, think of this as an electrocardiogram of the future. You place electrodes on the body, you apply this G, and you measure current at the surface. So, sigma grad U is the electric current. That's basically Ohm's law, right? This is voltage drop. Right? This is voltage drop, and this is one over R. So that's the current. And so the normal component of the current at the boundary is the so-called Dirichlet to Neumann mark because it takes Dirichlet data to Neumann data. In engineering, In engineering, you might call it the voltage to current map. And Calderon, actually working for geophysics company, supposed it's not about the body but the Earth. So if we make such measurements at the surface of the Earth, can we find the conductivity inside? And people do this actually. People I've seen a PBS program with people going on Mount Vesuvius and making such electric measurements trying to image the shape of the volcano inside, which has importance in how bad, we know it's going to explode sometime, we want to know how bad it will be. Okay, so the problem, but Halderon made this. But Calderon made this very respectable for mathematicians. Here's a math problem. He posed this for sigma in L infinity. If I give you this operator, Ichle-ton-Neumann map, on the boundary, does that uniquely determine the conductivity inside? And if so, try to calculate sigma from knowledge of this operator. And there's a vast literature on this problem in the last, what is it, 40 years. And it's become a paradigm for a number of many other inverse problems. The I here the I'm I'm cutting the story short by only listing 2D results. Only listing 2D results. The first uniqueness result was by Sylvester Ullmann in three dimensions and higher, global uniqueness, in three dimensions and higher. So my initial result required two derivatives in L P. Brown and Uman cut this down to one derivative in L P, essentially using Essentially, using this S. So there is a corresponding S for Schrodinger operators. And so I had shown that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map determines the scattering transform. Scattering transform for this in 2D, and that yielded a uniqueness result as well as reconstruction. Asterline Paivarinta improved this even further by using the theory of quasi-code formal maps rather than pseudo-analytic functions that we have here. Oops, I see a typewriter. There should be a grad here. So there's a result similar to what I'm about to tell you, but for small norm, which essentially mirrors the small norm result we had for the scattering transform by Russell Brown. Okay, so this goes a bit fast, so let me just tell you something. So, let me just tell you some intermediate step. So, first of all, what does this have to do with that? If you make the little change of variable v is sigma to the one-half u, and you solve this divergence form equation, then v. then V will be a pseudo-analytic function. Exactly the kind of equation that m plus and m minus satisfy. Suppose q is zero, then v is analytic. What's a natural boundary operator if we're in a domain or analytic function? For analytic functions, answer the Hilbert transform. So here we managed to also define a corresponding Hilbert transform, let me call it HQ, which relates real and imaginary parts of solutions of this equation in omega. It's going to take another lecture to convince you that if you know HQ, you can determine M plus and M minus on the boundary of omega. So M plus and M minus are pseudo-analytic functions of this type. And the claim is, And the claim is, and this takes quite a bit of proving, that the Hilbert transform for this potential, knowledge of that operator, determines m plus and m minus. And here I show you a little integration by parts. Suppose, right, so now q is our q lived in all of R2. Now we take a q that only lives here and make it zero out here. It's zero out here. And so the formula for S, which we had, this is our nonlinear Fourier transform, now only lives in omega, u is 0 outside of omega, integrate by parts. And you see that if you have the values of m plus and m minus, these functions. Minus these functions. On the boundary of omega, we have a formula for this scattering transform, for this nonlinear Fourier transform. So this involves integral equations, which I'm not talking about. And this is now a formula which gives you S. Which gives you S. So, by our by today's theorem, by Planchrel, we have a constructive way of getting Q. I didn't tell you what Q is, it's written there. So if V is that, D bar V is Q V, where Q Where Q is the derivative of log sigma. And finally, based on these changes, one can also show that if you are given the Dirich-Left-Ton-Neumann map, which is the data in the Calderon problem, you can figure out this Hilbert transform. If you know the Hilbert transform, If you know the Hilbert transform, we get to m plus m minus. If you know m plus m minus, then you get s. If you know s, you have a Planck theorem to get Q. If you know Q, sorry. And the assumption that we need throughout the whole story is that Q is in L2. So this works for conductivities whose log has derivative in L2. And if you have Q, And if you have Q, then you can just integrate this and get the sigma. And I'll stop here, 10 extra minutes for lunch. Questions? You had a lot of constants depending on the L2 norm. Yes. Can you say something about the size, let's say, the Lipschitz constant of the fluid and so on? Not really, but think E to the norm of, right? L to norm of Q could be enormous. Would be nice to have a different, a more constructive argument for those bounds. Other questions? So there's in the reconstruction argument, I guess numerically there are these big issues to deal with with opposiness, but now you have this transformation that is relatively clear. But from the main ill-positeness is here and some of it is built in. And some of it is built in. So you might. Here's what happens. If you have, if I give you solutions here, you can do with silly examples. And let's say your measurement is 10 to the minus 3 error. The error increases exponentially with the depth. So that is independent of the method. It's just a fact. Of the method. It's just the fact of the problem, of the PDE, of the elliptic PDE. It therefore makes sense that when you try to probe this operator, you input these exponentially growing things or decaying in certain directions to counteract that. And that shows up in here. However, people have said, okay, now we can have a wonderful A wonderful tailor-made regularization by cutting off high frequencies at this step. So there are low-resolution numerical implementations of this, or my earlier version. And then the uniqueness program has also seen a big increase these days with if you put a nonlinearity on the right-hand side, because then it becomes because then it becomes somehow easier to compare wait wait wa w where do you want to put the in the nonlinear in the in the in the original elliptic problem yeah if you put a you know gradient u squared on the right hand side some sort of flux nonlinear oh oh so I've seen that in hyperbolic settings where you where you gain information from the interaction of so that the singularities from two solutions interacting produce somehow Interacting produce somehow like virtual sources that give you information you otherwise would not have if this was linear. But I haven't seen it in the non-linear setting. I mean, sorry, in the elliptic setting. I think the main thing is that the Schrödinger operators that show up in the sort of Sylvester-Goulman type approach become harmonic operators. And so they end up seeing, they have to understand properties of harmonic functions on a domain instead of solutions to a short. Domain instead of solutions to a Schrodinger equation in the domain. Oh, I'd like to hear about that. But my question, I guess, is: let's say that you added something like a nonlinearity to that right-hand side. Is there any hope of finding a nonlinear version of M plus and M minus that would similarly invert this type of problem? I wouldn't discourage hope, but okay. Other questions? There will be a group photo at 2, and then we'll resume shortly thereafter. I think the benefit is the songs. Yes, Don't Cowell and David Collection one. Oh, okay. Then you divide yourself with small. So that's still happening? That's still wrong. I'll see. That's nice to meet you. And they've done sort of hard to explain that. I see. And this is recently content that you don't have a marketplace. Oh, super easy. Thank you so much. And on the one hand, there are solutions.
