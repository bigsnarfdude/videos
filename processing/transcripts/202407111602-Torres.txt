About this title Epatic Fibrosis Model: The Impact of Fibrotic Vascular Changes on MOLANIS. So, first, I would like to give you some context. The liver is the largest organ within the body, and it transforms toxic substances in our organism. To do this function, it has a peculiar circulatory system. It has a peculiar circulatory system. So first, the flow through the liver in the body goes from the bottom to the top. And the liver has two block supply networks here. The first one is the hepatic artery, is pink in this picture, and the hepatic artery network supplies the liver with oxygenated blood from the heart and the And the portal vein network carries the oxygenated blood from the digestive system. These two blood networks run in parallel and then the currents, these two currents mix here at the level of the microcirculation and then leaves the liver through this outflow network that it is called a pathic network. Epatic vein network. And the outlet of the hepatic vein network is the inferior vena cava. So here the microcirculation in the liver is in charge of the lobules. The lobules are the smallest functional units in the liver and they are commonly modeled as a porous medium. They have a form of A form of examinal prisms, and they contain the capillaries of the liver here. These are called sinusoids. And the blood flow within the lobules goes from the corners to the center. And here, for example, we have in the corners the smallest vessels of the blood supply networks, and we have in the center the turbulent. The terminal vessels of the outflow network here. So, in an ischemic way, we can just think of the circulation in the liver like these three networks and the sinusoids in the middle. But why it's important to study the circulation in the liver? So, liver diseases cause dangerous changes on hemodynamics. Changes on hemodynamics. Here we have an example of this. In this study, the authors measure the pressure in different points of the liver vasculature in rats in three cases. In the normal case, the rats have a healthy liver, and then for the fatty liver, we have the data in cramps, and then for the cirrhosis case, we have the data in black. That in black circles. So here we have this figure. This is the pressure in different points of the liver vasculature. And here we have the values at the exit of the liver vasculature in the inferior vena cava. And then we have these values in the smallest vessels of the patient vein network. Then we have here these values for the smallest. We have here these values for the smallest pacets of the portal vein network, the blue network. And then we have here the values for the intrans of the portal vein network. And we can see that liver diseases don't cause significant changes here in the outflow network, but they cause more significant changes in the portal drain network. Portal brain network. So we have an increase in portal pressure, and this is called portal hypertension. This is the main affectation in the hemodynamics in the liver when we have liver diseases. So, about the motivation and the goal of this project, we noticed that many words only address a portion. Address a portion of the hepatic vasculature, but just few words address the entire liver vasculature. And we also saw that many models and data on liver circulation, there are many models and data on liver circulation in animals but not in humans. And the most of the studies on liver diseases just focus on the biological causes of the problem. Causes of the problem, but not on the physical or mechanical causes. And it is well known that vascular alterations in these diseases increase the resistance to flow within the organ. So our goal is to develop a model of the entire human liver vasculature to study how vascular alterations due to liver diseases, particularly fibrosis in this case, affect the blood flow of brain. Affect the blood flow and pressure within the organ. So, first, we propose a circulation model in a healthy river, in the healthy case, and this model takes into account the pulsatile behavior of the blood flow pressure and the elasticity of the vessel walls. First, we needed to propose our vascular Our vascular liver networks. So, from many different papers, we found different information of these networks. We know the dimensions of the first vessel of this network. We know the dimensions of this largest vessel. We also know the pressure drop in these networks, the flow in the network, and the blood volume. The network and the blood volume within these networks. So we propose a theoretical framework. We have here two equations, one for the pressure drop and one for the volume here. And in these equations we know everything except for these ratios. We don't know the radius ratio between the vessels of two subsequent levels in the network and we Subsequent levels in the network, and we don't know the length ratio. We also don't know the capital N, but it is the total number of the branching levels here in this network. So we tested different values of N in these equations until we reach the radius of these smallest pesos in the network. And in this way, we obtain this dimension radius. These dimension ratios at n, and we obtain these construction rules for our networks. Then we designed the sinusoids tool and we found these values for the sinusoids in humans. So we have the radius, the flow rate, and the pressure drop, and we use Darcy's law to obtain the length which meets these physiological values in the sinusoids. Values in the sinusoids, and we also proposed the number of the sinusoids in our model because we divided the total liver blood flow by the flow rate in a sinusoid. Then, to consider the consatite behavior of the blood flow and pressure and the elasticity of the vessel walls, we used 1D elastic model proposed earlier in the group of the Earlier, in the group of Corvera. We used this model for each hepatic vessel in our model. And we needed to find elastic parameters in the liver vessels. So we found this relationship values for the young modulus and well thickness in the vessel. Well, we need Well, we need to impose some boundary conditions in the model, and for the healthy liver model, we found the blood flow waveform at the inlet of the patient artery network and the blood flow waveform at the inlet of this portal vein network. And we also impose the physiological pressure value here at the exit of the patient network. So these waveforms come from. So these waveforms come from an evil measurement in a healthy person. And I just want to clarify that a flow waveform is a flow as a function of time. And this curve is pulsatile that is a periodic function, but we are just using one cycle. And as an outlet of this model, we are obtaining. Of this model, we are obtaining here at the inlet of the blood supply networks the pressure waveform. So, we obtain here the pressure at the inlet of the hepatic artery network, and here we obtain the pressure at the inlet of the portal brain network. Our results are in blue, and I am showing you the results from other model in red. So So we obtain inlet pressure waveforms within the physiological range reported in the literature, and we also are obtaining these curves very similar to other work. So we validate the model in this way. But what happened in a phibotic liver? So in a fibrotic liver, there are different observations. So the first one is that the february. That the fibrous tissue in the liver stiffens the liver, and this causes that the young modulus of the sinusoids, of the one sinusoids, change. So, we found the healthy liver value for the young modulus in the sinusoids and the fibrotic value. So, in our model, we emulate this change. This change by taking the healthy value and then taking the fibrotic value for the young modules in the species. Then, another observation is that this fibrous tissue in the liver compresses the sinusoids, so the sinusoids are narrowing. And we emulate this in our model using a cross-sectional area for the compressed inuscript as a just a Cinusoid as just a fraction of the area of the healthy sinusoid. And then we have this another observation. So there is a kind of angiogenesis in the fibrotic liver. This angiogenesis is called splitting angiogenesis. And here in the sinusoid, what that happened that two opposite points in the what sinusoid What signals are getting closer and closer until they touch each other, and then the signals will just divide it in two. And we are emulating this in the model, double the number of the sinusoids and reduce the radius by half. So the boundary conditions that we are using here is, as I showed you before, the The pressure doesn't change a lot here in this network because of the thyrotic condition. So, we are using here the healthy value for the pressure. And we are using here, for example, at the inlet of the portal brain network, the flow in order to have a model to be able to change the pressure here, to observe the changes in pressure. And we are putting here. pressure. And we are putting here the the pressure waveform uh as an inlet uh in the empathic artery network. Then the results are we observe significant changes in pressure waveforms here in the fibrotic sinusoids and in the portal vein network. So we are observing uh we are obtaining the increasing portal pressure, the portal tension. The portal temperature. And I just want to show you here the pressure waveform here at the inlet of the fibrotic sinusoids. So here we have the case of the stiff-necked sinusoids in red, and then we have the case the healthy case in green. And for the stiffened sinusoids, we are observing an increase in amplitude of. Increase in amplitude of the pressure wafer, but the mean value does not change. So we are obtaining that the stiffness in the sinusoids just perturb the pressure, but the mean value doesn't change. And for compressing sinusoids, we have here this curve in blue, and we have again here the healthy case. And we are observed that the compression caused. Compressed sinusoids cause a significant increase in the mean value of the pressure waiver respect to the health decays. And finally, for the splitting sinusoids, we have the same result. We have here an increase, splitting xenosoids cause a significant increase in the mean value of the pressure waveform respect to the health decays. But the most important question here is: are our Question here is: Are our results in agreement with those reported clinically in patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis? And to answer that, I want to show you here this scan. This is the pressure in different locations of the liver, in the portal vein, in the sinusoids, and in the hepatic vein. And this is a representative scan for different cases. So, here we have So here we have the healthy case, the fatty liver is in orange, and then we have the cirrhotic liver in red. And we can observe that again the pressure does not change a lot here in the hepatic vein network, but we have an important increase in pressure here in the portal vein. And for medical doctors, they just decided to get the difference in pressure here. Difference in pressure here between these two points, between the heapatic vein and portal vein, as an important parameter to diagnose cirrhosis and to monitor the risk in the patients. So they decided to get this difference and this parameter needs to be less than five millimeters of mercury in the healthy case. Of mercury in the healthy case, in normal healthy persons, and is larger than 5 mm of mercury in portanipotential, and is larger than 10 mm of mercury in the circotic case. So our results, in our results, this parameter is for compressed sinusoids 9 mm of mercury, and for splitting sinusoids, it is almost 11 mm. Almost eleven millimeters of mercury. So the answer is yes. We are obtaining a resulting agreement with those reported clinically in fibrotic patients. And that's it. Thanks for your attention. Okay, time for questions. I know you're interested in understanding regeneration. The lever has this amazing capacity to regenerate. But the thing with regeneration is that in the lever, when you go from just a fighting lever to then the damn it to some person, uh the lever stops having its capacity to deal with it. I wonder if there's any typical phase transition from having a reversible damage which is finally finished to an irreversible damage. Oh, it's very uh for the case for the fatty liver is very interesting because uh there there are many people with fatty liver and There there are many people with fatilibra and they even don't know. Um but the fatilibra is just like uh to get uh fat drops in the tissue liver. And in the earlier stages, this is reversible because it's just like to get a healthy diet, yeah, and doing exercise and we know, we all know, we know, um, but yeah, it's Um but yeah, it's it's reversible. But there is a point that the fatty liver uh becomes in fibrosis and then in cirrhosis and then the worst case is uh liver cancer. But it's not reversible at that point. And as the first question you you say is to study the regeneration of the river, and this is something if This is something different because that happens, for example, in a liver transplantation. But if you have a sick liver, they just take out the entire liver from you, and you receive a healthy liver, a portion of a healthy liver from someone else. So this portion, the medical doctors put this portion on you, and this is able to grow because it's a healthy liver. Because it's a healthy liver. And the other person that gives you a portion of his liver is able to grow too. So that happens with this regeneration of the liver. They are not putting on you as the liver. Quick one, I guess. Have people look at any other organs? Organs, the liver. Any other organs? Any other organs? Not just the liver, liver produced, or look at other organs. That regeneration. That capacity is just for the liver. There is no other organ with that capacity. And it's most amazing because in the liver there is not just the capacity that it is able to grow. It is able to be smaller too. So, if you get a portion so big for your body in a liver transplantation, it is able to be smaller in order to be in a good size for you. Can you just put your last slide to to you you study these compressed sinusoids and splitting sinusoids? And splitting signs. So, which of these corresponds to which of the diseases? I forgot. All of these observations are in the fibrotic case, so it corresponds to cirrhosis, because fibrosis is like the early stage of cirrhosis. In fact, you have fibrosis in all the liver diseases at some point. So, what the Point. So, what about the intermediate disease? Let's say this one in yellow, what was this name? It's fatty liver. How can you model that? Yeah, the fatty liver has another observation, but it's almost the same. For example, here we have for the fatty liver, we have this one too: the compression of the sinusoids, but the compression is for not for femus. Not for fibrous tissue, it's for fatty drugs that you have in the tissue in the liver. And the sinuses are compressed. And the elasticity of the liver in the fatty liver is different, it's more soft the other direction. So last quick question about is what about the scheme? Because you said the liver is the only organ that can generate certain sentences as we As we get to move it, we are also original skin, so uh what is the difference of the skin different? Oh yeah, yeah, I just I am not thinking of the skin like an organ, but you are right. You are right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can have a scarf like when you just yeah, but I am just not thinking about I am just talking about uh the inner organs. The inner organs
