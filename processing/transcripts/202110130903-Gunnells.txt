Thank you very much for the invitation to speak. This is talking about joint work with Dan Yasaki. And I'll start by giving an overview of what we're trying to do. If it goes off the bottom of the page, please yell at me or something. We'll try to fix it itself. I'll try to find a bird's person. There's currently There's currently some Zoom stuff blocking the bottom of the screen. Annoying. Okay, so here's the, I'll give you the setup, sort of the introduction. So we're going to let F be the rational function field, and that's actually the main function field that we're thinking about. And then O is the polynomial ring inside there. And we're going to let gamma be And we're going to let gamma be a subgroup of G L N O, congruent subgroup. And our goal is that we want to compute H cohomology of gamma with coefficients in, I mean, right now just rational cohomology, but could be in some module. It's not a big change. And maybe the homology or similar things. Okay, let's see why. Similar things. Okay, I'll see why I'm being a little cagey at the moment and later. And really, this is really a computational story. We really are interested in computing explicitly these groups for various congruent subgroups and most importantly to compute the Hecke action on the cohomology. We really want to know what the Hecke eigenvalues are and what how the eigenclasses work because we want to understand Work because we want to understand what the explicitly compute when these scale representations are, just like in Auburner's talk on the very first day of the conference. So there has been some previous work done on this subject. So in n equals 2, we have work of Teidelbaum. Teidelbaum was around 1992. And we have later work. And we have later work by Armana. It's around 2000s. Peitelbaum's paper is kind of sat for a while, but Armana took this paper and developed applications of modular symbols and also did some explicit computations for n equals 2. More recently, we have a student of Berkeley, Shakur, who did similar investigations. Did similar investigations. We have, these are all using modular symbols in the same kind of spirit that I'm talking about today, but there are other investigations that are also more recent. So they're using completely different methods, but I want to mention them because they're very interesting. There's Alvarenga. This is around 2017, I suppose. I suppose and more recent joint work of Al Varengo with Lorshid and Yunior. This is 2021. But these, so these noise modular symbols may have the advantage that they work over, method works over different fields, different underlying curves, but the sort of drawback is that. But the sort of drawback is that it doesn't really work, it doesn't seem to work well with level structure, so it's full level. So you can't really see kind of what we're trying to see using these techniques. However, they are very interesting, and the relationship between these between this and modular symbols is not clarified. So, okay, so I want to. What about the work of Kano and Yasuda? Does that fit into what you're talking about? Into what you're doing. Well, I'm going to talk about that, yes. Let me just go ahead and bring, I was going to mention that later, but I will go ahead and mention that now. So, for n bigger than or equal to 2, we have the work of Kondo and Yasuda. Comes from, there was an original paper written around 2014 that has been superseded by something that came out this year. And so, what they do is develop sort of the good theory of what might. A good theory of what you might call a universal modular symbol. So, a large portion of what Ash and Rudolph did, and I'll go over that. But they don't, it's not, in that form, it's not suitable for computation. There's more to make it. So our contribution is to build on that, which the case n equals two was also done by Teidelbaum, is to build on that and to turn it into something that you can actually compute with. You can actually compute with. Okay, so let me talk about the sort of classical case of SLNC, since it would be remiss if this was the only talk where this was not discussed in length. But I think it's a warm-up and it's very friendly, and people should be certainly familiar with it in many forms. So this is due to Ash and Rudolph. 1979. And so here's the setup. So I'm going to let X be symmetric space S L N R S O N and so just fix ideas, dimension is equal to n plus 1, choose 2, 1 is 1, and we've been and we're going to let gamma be excuse me subgroup SLNZ carbon subgroup typically and we're going to consider the quotient x divided by gamma okay and so we're interested in computing with homology or homology of this so I want to describe what Of this. So I want to describe what a modular symbol is, and I'm going to describe it in several different ways, just to give, because for connection to what we're going to talk about later. But let me give a pretty low-tech description of what it is. So we have a different model for X in terms of the space C of positive definite quadratic forms in variables. modulo homothades. And we can construct subsets of this in the following way. So if I take some vectors v1 up to vn and zn non-zero, then these give rise to a symbol Okay, it's going to be class, modular symbol. Here's one way to construct what this is. You can take the Vi's and they give rise to some rank one quadratic forms. Just by thinking about them as being column vectors and multiply by this, you get a quadratic form of rank one, so it's not positive definite. But this sits inside the boundary of, if you take the closure. If you take the closure of the positive definite quadratic forms, and then if you take the image of this, you take the interior, this part, take the linear combination, or convex hole, and then you intersect with C, the interior, and then you project down. You get a certain subset geometrically. You get a sub a certain subset, a geometrically defined subset of x. Okay, and then you can further pass down the quotient gamma and you get something inside y. Okay, and so you get a class. Now that's this so this where does this class live? Well for the purposes of this talk, I'm going to say that it lives in H n minus one, the Borel Moore homology. The Borel-Moore homology of Y. Or this is in, yeah, this is going to be in Y. Okay, so if you think about it, this is being taken mod gamma, so it lives in Y. So what is that? That is the homology, so-called homology with closed supports. So H V M spiral more. Homology, which is homology of the flow supports. And that's how I want to think about it. So another way to think about what this is is you can think of taking You can think of take a torus, take a rational maximal split torus and SLN R and you can just take the take take the orbit, take T orbit through a base point, some of the terms. A base point, some fixed point. The base point, like, and that gives some subspace inside x, and then down inside y after takes a quotient, and you're getting exactly the same set. Take the Borel-Moore fundamental class with that, you get exactly the same set of things. Okay? There's another construction, which was sort of the original. was sort of the original picture, which I'm not going to say yet, original AR picture description. I will talk about that in a moment, but I just want to mention these for now. Okay, so for, I mean, I'm sure most people are certainly at least half the people are very well aware of what this situation is, but if not, I mean, Is, but if not, here's a sort of classical example: when n equals 2, and then in that case, h is just the upper half plane. And what happens is, so we're choosing these vectors v1 and v2 in that case, and so those just give us cusps, some points at infinity in the upper half plane. And we can think about this, either one of these pictures gives the same thing, just gives sort of a Sort of this guy running like this between these two paths. So, this edge, geodesic, whatever reasonable path you want to take running between those two. Okay, and then when you map down to y, which is gamma going into x, then you get a locally symmetric space, and so that's going to be some kind of punctured surface like this. I'm not compactifying it, so it's missing these points. It's missing these points. And then the image of this is some kind of geodesic that starts at a cusp and wraps around, goes all over the place, but eventually winds up going back into some other cusp. So it's not a usual homology class in the sense that its support is closed. It sort of leaks off to infinity. If you fill in the punctures by compactifying, then you wind up with a relative homology class mod of the boundary. Okay, so you can also think of it that way. Okay, so you can also think of it that way if you want. And in this setting, these classes were investigated extensively by Monin, but they had their origins in work of Maser and Birch. So, okay, so Ash and Rudolph described some relations among these classes, chiganeses. Known to the audience, I'm sure. So, first of all, what are the relations? Well, it's anti-symmetric. So, if you take some permutation of this, you pick up a sign. Okay, just take a permutation, anti-symmetric, and it vanishes if they're not. And it vanishes if they're not linearly independent. If they're delinearly independent, then it's a zero. And if you scale, if you like, actually, you could be working with rational vectors instead of medical vectors. It doesn't matter so much. But if you scale, lambda is. Lambda is in plus or minus 1, doesn't change anything. And you have this big relation, let's say 0 to n, plus to n, of v0 to sine, v0, and you delete i, and you get 0. Okay? And furthermore, you have an action. Furthermore, you have an action of the heck operators on these classes. So the heck operators act. So we get heck operators by taking matrices and integral matrices that don't necessarily have determinant 1. Okay, and then we consider this double coset. There's more, I'm not going to be very careful about level, or I'm just. So in any case, In any case, you can imagine that g has to satisfy some kind of determinant condition with respect to the level of gamma or whatever if you want. It doesn't really matter for the purposes of this talk. But given any element like this, you have this double coset written as a union of single cosets. And it's a finite union. And what you can do is given any class V, any symbol like this, this operator, if you call this Tg. This operator, if I call this Tg, this operator is going to act on this by taking it to the sum. So V gets taken to the sum over I of these representatives, Gi acting on V. And they just act column-wise. And now you might complain, well, well, they're in M and Z, so it's not a big deal, but usually we take these to be primitive vectors, scale them back down. In any case, it's not that essential. The point is that you have an action. And furthermore, You have an action. Furthermore, you have a subset of nice modular symbols that actually give you a finite set of representatives of a finite spanning set of the homology modulo of gamma. We have called the unimodular symbols. So these are the ones where if you take the determinant. Absolute value, with any representative of it, you're going to get one. Okay? There's finitely many of these mod gamma. And we also know, again, this is all coming from Aster Rudolph. We also know that any modular symbol can be written as the finite sum of unimodular symbols. Okay, you can write any modular symbol as a finite sum. It's an explicit algorithm, which is not unique in general, but it's an explicit algorithm. It doesn't, and it's a very effective algorithm. It's very fast. Okay, so that almost, so I mean, this picture has been seen many times, including in the last lecture, but no, you have to draw it. It's just such a fun picture. What did these modular symbols do? Such a fun picture. What did these modular symbols look like? Well, it's a so-called Fari tessellation. You start with a triangle with vertices at 0, 1, and infinity, and then you act on it by SL2Z and move it everything around like this until you get this picture. Okay, those are what the unit modular symbols look like. And then a general modular symbol will be something that starts over here and kind of goes over like this. And then you try and, the algorithm just writes this red thing as a sum of these blue things. Is a sum of these blue things. In the case n equals 2, there is an essentially unique way to do this because you can just use the classical continued fraction algorithm. But for bigger n, it's a slightly different nature of the algorithm. Okay? And finally, to put it all together, to really get something where we can actually compute something, we need to know relations among these unimodular symbols. We know how to reduce any modular symbol to a unimodular one so we can. Unimodular ones, so we can. If we start with unimodular ones, we can act on them by heck operator, and then we can try to rewrite them in terms, we can write them in terms of these unimodular ones. But to really know what's going on, we have to know the relations among these unimodular ones. And that we know. So we know the gamma relations among the Unimods. Okay, and this one is computed. Okay, this was computed by Ash for n less than or equal to 4 in 1980 and more recently by Kovsky for all in 2003. I should also mention this paper by Churchman gives a different approach to Vykovsky's result. Each result. But the upshot of all this is that we have an explicit model for this Relmohr homology group. This is with rational coefficients, but I could ramp it up to have other coefficient modules just by being a little fancier with my coefficients on the symbols. Symbols and it's explicit modeled, it's computable, and you can find hectigan values as much as you want. Okay, so that's the sort of classical setup. Now, I want to talk about function field case. We've got the rational function field. So just to remind you, f is rational function field post polynomial ring. Okay, and there is a, we need something for this, you know, we're going to take gamma to be inside G L N O, and we want, we need first something to have a replacement for our symmetric space. So here's how does that work? Well, there's a unique place that we call infinity. We call infinity. It's the unique place of this field with uniformizer 1 over t, which I'll call pi. So I was very used before I began this. I was very much more used to number fields. And function fields are very strange. So function fields do not have any arc median places, which is very bizarre if you're used to number fields. If you're used to number fields, it's you know, but it turns out it's a feature, not a bug. So you have, you can, in fact, get to pick what you want to be your Archimedean place, which is very unusual. Everything is S integers in this context. But you get to pick, and for the rational function field, the traditional place to pick as being infinity is to pick, an Archimedean place is to pick this one. And the reason is that when you compute the S integers with respect to this place, Integers with respect to this place, the set of places, you get the polynomial ring. So that's why we think about the rational function field, we think about what should be the ring of integers in there. It should be the polynomial ring. And so this is what makes that happen. But you could pick something else, and you could even pick more places if you want. You don't have to pick just one. This is what we'll take. It's nice because it's sort of different looking from all the other ones, and it's also has to go anyway. Well, anyway, it's what's always done. And then you take, you have completion, you have completions of these with respect to the discrete valuation you get from that place. And we build what's called the Bruha Ts building from this. Okay, and this is our replacement for X. And so I'm going to go through the construction, even though I'm sure many people know it, but I just want to make sure that everybody has a picture of what it looks like. Of what it looks like. So we take the vector space, in-dimensional vector space Fn, and then we take, so a lattice inside here means a free rank NO submodule. Okay, and then we define an equivalence relation on lattices by saying that two are the same. So it's very different, it's not the same. It's not the same as lattice and Rn, not at all, but it's what we call a lattice. And we take an equivalence relation on them. L is equivalent to L prime if there exists a relation of the form L equals lambda L prime, where lambda is n F cross. So their relations are considered equivalent if they are given, one is a homophetic image of another. And then we let bracket L be this equivalence class. Bracket that will be this equivalence class. Equivalence class. This gives us the vertices of the building. So the building is actually a simplicial complex, and these are the vertices. And then to make a simpler complex, we need some simplicity. So here's how we do that. So the edges Edges. We have an edge between two lattices, classes. If we have a chain, we have a flag, a one-step flag of lattices in following form. So if I take pi uniformizer times L, I can find a lattice L prime in between and have that sitting inside L. So for all the lattices sitting in between L pi times L and L, Pi times L and L, I get an edge between their equivalence classes, between their vertices. And one can check that this is actually a symmetric relationship, even though it doesn't look very symmetric. But to get higher-dimensional simplices, so k-semplices come from k-step flags. Okay, in other words, you have chain, you have pi. words you have chain you have pi times L sitting inside L1 sitting inside L2 dot dot dot and sitting inside Lk sitting inside L and these are all strict solutions okay and so the result when you paste it all together is you get a simplicial complex of dimension n minus one and And minus 1, and it's contractible. And it plays the role of the symmetric space. This is going to be our symmetric space. And the group gamma acts on this. And we put y to be the quotient. Okay? And as before, we're going to want to compute with Rel Moore. For L more homology, you can read n minus 1 of y. That's where monological symbols are going to live. Okay, now I can say a little more about what Kondo and Yasuda did. So, what Kanda and Yasuda did was work out basics behind these modular symbols and recovered basically what you see in a substantial part of what you see in. A substantial part of what you see in Ash-Rudolph paper, so the analog of Ash-Rudolph. Okay, and actually their paper is more general. It's working for any function field, not just the rational function field, with a single place at infinity. But the best results are in the case of the rational function field. That's where I think. That's where they get the most. So, if you think back to the picture of the modular symbols for SANZ, there was a connection between torus orbits and classes of torus orbits in the image when you go down my gamma. And so the analog in this case is what you call apartments. So, there's this distinguished class of subcomplexes called rational apartments. So, take what are called the rational apartments. What are called the rational apartments, F-rational apartments, and this is like the torus orbits from before and they give subcomplexes and they give classes in H and minus one B M of Y and they showed that these span H B M, they span this homology group. That's not necessarily true when you get away from the rational function field, but it is true in the rational function field case. And now I want to say a little bit more about what's different about what they do. So you know it's this is the function field analog of what Ash and Rudolph do. Ash and Rudolph do? So, you know, how is what's really different about this case? So, the way that Ash and Rudolph built their classes was the following. So, they started with the Tietz building, and they started with H, the n minus 2 of the Tietz building. Okay, so that's not a torus, that's the Tietz building. And then from this, there's a map from this, which is a homotopy equivalence between this and the boundary. Of X bar, which is the Borel-Serre compactification, a partial boardification of the global symmetric space. So Tn is the Cheats building and X bar is the Burl Ser. Okay, and then from there, you have an inclusion or a map into or map into the relative homology, h n minus 1 of x bar, rel the rel ser, again, rel the boundary. And then from here, you can take a quotient by gamma and you get a map down to y bar here now. Sorry, it should be a y. And now this is a manifold with corners, okay? So now you have a Manifold with corners. Okay, so now you have a class in the relative homology group of this manifold modest boundary, and so that's the Borel-Moore class. Okay, that's one way you can think about what they are. Take a compactification, take classes for all the boundary. Now, Kando and Yasuda, in fact, just one more step that can be taken is you can go from this by Poincaré duality to something in HVCD, the cohomology of HVCD. The cohomology of H D C D of Y. Okay? So Kondo and Yasuda don't work this way. They don't use the same idea. In fact, what they do is something what Heilbaum did, which goes back to Sarah's book on trees. So you can define subcomplexes of the building using a stability condition. So you can interpret the building in terms of vector bundles on In terms of vector bundles on the underlying curve, in this case P1, and you can use notions of stability and so on from that to define subcomplexes. It's somewhat technical, so I won't go into it in detail. But doing that, you can take the Teeth building, okay, and you can send it to not the Beryl-Sair boundary, but what they send it to is a relative homology group, Hn minus. group, Hn minus 1 of the building, and then there's a subcomplex which I'm going to call X alpha. So this alpha is a real parameter that has to do with the stability condition that I'm omitting discussing. And so if you go look at Sarah's book on trees, he writes this out in detail. It's also in title, but it's much easier to understand in that case. But it just, this X alpha. But it just this x alpha is a subcomplex the unstable region with respect to this parameter alpha. And it's basically, I mean, what you can think about it is that it's like you chopped off the building, went out some distance in the building, and then chopped it off. And this is like a little, you know, instead of reaching all the way out to infinity, there's some sort of partial cutting off, okay? And that, another perspective on that is also you can look at work of sacred. That is also, you can look at work of Saper, who gave a construction of the Borel-Sarah compactification of a global boardification of the global symmetric space and compactification of the locally symmetric space by using what he calls pilings. And so these are, there's a parameter that goes out, cuts off infinity, but then what you're left with is actually a little copy of the Borel Serre. If you cut off infinity in just the right way, they'll make the boundary components for the Borel Ser. And so in some senses, it's like that. It's the same. So, in some senses, it's like that. It's the same kind of idea. So, instead of using something like the Borel stare, which does exist in this context, it's not as useful as in the number field case because it's not a manifold with boundary. This thing's not a manifold. It's very bizarre-looking simplicity complex. So it's not a manifold. Okay. So, all right. But then, after doing this, they can They can go down to the quotient. So take y and then take y alpha, which would just be the image of this under the quotient. And then they have to take a direct limit over this parameter alpha to get the Brelmore homology. So it's building it from within instead of from without. Okay, that's one way to think about what's happening. But it is different. It is different. It's a different construction. Okay. Now, so that, so they, and that, that technology reproduce a lot of what Ash and Rudolph did. So if I'd like to say what we have done, our contribution is following. So, first of all, you can identify You can identify unimodular symbols again. Okay, and they're what you might expect. So we want them to be, we want them to have, they don't want to have, they can't have an interesting determinant. So what we want is that if you take the valuation of the determinant of the Vi. Of the Vi's, you're going to get zero. In other words, the determinant lives in Fq cross. Okay, so this is the valuation. Valuation. And moreover, any modular symbol can be written as a sum of finite sum of unimods. Okay. So this continuum fraction algorithm that already works over Z is going to work here too, because it's, I mean, Z is very similar to FQ of T, so that's not that surprising. Unfortunately, a lot of the computational tricks that we do to compute, to actually compute this decomposition over number fields, we can't do in this setting because we don't know how to do it exactly yet. But we can do it. We can just, I don't have all the tricks available. It we can just have all the tricks available that we know about other settings. Okay, and finally, we can describe the relation. So we know the gamma relations to present Hn minus 1 Bm. Okay, and guess what they are? Well, they are exactly the same as what you see in Lykowski's paper. It's the same as Bykowski's paper. Paper. It's the same as Waikosi, so the same proof works. Of course, you just have to suitably interpret. And the only difference, the only significant difference is that we have the same, so what relations do you have in Baikovsky's paper? You have, I'll be a little cryptic because, but you have. Cryptic because, but you have this sort of S relation which corresponds to a matrix that looks like this, which is just doing a flip. If you go back to here, this is the two-term relation that flips one of these blue edges. And then you have what you call the three-term relation. They come from this matrix. Okay, and that corresponds to the triangles here, that the boundary of a triangle is zero. The boundary of a triangle is zero. And then you have permutations, the anti-symmetry one. But you have another one that is a little different now for this function field case, and that is that if you act by any diagonal matrix in GLNFQ. DLN FQ. Do you have more units now? Okay? You don't just have plus or minus one. We have all of FQ cross. So you have all those units. So you can take the columns of your modular symbol and you can act by any of those units. That doesn't change anything. Okay? And this means that you can effectively compute. With this group. Okay? So I want to go, I'm running short on time, so I want to show you some examples. First of all, here's just a picture of GL2, which a lot of people know from seeing Sarah's book on trees. So it's a tree, which is the case Q equals 2, so it's a regular. which is the case q equals 2, so it's a regular tree at degree q plus 1. And there's the extra numbers that I've labeled here. These numbers reflect the action of G L 2 O on the tree. So two vertices are equivalent if under the action of G L2O, if and only if they have the same labeling. And here's how the labeling works. So it starts at zero and then it goes up to one and then when you at any higher number every label connected to it is one length Every label connected to it is one less, but there's two zeros there, except for one, which goes up. So starting at zero, and once you take a step to one, there's a unique way to go out to infinity along this ever-increasing chain of numbers. And so the unimodular symbols are exactly those paths, those paths that decrease, have one zero, and then go out. The non-unimodular ones are the ones that come in, decrease, then maybe bounce up and down around a bunch of zeros, and then eventually go back up. A bunch of zeros and then eventually go back out. If you don't go out to infinity along one of these sequences of numbers, then you're essentially headed to an irrational cusp. You're not going to a rational cusp. So here's an example of computation showing Eisenstein homology in this. So in this case, we're going to take our function field to be F7 of T, and then the level is TQ. The level is T cubed minus 2. So here I'm computing on GL2 and also in GL3. Already on GL2, so this example appears in Tidelbaum. For this level, he computed the Hecke action on modular symbols, and he finds, for example, that the Heck operator pi, where pi is actually T, the variable T, is given by this. So these are the eigenvalues of the Hecke operator on that Borel morphology group, 8 dimensional. Brel morphology group, which is eight-dimensional. The eigenvalue eight is an Eisenstein series, but negative four, this rational eigenvalue, corresponds to this elliptic curve, which has already been found by Geekpler in the 80s. When you look on GL3, you see the same, so you see this cusp class corresponding to this elliptic curve appearing in the cohomology, I mean in the homology on GOP. On GL3. So it's like you had this Eisenstein phenomenon. So when you, this is Abner was talking about this in his talk, you build this thing called the Heke polynomial, which is basically what the local factor of the L function would be for this class, and up to some variable change. And then when you factor this, you see that you have these two quadratic polynomials times these two linear guys. And these two quadratic guys correspond to that elliptic curve. Correspond to that elliptic curve. So this is the minus a p in the L function for an elliptic curve. In this case, it's negative 4, so you get a 4. And you have these extra powers of 7 because there's some twisting going on. So what you see here is Eisenstein classes appearing, coming from GL2 in the homology of GL3. And this is exactly what you see for SL3. See, in computations of a long time ago by Ashbrayson. Long time ago by Ash Brayson in green. You see exactly this phenomenon. The Eisenstein cohomology for trivial coefficients comes from cohomology from SL2 in this way for prime level. So here's another example. One of the nice features of this is that, so according to a theorem of harder, the cohomology vanishes except in one degree. Except in one degree, there's only one degree that you see cohomologically. So it's very different from the number field case, where you have this range of degrees, right? You have this range, like go to GLN, you have the middle dimension, then you have this sort of small range of degrees that's like linked in over two roughly, where the cuspidal cohomology can live. And then the top cohomology is far away from that. The top cohomology is not seeing any of that. So modular symbols, when you get up into degrees bigger than three for GLN, Bigger than three for GLN, you don't see cus forms anymore, except from lower-ranked groups. But that's not what happens for function fields, and that's one of the great, again, one of the great features about function fields, and in some sense, why they're easier or better. So there's only this one non-vanishing group. It is seen by the modular symbols, and that is where the cus forms have to live. They have to be in there, because there's no place else for them to live. And so either there are no cus forms, in which case maybe In which case, maybe, I don't know, maybe LaFort and Frenfell should get back their medals, but that's probably not true. There are cus forms, so there are plenty of them, and you see them right away. So it can be very hard computationally to see them when you're doing GLN over Z or over a number field, because they could be, you have to go to a very high level before you start to see anything. But for a function field, you see it right away. So here's an example for GL3. This time, the results. This time, the raisin field is F2, and the level is the cyclotomic polynomial, fifth cyclotomic polynomial. So in this case, you find some Eisenstein stuff, but you also find a cus form. And this cus form is what's called a non-self-dual cusform. So its eigenvalues live in a totally complex number field. It's a quartic field of signature 0, 2. And they come in complex conjugate pairs. There's two heck operators because you're on GL3 for each prime. And you see, these eigenvalues are complex conjugates of each other. It's not so obvious from this presentation of them because it's done in terms of this primitive element alpha, but they are complex conjugates of each other. Okay. What else did I want to say about that? I think that's good enough. So I think I'm about out. That's good enough. So, I think I'm about out of time. If I can just have one more minute, I want to say some further questions. So, the first thing is to look at other groups. So, this result of harder is true for any simply connected simple groups. Not just diagnosis. So, scientific development is about SLN, not about. His development is about SLN, not about GLN, but anyway, puts a little S versus G between friends. So, but we can look at other groups, potentially do the same thing. In particular, the symphlectic group is potentially very interesting. So, at least for sp4, we have this explicit complex due to McPherson and McConnell that gives us all the relations. Apparently, there's work that I don't know about that gives a lot more information, so I'm excited to hear that. So, let's say tentative. To hear that, so let's say tentatively until I know exactly what's going on there, maybe sp2n. But this is another opportunity. So we know that the again, it's all modular symbols. It's all modular symbols. And there's no cuspidal range. There's no middle dimension to deal with. It's just all metop degrees. It would be very interesting to do computations with that. But of course, one needs to make sure that everything works out. And the next, the final thing is about other F. Okay? So Kondo and Yasuda. So Kondo and Yasuda, in their work, they give a, like I said, they fix one place at infinity and work with that, which of course we, in number field case, you can't do. You can't say, I want to do real quadratic fields, and I only want to have one Archimedean prime. You will not pass your qualifying exam. If you'll do that, because it's very bad. But in the function field case, you can do that. But you have to pay a price. I mean, you can't get something for nothing. So that's one. So that's one, so it would be interesting to investigate other f when you have one place at infinity. But then also the example where you have what we expect. So if you start with a rational function field, you start with f q of t, and you do an extension, okay, then the place at infinity will go up and there'll be some splitting. There'll be some set of infinite places up there, the same as what you have. Up there, the same as what you have in the number field case. And so, what you have to do in this case is take a product of buildings the same way that you do for, like we're doing Hilbert modular forms, et cetera. You have to take a product of symmetric spaces before you take your quotient. So this is sort of the more natural thing to do. But we don't know in this case, sort of any, you know, over number fields, we have examples. We have this general Voronoi, Voronoy. Fournoy Kirchher theory of how to build these cell complexes that we compute with. Whether or not you can actually do it for a given example remains to be seen. It may be computationally too expensive, but at least there's a method you can do. We know what to do. But we don't have any such method in this case. And there's a potential that there is. I believe there should be because these buildings for GLN, for Buildings for GLN, for SLN, they have an interpretation in terms of what are called additive norms. So they're kind of like the negative of the logarithm of a norm, like a tropicalization of a norm. So in that sense, there is a model for these spaces that is like the quadratic forms model. It's just that it's like a tropical version of that because you've taken logarithm. So there should be some kind of Vornoy theory. There should be some kind of Vornoi theory, there's some theory of perfect forms. And if you look at GLN over the rational function field, it certainly seems clear that's what's going on, although I don't have any precise way to say that. And I also don't have any way to take advantage of that for an extension of the rational function field. But I think that that is a possibility and could lead to some more computations and more examples of interesting Yale representations. Singal presentations. So I think I'll stop there. Do we have any questions? Can I ask a que, can you hear me? Yeah. What happens with just the rational function field, but you take a different place for your infinity? Infinity. I think it's no problem. You just get new things that you didn't see before. No, I don't know about that. I don't know. So I have a question. I'm sorry to interrupt. You will in the following sense. So, like, for example, this elliptic curve. Okay, the elliptic curve. This elliptic curve. Okay, the elliptic curve has that place in its conductor because it is okay. So the automorphic forms that you get are the ones that are Steinberg at that infinite place. So if you change that place, you're going to be changing the forms. So you're definitely going to change what you get. So, I mean, in that sense, yes. Will it be like so different that you would want to do it? I don't know. You're definitely going to be computing different things. Definitely going to be computing different things. So, if you want, in the GL2 case, if you wanted to compute tables of elliptic curves, there's actually no one seems to have done. There's no analog of corona for that case. You would only see certain, you would see elliptic curves with certain kind of, infinity has to be in their conductor and they have to have, I think, split multiplicative reduction there, I think. Not positive, but what was the other question? Sorry, did you take anything? If you tank any analog formula formula simulacrum. Sure, if you tank any degree one place, it won't be any different because you've just found a morphism. We've got the morphism group, right? Okay. If you took a higher degree place, that would be different. And then if you took a different field, you took a different function field, then you don't have any automorphisms anymore. Automorphisms anymore. So take that. But I don't think there's any data. There's not a lot of data about what curves you find or even just for classical, you know, the classical modular forms for GL2. There's some data, but there's not a lot. I'll do it for you, Paul, in my next slide. Do it for you, Paul, in my next slide. Okay. Hey, so I have a question. I'll make a Sims character that's you that will do it for me. What was the question? Oh, sorry, like the sort of social dynamic of talking on Zoom is weird. You never know who's done. But so I was wondering, so you have this construction of all these relations that you said you followed by Kowski's group. Do you think is there any hope for doing that in the style of my paper with Church? Paper with church? I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I only followed by Kovsky because I was most aware of it. But it's certainly possible. It'd be interesting to try that. I mean, the real difference is it depends on, yeah, I mean, that's an interesting idea. Okay, that's right. Paul? Yeah? Is it true that the Serre conjecture kind of thing holds for these guys? Yes, I think that is known. That's the theorem. Yeah. We definitely know, I mean, we know so much more about those kind of questions. Those kind of questions. But that means that this is a way to compute explicitly with such things. So I would like to also ask a couple of questions about the presentation. First of all, I was a little bit confused about what you said on just the generators. Doesn't Azure directly apply to all these function fields because it's Because it's a Euclidean domain? No. I mean, well, this function field is a Euclidean domain. And not all function fields are. I mean, a function field with one variable. What I mean? I'm not sure what you mean. I mean the rational functions of with one variable over any field that One variable over any field that's a Euclidean domain, and so that rule should directly apply. Probably you need the polynomial ring, right? Isn't that the relevant thing that should be Euclidean? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yes, I mean the polynomial ring, not the. Yes, you're absolutely right, Jeremy. I mean the polynomial ring with one variable over field is Euclidean, and so I should apply to that. And so it's generated by a partner. By apartments in that ring, so integral of apartments. Is that the statement of your generators as well? You phrased it differently. You said something with rational apartments, which I don't understand what that's supposed to be. No, it's the same thing. So you can... You can... I mean, they write down... they write a proof and they write an algorithm to do it, and it works. Okay. And and so. And so in your when you go through Bykovsky through that proof, do you use anything specific about this ring or do you only use that as Euclidean? And maybe related to that, you seem to only prove it for
