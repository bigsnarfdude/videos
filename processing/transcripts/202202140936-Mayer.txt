Can you see my screen? Yep, yes. Okay, perfect. Yeah, so I will talk about quantifying structure and immune receptor epitope maps. And so it's very convenient and the way that the organizers have arranged the talks that we've already heard about some work related to TCR specificity just by in the first talk. In the first talk. And so, this is work that I've been mostly doing with Kurt Callan at Princeton that has been pooring now for a number of years, but I haven't yet presented it outside of sort of more local group meetings. So, I'm really looking forward to getting feedback. And I also do intercouracture despite the fact that I'm doing this virtually to intersperse with. Virtually to intersperse with questions if you have, because I rather have questions than lose people if I'm not making sense. So with that, I want to give a very brief introduction. So as we know, the receptor epitope binding is what enables specific adaptive immune responses. In particular, I'll be talking about T cells today. So T cells through their T cell receptor. Fruit adhesive receptors interact with highly diverse ligands, so different peptide MHD complexes. And in the last five years, we've went from knowing a few crystal structures of a few T cell receptors in complex with peptide MHC molecules to getting really much more deeper receptor epitope maps. And what do I mean? Receptor epitope maps, and what do I mean by that? In particular, from the work from Paul Former's lab, also Mark Davis lab, and many other people since. The basic way that these experiments work is that you take a blood sample, you sort specific T cells, and then you sequence their receptor sequences. And then you can look at how these different clonotypes that all put clonotypes that all putatively respond to the same epitope, how they look like, and in what ways they might be similar or not similar. And one visualization of that is shown down here based on data from Dash and L 2017. And what is plotted here is a matrix of pairwise distances where on the lower diagonal Where on the lower diagonal, one has the pair rest distances of the CDR3 alpha sequence. And on the upper diagonal, above the diagonal, the pair is distances between CDR3 beta sequences. And here the sequence distance is defined very simply as sort of an added distance, just a number of insertions and deletions or changes to the amino acid CDF beta sequences. But obviously, there has been a lot of work in the field of trying to refine these distance measures. To refine these distance measures, but for this talk, we're going to keep with these simple ones. And what is very striking about this data has attracted a lot of interest since, is that there is very clearly much more clustering in these set of sequences that one has if one took the same size set of sequences from a background set, so from just a blood sample of the repertoire. Of the repertoire. And for example, here's a very big cluster of sequences that also span multiple subjects that all have highly similar both CF3 alpha and CDF3 beta sequences. But then there's also more isolated clusters of receptors as well. And so now this tells us about the specific set of receptors. The specific set of receptors that recognize one specific target. So we now have this not just for one target, but we're starting to have this for many more targets. So one thing, yeah, so just to sort of fix the idea, so what before I go to that is that actually in these different clusters, there is this high level of sequence similarity, but as already visible from this map, there also Already visible from this map, there also are these very distinct solutions that actually don't have any close-by sequence similarity either on the alpha or the CDF3 beta level. For example, here there's sequence logos for two of these clusters that actually are overall quite distinct, even though locally, clearly there's a lot of similarity between these receptors. And so since we have gotten Have gotten much more data. So, here's two other such maps from the study from Paul Formers. Here's a more recent study on SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. So this should be 2020, obviously not 2017 for this one. And so one can look at a lot of these maps. And then obviously, every time one understands the specific set of receptors that respond to a specific target. To a specific target. But one thing that from this remains unclear is how to go and think about whether there are any general principles that come out of this collection of sort of anecdotes about how receptors cluster that recognize one specific target. And so ultimately, Ultimately, but obviously, we will keep generating this data for many, many more receptors, and that's going to be useful for thinking about these receptors. But if we want to understand on the repertoire level how receptors, T cell receptors are matched to the ligands, we need to maybe also take a broader statistical approach. And the need for that is illustrated by the numbers that. The numbers that are involved in this problem. So, on the one hand, it has been estimated that V D cherry combination can produce up to 10 to the 61 different alpha-beta receptors. And on the other hand, there's many, many different, for example, here in the context of CD8 epitopes. If one says, looks at 9 merc, there's on the order of 10 to the 11 different potential 9 merc. If one looks at 11 merc, there's 10 to the 14. So there's a very, very large number. So, there's a very, very large number of different ligands and a very large number of different receptors. Obviously, of the different epitopes, not all of them will be presentable, but still that leaves a very vast diversity. And so really what I think would be very exciting is if from this steadily increasing set of examples of getting a row of A row of entries basically in this very big matrix of all the receptors that the system can potentially make and all the peptide MHC targets that it can potentially recognize. Can we extrapolate and can we somehow start building a quantitative theory about rules for the mapping between receptors and their targets? And what I want to present is Is some sort of initial attempts, let's say, at trying to move away from clustering a specific set of receptors and instead trying to look for general statistical signatures of antigen-truman selection. And for example, we'll be asking the question of whether we can say anything quantitative about the probability that if I know that a certain receptor will bind to a target, Bind to a target that if I make a certain number of amino acid changes to that receptor, that it's still going to bind. So, clearly the idea of clustering is that it's much more likely to bind in any other receptor, but can we be quantitative about this? Can we say, if I make a single amino acid change, what's the probability that that's still going to bind a given target? And in order to do that, what we started to do is that we We take this matrix that we had before of pairwise distances, and we look at the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of this matrix. So we can look at the relative frequency with which we find basically two randomly chosen receptors out of that epitope-specific set of receptors at a certain distance. At a certain distance, and curves are shown here for the CDF3 betas sequences, and here for the CDF3 alpha sequences. In the case where we have single-cell data with matched pair chain sequencing for both alpha and beta, we can also combine them as is shown here. And what is very striking about these curves is their comparison with a background curve. So these background curves here. A background curve. So these background curves here are constructed in a similar way by picking random sets of alpha and beta sequences from blood repertoire sequencing. And then assuming independent pairing, what then also obtains a curve for paired for the background that what should expect in paired chain. Expect impaired chain sequencing data. And I just want to highlight here maybe two things. One thing is the sheer level of enrichment of these coincidences, especially when looking at the full clonotypes, so the four alpha and beta sequence, which in the background one would suppose happens only with a frequency of 10 to the minus 12, but actually. Frequency of 10 to the minus 12, but actually, in this three different epitopes that the lab of Paul Homozov, the frequency with which one sees these precisely convergent receptors is actually on the order of 10 to the minus 3. So there's nine orders of magnitude of enrichment of coincidences relative to the background. So clearly a very high level of Of selection. And the other thing that is very striking here, and that we will talk about how to interpret quantitatively in a bit, is that this enrichment extends over quite a range of distances. So over the next, basically, here up to a distance of 10, there's still a very high enrichment. There's still a very high enrichment of finding these differences in an epitope-specific set of receptors relative to finding that same sort of distance in the background set. But at the same time, even in these epitope-specific sets, one sees that at large distances, the distributions look similar to the background, meaning that at large distances, there are some between basically different group of receptors. There are receptors that look as dissimilar from each other. That look as dissimilar from each other as any two receptors chosen and random from a background set. And I think this also sets the stage of what to expect from the kind of machine learning type approaches that one might want to develop for predicting antigen specificity in a particular subset of for a particular target. For a particular target. And with this, what we then found, which is that, well, maybe the right measure to look at is the ratio of this pairwise distance distribution in the selected set of epitope-specific cells relative to the background. And when normalized in that way, you can think about this basically as the autocorrelation. About this basically as the autocorrelation function of the selection factor. And what we found out to a bit to our surprise is that there's a very robust and universal signature of selection across different studies. So in this upper plot, you see, so this is all just to make it comparable. This is all only based on the CDF better chain because in some of the studies. The CDF3 beta chain, because in some of the studies that's the only thing we have. So, this is a set of tetrama-sorted cells from Dash et al. that was there in the previous studies. And one sees that there's on the level now purely of the beta chain, there's a sort of thousand-fold enrichment of coincidences relative to background, of precise coincidences relative to background. And then there's some variability in that. There's some variability in that value across the different targets. And then there's a roughly one order of magnitude drop in this enrichment for every amino acid change. And we then went into a different, more recently published data set using a sort of multiplex technique that is maybe a bit more. That is maybe a bit more promiscuous, so not quite as restrictive as tetrama sorting, and there might also be issues with false positives that a lot of people are worried about. But still sorting all these activation markers and then taking out receptors that one thinks, sorry, why is this jumping around? Sorry, responding, we see that in this set of receptors, we find a lower overall level of enrichment. So this is a Level of enrichment. So, this is across the different targets that they looked at, doing all the possible comparisons within groups of antigen-specific epitope-specific cells. And again, we find that signature of roughly an order of magnitude drop in these near coincidence probabilities with each amino acid change. And another way of identifying clones that putatively target the same epitope is by looking. The same epitope is by longitudinal sampling, such as done in a study by Mina Vina et al., where a set of TCLs was identified that recognized the same, well, that you don't know that they actually recognize the same epitope, because you just know that they came up in response to an infection at a particular point in time. But because of immunodominance, it's going to be a mixture of a set of receptors that Mixture of a set of receptors that recognize a relatively small number of targets. And again, in this analyzing these responding receptors, we again found the same signature of section. There's an exponential decay back to a background with a specific length scale of around one half. And with that, we can then think about a bit more abstractly, what do these coincidence changes tell us about selection. Tell us about selection. So, if you think about a graph where the vertices are the receptor sequences and the edges connect to sequences, if they share a certain sequence similarity, say either precisely identical amino acid sequence or identical up to two, say, amino acid choices. Then, the probability of coincidence at that certain distance is going to be two times the number of edges divided by. Of edges divided by basically the square of the number of vertices. Well, you take out the diagonal as before. And so, if you then say, well, you filter that by saying, I just take all the receptors that are specific to a certain target. Well, the number of vertices is going to decrease by the fraction of receptors that are specific. But the number of edges is going to decrease by a factor that depends on that product of the probability of choosing. Of the probability of choosing that receptor sigma is specific, and the probability of choosing of a receptor sigma prime that is at a certain distance to the receptor sigma, also being specific. So the maximal value for that is going to be: well, if it's the same sequence, then we should think that maybe it has a different nucleotide sequence, but the same amino acid sequence, then what should think that it's actually. Then we should think that it is actually q of sigma times q of sigma prime is just going to be equal to q of sigma. So then the coincidence probability in that sense for precise coincidences is just going to go up as the inverse of the fraction of sequences selected. And then at the sequences, the distances further out, the probability is going to be lower. Going to be lower, but it's still going to be higher than the background because the conditional probability, condition of q of sigma being one, the probability that one of these neighboring sequences is going to bind is going to be higher. And so by comparing the probability, this enrichment, this odds ratio for precise coincidences and near coincidences, we can actually make quantitative statements about the relative probability. Qualitative statements about the relative probability with which neighboring sequences will bind the same target. And we find that neighboring sequences will bind the same target with 10%, about 10% probability. And one thing that we then did further on is that we looked at now paired alpha-betha chain sequencing data from a study by Tano et al. Tunnel et al. That is just straight blood sample. So no sorting was performed for antigen specificity. But if we compared, and these here are a number of different individuals, and if we compared this to a background that you would expect under an independent alpha-beta chain pairing, again, we find the same signature of antigen-driven selection with the sort of same. With the sort of same falloff rate here. And so, what's going on here? Why would you find a signature of antigen-term selection in a repertoire that hasn't been sorted for antigen-specificity? Well, what we think is going on is that we can think of the memory repertoire as a mixture of epitope-specific groups. And if one has such a mixture, the probability of observing a certain sequence sigma is they're sort of given by. They are sort of given by the sum over a set of mixture components with probabilities p of pi, and then there's the probability of sequences within that mixture component. Then one can show that one can decompose the probability of coincidences into a within mixture component and into an across mixture component. And at these small distances, well, across different epitopes. Different epitopes, the coincidences should one would expect follow the background. And one can actually, what is a way of checking this? Well, one way of checking this is that if one compares two individuals that actually don't share HLA types, one would expect that this affects your lessons. And this is indeed what we found. So when restricting, when doing pairwise comparisons between individuals and restrict and then mean individuals and restrict and then looking at levels of a grouping them by levels of HLA overlap what we found that the lower the HLA overlap the more the closer the curves are to to the background that one would expect under independent chain pairing and then given that one can then actually look at the numbers that one gets for this coincidence term One gets for this coincidence term in a full blood repertoire. So these are on the level of 10 to the minus 8. And we can put those together with the level of coincidences that one obtained in these earlier studies for antigen-specific repertoires, which are on the level of 10 to the minus 3. And if we take these two together, we can actually now say Can actually now say something about an otherwise quite elusive quantity, which is the diversity of the set of epitopes targeted by an immune repertoire, which is this term PC of P of pi. And what we find then is that the functional diversity of the human immune repertoire is on the order of 10 to the 5 recognized epitopes. Recognized epitopes, obviously with relatively big error busts, especially coming from the fact that we actually don't have that many examples of this probability of coincidence within epitope-specific groups, but that might get further refined as we get more data. But quite interestingly, that functional diversity is, I guess, within the orders of magnitude that one would expect, meaning. That one would expect, meaning much lower than the full diversity of the underlying clonotypes. But also, still, if we think about how many different types of infections one have, and a lot of them, there will only be relatively small numbers of immunodominant epitopes. Then there's relatively low diversity of only 100,000 different epitope-specific groups, I think, makes quite a bit of sense. Quite a bit of sense. And so, with that, I want to summarize by saying that we believe that looking at pairwise distance distribution, distance distributions, and especially normalizing them by suitable background distributions, provides a very natural statistics of selection and sequence repertoires. Our framework makes the link between similarity and specificity that is often sort of used in clustering approaches more quantitative. Approaches more quantitative, by, for example, showing that neighbors have a 10-hour approach. We have a framework, a theoretical framework for asking what is the functional diversity of an immune repertoire. And we find that the human immune memory repertoire recognizes about 100,000 different epitopes. So, with that, I'm looking forward to your So, with that, I'm looking forward to your questions and the discussion.
