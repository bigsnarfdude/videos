Fantastic. I'm really glad to be here in person. And yeah, so I'm going to tell you a bit of part one and part two, a bit like Phil's talk. First, I will talk a bit about this machine learning of immune dynamics, and I'm going to switch gears a bit and zoom out and talk about the systems immunology of COVID-19. So, just want to first thank my lab. So, these are folks in the lab, and I'll highlight them as I go along, and also folks at the Center for Human Union. Along, and also folks at the Center for Human Immunology with whom we work closely together, especially on some of the human immune profiling aspects. So, first, just to introduce sort of at least my view of what is systems biology and immunology. So, we do sort of both aspects. One, it's as you know, there's this top-down notion of systems immunology. The premise is that there's much that we don't know yet in terms of what are the components and how do those components interact, right? Components interact, right? So, the idea is to discover the components and their interactions in a fairly unbiased way, and also with those, we can start to build black box, for example, machine learning models of the system behavior and outcomes. But black box in the sense that the mechanisms may not be very clear. The second aspect, it's the bottom-up emergent phenomena, system immunology, with the premise that there's much that we can intuit, right? So sometimes we stare at these diagrams of circuits and cells, and it's hard to intuit exactly what they would do. It's hard to intuit exactly what they would do. So, therefore, we need quantitative models of how these components work together to give rise to emergent biological phenotypes. And with the emergence of technologies and approaches, I think these two aspects are also coming together more, and I hope we can do a lot more of that as we make progress. So, my lab works at sort of two levels. One, it's all the way at humans, working on systems, human immunology. We ask questions like why do individuals in the human population Individuals in the human population mount highly variable immune responses to perturbations like infection, vaccination, and disease. So, can we predict the immune response outcomes, right? The other aspect is really zooming even further out, looking at multiple perturbations across health and disease. Can we start to learn across different types of infections or different types of disease that involve central notes in the immune system? And can we just start to understand what it means to be healthy? To understand what it means to be healthy, for example, by learning from lots of diseases. So, to enable those, we need to also build tools to pursue this. The other aspect we focused quite a bit on over the years, it's really looking at single cells and trying to understand this question of do differences make a difference. And I know some of you, including my colleague Grigoire, it's really interesting this notion of heterogeneity, right? So, can we understand the functions of cell-to-cell variations, even in very homogeneous cell populations? Homogeneous cell populations, and also, how does the environment impact single-cell variations, and how do these variations propagate within cells? By the way, I want to thank Gregoire also for really being very persistent, for getting me here, and thanks, Gregoire. It was too convincing I couldn't make it, right? So, just to start, to sort of set the stage for what I'm going to tell you in terms of the machine learning aspect. For what I'm going to tell you in terms of the machine learning aspect of it on the mechanistic models. So, single cell variation beyond cell type and cluster. So, now we have vast amounts of data to look at single cells, but we consistently see that even if we zoom in to very homogeneous populations of cells, you basically still see this kind of phenomenon as reviewed by this seminal paper from Michael Elovitz, where they put in like identical YFP into single cells and bacteria and E. coli, and you can see Picasso. And E. coli, and you can see because stochasticity alone can drive variation across single cells. So we had explored this a few years ago, even at the level of humans. So what we did is we looked at a cohort of healthy people and we looked at their single cell data, in this case, like flow cytometry data. When we zoom in, so we, in a systematic way, we went through all the different cell populations, and then for all the proteins measured, look at their surface expression, and then ask how variable. And then ask how variable are those proteins expressed in those populations of cells within a single person. And then the question we want to ask is actually understanding whether these kinds of variations are different from person to person. So we wonder whether if you look at one person, you have more heterogeneity, while in another, you have less, for example. Indeed, that's what we found. A large number of parameters we look at this way reveal this kind of very stable characteristic within individuals. Stable characteristic within individuals. For example, here I'm showing you one subject, healthy again, and you look at CD38 expression in this population of CD4 naive T cells. Over a course of two months, you measure basically different blood samples from the same individual. You see that the distribution is around, like the standard deviation is about 0.3, let's say. You look at a different person, this person has a lot more heterogeneity, right, in the same population of cells, and it's also very consistent. If you look at And it's also very consistent. If you look at sample the same person over two months, you see that the spread is wider. So we found that these kinds of characteristics can be very age-dependent. So in this case, the example I show you, the older individuals tend to have narrower distributions of heterogeneity and CD30A. And also we found that these could be regulated by genetics. So if you look at, so we scanned all the SNPs in the human genome. In the human genome, and ask which one of these variations within these cell phenotypes can be controlled by genetics. So, we found a handful of examples like these where a single SNP is associated with not with the mean expression of the protein, but with the spread of expression within that cell population. So, this is potentially quite interesting in that you can have heritable genetic differences that not only shape, like in an EQTL manner, expression of genes and proteins, but it also Of genes and proteins, but it also controls potentially how widespread of expression within a homogeneous population. Now we can start to build all sorts of models on, like, especially these extreme outliers, right? What are these cells doing? They have more extremes. And here we sort of have a model. I'll be happy to talk more about it later on what could be driving some of these phenotypes in these naive T cells. So we're now exploring this also in very high dimensions. I'll show you the kind of single cell data we're getting. The kind of single cell data we're getting, and you can now do this kind of in very high dimensions. So, genes, of course, don't function in isolation, right? So, if you have variation in the protein, it could propagate in the network within cells and also across cells. So, this goes back to the discussion we had about rewiring. What do we mean by rewiring, right? So, when we look at the genome, the wiring, meaning the possibility that, let's say, a transcription factor can regulate a downstream gene, it's hardwired in a sense, with their motifs. Hardwire, in a sense, with their motifs, their DNA sequences that you can buy. But it really depends on the condition, right? So imagine you measure a bunch of single cells and you can look at the A and B. And in some conditions, you can actually see nice correlation between A and B under the right conditions because the variation in gene A can be propagated to gene B. But you can also imagine that there are lots of conditions under which the correlation is not guaranteed. A very simple scenario, it's a lifetime of the protein. It's if the lifetime of the protein is super long, super stable, right? So, in that case, fluctuations in A would just get averaged out, it just becomes, it won't be transmitted to the downstream, right? So, we kind of explore this in depth with a model system in macrophages, actually, try to see how the environment, exposed to different cytokines, how can that shape this kind of propagation? So, we review sort of like one very specific example where Where after IO-10 treatment, and the reshaping of both localization of certain factors in terms of nucleus versus cytoplasmic localization, and also the chromatin states can shift a lot of the interactions among these genes, resulting in this kind of change in the single-cell correlations across these gene factors. Again, this is published, I'm not going to draw into it too much, but what I want Into it too much. But what I want, I set the stage for it's: initially, we sort of built this approach called MEPA. It's to try to understand: given a situation like looking at variation in one gene, how does it propagate, how can we understand in the parameter space under what conditions does that happen, right, basically, if you have a complex model in particular, right? So, this sort of like, you can zoom out a bit, and the problem is basically you have an underlying network of genes, and there's various, And there's various variations, some of them stochastic. And you can imagine that these interactions would give rise to the kind of picture we typically see nowadays, right? We have this kind of single-cell measurements of cells versus like genes, basically. So in a way, that matrix, it's a function of these underlying interactions and their propagations. But given a network like that with all sorts of complex parameters, what is determining the resulting sort of snapshot phenotypes? So that's kind of the bigger question we're asking. So that's kind of the bigger question we're asking, right? So the way we thought about it, it's so there's classical sensitivity analysis you can do, for example, to think about this, but those can be both global and local. If you do those, it can be fairly expensive. And also it depends on the complexity of the model you build because you need to conduct simulations. These are totally intractable analytically, right? So we thought of a simple idea. If you sample the parameter space, even very sparse. Even very sparsely, but you cover many of the combinations. And then you look at the phenotype you care about. Let's say the phenotype we care about is whether two genes are correlating or not. Now, can we learn a machine learning mapping of the parameters to the phenotypes, right? And if you utilize a machine learning model that's fairly explainable, meaning we can extract what are the parameters that are relevant, that would provide us some insights. It's almost like solving the underlying equations, basically. And the other advantage of doing this potential. And the other advantage of doing this potentially is that it will reveal where locally in the parameter space that things would really matter, and we can start to explore the local parameter importance also. And I'll show you examples of that in a bit. So just to motivate, right, you can imagine this very simple gene circuit. Like X regulates Y, X is a transcription factor, it's a target gene. And you can do Julicity simulation, the full-blown modeling, promoter on and off, and all sorts of details. And all sorts of details. And then by tracing the time kinetics, you can compute the correlation over time of these two genes, basically. And then, so let's say the phenotype we care about is the correlation, right? Simple. And you look at that, and you can plot in a t-SNE space all the parameters and coloring them based on the correlations. And as you can see, in this kind of model, when you look at the possible parameter space, the number of combinations that actually give rise to decent correlations is actually very small. A very small number of possible parameters would give rise to the rise. Small number of possible parameters would give you decent correlation between these two genes. So, the nice thing about that is you can do this very quickly, and now you have a model that can actually predict the outcome of this simulation very quickly. You don't need to do the simulation anymore. You can imagine even a more complex picture, because you now have a model that's a lot simpler to compute. So, we actually use random forests in this case, because the property of both it's easy to extract the global variable importance and also the local variable importance, right? And also the local variable importance, right? So once you know kind of where in the parameter space this is interesting, what you could do also is you can now use this to guide you. You can sample more parameters in those neighborhoods where things could matter and now go back and simulate more so you have a bit more observations to work with to understand the system better. Sorry. So the t-shirt space that you were showing for projection parameters are not connected. Like it's like you have a very discontinuous picture of the parameters being projected. Of the parameter space projected in 2D for what you would get by correlation? Oh, yeah, so they actually, if you look at them in a heat map kind of format, these actually do form clusters, basically. Yeah, so but when they project them down on the T-SNE, it depends on the T-SNE parameters. We can make it more separated or more close. Yeah. Yeah. So here it's how if you compare the simulation to unseen, so simulation of unseen parameters. So, simulation of unseen parameters, and then our prediction using this model, what you can see is that it's very concordant. And we found this to be the case even in more complex models. So, if you put in more genes, I'll show you an example next. And like I said, what you could do now is you can dissect out the global variable importance. These are highly concordant typically with global sensitivity analysis. But what's the interesting thing is you do this once, but then what you get out, it's also all the local variable importance information. So, here it's a compressed picture, so each row. A compressed picture, so each row corresponds to a cluster of parameters, basically. So these cluster parameters show similar behavior. And as you can see, although degradation of the protein X, as I alluded to, it's very important. If you have too long of a half-life, it's not going to transmit information, right? Really, only one of the parameter combinations would have this very high importance for this particular parameter. The others, other parameters, dominate, actually. So you can learn a bit of sub- So, you can learn a bit of sub-parameter space importance from doing this. Again, the nice thing about this is you basically do this only once, and then you get everything, all the information back out. So now, I don't want to dwell into details, but you can also, we also did the most sort of, at least as far as we know, the most advanced analytical approximations and found that there are regimes specifically to a local parameter cluster where the analytical approximation is doing fairly poorly, whereas the machine. Fairly poorly, whereas the machine learning model is doing nicely, quite well, basically. So you can also now perturb things and use the machine learning model to tell you what the result of the perturbations are. And again, they tend to be very concordant with the simulation results. So I want to give you a very specific biological example because I think on day one or two, we touch on this topic of peripheral control of autoreactive cells. So this is a very nice collaboration with Harry Wall. This is a very nice collaboration with Harry Wong and Ron Dermain, where they have done beautiful mouse experiments to work out this nice example where in the periphery, the circuit involving potentially autoreactive CD4T cells and antigen presenting DCs and T-rex, how this multicellular interaction involving feedbacks is really serving as a peripheral controller to make sure that potential autoreactive cells don't really get activated. Don't really get activated and proliferate to the numbers that will become pathogenic. So, as we discussed, thymic negative selection alone really does not prune all these cells. So, you need peripheral control, basically. So, the thing they found earlier is that there are these T-reg clusters in lymph nodes that are surrounding these likely autoreactive CD4 T cells. So, they always find these clusters, and you can see that if you look at these potentially autoreactive CD4 cells, the Of CD4 cells, the density of T rects around them is much, much higher than if you look at a random CD4 T cell, basically. So then Kim Jung, a grad student in the lab, built this model involving multiple cells and also utilizes the previous work from Guégoire on the T cells in particular. And asking basically where are the breakdown points of the system, right? When will the autoreactive cells escape from control, basically? So by applying the framework I mentioned, The framework I mentioned, MEPA basically, he found that again, there's a small number of parameter combinations that can give rise to activation of these autoreactive cells. And one of the most important parameters, it's indeed the density of T-rex surrounding the CD4s. So, what's to me the most intriguing aspect of the model, of this analysis, was that, yes, so as expected, if you double Yeah, so as expected, if you double T-rec density or half T-rec density, the number of configurations, so these are the parameter combinations, that could potentially lead to autoimmune overactivation, it increases or decreases. But what's more intriguing is if you look at, for example, genetic variation around CTLA4, it's well known to be connected to increased susceptibility of a variety of autoimmune diseases. So here we try to simulate that scenario. So we said, okay, if you have the dose, So we said, okay, if you have the dose of CPLA4, what happens? What happens is, yes, it does increase the number of the fraction of these active configurations. So cells would basically, autoreactive cells can escape, basically. But what it also increases are these, what we call susceptible regions. So these regions, it doesn't lead to the activation of those CD4 cells. What it leads to is that now in these configurations, the sensitivity to the density. To the density of the T-rex around the CD4s becomes a lot more greater. So, if you have some fluctuation in the T-rex density around those cells, these autoreactive cells now have a higher chance of jumping out and proliferate, basically. So, I thought this is one of the interesting predictions coming from this analysis: is that you shift the underlying genetic, for example, or other environmental determinant factors. It doesn't necessarily immediately draw. Necessarily immediately drive the system towards pathology, but it opens up a variety of possibilities. In this case, it opens up the sensitivity to the density of T-Ranks, basically. So now I'm going to move on to COVID-19. I think I'm two minutes over, my 15 minutes. You've been talking for 18 minutes. Three minutes over. Okay, I'll try to be. You have 10 minutes left. 10 minutes left. Yeah, so first I will talk about something we have published last year and quickly because it's published. So this again, it's work that really took a village. In addition to folks in my lab and the CHI, it really, it's a lot of coordination and collaboration with the NIAT COVID-19 Consortium, in particular with Gigi and Helen and lots of other contributors. So this is very early in the pandemic, back in Pandemic back in around March, I think, 2020. So, my colleagues called me up saying that, oh, we have these urgent samples from Italy. People arriving in the hospital in waves, and we want to understand what's going on. So, we sort of looked at the people coming in and selected 33 patients at that time, where most of them are fairly critical, I would say, and some moderate, and then very quickly assembling a cohort of age and gender-match healthy controls. And the idea is to apply what. And the idea is to apply what I'm going to tell you, these multimodal single-cell approaches to really track these patients as they come in and look at the evolution of the acute disease over time. So multiple other groups have also conducted similar studies with different technologies and approaches. So I'm going to highlight ours and mention that some of the observations here are also consistent. So I try to sort of pick on the more unique aspects here to talk about. So the approach we use is this kind of site-seq approach. SI-Seq approach. What it is, is basically allows you to profile single cells to look at both surface proteins, the transcriptome, and the VDJ at the same time within these single cells. So it's very much like float cytometry. So you have an antibody, it's just not conjugated to a fluoric floam, but it's an antibody barcode. So you can sequence that barcode to get an idea on the surface protein level. So the way we were able to do this, because there's a large number of samples, right? Large number of samples, right? It's really multiplex. So we multiplex individuals by their SNP. So we can pool multiple people together. And we multiplex time by using these hashing antibodies. So by doing it this way, we can basically pool 50 samples all together and be able to deconvolve later by SNP and by these hashing barcodes basically. So in this particular experiment, we measure 190. We measure 192 proteins on the surface, the transcriptome, and also the VDJ, as I mentioned. In addition to total PPMCs in blood, we also sorted memory T and B cells so that we can enrich for their representation to look at the repertoire. So these are the cells and their phenotypes. You can sort of get most of the major lineages. And I think Phil already touched a bit on this. I'm not going to draw on it. So the two issues we were focusing on, it's what a signature is. What are the signatures of disease severity? Why is it that so some people look very severe compared to others? The other one is like, what's the trajectory? What's the time, sort of evolution of the disease of signatures? So here, you can get a hairball kind of thing very quickly because we have a lot of different cell types. Within each one of those cell types, we have a phenotype. Let's say you look at the inflammatory status, the interferon status, and whatnot. And when you correlate that to disease severity, And when you correlate that to disease severity, you typically get a picture like this. Lots of things are correlated with each other. So, what we try to do is to disentangle this kind of correlation network and ask: can we find a set of likely more direct and primary correlates of disease severity? So the way we did it, it's we conducted statistical conditional independence modeling. Basically, if two variables, let's say a variable is connected to disease severity based on correlations, that correlation, it's not That correlation is not going to be degraded because of their correlation with some other variables, basically, in simple terms. That's how that works. So, with that analysis, William Lau and the lab basically uncover these four primary coralts, basically. So, what they are is they all point to innate immunity. So, on the one hand, you have these senescence apoptotic phenotypes in PDCs. These are plasma cyclodendritic cells. These are plasma-cycloidic cells. So, those are major producers of type 1 interferons. So, their numbers are lower in the periphery, and in these severe patients, it's well known, and also it's on our data, that those patients have low type 1 interferons, even low signatures, even earlier on, right? So, our hypothesis is that these cells are actually dying, so therefore they fail to mount a proper type 1 interferon response among other type 1 interferon producers, basically. So, that's one signature. Basically, so that's one signature, and these are positively associated with disease severity. And then there are three phenotypes associated with NK cells: CD56 DIM, CD16HI, NK cells. They all have to do with, one had to do with fatty acid metabolism, the other one had to do with inflammation. So what happens is in these cells, the most severe patients have low inflammation in these NK cells, but they have an elevation in the fatty acid metabolism signature. And this is all linked to IL-15. Linked to IL-15. I'm not going to show you the detailed data. So basically, IL-15 is highly correlated with DC severity and it's associated with D signatures in these NK cells. So IL-16 is known to be a potent early activator of these NK cells and their sustained presence. It's known to drive the NK cells towards a, you can call them a tire or a burnout kind of state. So these features are quite consistent with that kind of burnout phenotypes in these NK cells, basically. Phenotypes in these NK cells, basically. Low inflammatory gene expression, low interferon gamma production, but somehow these fatty acid genes are going up quite high in these severe patients. And IL-15, interestingly, it's also, we found in a separate study that it's actually a very early predictor of whether somebody's going to recover or die in these severe patients. So they ramp up and then the disease patients would come down, but from the get-go, they're fairly high already. They're fairly high already. So, here is the interesting aspect that also I think EMBER data and analysis may provide some insights. What we found is that very intriguingly, if you look at the patients and track their disease course, so also not individual, we have some data on the individual patients, but this trajectory kind of picture, it's reconstructed from multiple patients by averaging over their sort of, because we don't have like lots of time points in a single patient. What we found is that the Single patient. What we found is that the milder patients tend to have higher inflammation signatures in cells earlier on, while the severe ones they're lower. But then by days 17 to 20 years or so after symptom onset, these more severe patients, all of a sudden their inflammatory signatures are ramping up late, very late, while the other ones are going down like towards recovery, right? So we see this, for example, in the NK cells or in the monocytes I mentioned. So if you look at In the monocytes I mentioned. So, if you look at the time before day 17 in these severe versus like milder patients, it's negative. So, the milder patients have higher inflammatory signatures. But when you look at later time points, it flip basically. Same thing, so if you look at like NFF kappa B related signatures, genes, and also inflammatory genes, basically. So, then we decided what, well, maybe this is like a juncture of divergence. Can we now look at it independently? Can we now look at an independent set of patients? Although it's from the same region, some of them would go on to death, basically, and some of them would recover. They all came in with the same disease severity, all very critical, basically. But some of them would go on to death, and some of them recover, right? So in this cohort, we didn't have the cells. So what we could do is only look at the circulating proteins and cytokines. But we basically see a similar picture. So these are a bit complicated, but I just want to. These are a bit complicated, but I just want to summarize that. What we found is that if you look at before this juncture, things like IL-6, IP10, IL-17, there's not much of a difference between these two groups of patients. But once they sort of like go into the juncture, they start to diverge, basically. So the ones who go into death, they ramp up like IL-6, for example, while the recoveries are kind of flat, for example. You can also see scientists. You can also see signs of tissue damage and potentially microbial translocation. So there may be a disruption of barrier function at that point. And some of the, not necessarily co-infection per se, because the percentage of co-infection that they can detect is typically still low, like 5 to 10% maybe in the global population, of severe population. So something endogenous, like maybe in our gut, is really leaking through, for example. It's driving the second wave. Are these sort of sorted by age? Are they sort of sorted by age and other comorbidities? Yeah, so these are all already controlled for age and they're male dominant. But in terms of these two groups, they're well matched in terms of those characteristics. Exactly. Yeah. So interestingly, this has been seen in severe influenza, except at the timing, it's earlier. So by 12 days or so in severe influenza, this very nice paper from Peter Openshaw's group. They saw that independent of the antiviral signature, earlier. Of the antiviral signature earlier on in disease, around day 12, they got a group of patients who would manage this kind of, they call them the bacterial signature, but it's really an inflammatory signature. And it's not, and only in a small subset of them they can indeed detect secondary bacterial and other infections. Many of them, they don't know why. So this is intriguing about this kind of second wave. So now let me go. Now that was during COVID-19. What about before? What about before? I think Amrita asked a question about, like, okay, are there determinants of how bad somebody may get? For example, why do individuals respond differently? So we know that, of course, genetics matters. And there's also intrinsic factors like age and sex. Age in particular, it's really a major risk factor based on epidemiological data. And then things like pre-existing adaptive immunity, like antibody levels, whether you've got certain T cells, even cross-reactive against seasonal. Even cross-reactive against seasonal coronaviruses, those matter. But we also found in our previous work, for example, that the status of the immune system, independent of antigens, antigen agnostic, prior to a perturbation can also matter. So, for example, if you look at before vaccination status in the transcriptome of certain cells, like innate cells, and that can actually associate it with the antibody response. With the antibody response to influenza and yellow fever. And the intriguing thing is, we hypothesize that maybe these kind of baseline states are also relevant in the context of autoimmunity in the sense that in some autoimmune diseases like lupris, you have this kind of like clinically quiescent flare, quiescent flare kind of pattern, right? But it's highly variable across patients. What are the determinants of that kind of flare intensity? So one hypothesis is that, well, maybe the So, one hypothesis is that, well, maybe this kind of baseline status in tone may also apply to a subset of patients. So, interestingly, in lupus, there are a subset of lupus patients when they flare up. If you look at their blood, they look like healthy people who are responding to a flu vaccine or any vaccine with like plasma blasts going up with certain types of B-cell signatures. So, we hypothesize that maybe that subset of patients, if you measure their baseline status when they're clinically quiescent, that may When they're clinically quiescent, that may also be associated with those flares. And indeed, that's what we found in terms of that connectivity in the two scenarios. So, if you look at healthy people, the same signature that predicted response to vaccines or infection, in this case, because yellow fever is basically, in a way, a live infection, they, similarly, when you look at them in the clinical quiescent period of these lupus patients, they are associated with how badly going to flare up in those subset of patients. When you look at other lupus patients who don't have that kind of signal, Lupus patients who don't have that kind of signature, it doesn't apply. It's very specific. So, for COVID, it's not easy to find people who had a pre-infection sample, right, basically. So, we went around our colleagues and collaborators at Valley. By a bit of a chance, we found a colleague across the street, Andrew. He basically spearheaded the study of quarantine study in the Marine population. They enrolled a large number of Marines, quarantined them, thought that by their quarantine, Quarantined them, thought that by their quarantine procedure, nobody would get infected. But unfortunately, actually, a subset of them do, basically. So, therefore, they had a pre-infection draw. Again, I'm going to skip the details, but what happens is basically we had a baseline sample, right, from these people, and we can ask, apply the same approaches. Are they associated with how bad they're going to, like, do they have symptoms or do they have no symptoms, basically? So, make the story short, yes, you can actually find signatures. There's hints of antiviral signatures being put. Of antiviral signatures being protective. So, some people already have elevations in antiviral signatures in some cells, and those people tend to be asymptomatic in this case. The more intriguing thing is in some monocytes, they have this more inflamed kind of status, and those people tend to be symptomatic. So, I don't know whether that suggests that if you have circulating monocytes that's already poised in this inflammatory state, if you have a little bit of a signal, a trigger in the lung or something. A signal, a trigger in the lung or somewhere, these guys would go in and exacerbate pathology, right? So maybe that's one potential mechanism. So these are zoom a bit early, so I'm just showing you as a just to be provocative and think about what kind of mechanisms that before one gets an infection, the current status of the immune system, in particular the innate immune system, may really matter, basically. Finally, in the last two minutes, we have done this study to understand what's going on after COVID-19. So we in particular look at people who have myel disease because that's basically 98% of the people in the population who got myel, they never got into the hospital, basically, right? But they have symptoms, basically. So in this case, we actually want to look at their baseline phenotypes. Like months after they got COVID, they all recover. Anything changed in their immune system, number one. Number two, we want to give them a challenge. So in this case, the challenge is not a Case the challenge is not a COVID vaccine. We want to give them a heterologous, like a challenge with a different antigen. In this case, the regular seasonal flu shot, actually. So, this was actually really a heroic effort by Rachel Sparks, who's an assistant clinical investigator working with me. This was during the height of COVID-2020, like about eight months out of the initial wave, to enroll these people with a lot of restrictions. And they also haven't had the COVID vaccine, so it's just a small window. So, there's a small window, we can sort of get to them basically. So, make this long story short, we can see the most profound differences we see at these people independent of the time since their disease. So, these are fairly stable differences that we see. They're actually sex dimorphic. So, you can see that the COVID females versus healthy females, there's differences that are distinct from what you can see in the males. So, the COVID females are actually. So the COVID females are actually bound in terms of these kind of innate activation statuses and pathways, while the males, they tend to have the opposite kind of signatures. And I'm going to skip these. And this is the interesting thing. It's that their response to the flu vaccine is also different. So if you look at the males, the males actually tend to have a stronger antibody tighter response to the flu vaccine. While the females, they map about the same. While the females, they map about the same kind of response compared to healthy females, basically, right? But the male seems to be enhanced. Now, what's going on is that if you look at the day seven, these are flu-specific plastoblasts, you see the same thing where the COVID recovery males had a much more robust plastoblast response compared to the healthy males, but about the same between the COVID recovery females and healthy females, basically. And then here's another thing. We look at the base. Here's another thing. We look at the baseline. We thought that, well, maybe there's some flu-specific B cells that got activated in a bystander manner. And what we found is in Dia, you can find these flu-specific B cells higher in the COVID males compared to the healthy COVID males. But they're not very specific in the sense that you can find all the HAs and H3s and they're all higher. But then if you look at the frequency of these B cells, by the way, these are B cells, by the way, these are CD71 B cells, they're mysterious, and I'm happy to discuss in lunch, for example. They're actually broadly elevated in these subjects at the baseline already. So again, not sure if these are induced by COVID, but they're associated with prior COVID, basically, that these are all elevated in these subjects. And finally, if you look at the innate response to the flu vaccine, you can see, for example, in the males, the Example in the males, the interferon response is significantly elevated. So they have stronger, broadly speaking, innate response to the flu vaccine in these COVID-recovered males. And there's other things I'm not going to touch on too much, but we also found higher levels of interferon gamma in circulation after the flu vaccine, suggesting that these males are in a more poised state, basically. Once you vaccinate them day one, immediately afterwards, you can see these stronger innate inflammatory responses. Stronger innate inflammatory responses. And maybe I'll skip this part about. Yeah, I'll wrap up. So I'm going to skip this and say that hopefully we can bridge the gap soon. We are really over time, so maybe we can go on with the discussion over lunch. I mean, except if someone has Zoom, I guess the people here can ask. Okay, so quick. The people here can ask. Okay, so Quaid, one question, and that's it. Hi, Craig. I'll make this quick. Yeah, fantastic talk, John. And on that subject of like bridging the top down and bottom up, could you comment a little bit on how you took that regulatory motif, like X activates Y? That's a simple motif where you can redo very predictable machine learning on the parameters. I like how you generalize it to the T-Reg model. How could you do this more generally? How would you Generally, right? How would you take any kind of collection of cell states that you measure by single cell R and see whether it's not only like you know a uniform population but say maybe heterogeneity in the population that's some hidden variables that you can't see? Like how would you kind of start? Yeah, that's a great question. So my own bias on that is I think that we are still underexploiting the top-down data by a lot. So by both in terms of the phenotypes, we can derive, because often we We can derive because often we look at things like modules of genes and use that as an imputed way to look at activities of transcription factors, for example. So I think if we start to model things in that space more and guided by the existing models and see what kind of new connections and knowledge we can add to that, so that hopefully can give us like an enhanced topology to begin with. By topology, I mean the topology of interactions among molecules and among the cells. Once we have that, I think we're then the I think then we can kind of jump into the kind of like the MAPA kind of analysis where we can sparsely sample the parameter space. By sparse, I still mean like maybe 50,000 or so combinations. And then to generate a first-level understanding of where in that space things could be really interesting. And then based on that, that I think would guide experiments, just like I mentioned in the T-Rec and autoreactive T-cell space, some of those modeling predictions actually indeed guided imaging. Indeed, guided imaging experiments that I didn't get time to show. That enhanced, I think, eventually led to new quantitative information on how that can help limit pathology potentially. So I think if we iterate like that, derive more information from the current data, I think there's still a lot of room to do, and then dive into this kind of approaches. Approaches. Yeah. Thanks for that question. Thanks a lot. We can discuss a lot more this afternoon, I guess, with quick transition. So we meet again at 2:30. So let's have a quick lunch and see you later today. I'm sure the data started. So kind of show you what
