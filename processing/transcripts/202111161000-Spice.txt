Yes, and I apologize. I realized as I was making these slides that I forgot the title that I'd given Tasho. So I think of this talk as kind of a successor to my 2018 paper. So I've been numbering it too, and I was trying to think of various film sequel subtitles. So I couldn't decide between a good day for asymptotic expansions and two asymptotic two expansions. So you get them both. Anyway, one way or another. Anyway, one way or another, we always, oh, good, my page switching isn't working. There we go. We always have to start with some notation, but the more I talk, the more I try to get rid of any notations and formulae. So I'm going to try to keep things real minimal. K is a field, so minimal that I'm hardly ever going to refer to K. Bold G is a smooth reductive linear algebraic root, and regular G is the rational points of bold G. So of course, nothing. So, of course, nothing stops us from discussing these objects in total generality, but for me, K is going to be a p-atic field, by which I mean explicitly to include the possibility that it has positive characteristics. And I want to mention sort of for my own edification that the material on which I'm speaking, at first, the machinery doesn't require that G be connected. So I can handle disconnected groups, but to actually apply the general theorems that I've proven for all my main theorems. Theorems that I've proven for all my main theorems that I'm going to talk about today, I need information about representations and the most interesting information out there, at least the information that I know is about connected groups. So I'm going to assume in the applications that G is connected, but for a lot of the run-up to the main theorems, I don't actually need that. This is Jeff's fault, by the way. I was sitting with Jeff, oh, maybe 10 years ago, and said, I think I've got this paper just about done. And he said, well, could you manage to handle the case where? Could you manage to handle the case where we have elements not coming from the identity component? Anyway. All right, so I'd like to start with a slogan due to Tom Hale. And that slogan is that chaotic harmonic analysis is not elementary. And I like that statement on its own. I like having a formal statement to back up my idea that what I do is hard. I put it in just about every research proposal that I write. There's a technical meaning to this that I don't want to get into, but I do want to say. Get into, but I do want to say what I'm talking about: what are the objects of piadic harmonic analysis? So, specifically, characters are non-elementary objects, and Fourier transforms, at least of nil-potent orbital integrals, are also non-elementary objects. And my job is to compute characters, at least as imposed by Paul Sally, my job is to compute characters. And so, the fact that elementary job means it's tough, but you can hope. But you can hope. Oh, sorry, I forgot. These are one of many objects. There's a list in Tom's contemporary math paper, like five or six objects that are non-elementary. So we've got all these non-elementary objects, and I'm most interested in the characters, but what I can hope is that at least we've got these two non-elementary things. Maybe they're non-elementary in the same way. Maybe characters are at least more non-elementary than Fourier transforms of orbital integrals. So I'd like to talk about some ideas that... So, I'd like to talk about some ideas that might back up this comparison of elementarity. The first idea in this vein is the Harishanga-Hau local character expansion, which says that the character of representation near a semi-simple element gamma, I forgot to write that gamma was semi-simple, near a semi-simple element gamma is given by a Fourier transform, sorry, is given by a linear combination of the Fourier transforms of nilpotent orbital integrals on the centralizer or the connected centralizer. Centralizer or the connected centralizer of that semiconductor, at least as long as you stay sufficiently close to zero. And at first, as stated by Harishandra and Howe, and incidentally, I've always thought Howe's approach to this was absolutely magnetic. Go back and read his original paper. He says, well, here's what happens for GL2. So it probably happens in general. I think that's amazingly bold and even more amazing that it was right. So when these theorems were first stated, this was what we had. We knew that this held. this was what we had. We knew that this held near zero, but it was a purely qualitative result in the sense that we didn't have the coefficients and we didn't know how zero we had, sorry, how near zero we had to be. Following on Project, DeBacher made this precise when your local character expansion is centered at the identity, namely you have to be closer to the identity than the depth of the representation whose local character expansion you want to write down. Adler Cormann generalized it to arbitrary semi-simple gamma, where you Arbitrary semi-simple gamma, where you get a result that now it depends not just on the depth of the representation, but also on the depths of the non-trivial root values of the semi-simple element at which you want to center. The deeper the root values of gamma are, the closer you have to be to the identity under how local character extinction kicks in. So in support of the idea that maybe the character is no more non-elementary than the local character, sorry. Than the local, sorry, than the nilpotent orbital integrals. Oh, I see, we've got some comments in chat. Oh, these are just your slides. Sorry, sorry, I thought it might be a question. In support of the claim that the character might be no more non-elementary than the Fourier transforms of nil-potent orbital integrals, we want to know how elementary are these coefficients? And this is a long-term project of Julia Gordon, Tom Hales, and myself to see what we can say about these coefficients. I'm mostly going to leave aside. I'm mostly going to leave aside that very technical motivic point of view and just talk about the computations of these objects. But at least part of the view of what I've been doing for computations has been feeding into that project with Julia and Tom. So I actually want to shift my point of view. It turns out the local character expansion is not, at least for my purposes, is not the best way to think of characters. Instead, I'd like to think about things the way that Fiona introduced. The way that Fiona introduced, following on from work of Kirilov, which says that instead of thinking of a character, at least the germ of a character, as represented by a linear combination of Fourier transforms of no-potent orbital integrals, maybe instead we can think of it as a linear combination of semi-simple orbital integrals, or at least orbital integrals with a fixed semi-simple part. So this goes way back in the form that Kirilov studied. It was for nilpotent groups, I believe, in the form that Fiona studied. Believe in the form that Fiona studied, it was handled in a case-by-case way until it was really systematized by Kim and Mernahan starting in 2003, where they proved that in this case, when I say y has to be near zero, we can be up to and including the depth of the representation, which means we've got a slightly larger domain of validity for these asymptotic expansions than for the local character expansion. And then if you make a more careful choice of that. And then if you make a more careful choice of that semi-simple element, and if you do quite a bit more work, you can even get up to just below halfway or just past half of the depth of the representation in which you're interested. So I took this as motivation for trying to get a general picture of characters. And I said, well, what if, like with the local character expansion, which can be recentered at an arbitrary point, what if the Mernihan-Kirilov asymptotic expansion? Excuse me, asymptotic expansions can be recentered at an arbitrary point. And in 2018, I proved that they can. Namely, that we've got an analog of the Mernah-Kirilov expansion, which is only near the identity, but we can put it near any semi-simple element. And I should say, technically speaking, I'm sweeping some tameness hypotheses under the rug. I need this element gamma to belong to a tame torus, and I need something like lots of good elements exist. Thanks to Jeska's work, I know that this is no more restricted. Yes, because work, I know that this is no more restrictive than assuming that p doesn't divide the order of the pile group. I'm sorry, could I ask a really dumb question? I don't know what the notation OG of gamma pi means. Right. So the O is standing for a set of orbital integrals. The superscript indicates the group with which we're working, although these are orbital integrals on the dual Lie algebra. And the parentheses indicate that I'm taking elements whose closure contains that semi-simple, sorry, orbits whose closure contains that semi-simple element. Closure contains that semi-simple element. Okay. So basically, this is meaning take gamma pi, add on any nil potent elements that commute with it, and then take the orbits of those. Thank you. No problem. And yeah, I am going to build up one of the most difficult things about this subject is the notation. So I'm going to build up quite a bit of tacit notation. Like I've already used this H here, which stands for the centralizer of the semi-simple element at which I'm recentering things. I'm going to try not to switch. I'm going to try not to swamp you in formal definitions of all the notation, but where it gets confusing, please stop me and ask. All right, so we've got at least this in principle grasp of the character near any element. We can write the character as a linear combination of orbital intervals, Fourier transforms of orbital integrals with a fixed semi-simple part. And this actually generalizes the local character expansion. There's some flexibility in how you can choose this element gamma pi. You cannot choose it r. Gamma pi. You cannot choose it arbitrarily, but you can always choose gamma pi to be zero. And if you choose gamma pi to be zero, we recover no potent orbital integrals. We recover the domain of validity, actually a slightly larger domain of validity than the Adler-Foreman results. So in this sense, the asymptotic expansion results subsume the local character expansion results. The problem is this is a pure existence result. It says these coefficients exist, but it says nothing at all about how to get your hands on their explicit values. Hands on their explicit values. So now I've changed my question. Because the character is written as this linear combination, instead, from now on, instead of saying, what are the character values, I'm going to say, what are the values of these coefficients appearing in the recentered asymptotic expansions? So, a kind of philosophical question is when I'm giving a computational result like this, what does it even mean? How do you know if I've given you the answer to how to compute this object? How do we compute? Compute this object? How do we compute a character? How do we compute a coefficient appearing in an asymptotic expansion? Well, I need something to start with. And I'm going to view my starting ingredients as twofold. One, I need to know what representation I'm dealing with. So I'd like a parametrization of the representation pi. And then, of course, those parameters are allowed to appear in my answer. And I also need a parametrization of the elements of g, at least the elements gamma, the semi-simple elements at which I'm going to center my extensions. My extensions. And of those two, parametrizing the elements is the simpler task, which I say because I can do it, whereas I rely on a lot cleverer people to parametrize the representations. So at this point, I'm going to start attaching names to some of the things that I talk. I guess I've already mentioned Harishandra, Howe, Kim, and Mynahan. But this next concept is one that has been rediscovered so many times, I'm almost guaranteed to get it wrong if I try to give the history. So I'm just going to keep it simple. To give the history, so I'm just going to keep it simple and I'm going to say I personally know about good elements from the work of Jeff thesis. So, on the group level, an element is called good if it's semi-simple and if it's all, excuse me, if all of its root values, trivial root values, lie at the same distance from one. Another way of saying this is that in its neighborhood, it's the most singular element. You can jiggle it a little bit and its centralizer can only get smaller, not bigger. Get smaller, not bigger. The start of all my work on character computations came from trying to understand some work of Corwin, where he studied normal elements of division algebras, which I've written down the technical conditions, but I don't want to go into a lot of detail about it. It's special elements of a division algebra, depending on the choice of uniformizer. But it turns out to be helpful to change your perspective. And instead of fixing a uniformizer and look. And instead of fixing a uniformizer and looking at special elements, it turns out to be helpful to look at an element and say, well, we can choose a uniformizer that makes our special element normal, whatever that means. All the monomials appearing in the p-adic expansion can use. Once you look at things from this point of view, it suggests a generalization to arbitrary p-adic groups, which says instead of monomials, let's look at good elements. Instead of a commuting sum, which doesn't really make sense on the group side, let's look at a commuting. Group side, let's look at a computing product. And this was the start of Jeff Adler's in my early work on computing characters of supercastral representations. So I mentioned I don't want to have too much notation, but I do need a certain amount of notation for what I've come to calling, or what Jeff started calling, heads and tails. If I write an element gamma as a commuting product of good elements, I'm going to write gamma less than r to mean that I take all the terms in that. R to mean that I take all the terms in that expansion that are before R that have depth less than R, multiply them together. I'm going to write gamma greater than or equal to R to mean that I take everything past depth R, including depth R, and multiply those together. If I convert my gamma to an uppercase Y, I'm going to mean I take the logarithm. I'm going to throw around notation like this fairly casually. But as usual, please stop me if anything I say doesn't make sense more than usually. So unfortunately, this decomposition is not unique. Fortunately, this decomposition is not unique. So there are lots of ways to write an element of the product as a commuting product of good elements, but at least it's true that if you take all the terms up to a fixed step and take their centralizer and take the connected part of that, that is well defined. The result of that operation is independent of which decomposition you choose. And part of my recent work has been to lift this connectedness restriction, which is to say to avoid having to assume that gamma Avoid having to assume that gamma that the semi-simple element in which I'm interested, and actually, I should be saying quasi-semi-simple here, to avoid assuming that that element lies in the identity component. And once I avoid that, also to avoid having to assume that I'm dealing with connected centralizers, to deal with arbitrary disconnected centralizers. And once again, I don't want to say a lot about this except to say that I need this decomposition. I need these groups for fine control over the terms that appear in a Frobenius. Control over the terms that appear in a Frobenius-type formula. Whenever you're dealing with compactly induced representations, such as supracuspitals, if you want to get your hands on their characters, that involves a lot of conjugation. That involves a Frobenius type formula. And I need to know very well which terms in that conjugation, well, which terms contribute at all, which terms can be lumped together to give zero and so be ignored, which terms contribute to a Gauss sum, which terms contribute in which various ways. So this is in some sense the technical sense. In some sense, the technical centerpiece of my work, but you don't actually see it in the end results. But I'm so happy with it, I had to mention it anyway. All right, so that's how to parametrize elements. How do we parametrize representations? Well, there's a pretty common theme, a pretty common underlying idea when you look at how various disciplines, how various fields parametrize their representations, which is first you pretend that you understand abelian harmonic analysis, which from my point of view means you pretend you understand the one-dimensional representations of the group. One-dimensional representations of the group. And then you try to get a handle on the higher-dimensional representations, meaning in particular, even the dimensional representation, by somehow describing them in terms of one-dimensional representations, not necessarily of the big group G, but of certain special subgroups of G. And at least all the parameterizations that I know fit conceptually in this form. For example, the very first theory, the theory of the highest weight for representations of compact groups. Representations of compact groups. We're used to parametrizing representations in terms of integral elements of the dual Lie algebra, but you can equally well convert an integral element to a character of the torus. And so we can view the theory of the highest weight as parametrizing representations of a compact group by certain one-dimensional representations of its torus, of its maximal torus. Harichandra generalized this to the setting of real semi-simple. Of real semi-simple Lie groups, where we parametrize the discrete periods representations, not all the representations, but at least the discrete period representations in terms of pairs of the compact carton and characters of the compact carton. And that was in the real setting and then in the p-adic setting, I think the first work on this was done by Corwin and Howe, who parametrized simultaneously representations of multiplicative groups of piadic division algebras and also representations of. And also representations of general linear groups in terms of pairs of a degree n field extension and then an admissible character of the multiplicative group of that degree n field extension. So these are all looking at one-dimensional representations and not just one-dimensional representations of subgroups. These are all looking at one-dimensional representations of tori. So other results, most notably Moy's work on the representations of GSP4 and unitary GFP4 and unitary group U21 and three variables suggested that maybe looking at tori, or at least looking at maximal tori, was restricting our attentions too far. Jet started the systematic study of this in his thesis, and it was brought to what I think is viewed as the complete form by JKU in 2001 in his construction of Kane Supercocibles paper. And JK's construction is what I'm going to take as my parameterization of representations. Of representations. So the character formulae that I write down are going to be given in terms of these two ingredients: in terms of a decomposition of an arbitrary semi-element as a commuting product of good elements, and in terms of J case parametrization. I'll say just a little more about J case parametrization before I get into that. So I mentioned we started this whole P-atic Odyssey with the work of Corwin Howe on representations of division algebras, multiplicative groups of division algebras in general linear groups. Of division algebra and general linear groups, where we started with admissible characters of multiplicative groups of extension fields, and those were factored into generic characters of intermediate fields. I'm not going to define any of that terminology. The terminology exists, as usual, in our discipline, admissible in about 20,000 different things. Don't worry too much about what it means in this special case. For JK, it was more productive. It was more productive of the original admissible characters of the tori, but rather of the factorization as the basic object. So JK's constructions paper starts with essentially the analog for arbitrary groups of a how factorization, namely a tower of groups, G and various tame-twisted Levy subgroups of it, a depth zero representation of the smallest group in that tower, and a collection of linear characters, one-dimensional representation. Of linear characters, one-dimensional representation, one for each of the subgroups occurring twisted levy subgroups. Now, as far as I know, JK never intended for that to be the final object. JK, I believe, hoped that we would eventually be able to phrase things in more core Win-Howe-type language. And sure enough, Hakeem Mernahan, Hakeem Alone, and Kaletha have brought us back to the original perspective where you don't actually need the full U data. You don't actually need the full u datum, or at least you can recover as much as you need to construct a representation. You can actually get your hands on the entire supercospital just by knowing the bottom group in the tower of tainted twisted levy subgroups, the group T0, the depth zero representation pi minus one, and actually the twist of that depth zero representation by the product of all the other characters occurring in the JK power. So, but I look at JK's original parameter. Look at JK's original parametrization where we work with the pre-factored object because it carries an implicit inductive structure. Namely, we've got this tower of pain-twisted Levy subgroups of G. And before you construct a representation of G, you construct a representation of the last group but one in that tower, the biggest group G prime in that tower. So if you've got your hands on the tame supercuspital somewhere along, sorry, a tame supercuspital pi of G, somewhere along the way, you actually came up with a Taine. Somewhere along the way, you actually came up with a tame-surprisal pi prime of a proper tame-twisted Levy subgroup G prime. And this was the starting point for my work on characters in 2018. Namely, that if the characters in a, sorry, the coefficients in a recent asymptotic expansion for the character of pi, I can compute those explicitly in terms of the characters of the analogous expansion of this smaller of this representation pi prime. or of this representation pi prime of a smaller group g prime now i said explicitly you'll notice this this theorem is kind of light on details explicit is allowed to involve quite some elaborate ingredients this is not simple it's just explicit so among other things one of the things you need to know what i mean by explicit is to understand the different linearization of the v representation that vincent colleta and myself used in our recent uh Used in our recent, I guess it hasn't appeared yet, but our recent paper on the archive. And Jeska, I believe, is going to talk more about that on Wednesday. So, this is one point. It's fine. You can deal with it. It's all written down. Or at least once Yeska and Tasha and I finished our work, it was all written down. But unfortunately, this is just one step in an inductive process from the biggest group G to the next biggest group G prime in the power. And it seems like, for years and years, I thought it would be as simple as. For years and years, I thought it would be as simple as, well, just do it again. Look at that next biggest group G prime and go to the group G double prime that's slightly smaller, and then go to the group G triple prime that's slightly smaller, and just keep it in this until eventually you get down to G0, the smallest taint-twisted Levy subgroup in the power, on which we have a depth zero representation. And then hope that somebody else understands the characters of depth zero representations. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way because of a very It doesn't work that way because of a very technicality in the statement of the theorem, which says that I depth R representation and I want to look at its expansion at depth R and I write that down in terms of analogous expansion also at depth R of the representation pi prime the problem is usually pi prime has smaller depth than Pi prime has smaller depth than pi, which might not seem like such a big deal, but it means that I don't have the right ingredient to go one more step down. I need r expansion of pi prime. Inductively, all I would know was a depth r prime expansion of pi prime, where r prime was the depth of pi prime. So, this recipe, unfortunately, is not suitable for induction. And there, matter sat for, well, depending on how you count things, three to five months. The paper appeared in 2018. The paper appeared in 2018. The work to do it, the work that went into it was actually completed in 2016. Can I ask a question about that last slide? Yes, please. I'm not sure what C sub O prime of pi prime gamma less than R means. I thought that the expansions, I mean, I thought that was notation for expansions out to R. To R. And you're saying the problem is that this pi prime doesn't have a single expansion out to R? I mean, yeah. Well, my understanding was that you could only get one expansion of pi out to more or less depth, the depth of pi. The depth of pi. Right. So pi prime. What does that mean? Pi prime has a shallower depth. So I'm actually looking at a smaller range. So it seems asking less. I'm not even asking for the expansion of pi prime in the full domain of validity that I'd be guaranteed. I'm going to this smaller domain that's guaranteed related to the depth of pi. So in hence, well, just take that affirmation that you know exists on a bit. That you know exists on a big domain and restrict it to the smaller domain. The problem is that this changes the orbital integrals that appear in the expansion. That changes this gamma pi element that I wrote down earlier. So it's not just as simple as take an asymptotic expansion on a big domain and restrict it to an asymptotic expansion on a small domain. If you've got this small domain, it's plausible that I have an asymptotic expansion there because I have it on the bigger domain, but it's going to be in terms of the domain. But it's going to be in terms of different orbital intervals. So, of course, it's going to have different coefficients. I may or may not have answered your question, but I suspect my next slide might come a little bit closer to answering your question. Because the obvious remedy, the solution, the obvious answer to this is, well, why don't you just take that asymptotic expansion of pi prime that you've got on a bigger domain out how to convert an asymptotic expansion on a big domain? Asymptotic expansion on a big domain to an asymptotic expansion smaller domain, and that is exactly what we do. So, I hope I'm okay. I'm getting a message that my internet connection is unstable. So if I freeze up and you need me to repeat anything, please let me know. So, everything boils down to the idea of and thinking really seriously about Fourier transforms of orbital integrals on the Lie algebra, that is to say, elements on the dual Lie algebra, so the function exists on the Lie algebra. Function exists on the Lie algebra. And think of characters on the group taking the analogy between those very seriously and very literally. So I sure perfect up yesterday when Spencer said, I've got these results on orbital integrals. I hope they'll be useful to somebody who's writing character computations. We haven't delivered on that promise yet, but I hope very much to do that. Because that is the technique behind the work that I'm talking about today. Namely, I take these character results, saying that characters have certain asymptotic expansions that I proved in 2018. That I proved in 2018, and I prove analogs of them for Fourier transforms of orbital integrals. Inductively, remember that I've got this whole tower of representations from the very smallest, which is a twist of a depth zero representation, up to the very biggest, the representation that I'm interested in. I assume by induction that I know how to transfer a character, sorry, an asymptotic expansion for my small depth zero representation to an asymptotic expansion at least prime. expansion at least prime. That asymptotic expansion for pi prime will now be just half depth. It won't be at the depth of pi prime at all. It'll be way bigger domain. Next, I do the step that I was just mentioning. I take my asymptotic expansion that I know holds on a large domain, but in terms of orbital integrals on a large group. And I rewrite those orbital integrals, or I rewrite each of those Fourier transports. integrals where I rewrite each of those Fourier transforms of an orbital integral in terms of the Fourier transforms of orbital integrals on a smaller group. So I use the idea of asymptotic expansions that I apply that idea to the Fourier transforms of orbital integrals themselves. I've now got a two-fold asymptotic. I expand a character in terms of Fourier transforms of orbital integrals on a big domain. I expand each of those Fourier transforms in terms of Fourier transforms of orbital integrals on a smaller domain. I combine those two and I've now got an asymptotic expansion of my penultimate representation, my character pi prime, or my representation pi prime, on this small group, the centralizer of the part of gamma before depth r. My 2018 results to transfer from pi prime to pi. I've got an asymptotic expansion. Final character, my final representation. Character of my final presentation, the one that I was interested in on a small domain, but to make the induction work, I actually need an asymptotic expansion on a big domain. And so then there's a final collapsing step where I take an asymptotic expansion on a small domain, and I hope that somehow I can lump those orbital integrals together so that they form orbital integrals for a bigger group on a bigger domain. And this collapse part is that this collapse step, I should say, is the tricky part. The rest of it, once you've these theorems, once you've got the hang of it, is fairly automatic. But being able to collapse an asymptotic expansion on a small domain, which is hypothetically written as a two-step, a nested asymptotic expansion, being able to collapse it back. It was so hard that he froze completely. Tasha, maybe you could suggest that let's try to go from here and see how it goes. Okay, I apologize. I hope from here we'll be okay. Sometimes I get little bursts for this bad connection. Anyway, so the tricky part of this is this idea of taking a possible two-step, a possible nested asymptotic expansion where we took an asymptotic expansion. Expansion where we took an asymptotic expansion on a small domain and we hope it resulted from taking an asymptotic expansion on a big domain and re-expanding. We hope to collapse it back down to that asymptotic expansion on the big domain. Now, at this point, unfortunately, I've been trying really hard to avoid using too much notation, but I can't get away without notation anymore. Here is the statement of my 2018 result. It says that if I've got It says that if I've got asymptotic expansions for the characters of the various conjugates of my representation pi prime, then I can write down an asymptotic expansion for the character of my big representation pi. Most of the notation here is, if intimidating, at least consistent with what I've been doing so far. I've got Fourier transforms of orbital integrals, which can either live on centralizers, which are called H, on the big group, which is called G. On the big group, which is called G, or centralizers on the small group G prime, in which case I indicate them with a prime. A superscript or subscript G, depending on which is less notationally obtrusive, means I'm taking a conjugate. I'm denoting orbits on my centralizer group for the big group H. I'm denoting them by O. Orbits on the small group G prime for the centralizer H prime, I'm denoting them by O prime. So I hope most of this is. Most of this is not too table, except there's this Froctor G twiddle. And that's just a fourth root of unity about which I'll say more in a couple minutes. So these are my 2018 results about how we transfer asymptotic expansions for the characters of the conjugates of pi prime to the character of pi itself. In 2021, this should look almost identical to the previous. It should look almost identical to the previous slide, except now it's about orbital integrals instead of characters. In 2021, I proved that we had an analogous re-expansion type result for orbital integrals. And this time, the notation is definitely hairy, and I just kind of like to brazen through it, although I'm happy to go back and revisit and talk about any of the individual notation if you want. The key point for me is that if you look at the formula that expresses a character expansion, A character expansion and the formula that expresses an orbital integral expansion, they look essentially the same. They have the same inductive structure to them, possibly up to differences between the meanings of these two Gauss sums, these two fourth roots of unity that I'm denoting by Frocktorg. Now, the regular, the undecorated Frochtorg is literally a Gauss sum. The Frochtorgi with the twiddle on top is essentially a Greek. The twiddle on top is essentially the same object. It is basically also a Gauss sum, at least once you use the exponential map to move between the Lie algebra and the group. But it's also got a contribution coming from this modified Bay representation that Sinson, Colette, and I use in our modification of use construction. And that depends only on the topologically semi-simple part, gamma zero, the very shallowest part of gamma. But fortunately, when we were doing this whole re-expansion process, the very first Re-expansion process, the very first thing we did was we got rid of, we expanded past, we expanded in the neighborhood of the topologically semi-simple element. So from now on, we only have to worry about the topologically unipotent element, which means that these coefficients, these fourth roots of unity, Frock tor G and Frock toward G twiddle, occurring in the two different kinds of asymptotic expansions, the one for the character and the ones for the orbital integral, agree. And so we wind up with this character, which does. Up with this character, which doesn't look, sorry, with this inductive formula, which doesn't look notably different, except I've now phrased the character of pi, the character of our final representation pi, in terms of the character not of just one smaller, not just of pi prime, but of our zero representation, of our representation that lives at the very bottom of the tower. That's a twist of the depth zero representation, pi zero. This is the highlight of my talk. The highlight of my talk, and it's buried in a huge pile of notation. So, I want to talk a little bit about what does this mean? What implications does it have? What can you do with this sort of result? On the Lie algebra, because as I mentioned, I want to think of results on the Lie algebra and results on the characteristics of things very much in parallel. On the Lie algebra, the results that I've got can be viewed as completely reducing the behavior of Fourier transforms of arbitrary orbital integrals. transforms of arbitrary orbital intervals to the behavior of Fourier transforms of no potent orbital integrals. And this is as always subject to tame-ness conditions, but those tameness conditions are fairly mild. As I mentioned, Jeska proved that P not dividing the order of the bio group is enough. This should sound familiar because that's exactly what the Shellika germ expansion tries to do. It tries to write down arbitrary orbital integrals in terms of semi-simple orbital integrals. Now, as far as I know, and I checked with somebody else who has a And I checked with somebody else who has a better grasp of the history, and he did not explicitly disagree with me. But if this is wrong, the fault is mine. As far as I know, the Schalica germ expansion was only ever stated as an expansion of a Fourier transform of an orbital integral near zero. I don't think anybody ever explicitly wrote down the idea that you should be able to center it near an arbitrary semi-symbol element. But in fact, you can. And not only can you, I can explicitly describe the domain of validity, which is The domain of validity, which is quite similar to the domain of validity of the Mernahan-Kiralov asymptotic expansion for characters of representations. If we've got a semi-simple orbital integral, at least a regular semi-simple orbital integral, then we've also got a nice quantitative version of a result due to Waltz Berget. Waltz Berget showed as part of his local trace formula paper back in 1995. He showed that if you take the orbital of a regular semi-simple element and Semi-simple element. And depending on how you like to think about it, if you either move that regular semi-simple element far from the identity, or if you leave the regular semi-simple element where it is, but evaluate it only very close to the identity, these are dual operations. Either way, then the Fourier transform of the orbital integral will be given as a sum, essentially a sum over a Weyl group. It'll be given basically as a sum over a Weyl group of certain Over a bile group of certain fourth roots of unity, which he denotes by a lowercase gamma, but I'm already using gamma for a group element, so I'm going to denote them by Fractor G. There are vial indices, which can be rewritten as Gauss sums, as a sum of certain fourth roots of unity times values of an additive character of the ground field. So we've got this nice, completely explicit description of Fourier transforms of regular semi-simple orbital integrals, as long as you're willing to take your element. As long as you're willing to take your elements from your orbiting very far away from the identity, or as long as you're willing to evaluate your orbital interval, your Fourier transform of an orbital interval, very close to the identity. So I view this as rather impressive. We can also do the same thing on the group level. Our results on the group level specialize to those of Kim and Mernahan. In fact, Kim and Mernahan was the motivating case, the case gamma equals one, the case for an asymptotic expansion of a character. The case of an asymptotic expansion of a character only near the identity. But they also specialize for the Harishandra-How local character expansion when I take my semi-simple element equal to zero. So this is one asymptotic expansion that covers, as far as I know, most of the explicit information we've got about general characters. Kim Mernahan-Kirilov-type asymptotic expansions, Horace Chandra Howell local character expansions, and the DeBaker and Admiral Foreman quantitative versions that tell you not. Form in quantitative versions that tell you not just local character expansion holds, but where and these results in the supercuspital setting completely reduce the computation of arbitrary, sorry, characters of arbitrary supercuspital representations to those of death zero supercuspital representations. Which unfortunately is probably the hard part, but fortunately it's not my job. The backer and Tsai, probably among others, are hard at work on understanding the character. At work on understanding the characters of depth zero supercuscal representations. And once again, we get a existing result. Kaleta proved this result in his regular supercups paper back in 2019. It says that you've got a nice explicit description of the character of an arbitrary supercup representation at a regular semi-simple element that's far from the identity. Now, unfortunately, unlike on the Lie algebra, you cannot just take an arbitrary element and scale. cannot just take an arbitrary element and scale it so that it's far from the identity. So this is a quite restrictive condition that I've got a regular semi-simple, also topologically semi-simple element. But if I do, I can write down the formula for an arbitrary, sorry, for the formula for the character of an arbitrary supercut representation at an element that's close to a regular topologically semi-simple element as a sum of certain fourth roots of unity times conjugates. Times conjugates of character values of conjugates of the depth of zero representation that underlies it. And I've actually finished early. I'll stop there. Thank you.
